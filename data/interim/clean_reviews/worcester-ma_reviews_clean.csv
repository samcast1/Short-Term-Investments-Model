2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The atmosphere is sensational.
Much care and zeal on the part of Gabriella.
He left personal hygiene kits, water, soda, many towels. The apartment is hyper equipped.
This season that I did in the US, it was the best we got.
I hope to return again and again.
Parabens, Gabriella"

The staircase was a kind of a blessing to me as I‘ve not been able to exercise my body for a long time and I enjoyed going up down the stairs. I had a chance of meeting Gabriella hubby and he was search a lovely person. The biggest Walmart was 5mins drive,Burlington coat less than 15mins for those who would like to shop around.I will definitely visit again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is fabulous place to stay for any healthcare providers who are traveling and working at UMass Memorial Hospital. Not only is the hospital in walkable distance, there are plenty of grocery stores and restaurants.
Mary is extremely kind and really wants visitors to have a good stay. She addressed any requsts /questions I had.
Two thumbs up – way up."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very close to some grocery store and food places which I appreciated! It was on the second floor so it was a bit tight to go up with my suitcase but I had a good stay in general!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a quaint comfortable place to stay. It’s in the midst of a busy area, so traffic noise was present in the bedroom area. All else was quiet. It’s a very convenient location."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay while picking up traveling contracts at UMass Memorial. Hospital is in walking distance and there is a nice neighborhood for a morning run. Grocery stores are right next door. Host is also very kind and responsive.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location for the Worcester/Shrewsbury area. You are close to everything you need or want to do. The apartment is fantastic for two people, or more, if you don't mind sharing the bedroom. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to make your stay like home. The bathroom was spotless and the water pressure was great. I have absolutely no complaints at all about our stay there! 5/5 would book again in a heartbeat!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary was great. Super responsive. It is a great place for a school weekend
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was a very communicative host. She had laid out all the rules. I liked the interior of the place, very clean. The location is not that nice as it is beside a busy street. Not your typical neighborhood. The place and the host are pretty great. Would recommend if the noise does not bother you as much as it did me."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five stars all around. Perfect spot!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary was responded to all my queries on time and never had an issue with the stay. Overall great experience!

Thanks again, Mary!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location is great, we really enjoyed being able to walk to different stores and multiple supermarkets. There are restaurants, supermarkets and things to do very close. The area is very good, central and accessible to all places we needed to go. We had all we needed in the property. The application to open and close the property worked very well and it was easy to use. We felt very good staying at the property and looking forward to stay there again in the future."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was perfect! The apartment was pristine and perfect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very conveniently located. Very nicely furnished, and had everything we needed."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! We will book again!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful weekend retreat! The apt was immaculate, and the bathroom seemed recently updated. The living room featured a 75in TV, perfect for unwinding. Mary paid close attention to the details of her space and it showed.
Only a few things kept my rating from being 5 stars. When I booked here, I had no idea how busy of an area it is, directly off of rt 9 and essentially in a shopping plaza. I appreciated some of the convenience, but would have preferred to have a clearer sense of the area, as it isn't represented in the listing or photos, and was less private than I expected.
Also, I tried to take a bath, and the push drain stopper would not entirely close and I ran out of hot water while filling the tub, making the 5min in the tub, less than relaxing. The furniture was quite dated and the bed was not very comfortable on my recently injured back.
Mary was kind enough to extend my checkout time, and if I could have stayed another day, I would have! Definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an overall good experience, although it was difficult to adjust the thermostat because it seems to stay locked. This is on route nine which is a very busy main street that runs from Boston in way past Worcester so if you’re looking for a quiet and peaceful, it’s not exactly that with the traffic but if you’re looking for a place you can step outside and walk to 75 shops and restaurants within five minutes that are all lined up right there then this is your spot, Mary was very responsive. We had some problems getting in the door upon arrival with the lock unit not working properly but other than that everything seem to go fine. Mary is very responsive, polite, friendly, and I needed a late check out because I got stuck on something and she was accommodating, which I appreciated"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"really a nice, ultra clean apartment with several amenities nearby"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A good stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location- abundant grocery stores for quick grabs. Easy to get places quick. Amazing appliances. Clean iron,ironing board, and laundry. Needed dish soap and more toilet paper.and control to switch from heat to a/c not just the temperature. Nice neighborhood- just on busy road so loud to open windows for breeze. I would stay again and recommend it to others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very responsive host, answered all our questions in a timely manner and provided onsite help quickly when needed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice apartment and private! Will definitely stay again 😊"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was great. Very walkable, clean and Mary was a great communicator. We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was very clean, cheerful and cozy. The location was central to grocery stores and restaurants. The kitchen was a nice size and the appliances were clean. Included is a washer and dryer which was very useful. It is on a busy street and can be noisy, however it does quiet down as the evening progresses. You can tell attention and care has gone into making this a great place to stay! Enjoyed my stay and would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our needs, but it's definitely on a busy and very bright road/shopping center. The blinds don't block ambient light, so bring an eye-mask if you need darkness to sleep! We had a very short stay so didn't use the kitchen at all. There weren't any food staples provided (condiments, oil, etc), but a Trader Joe's is right in the plaza if staying longer and interested in cooking. Laundry detergent and a nice big washer/dryer were excellent!
The host is super responsive. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Located right on the main road. Plenty of space. Quality appliances. Really responsive host.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd floor space Was easy to find and offered convenient. Check in and check out. Everything was totally spotless… Great towels, which really matter to me. On-site washer and dryer or a great for me because I had been traveling. The apartment is conveniently located in the center of all sorts of retail and restaurant options… Worked out perfectly for me. Thank you especially to the host, Mary, Who answered my questions so quickly and clearly."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location with everything you need. Stayed for a short work visit, so just came to sleep but looks to have a full kitchen setup and washer/dryer for longer stays. It’s on route 9 but I didn’t notice any noise. Shower was hot, and the place was warm, everything clean and tidy. Happy to stay there, thanks!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had lots of fun around the area and was a great place to stay
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Uncomfortable beds and furniture. Beds were not freshly changed. They smelled and I had to wash all the linens and remake the beds. No toilet paper only 1 roll so I had to buy my own! Not happy about that. Great location for our stay, excellent check in and out and great host communication"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This apartment is a great choice for staying in the Shrewsbury area. We were visiting family in both Shrewsbury and Worcester and this was a very convenient location. Lots of food choices near by as well as a Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. The kitchen had everything we needed and laundry worked great. Easy checkin and good communication. I would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This apartment is in a fantastic location and was very convenient for that reason. The kitchen had everything I needed for basic cooking. Because it is right by a busy street, there are road noises at night so that is something to be aware of if you’re not used to it. I didn’t find it disruptive at all, and I felt safe the whole time I was there."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Mary's place in Shrewsbury. It was clean and spacious, had all the amenities I needed, and was conveniently located near Worcester. Parking, check-in, and communication were all easy."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed three nights here it was very clean very cute and very well done it is close to everything the only thing is it is close to a main road if you’re sensitive to traffic noise but the place itself is wonderful
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location in the middle of everything. Communication was great. Have to be careful with kids as there are two sets of stairs.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location at Shopping Centers 100ft away from Chipotle and Italian Bakery. Walking distance to supermarket and other restaurants too.
Large one bedroom with large washer/dryer and great bathroom and kitchen."

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,I just wrote one and it wouldn't let me go next.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fine apartment, located on the second floor of a business right on Route 9, with a Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, and more in easy walking distance. It felt very safe. The apartment was clean and as pictured, with some lovely extras. I did use earplugs at night for the road noise, and that worked great. I would stay there again."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice, cozy stay. Tv has access to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon prime. There is a nest thermostat which was really convenient and nice to have.

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, close to all restaurants and etc"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was great (clean and comfortable!) and I plan to stay there again when I'm next in the area. So many bonus points for being a parking lot away from Trader Joes, Total Wines and across the street from Dunkin' Donuts!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Good location with many needs in walking distance
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment proved very good base to take day trips from. It is roomy, clean, bright and comfortable. The weather was very warm during the visit and the a/c worked extremely well. The location very much in the middle of a commercial strip which is convenient (walking distance) to some chain stores/restaurants, but also means there is loud traffic directly out front through all but several hours of the night. A very nice park/beach is along a nearby lake, also within walking distance. Communication was excellent, and the apartment well appointed. I’d recommend it, so long as the location along a busy street would be acceptable to you."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and very clean
Cute apartment but steep set of stairs
Washer and dryer was a plus
Had some trouble working TV"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a cute little apartment. Can be a bit hard to find but Mary’s directions will get you there. Once found it’s just a great place to hang your hat and enjoy the area.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Served my purposes well! Excellent to have a Chipotle and Trader Joe’s a minute’s walk away. Loved the deep tub!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit as described and well appointed. Mary was on top on things with a repair completed immediately upon communication. The space is impersonal, so doesn’t feel super homey, and it does sit on top of a business, on a main road, in a strip mall. Convenient for Trader Joe’s or Chipotle, but a bit odd for me. Lots of road noise and brightness for light sleepers."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bedroom and kitchen are a little outdated compared to the rest of the apartment, the apartment is located between of great food spots including great Indian food, a bakery, and a 24 hr Dunkin. The apartment is also in walking distance to a bunch of other shops and a cool memorial bride (definitely worth checking out at night). As the other reviews said you're right off of the turnpike but noise wasn't really much of an issue during our stay. Overall it was a great price and location for what we needed, it was pretty clean and I'd probably stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifulllllllllll stay!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Mary's place. The communication and check-in were super smooth and efficient. The lodging was clean and comfortable. We loved the easy access to a nearby bakery and other shops.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and bright but impersonal. Bring or buy your own dishes unless you are a dwarf.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean space with a fabulous bakery about 50 yards away.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place would stay again for sure!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean quiet place all to your own, right next to some very convenient stores, groceries and dining options. Very close to the water and town of Worcester, great stay."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome stay, clean place."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is more like a really large hotel room rather than a normal homey airbnb that I'm used to. As others have said, it's right next to a busy road with lots of businesses all around. This was convenient, though, because we could walk to get food at Whole Foods or Trader Joes. I was helping my daughter move into Clark University, so the place was convenient. There are few amenities, so if you plan to cook you'll need to bring all the spices and oil, etc. The place was clean, roomy, and Mary was quite responsive to inquiries."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot for a weekend getaway or even a longer stay. The place was very clean and had everything we could need.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary was quick to respond and everything was clean and ready.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at Mary’s apartment for a couple of weeks. The apartment was clean and has all necessary amenities, and also a roku tv in the living space which is a very nice touch. It was exactly what we were looking for to work remotely and have some time away from home. Thank you Mary, we had a lovely stay."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very comfy and great location
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cozy place with most of the necessities, plenty of food options nearby and in walking distance."
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,On a main highway and in a busy business district but for mainly sleeping and a few easy meals it is perfect.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is an excellent find. It's clean, private, mostly quiet and within a 5 minutes walk to all good shops and restaurants. The apartment has all the necessities, including washer/dryer, one needs for a short term or a long term stay. Mary responds quickly and is super helpful. Highly recommended!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Spacious, central and has all comforts you need. Some sound from Rt9 does make it into the bedroom, so it may not be ideal for light sleepers. Would stay again!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Would be good for a business traveler who will not make much use of the place. It’s not one of those ‘unique/cute’ Airbnbs, it’s more like corporate housing/motel. Shower and heater work great. Kitchen utensils and equipment very barebones. Convenient access to retail. Lots of background car noise. Not a nice neighborhood to walk around."

We had an issue with the electronic lock, wich Mary´s husband (a kind gentleman) solved quikly, he was very ashame for this, because we had to stay in the cold for about 25 min.

Mary has been an outstanding host able to be completely available and present despite the fact she wasn’t being on the spot. The house is in a very convenient location close enough to anything (10 minutes drive from downtown Worcester and on the Boston Turnpike to get easily on the main highway to everywhere). Stores as Trader Joe’s or Whole food at walking distance as well as diner or other places for hanging out.
The space is very warm and cozy and equipped with anything you need to make your staying as comfortable as your own private home.

She was friendly, as was her husband. Irene showed me my room and my bathroom. She provided me with a key to come and go. We chatted for a few minutes before I went upstairs to get situated before I left to meet up with friends. I returned around 10p, used my key to get in. Irene was in the kitchen, she greeted me warmly, I thanked her and went to my room. The bed was wonderful. Very firm and comfy. I woke up the next day, packed my belongings and headed downstairs. I spoke with John, thanked him for the hospitality and asked if I could leave my car in the driveway while I went for a morning walk. He was fine with that. I returned the key, thanked them and headed out. My main thing is feeling safe and I absolutely did! Nothing questionable about the neighborhood or my interactions with the homeowners!

John was an amazing host who told us about the local recommendations nearby. I would love to stay at his place again! 😊"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Sarah's cozy apartment for about a week. It was centrally located to just about everything we wanted to do/see. So many hikes, museums, restaurants, etc within the area, and she was an excellent host! Very responsive and shared some local gems to visit during our stay. She had just about everything you could want in the kitchen to make meals, as well as extra towels, blankets, and pillows. I enjoyed the nature decor throughout and her laid back style. Lots of pretty plants added more coziness to the space. We always found parking outside in front of the apartment, and check-out instructions were very straightforward."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for any WPI event! We stayed for WPI graduation. It was 5 minutes to campus and under 10 minutes to the DCU center.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay when you visit Worcester
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home with easy access to WPI campus. The atmosphere of relaxation was comforting. I also enjoyed kitchen access and would return to this Airbnb. Thank you Sarah. This was the last leg of a three week trip to the US and then back to Europe. I was able to sleep well on the comfy bed and well not much else to say! Very nice!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah is a lovely person. The home was really cozy for the two of us. Relaxing and comfy. Nice kitchen to cook and hang out in. Living room and bedroom were comfortable. She's done a nice job with things you wouldn't necessarily think of...like a mirror in the bathroom that tilts...it matters; it makes a difference. The vibe and aesthetic of design is consistent throughout which also helps you relax into it. It's not a jumbled/random design. Simple pleasures too, right?....like a brita water filter in the fridge. Checkout procedure was completely reasonable. We're fans...we'll certainly be back. If your visit to Worcester is WPI related, maybe for Homecoming or Parents Weekend or scouting out the college, this was a great spot. EASY to get to the school plus a nice grocery store along the way (plus a treat of a coffee shop if Sarah will share it with you). We'll stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Since moving out of Worcester 20 years ago, I’ve flown or driven back more than thirty times for visits with friends and family.
And honestly, I have to say that this apartment has been the most peaceful and relaxing place I’ve stayed throughout all of those trips. I’m new to the Air BnB process, but have to say that this experience was much more enjoyable than the hotels downtown or a friend’s spare bedroom. This home is the prefect getaway after a long day of driving around and visiting with people. I was able to read, write and recharge before the next day of visiting.
The next time I’m in Worcester I’ll definitely want to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place was super welcoming and comfortable in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Not really walkable, but still super close to everything you needed with a car handy. Perfectly set up and spacious for two. Lovely decor with lots of light and plenty of plants. This was our first visit to Worcester and a great place for us to explore from. Sarah was super communicative and really responsive to any questions we had. Highly recommend this spot. Go WooSox!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Sarah's place was absolutely beautiful in every way, nicely furnished and decorated. It was a great place for both work and relaxation, watching TV, home cooking.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stay at this gem of a place with a helpful, responsive host. The place is as serene and comfortable as the pictures. The bathroom and kitchen were immaculate with what you need for your stay. The linens and towels are new, clean, comfortable, and plentiful.
I initially hesitated to book the unit as it is her home when she is not traveling but the bedroom seems to be the guest room with an empty closet and bureau. Soon after entering, I completely forgot it was someone's home. The furnishings and decor are welcoming and surpass those I have encountered other stays. And there were beautiful plants everywhere. I felt like I was at home.
I crossed paths with Sarah and she is a motivated, disciplined and considerate person. she is pursuing a music career after slaving away in the corporate world. So, step up and support her ambitions by renting this wonderful spot. Despite how many houses there are on this street, I always found a space to park, within 2 car lengths of the home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s lovely home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. We were visiting family and also doing some sightseeing, and Sarah’s home was the perfect place to stay. We easily made our breakfast each morning and dinner one evening in the well-stocked kitchen. There are grocery stores and a CVS within close driving distance. Union Station is close by for taking the train into Boston for a day trip. Sarah’s home is very clean and relaxing. Everything was as pictured in the listing. I’ve been in a few 5 star-rated places recently that were not clean and needed new pillows, etc., however, Sarah’s home is truly deserving of 5 stars!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah,
Your space was lovely, eclectic and matched my choice of styles, completely. I could have not been more pleased. I was with my mother and needed another sleeping space and the leather coach with blankets could not have been more pleasant and cozy for my choice, leaving my mother the bedroom. Mom needed the electric blanket and that was also an extra for her!
Thank you for being so responsive and accommodating with sharing your space.
Best Wishes,
Libby and Laura"

anything you would need. We so appreciated being able to bring our little dog. Because Sarah and her friendly dog were still on premises we were not able to park in the driveway and it felt a little strange to use the fenced in backyard but it was a quick visit so it didn’t matter. Plenty of on street parking and close enough to casual restaurants to grab food. Would definitely stay again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Bayram has created a serene and easy space on Franconia: it is warm and intuitive without feeling cluttered. The “extras” are a delight, from flavored coffee syrups to travel-size toiletries, toys for all ages, snacks and seasonings, extra pillows, comfy sheets, duvets and fun movie-night-in treats. The kitchen is supplied to help you cook a meal, and the home is beautifully maintained. We couldn’t have asked for a more ideal spot for our family to celebrate Commencement and be together. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was impeccable! The hosts were responsive, friendly and kind. The house is newly renovated, spotless and simply lovely. Exceeded our expectations!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is very nice. Perfect for our family. It has been newly updated throughout. Very nice kitchen and bathrooms. Pretty neighborhood. Nice neighbors. Only 2 small downsides that kept me from giving 5 stars: (1) the smell of curry in the house was very strong and windows do not open so could not air out the house. (2) the house is not level. So furniture in the house is not level and sleeping in a sloping bed was interesting! But you did a wonderful job with the remodel. Very relaxing feel. All the amenities were such a nice added touch.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was perfect for 3 couples gathering for a wedding. The location is great. The little extras, from toothbrushes to coffee to snacks, made it extra special. Highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"A few words will not do this place justice….
I was absolutely blown away by how amazing this place was. Warm and cosy to start and super clean. They left slippers at the front door for us which was so lovely and then on looking around they had left travel size tooth paste, face wipes, hair bands, toothbrushes and floss in the bathroom which I as a person who wears make up and has long hair was a brilliant touch.
The beds were super comfy - desperate to know where those pillows are from!
The air bnb has a book with everything you need to know which was brilliant and super helpful. Lou rocs diner is the bomb! If you stay here defo visit as the breakfasts were AMAZING.
There was 6 of us staying here and we all loved it and had such comfy stays.
The pantry was stocked, I had some Oreo’s at 4am due to the jet lag and their English tea was amazing.
All in all when we come back we will stay here again.
Thank you so so much!"

The kitchen is fully stocked as well as the amazing pantry stocked with little snacks, cleaning products etc. Oh, and the bathroom even has little toiletries in case someone forgot theirs. The attention to detail was very apparent here! Bayram and Patrycja were extremely responsive and made our stay even better. The check in process was smooth and rules regarding the house were very easy to follow.
We will definitely be back next time we come to Worcester!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hello Bayram, thanks for sharing you home with me and my family. The location was great easy access to places."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was beautiful and well equipped. The only feedback I would give is that having three women in the house with just one bathroom with a shower was a little harder to negotiate, but we did it. We suggest having mirrors in the bedrooms so that would help accommodate having only the one bathroom upstairs. Other than that everything was perfect! Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host, great location.
House was equipped with everything necessary for instant utility usage. Accommodating snack treats, and Waters were a nice touch."

House was fantastic, warm, clean and lots of welcoming extras, etc. Bayram quick and friendly communicator. Can absolutely recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a gorgeous Airbnb, and the hosts really went above and beyond to make us feel at home. From the fully-stocked pantry to the extra toothbrushes, hair ties and make up remover wipes in the bathroom - they really have thought of everything!

Out of all the places I’ve booked through air bnb this one was def my favorite. 1st off the photos don’t do this home any justice, it’s way more beautiful in person. Also all the little personal touches from candy on the table to a fully stocked pantry with food and snacks for us and the kids to enjoy. The house was also fully equipped with anything you needed from tooth brushes to hair ties and everything in between. You literally just had to bring yourself and your clothes. Everything was clean and spotless and I’m the pickiest person when it comes to that so it shows how much attention to detail they give this home. We stood for an event but we plan on staying again in the summer time just because we loved it so much. We’re looking forward to it."

Very comfortable beds & everything you could imagine to make your stay perfect. Bayram immediately answered any questions I had & was very hospitable. I highly recommend this rental.

The kitchen had everything we needed, plus a keurig and a pa try stocked with snacks. Each bedroom had its own A/C unit so we could have individualized temperatures for sleeping. It was a very comfortable place to come home to during our trip. Check in and out we’re super easy. Thanks for a great stay!"

A very welcoming, clean home. There were convenient outlets for charging, adjustable lighting, plenty of linens and toiletries. I even just appreciated having paper plates and cups available. Our kids loved the games/activities and snacks available and the adults appreciated the well-equipped coffee station. After a stressful day of traveling, it was such a relief to arrive at such a beautiful home. Host was very responsive and helpful. Truly a 5 star stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. You see the pics of someone's insta and now you can rent to live there in Worcester.
This is a great place - 4 bd, 1.5 bath - that is fully set up for the AirBnB stay. Hosts have provided a great kitchen set up including many extras like coffee pods with choice and snack pack area. Also same in bathroom - nice set up.
Wi-fi is strong; multiple TVs; a foosball table; easy parking.
Hosts were really easy to communicate with."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was incredibly neat and spotlessly clean and as described. And loaded with amenities and treats: everything from Goldfish to Q-tips, cold bottled water to toothbrushes! Every base was covered. We were very comfortable temperature-wise using the A/C window units all over the house. Beds were comfy and there were plenty of pillows and towels. I have zero complaints and would happily stay here again while visiting our daughter in Worcester. The only thing we might have enjoyed were some table/floor lamps and/or dimmer switches in the public rooms -- very, very bright! A great choice for staying in Worcester, a very central location for our needs. Thanks again for such a great stay!"

Beautiful kitchen, bathrooms and each and every room in the house!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bayram’s home was absolutely wonderful! It was beautiful, cozy, and had all of the comforts of home. We were staying overnight and attending a concert - the Uber ride to downtown was just a short 7 min drive away. We enjoyed making dinner (the kitchen is well-stocked with utensils and pots and pans), dining at the table, relaxing in one of the living rooms, and sleeping in the super comfy beds! The bathroom was surprisingly well-stocked as well, with toothbrushes, toothpaste, hair ties, and products! We couldn’t have asked for anything more!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"10/10 by far one of the best airbnb places I’ve ever stayed at. Great kitchen, lots of space super comfy with 2 tvs / to relax in. Great communication, super easy checkin and out; loved my stay here would 100% recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful listing in a convenient location - five min from Clark university and less then five to the canal district and all the wonderful restaurants and theater/arts venues. Despite it’s proximity to the city center, it was in a very safe and pretty residential area. The owners were responsive and helpful from the get-go and remained so throughout our stay. We arrived and were happy to find a private driveway (a first for our airbnb stays in Worcester) and what looked like a very well maintained single family home. We got the real wow when we opened the door. Super comfy and clean, nicely decorated and with numerous touches throughout to make you feel at home. There are two TVs, lots of DVD movies, a foosball table, board games and cards, lots of snacks, beverages and candy in the pantry, all the coffee and accompaniments, and even extra toothbrushes, toothpaste and hair ties for those who may have forgotten to pack them. I can’t say enough. We were delighted. Will be back!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bayram’s place is a real find and hidden treasure in Worcester. We were impressed by how well appointed, stocked, and maintained the place is, with so many little warm touches that made the place special. They even left us a delicious apple pie for Thanksgiving!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and very clean. Felt as if it was our own home for a few days. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. keypad entry easy: Hoping password changes for each new guest. Home has no air conditioning, but also has no screens in windows. this is also a safety issue, since you have to open the windows to get air. there were no window treatments on the first floor which left you exposed to everyone outside and homes were close together. Appeared to be a safe area. The mattresses in 4 bedrooms were 6 inch
spring mattresses on all beds which were uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. With a few changes, the rating would be higher."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house and super responsive hosts. Lovely stay and would come again soon :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, very nicely built, clean, open space, lots of space, and in a community location near WPI."

My family really enjoyed the place. If I were to go back to Worcester I would definitely stay again at Danielle’s. Thank you Danielle."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay! I’d visit it again !
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious and large apartment, definitely high value for the price. AC worked great and though not in downtown it was a close drive. Only issue we had was that the cleaning product smell was really intense. Would recommend a natural cleaner in the future with no overly synthetic scents."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was good for what I needed and at a fair price.

The space itself was exceptionally clean and well-organized. Every corner was spotless, and the decor added a cozy touch to the atmosphere. We appreciated the attention to detail in maintaining such a pristine environment.
Moreover, we felt safe throughout our stay. The host has clearly ensured security measures are in place which provided us peace of mind during our visit.
Overall, we would highly recommend Danielle's Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, and safe accommodation with top-notch communication from the host. We would definitely return for another stay in the future!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place comfortable stay
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean apartment. Danielle is a very responsive host. It was easy to check in and out and we felt safe inside the apartment. The neighborhood is a little rough, so walking to and from our car didn’t feel quite as safe. If you are checking it out, check out Vernon Hill neighborhood. I went running in the neighborhood one day and also didn’t feel the safest. However overall it was a great stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect modern cozy guesthouse. Everything was spotless and easy to find! Hosts were extremely helpful and efficiently responsive.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Rental was very clean and had everything we needed. Danielle responded very quickly and was a great host.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This spot is nice and the host did a good job with decorations and making it look cute. Wasn't in love with the location. Right next to the highway and the train so it was pretty loud at night, plus noise in the above apartment. The neighboring building also had lights on all night that shined into my bedroom even with the blinds down. Obviously this can't be controlled, but thought it was worth mentioning. Danielle was excellent host though - responded to my needs quickly and kindly and allowed me to park in her driveway to keep my work truck safe."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we have been here now 4 times and we love it more and more every time
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique stay! Loved the setup. However, it is a very creaky/noisy stay. Whether from our own floor or those above or below.
I would like to note that the bathroom isn’t exactly plus size friendly.
Parking was easy and felt safe throughout stay."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle was a great host and very responsive.
The building is old and a bit loud (thin walls, creaky floor).
The beds are extremely comfortable, and while the kitchen has an odd layout we were able to cook several meals. The pots and pans (and their lids) were well above average for AirBnB. The knife and cutting board were merely average.
This isn’t a luxury property, but it is clean, comfortable, well managed, and offered at a very fair price."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,clean and tidy. easy to get into. self check in. cheap for the whole apartment!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Wanted to stay longer honestly
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place for a short stay. It’s a rustic and quaint apartment but worth the amount. Parking was a breeze. Danielle was a great host, responsive to questions we had. We would recommend this place for sure!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An older house, but well renovated! Huge space with lots of natural light and a good assortment of kitchen utensil/pots and pans for cooking. Very creaky house and you can definitely hear the other people. The stair case up to the second floor is fairly steep as well. Not a problem for me, but if you struggle with that just be aware. I had issues with parking due to the ice and hill that the host immediately helped me resolve! Had a great stay overall!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! And Danielle was very responsive!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danielle and her beau were absolutely lovely to work with! Extremely responsive and attentive to our needs. While the place wasn't perfect, it was absolutely gorgeous on the inside (they did a great job decorating and keeping it modern yet cozy). It felt a lot bigger than what we expected as well, which was absolutely a plus!
The kitchen has a gas stove, so if you like to cook this is the place for you! The linens were clean and the bedrooms were turned over well.
I would love to stay here again! I can't stress enough how accommodating and friendly these hosts are."
2024-01-01,3.0,Group trip,"It's a very nice apartment and we had a good stay. But the cleaning wasn't the best, they should improve that. And the heater never warmed good we were dying of cold every night 🙌🏽"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed our stay and it was exactly what we needed! Hosts were accommodating and kind!
2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is in a convenient, central location.
Sadly we arrived to a bathroom that looked very used (toilet, sink, and bath mat), had mold in the shower, as well as every single towel left completely damp. This was off-putting enough for us to cancel our reservation. The host was communicative and apologetic, and did refund us promptly.
If the bathroom gets revamped,
it will be a decent stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great host
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Danielle was a great host. She was extremely responsive whenever I needed her and communicated very well even when it was late at night. I’d definitely stay at a place Danielle was hosting.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,excellent host! we have booked another stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great, clean and quiet place!!easy access and instructions to enter!! Host was Great at quickly responding! Very quiet! Felt like home away from home for the month My family and I were there! Would highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had the pleasure of staying in two of Danielle's places. When I knew I would need to extend another month, Danielle's 2nd floor apartment was going to be available. It was recently updated with new furniture and bedding. It was nice to relax on the new couch and watch tv then get a nice night's sleep on the new mattress. Danielle and Inder are really nice and friendly, super fast to respond.
If I hadn't found a home to purchase so quickly, I would have continued to stay in their Airbnb."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay at Steve’s place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great old carriage house in a beautiful neighborhood. Steve is great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stayed for almost two weeks and the house was exactly what we needed. The neighborhood was very quiet and Steve was very accommodating and I have no complaints. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious and comfortable guest house, in a lovely quiet neighborhood. The living room is a large sunny space where we enjoyed setting up our laptops and taking advantage of the high speed internet for work. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space for our belongings. The unit was very clean and the bathroom recently renovated. The yard is large, although not fully fenced for dogs. We really enjoyed walking around the beautiful neighborhood. Our host, Steve, and co-host, Pat, were very communicative.
I gave it five stars as the price reflects the age of the property, but it’s an antique. The kitchen could use updating. You won’t mind if you are eating out a lot, but it’s not ideal for cooking. That said, it was well equipped.
The down pillows and comforters add a touch if luxury, but be aware there are no alternatives to down if you have allergies.
All in all, we enjoyed our 11 day stay, and will definitely return."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a very pleasant stay and wonderful communication with Steve.
Would recommend and also stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The carriage house is cozy and spacious. Lots of natural light. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking. The living room is large enough to fit a queen air mattress without feeling crowded. Large yard great for dogs. The neighborhood is very quiet. Definitely did not feel like I was in a city. Lots of street parking right by the house.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It was central to everything, yet private. The cottage house was spacious and the neighborhood was beautiful. Steve went on vacation before I checked out - he made sure to let me know and also that the co-host, Pat, who lives in the neighborhood, would help me with anything. And she did! They were both incredibly nice and the stay was fantastic. I look forward to coming back next year!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was visiting my family in the area, and Steve's place was convenient, peaceful, private, and fit our needs well. It was just me and one of my grown daughters, so he provided us with a comfortable bed for her."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed staying at Steve’s place, the cottage was cozy and comfortable, but surprisingly roomy ! The gardens surrounding the cottage were lovely and added so much to our enjoyment. A deer came several times during our stay to eat apples that had fallen from a tree in the garden. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, with lovely old homes lovingly cared for. You can easily walk to state-of-the art museums, and great restaurants. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We like the cottage because it has everything one needs for a monthly stay. It is in an upscale neighborhood which is great for walking. The separate cottage offers total privacy. Steve is a great host and is always jovial and willing to help in any way. We have been there many times before and are always pleased with our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Steve was an excellent host. Very quick to respond and fix any issues. We stayed for 3 months and loved it. Wonderful location, felt extremely safe. Beautiful neighborhood, loved walking around it. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and everything you would need. The bathroom is adorable, the hot water is the best I’ve ever experienced. The bed is very comfy. The living room was our favorite place to hangout, big bright windows, tons of sunlight. Tons of big closet space. Overall it was great. Steve is so kind and willing to accommodate you and work with what you need. Feeling safe was so important to me and I absolutely felt that way here! Would definitely recommend!"

There was plenty of room to let our Chile walk around and play, in the separate living room, along with space in the bedroom if we wanted to set up the pack and play. All amenities were as advertised and made it convenient to do everything we needed. The washer/dryer was a huge help! The place was very clean and the instructions given to us were clear. my husband and I were visiting family and we had plenty of space to invite them over and play with our child without feeling cramped. We are planning on booking this place every time we come from now on!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I’d book again! Great place for a long term or short term stay. Stayed for over 50 nights with two people working remotely and it was perfect. Location is also great. Close to everything while also in a quiet neighborhood.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Steve was very personable and available when needed. He responded quickly with any concerns and issues that we had even while on vacation.

The flowers around the property were beautiful and Steve encouraged us to cut some to put inside the house. We would highly recommend this peaceful retreat and would come back again !

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Steve’s cottage is the perfect Worcester stop for your long term stay. We spent a week there - everything you might need was provided, and Steve went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable, especially during the weekend heat wave by providing a window a/c unit. Cottage is close to everything, and in a beautiful old Worcester neighborhood surrounded by nature shade trees and gardens. A must stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The old converted carriage house was perfect for the two of us. Lots of room, well-equipped, with a comfortable bed, and close to WPI, a main reason we chose it. One caution: If you use google maps and you go by the given address, you’ll end up a block or so away."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Steve was a wonderful host, super communicative and helpful. We had a lovely stay and would come again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time in the private cottage. Steve's responses to questions were quick, & the kitchen & bathroom were quire stocked with utensils & other necessities. The house can generally make many noises at night."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We had a wonderful longer-term stay at Steve's cottage. Steve is an exceptional host and great communicator.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Set in Worcester's historical housing district in a large garden with wonderfully rich green grass, we liked the carriage house especially for Steve's interior decorations of the rooms: attention to detail made the spaces (kitchen with a small sit-in, bed-room, living room) arty and cosy at the same time. The kitchen was well equipped, the bed comfortable, the surroundings delightful, and the hosts helpful but not obtrusive. We can definitely recommend the place."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,be careful with driving in Boston make sure that your rental vehicle has a GPS
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was quite a pleasure to rent the cottage again. Steve always gives you a warm welcome and is always available if you need him. We like renting the cottage because it gives us a lot of privacy and is very quiet. It is in one of the better neighborhoods in the city of Worcester, and near everything you would want to see or visit. It has all the amenities one would need for a brief or long stay. We will be back."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Really cute and charming cottage with a fantastic location -- we stayed here for two weeks and the surrounding neighborhood is delightful and very walkable, which was a huge plus. The kitchen is fairly well stocked so you can do basic cooking and there's a washer/dryer which is fantastic for the longer stay. As noted in the listing, there's no AC, but the cottage is actually quite shaded so stays fairly cool and there are lots of windows and doors to open (and really beautiful gardens!). There is a path right in front of the cottage that all visitors/guests/workers at the main home use and there is a fair amount of coming and going, so that's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a private space, particularly in summer when you might have windows and drapes open during both the day and evening. Steve is really kind and friendly, and we loved seeing him around."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We highly recommend this cottage as a great place to stay for either a short or long term getaway. It is centrally located and convenient to local attractions.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I spent two months in Steve's cottage when I first moved to Worcester and can highly recommend it for a long or short stay. The cottage is much roomier than you'd expect based on pictures-- a full three rooms (kitchen, bedroom, living area), plus a large bathroom. Sunny and simply but comfortably furnished. Fast wifi-- I worked from home about 50% of the time while I was there with no problem on many Zoom sessions. Neighborhood is safe and walkable. There's a CVS, Shaws (grocery store), several gyms, and many other stores within a 10 min walk. Also walking distance to WPI and a short commute by car to downtown Worcester, WSU, and many hiking trails on the outskirts of town. It was a great place to land while I got to know the area and I'd gladly stay there again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"As a young professional looking for a place to stay during an internship, Steve’s Airbnb was perfect! It had everything I needed and I loved my stay. Steve was the perfect host and very welcoming/helpful. The location is perfect for walking and close to a lot of great places. The cottage has a beautiful view no matter which window you look through, especially when looking towards the flower beds. This was my first time Airbnb stay and I felt extremely safe. Overall, I loved my stay and Worcester!"

2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cottage is larger than I expected from the photos, with a good size living room, separate bedroom, recently redecorated bathroom, and kitchen. Nicely furnished and lots of light. I found it very comfortable (mattress is great) and very much enjoyed my stay. It's located in a lovely neighborhood in Worcester and it's pleasant to take a walk round the block and see all the houses. Pretty flowers in the garden too. Kitchen is well equipped and having a washer and dryer was a definite bonus. Would definitely recommend."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was my second stay at Steve’s. The cottage is always clean and comfortable. I will come back for third visit.

Kitchen is a bit clunky, being older, but has all the stuff you would need to cook whatever you would wish, even a blender.
Late night check-in was a breeze and come morning, Steve was out there clearing the snow that had fallen overnight. It’s a lovely neighborhood. We highly recommend this place."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly amazing -- I could have stayed for quite some time. The hosts are so gracious, and have planned out everything that you might need. I was surprised to find coffee in the cupboard and some goodies in the fridge. The setting though... wow! This is the most beautiful part of Worcester. The carriage house is set under a giant beech tree and surrounded by wonderful flower gardens. It is peaceful yet so well located! The bed is super comfy, the apartment is tastefully, comfortably, and eclectic-ly decorated, and very clean. The hosts had great dining and other recommendations. And, they are really only 10 minutes by car to virtually anywhere in Worcester, and very close to countryside. I only hope this place is available next time I come to Worcester!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steve's place was H U G E--bigger than I expected. It was a cute place in Worcester. We rode our motorcycles and stayed two nights. The second day our weather radars were calling for several severe storms passing through the majority of Massachusetts and we asked Steve if we could park our bikes in the garage to keep them from any high winds/heavy rain that might be coming. It was no problem and we were able to store our motorcycles in the garage during the storms. We had time to explore Worcester and even took the commuter rail into Boston. The box fan helped cool the room off when it got too warm, but a portable A/C unit may have been better (we tend to like it a bit colder, but it was very manageable). We had a great time and we will definitely consider staying here again if we find ourselves in the Worcester, MA area again!"
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage is located in a well-kept neighborhood and beautiful homes. It is an advantage to have a car with you.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This cottage built in the 1930's era is being renovated over time but you'll appreciate the modernized bathroom and adjacent washer/dryer. The kitchen still retains a funky old-style separation of the sink wash area from the common cook area. It has lovely oak floors in the bedroom and living area. The owner is an excellent communicator and lives next door. The neighborhood is peaceful and very quiet and I slept soundly in my 10 days there.
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, but is lacking furniture to make it feel like you can actually relax."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Steve’s place was perfect for my 9 day stay in Worcester. It’s in a lovely, quiet residential neighborhood that’s nice for walking and close to everything. Having an entire cottage, at an affordable price, was terrific. The cottage has seen some years but the kitchen appliances and fridge are brand new and the entire bathroom has been recently renovated. The rooms are spacious and bright with lots of windows. Steve was an attentive host, providing all the information I needed (street cleaning tomorrow!) but never intruded on my private time. I did not have time for sightseeing but I’m sure if you needed recommendations on the local happenings, Steve would be willing to help out. I highly recommend Steve’s place."

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place! It is a cute little cottage in a great part of the city. The host was really thoughtful and helpful. There were little touches done by the host that really nocked this place out of the park.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at the cottage for two months during a travel nurse assignment. The cottage had lots of windows to let in natural light and kept the house bright. The house had utensils and pans for cooking. Newly done bathroom. Nice large yard in front on the house. Wonderful quiet neighborhood to walk around and close to restaurants, bars, downtown area."

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The cottage is updated enough to be comfortable but has a lot of its original rustic feel in tact. Steve was a super nice host who respected our privacy but was never very far for any guest needs. The cottage is located near many attractions of Worcester and close to highways for easy commutes. I highly recommend Steve and his cottage if you find it available when you are in the area

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Robert's was a game changer. His place is amazingly clean and well positioned for the multitude of local activities I needed to attend. As a host, Robert is extremely communicative and respectful, he does a great job checking on his guests before and after their stay, and he makes every effort to accommodate when appropriate. Excellent value and experience, highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"Erika is a control freak. Everything was fine until her dog bit me requiring a visit to the ER. On more than one occasion she entered my room without announcing herself and proceeded to yell at me in a drunken stupor. When I provided her with hospital bills, she no longer felt”comfortable” with me being at the residence. Never once did she offer to take care of the healthcare expenses but was more worried about proving her dog was rabies vaccinate."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very positive experience for me. Erika was a great host and I really enjoyed my stay. I would stay there again if possible.

Neighbourhood was very quiet and peaceful
Highly recommend 😄"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Based on my hotels' experience, and since I have been on Airbnb - Erika's home is one of the Best. The Best Airbnb i have ever stayed.
She is friendly, funny, and give you all the space will need. Very conversational and helpful.
If I were ever in the area again, or need a long-term rental situation - I will definitely stay with her.
Thanks for being awesome !!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Erika is an amazing host. the Airbnb makes you feel at home and it has everything you need from a place. Erika has the most well behaved friendliest puppies also. the only thing to watch out is you probably need a car to get around in this area but parking was not an issue in my experience. If you are like me who loves animals and a peaceful place, you will enjoy your stay and have no trouble working from home during your stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was very pleasant.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I came for a week to visit my daughter in college. Erika is the perfect host; welcoming, relaxed and happy to help with advice on anything local. The accommodation is spotlessly clean and located in a very quiet neighbourhood next to some beautiful walking tracks through woodlands. In the house, Erika has thought of everything in order to make the use of the property and its facilities effortless. There were fresh eggs and home baked banana bread every morning. I will definitely seek this property out again for my next visit to Worcester. Thank you Erika!"

The decor of the house is charming and whimsical, and very appealing to me. But by far the most enjoyable aspect of my stay was interacting with Erika herself. She is very friendly and welcoming, prompt in her responses whenever I asked questions on the Airbnb app, and is such an interesting person to talk with. She even made breakfast for me and another guest while I was there, including a delicious home-baked loaf of bread. I hope I will get an opportunity to visit Erika’s home again, and I wholeheartedly recommend her place for any traveler looking for a place to stay in the Worcester area."

The parking was sufficient for my large minivan, and the street never felt unsafe. Grocery store was only 9-12 minutes away.
There are a lot of stairs leading up to the house, and in the house itself. They are sturdy and well maintained, but some turn 90° corners without a landing.
Mail and packages arrive to and from the house without a problem.
Overall, I greatly enjoyed my stay. All of the pleasant features were what I payed for."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Erika is a gracious host with a beautiful home. It's tucked away a bit out of the city, but makes up for it with a tranquil setting.

The shared bathroom was nicely labeled to separate your things from others as well as items that were available in case you forgot something.
I enjoyed some nice tea in the evening when I arrived. I absolutely loved listening to nature as I read in the living room.
The room had an AC unit which I did not use as I felt the temperature was perfect upstairs. There is also a half bath close to the bedroom. I will definitely stay here again when I return to the area.
Thank you for a very pleasant stay !"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great AirBnB: we are so thankful to Erika! The online description and pix are accurate. Erika provides 3 queen Bedrooms in her cute cottage with many homey touches and decorations from travel to India : 2 rooms on the top floor, and one on main level. Sharing the full bath was never a problem. (1/2 bath on top floor). Stairs are required but not too steep. Everything is clean and she generously provides fresh eggs from her adorable backyard hens, along with coffee, tea, homebaked bread and muffins! Access to the kitchen - frig, range, coffeemaker, microwave etc (cook and clean up after yourself!). Communication thru the app, Check in & out was all easy. Erika is super friendly — her vibe is what Airbnb is all about!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Outstanding accommodations, gracious and helpful host, in a charming location."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was spotless clean, my room was just right for one person, very comfortable mattrass and thick comforter excellent. Many lamps and an overhead light! Unheard of in American households. There was a substantial desk and chair, one could work there comfortably. Heating was necessary in the room because it was still the end of April. I think that the ground floor could have been a bit warmer but it is very hard to keep warm a large area (kitchen, dining and living room). It is matter of habit. Everyone in the house (only three people in three rooms) had a lot of space in kitchen cabinets as well as the fridge. The house is nicely decorated. Erika is a great host, does not hover but she is very pleasant to talk to. The only downside -- and that is not her fault -- are the potholes in the street. Don´t try to enter it with a sports car (as my friend would have done if I had not warned him emphatically) :-)"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed my stay here! If I needed to come back to Worcester again I’d stay here again!

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely and cozy home, kind and welcoming host. I came here for a ""night away"" and used her wonderful kitchen to prepare dinner and relax. The next day I walked to a yoga class, a coffee shop, and explored the conservation lands near her house. Thank you!"

Plenty of room for parking. Erika is a wonderful person whom I truly enjoyed getting to know. She also makes really good blueberry muffins. I could not have asked for a better housing situation, for my time in Worcester!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay! I highly recommend it. Stayed here for two months. Beautiful house very clean and comfortable. Good location and nice neighborhood. Excellent host! Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.

2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved Erika's house; super cozy with many towels for bathing, centrally located and ahh, the farmstead-like qualities!
The kitchen was so inviting, Erika even made yummy banana bread during my stay. She had a lot of bougey decor pieces there, & I liked the neighborhood in general... It was fairly traditionally NE. Warm weather & fall foliage, ya know!
Monty, the cat, was my favorite of her pets; very affectionate and mischievous - the last night he was persistent in stalking me and of course trying to bite off my fingers."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed there for several days. The location was great - close to many good restaurants and any shops you might need in your travels. It was also tucked away enough so parking was never a problem and it felt very safe.
The house itself is very cozy. The kitchen is absolutely beautiful and the shower felt great. It just rains buckets of water on you in this nice claw foot tub. I wish I could take the shower with me. The mattress was extremely comfortable and the sheets were so soft. There was plenty of space to put all our belongings for the duration of our stay - dresser, two night stands with shelves, hooks.
We felt free to come and go as we needed to. Erika and her roommate were very friendly and accommodating. Don't hesitate to ask for suggestions for places to eat or anything you might need! There were two sweet dogs (Elliot and Gracie) and a loving cat (Monty). They didn't make any noise and were just as friendly as the people. The house was VERY clean and always smelled great (I specifically remember the Christmas tree smell from the candle).
We both agreed we would stay there again in a heartbeat if we spent time in Worcester again. Much better than a hotel room and the price was very affordable."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"James wasn't just a wonderful responsive host, but also a very good person. it's obvious he enjoys being a host, and it shines through with how accommodating he is. The place is exactly as described, and very clean. Floors are vacuumed and washed daily, and the bathroom is spotless. James was my first Airbnb host, and I won't go to anyone else's place.
Thank you for everything!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed the stay. The initial walk upstairs from the outside may seem a bit sketchy, but once you’re in the apartment, it feels nice.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved how the place is literally in the middle of the city, very convenient to go anywhere, the room is very clean and has big windows. But keep in mind that the traffic around the house is a lot so the noise can be pretty loud."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay during my son’s graduation from WPI! The room was cute and well-appointed, with some really nice touches like bathroom cubbies and snacks. The bed was comfortable, and the room even included a mini-fridge. On commencement day it was only a 15-minute walk to campus, through a very pleasant neighborhood. If I ever return to Worcester, this is where I’ll stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"James is easily the best host I've ever had on AirBNB. He's always very responsive to any issues that would come up, and was quick to correct them.
I always felt right at home in his place. The bathroom was professionally cleaned frequently, and was always squeaky clean. The place was accurately represented in the listing.
The historic house sat on the corner of Elm Park, which is great to walk through. If you attend WPI or any of the other nearby universities, you'll have a wonderful commute to class through Elm Park.
Another interesting feature that I've never seen elsewhere is the snacks that James has for sale at a reasonable price. This is a godsend when you're too lazy to go to the store, which I often was.
Parking in the area is easy. I've never had any issue finding a spot on the street. It's not too crowded, unlike some busier parts of Worcester.
I've been staying with James for several years, and I never encountered any crime in the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was as listed. James was responsive to our needs and this was perfect for our one night stay in Worcester!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great - centrally located and convenient. Always a pleasure to stay at James' place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was an excellent Airbnb stay. The first thing that I noticed was the great decoration of the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. A lot of Worcester memorabilia and just a really good feel.
The cost was much lower than similar stays in this area. The place was very clean and fully set up for both business and vacation travel. Elm Park was directly across the street and was a great place for unwinding at the end of the day. The house was very close to several universities and there were numerous places to eat within a 10 minute walk.
I will definitely come back to James' place again, and would recommend it to anyone.
Thank you for the stay, and I will see you in the spring."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay, it was clean, I enjoyed the ability to play video games, and overall nice spot. He responds very quickly and was very helpful to meet the needs I had. It was very much appreciated! Would definitely come here again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James makes a clear effort to provide an exceptional experience. He is very communicative and the space has all of the ""little touches"" that show you that he cares. The room felt very private and secure.
The house is located in an accessible area just a short drive from downtown. Parking provided and reliable.
James does a great job of making the space hospitable, but please keep in mind that it's a very old house and it's nuances are reflected in the price. With this in mind, we had a wonderful stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and clean apartment with many amenities. Host very helpful and reliable
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,James was a great host and very responsive! The room was exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for as we passed through Worcester for the night.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An apt. with a boho vibe & 3 BnB rooms. James was very friendly & accommodating. He has 2 adorable dogs who DON'T BARK! I barely knew they were there. If you have severe animal allergies it might be an issue but I didn't notice anything. The common rooms: kitchen, bathroom (shared), and living room (under renovation) were cold but the bedroom was toasty warm. The 3rd floor location could be problematic for people with mobility issues as the stairs are narrow and a bit rickety in places.
Great location across from 1 of the oldest public parks in the US. (listed in the National Register of Historic Places.) In the winter people go skating. In warmer weather playground & picnic areas are popular. A very good supermarket is 2 blocks away. Both the WPI campus and the Art Museum are within walking distance (@ 20 min). Nearby on Park are nice restaurants, on Highland my favorite cafe/bakery, 2 local pizza places & other eateries. Good choice for long or short term stays."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would recommend it to anybody

The house was near downtown, so everything was near us. Great place for the price you pay!"

2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house and location were perfect right in downtown and the value was great. Everything was as advertised and James was very responsive but unfortunately there was a couple of issues.
1.) The bed broke when going to lay down, we made due but ended up leaving much earlier than originally anticipated.
2.) The Apple TV remote had no batteries leaving us unable to use the TV.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place may be the single most thoughtfully put together airbnb I have ever stayed in. James very clearly put his time into ensuring that his guests would have every convenience possible in his cozy apartment. From smart placed plugs, USB connectors, warm lighting, welcoming plants, cubbies in the bathroom for each room, to toiletries dispensers in the shower. To top it all, he set up a super convenient self-serve ""snack bar"" in the kitchen where you can get small snacks and cold water and simply venmo him your total which was life saving after a very long day out and about!
The whole space is stylish and filled with love. From plants to cute dogs. Communication was always great. The location was incredible as well! Located right on a fantastic park packed interesting art and a nice walk to the downtown area. Free parking in the driveway and the street. Great price as well!
On future trips to Worcester, we can't imagine staying anywhere else!"

Overall a smooth, pleasant stay."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was exactly what was promised. Host was always quick to respond to messages (usually within seconds).

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"After staying with James twice in two years I must say he is a fantastic host. He took care of the tidiness and cleanliness of the apartment very carefully and frequently, and did so very politely even when the guests can be messy. His kitchen is particularly notable since he has a great collection of not only utensils and cooking utilities, but also decorative pictures that make you feel like being in an Italian gourmet restaurant. The house is close to Price Chopper supermarket if you want to buy your own food, and also close to a variety of restaurants on Park Avenue if you want to eat out. I definitely recommend James’ place for your stay in Worcester."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,James is a nice guy and really helped us out when we lost his keys!
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is clean and appropriate for the price. It would be nice if the room had AC, however there is a fan supplied. The location is within the city so expect to hear city noises. The bed is a typical bed. We are spoiled at home with our fancy bed so it wasn't too comfortable for us.
The host was very friendly."
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot beat the price for being close to WPI. Know going in that you will have two flights of stairs to climb to get to the apt.

2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks, James, for the easy and affordable stay. Your help lugging our things to your 3rd floor nest was greatly appreciated."
2018-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"James' place is a victorian curio cabinet of oddities. It was fun to browse the decor around the place--good taste, for sure! The location is GREAT, close to everything, really, and right across from a beautiful park. We stayed on the fourth of July, and I watched fireworks from the third story window. The room was super duper clean. My only complaints are that the room was ten or more degrees hotter than the rest of the house, even with a fan, so be aware of that on super hot days. We stayed during the heat wave and it was miserably hot. Also, the bed is not comfortable in the room we were in. Both my bf and I had sore backs the next day. Overall, though, it was nice. I'd definitely stay here again on a day with cooler weather!!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good location and not too far of a drive to Boston. James was very hospitable and we enjoyed our stay.

We met another AirBnB guest there who was great to chat with, which gave the experience a pleasant hostel-like feeling."

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James was a great host, the space was clean, spacious and a super value for being right in town. There is one broken screen in the bedroom that needs to be fixed, but we were there such a short time, it didn’t faze us. We would certainly stay here again!"
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the variety of different amenities available in the kitchen.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simple apartment relatively near WPI. Definitely a good value, and I'll be returning there if I need a temporary place to crash for the night. Park in the driveway. Enjoy the artwork he has on the walls!"

2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"James was very warm, welcoming and helpful from the beginning. He provided a great room that was cozy, comfortable and most of all clean. Perfect room to unwind, rest, and relax in. Great for parking if you have a car, so you don't have to circle the block trying to find a spot. It is a safe & sound neighborhood near to all- yet quiet, as well as laundry in-house. James was a great host, personable, attentive & accomodating-always asking if we needed anything, ..a pure gentleman with a heart of gold. We had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying at this one of a kind Oasis,...a true ""home a away from home!"""

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Jessica's place because my partner is very into disc golf and playing at Maple Hill was on his bucket list. It was so fun to find her place which is basically on the 17th hole of the course! He celebrated his 40th birthday with a few friends at the air bnb, playing at 3 different disc golf courses nearby and it was absolutely perfect for them. They loved the privacy and proximity to Maple Hill and 2 other beautiful disc golf courses. Jessica was a wonderful host - she was super responsive before and during, very easy to coordinate checking in, provided recommendations for local restaurants and went out of her way to ensure they were comfortable. My partner and his friends had a wonderful week and have already talked about making it a yearly tradition to come back to Jessica's place to enjoy the incredible disc golfing in this area!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renting an AirBnB can feel as if you are in someone else's space, but Jessica's home did not feel like that. The space is warm and welcoming and has personality without creating a feeling of trespassing. The beds and pillows were comfortable, there were extra blankets for the bed and sofa, plenty of space so I didn't wake the late-risers in our group. Highly recommended."

The property is beautiful although i didn't get out much to enjoy it during my stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and Luke were amazing hosts. We felt at home from the moment we arrived until the moment that we left. The house where we stayed is the side-wing of the main house. It is stunning and has style, is well decorated and the beds are very comfortable. Bathrooms were fresh & clean. The fresh flowers made us feel at home.
Hosts did everything to make us feel comfortable. We could use the terrace with bbq and with breathtaking views over the garden & pond. We could also use canoes & kayaks on the lake at the end of the property. The gardens around the house are very well kept. This was without any doubt the best airbnb experience we ever had!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jessica and Luke's house was a lovely place for our family to visit Boston. The house is very cozy and spacious; the kitchen has all we need to prepare our breakfasts, and the backyard is beautiful. Jessica and Luke were very kind and friendly.

I totally recommend it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great private location with beautiful gardens. The apartment was just the right size for our family of 5 with everything we could need.
The only negative was It was super hot and we could have used an air conditioning unit in each of the bedrooms but we survived. We will definitely stay again should we need to be in that area for anything.

Thank you for the opportunities to enjoy your beautiful home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a tremendously happy and positive exeprience. We have two little kids, 4 and 1, and they loved the property. The hosts are quite possibly the nicest individuals have experienced with short term rentals. Everything from the appropriate kid toys in the apartment to the cleanliness. They showed our kids the chickens ( which we named cupcake and taco) and talkd all the wonderful gardening and history of the property.
The beds were very comfortavle. Soft linens and plenty of pillows.
I hope we have a reason to come back one day!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town to take an exam, and the Barred Owl Retreat was the perfect place to study and rest beforehand. The property is so beautiful and quiet with lots of birds and wildlife, and the space itself is adorable! There were many thoughtful details and special touches. Beautiful hikes and Worcester are just minutes away. The bed was incredibly comfortable! Jessica was so accommodating and responsive, everything about it was easy! I'm really grateful to have stayed there. I hope to return in the warmer months to see the garden and trees in full bloom!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jessica welcomed us right when we arrived. She was friendly and showed us the apartment which was just as described. It is an older home and she decorated it as such which I loved.
It was nice for everyone to have their own bedroom. Two bathrooms are always a must for us.
I noticed right away how clean it was. We have stayed in homes that have not been cleaned well, so I was very happy.
My son and I went on a nature walk on the property. We saw a little waterfall in the yard and said hello to the hens. We hiked through the woods in the back where we saw a beautiful pond.
Jessica was super responsive and even sent me a message to be careful one night because it was icy and she noticed we weren’t back yet. I thought that was very kind and thoughtful. She also lent us some sugar when we ran out. 😉
We all enjoyed our time at Barred Owl very much and have saved it as a favorite. It was quiet and in a prime location for our travels."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed every minute of our stay at Jessica’s place!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we absolutely loved our stay at Jessica's. everything was beautiful and its clear the space is well loved and taken care of. all 4 of us and our dog were extremely comfortable and being right next to Worcester, no shortage of options for literally anything like food, trails, etc. the grounds are also lovely - we did not get to utilize as much because the weather was a little rainy but it did not subtract from our experience. we would absolutely recommend and be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's rental is amazing - peaceful, quiet, cozy and inviting, dog friendly for our special needs basset hound. Close to town and restaurants, easy to find. Jessica was super responsive to our questions, and the best part was the claw foot tub!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was exactly as described, clean and spacious, and in a nice neighborhood in walking distance to downtown and WPI. Communication was responsive and check-in instructions were easy to follow. Would stay there again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"over last 4 years, we have visited Worcester repeatedly to see our daughter at Clark. we've stayed at many air bnbs for parent weekends etc, and this one was by far the best for us. if we do return again it will be for Brimfield since daughter just graduated yesterday, but I would definitely book Jonathan's property again."

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is clean and beautiful, with complete kitchen facilities. It is equipped with coffee, tea and snacks. The heating in the room was sufficient, but it blew directly towards the bed at night, making people feel hot and dry when sleeping. The building is charming, nestled in the Latin American community and within walking distance of the art museum.
Check-in Experience: The check-in instructions provided the apartment door code, but not the room door code. Jonathan was gracious, polite, and promptly provided the necessary information after a quick phone call. A hairdryer was missing initially, but Jonathan swiftly rectified the oversight upon notification, for which we were appreciative. Upon check-out, Jonathan seemed to have lost an electronic key and consulted me, which left me a bit puzzle. I hope that the monitor can help him solve such problem. Nonetheless, overall, it was a relatively pleasant stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jonathan was very responsive and helpful. The instructions and info of the apartment were very easy to follow. Place was exactly like the photos. Definitely felt like a home as soon as you walk in. zero complaints and would definitely use again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks for a great stay! Jonathan's place was very clean and the rental was as described, with lots of amenities. Much appreciated."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just great! We loved the cute apartment and the neighborhood was quiet! We appreciated the little details like extra towels and a snack bowl. The kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfast and coffee. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect substitute for a hotel room when i had a conference in Worcester and all the hotels were booked. It was super clean and well kept, in a quiet building of a quiet neighborhood. I loved that it was self check-in with all the info right in the listing. The self check-out instructions were simple and straightforward (no lengthy list of chores!), which I appreciated. Since I had originally been looking for a hotel room, I really liked the relative anonymity of this process. Jonathan was responsive by text, but otherwise gave me my privacy. I had a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Consistent, clean, affordable, and Joseph addresses every question or concern in a respectful and timely manner."
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is well located and has everything you need but the hygiene in the accommodation is precarious. Apparently the person who does the cleaning does not do their job well and is not being supervised.
The first day when I arrived, the sheets were not clean, I had to ask the host to change them, the walls were spotted, you could see hand marks and other dirt stains.
There was a bad smell in general but especially in the kitchen, apparently the electric oven was dirty from long ago and the leftover food was smelling bad, in addition to the zafacon that is in the same kitchen was more than half full of trash of several days.
The heating above all at night makes noise, sounds like hammer bumps inside the radiator, apparently needs maintenance because it looks like a very old system.
Overall I didn't have a choice, I had a busy schedule during my stay in the village so I could tolerate the conditions but wouldn't stay there again."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"too expensive for what you got... if you want a ghetto experience, you're served... the only thing that was clean was the bed (thank god) we had our lunch stolen in the kitchen while we were in our chamber... it was our first experience and saddly it was not pleasing at all ..."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure to stay at any of Joseph's places. Responds quickly if you need him. His Father is such a pleasantly nice man, and just a call away if needed. and his cleaning staff, is hilarious and very outgoing going. Always a good time talking with these 2 above when we are parting ways. Thanks again for accepting us in your lovely home."

I’d only wish there was a TV in the bedroom and a window Air conditioning unit or some kind of high powered cooling fan.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 Star!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean place to stay. Joseph responds quickly
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Joseph's place was very convenient and right next to the padallium, which was easy to get to for a concert i was going to!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Affordable and walkable if you need a place to stay for a couple nights.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay…close to downtown area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend if you just want some where to sleep at night. The place is quiet and clean. Host Joseph is accommodating and responsive.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place to stay for its value. Everything matched the description.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a short stay in Worcester. The walls are a little thin, so I would advise earplugs if you are sensitive to sound. And visit the beautiful Elm park while you are there!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, sketchy area"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will come back again
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place to spend the night. Joseph was very responsive and accommodating during my stay.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clear communication, easy check-in, listing just as described!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Joseph's place. It's a great deal and his place was very clean, quiet, secure and comfortable. Check in was extremely easy and Joseph was very responsive to all of my inquiries. I was only in for a couple of days for a wedding and it was very convenient. I didn't have a car, so I took a 7 minute Uber from the train station. The train was an hour and a half from Boston Logan about $27 on weekdays and only $10 on weekends. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a hassle, so if you are exploring the town, shared ride is the way to go as everything is nearby and pretty easy to get to. If you have mobility issues, this may not be a good choice for you as there are stairs and they can get a little narrow carrying up and luggage. If you are on a budget and want a clean and secure place to stay I would definitely recommend Joseph's place 🙂 Happy and safe travels, fellow adventurers!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable room and a good value. Located in an area with a ton of restaurants and general stores. I was worried about street noise but not a problem. Chandler Street is busy but not a major thorough fare like a route 9 type of highway. Others talked about shower and electric problems - I didn't see this. Also, I liked the ceiling fan in the room."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was really nice! Joseph is a really nice host!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"awesome place as always. favorite opinion for Worcester Airbnb private, cheep and quiet."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean room, exactly as described. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"So one person went over and added an additional person and added a fee.2 people, 1 day, cost $177 USD,"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A cheap place to stay, and certainly feels that way. Bed was clean and room was fine, but various other parts were dilapidated or in various states of cosmetic disrepair, including some exposed wiring. Water in shower was either scorching or freezing.
Served its purpose but don't expect much."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good location great food around
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Seem less checkin and stay. Repeat customer.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time. The host is friendly, helpful, and responsive."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place is around the corner from two sushi joints (Baba sushi & Sake Bomb), an all you can eat hotpot place that is out of this world (Chaun Shabu), one of the best breakfast places in all of Worcester according to Reddit (Atlea eatery) and one of the top 2 parks in the city (Elm park, the other being Green hill). All within a 5 minute walk!! The place is situated on a fairly busy street by an intersection so you will have to contend with some noise but the A/C helped drowned it out and I came prepared with lemon balm extract (natural sleep aid). Might play it safe and bring ear plugs next time though, but maybe that’s overkill. Depends how heavy of a sleeper you are.
Room was spotless, never even seen the other people staying in the other rooms although I could hear them come in and out. Host left a towel and a bottle of water for me, which I was grateful for, great lifesaver to help my hangover the next morning."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to layover and a very accommodating host
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was a pleasure to stay at Joseph's location. He was quick to respond to questions or concerns and the room was clean and bright. The desk was nice to work from during the day and the location is close to some beautiful parks, as well as restaurants. I had a small work emergency and had to cover part of a coworkers shift on check out day, and Joseph was gracious enough to let me work out of the common space for a few hours past check out time. Thank you for a lovely stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best room in town
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay for a few days to visit the place... 👌

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A+ stay, thank you"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for what I needed. I would definitely book again if I need to be in the Worcester area.
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The description simply said cozy room with shared bathroom. From my perspective, it is a room in a shared co-ed apartment and cozy is a euphemism for small. There was barely enough space to unpack my luggage and store it. There was no mention of the fact that it is a second floor walk-up with a steep, narrow staircase.
I have sleep apnia and need a CPAP machine to sleep at night. It was necessary to place the machine on the bed next to me at night as there was no stand or other place for me to put it. I also had to go out and buy an extension cord in order to reach the only wall plug, which was located on the opposite side of the room.
Finally, there was no mention of the parking situation until after I was checked in. There is no off street parking, and no parking on the street in front of the building. Parking is only allowed on one side of the adjacent streets. It was necessary for me to park about a block and a half away and walk back and forth in one of the coldest weekends of the year. People need to be advised of these things before they commit to rental."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,it's coo

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfort and quality! Just as advertised. Joseph is very attentive to his guests. Check-in was extremely easy. The decor was beautiful and the entire house was spotlessly clean! There are plenty of restaurants in the area. I give this 5 stars across the board.

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice for an overnight stay. Quick and easy communication. If you stay longer bring your own pod or pan with you. There are just a few spoons, less forks and knives for eating."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Small room in a 3 bedroom apartment but both the room and the shared areas were clean and perfect for an overnight stay. The area itself wasn’t the best but you get your money’s worth.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay. Room was very clean and bed was comfortable.
Parking was very difficult as I stayed during a time when road construction was happening so no parking anywhere close to the location. But thats not Josephs fault and I'm sure parking wouldn't be an issue when construction is done. Other than that perfect stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I think it’s a great place to stay the communication (while quick to reply) is not clear at times. But it’s great for a good priced place to reside.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Close by local food shops And walking distance and driving to where you need to go in worcester Joseph was kind and friendly and so was his father.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph's places are all around excellent. The cleanest rooms and easiest check in process I've ever experienced. He always responds right away to any messages and he's friendly and more than accomodating to any needs or concerns. His houses are located minutes from food, convenience stores, parks, restaurants, etc. I have always been amazed at how great his rooms are at all of his properties. Cleanest most well kept AirBNB I've ever booked. I highly recommend booking with Joseph."

2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph had fantastic communication and response times but there were a lot of technical difficulties during my stay and I was locked out more than once. This being said, a quick call or text to him and the problems would get fixed. The internet was going in and out during my entire week long stay."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is exceptionally clean and well kept. I would definitely recommend.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Joseph's place is amazingly clean and comfortable. I stayed for multiple weeks and never once had a problem that he couldn't remedy quickly.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool place to rest
2020-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is good, but I had some issues, in the for two days the smart lock showed problems and the host insisted on me to put the code that did not enter, the host's father was on site and confirmed that the lock was having problems and yet for two occasions I was waiting for the host to unlock the door remotely on a wire of degrees. The house did not have potable water to drink, I communicated with the host and he asked me to drink the water from the kitchen tap because he said it had a filter, only the water had a dark hue. Overall the house is expected, but there are many things to improve overall."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value if you are looking for a clean quiet place to come back to after work. Great Wifi and heat works!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joseph’s place is exactly as described and pictured.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph is a very responsive and thoughtful host. Staying at his unit feels like home. The place is designed with care and I feel I received more than my money's worth of service.
You get access to a fully furnished kitchen, common area and bathroom for the price of 1 room. I felt like living in luxury for a very affordable price.
Thank you Joseph! I will always drop by to say hi when I visit worcester."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good building, good location."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Joseph’s place was good overall. The place was sparkling clean at all times and Joseph and his dad are great hosts. Checking in was very easy and there’s the option to keep luggage after checking out, which was very helpful. On the other hand, there are a couple of things that other travellers should keep in mind before booking a room at Joseph’s. The house is located on a street that’s quite noisy. I heard sirens and other loud noises almost every evening. In addition, the Wi-Fi connection was not good and I had to contact Joseph often so I could get internet access. Joseph eventually gave me access to a more steady network. Also, my room initially did not have AC, but Joseph’s dad installed an AC unit a few days into my stay. Lastly, be aware that there’s a religious service on the first floor on Sundays, so one might hear gospel music upstairs, which I didn’t mind, but I know other guests did."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed in one of Joseph's rooms for the second time, it was just as excellent as the first. A very comfortable place, where you have everything close to you, you don't suffer for anything."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Check in process was really smooth. Communication with the host was good. The pictures describe the room well. It was a three bedroom apartment with a lock on each door, so you’re sharing common spaces. I happened to have a roommate who came in late at night and was disruptive for a short period of time. But I’m not sure if this would be everyone’s experience at this Airbnb."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is my 2nd stay here. Had a good stay. Thanks Joseph. Will probably see you a 3rd time.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph place is Lovely,it is clean and comfortable. Only issue I had for staying there 4 nights was no tv in room,there is WiFi onsite...for those who as electronics,but I’m pretty sure joseph will have tv available for all rooms soon."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely repeat
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and place
,,,"Mary and her husband were very rude and hostile hosts. I’ve already reported their behaviour to AirBnb. They called us “stupid,” told us to “shut-up,” and the man came way too close to my mom and was pointing fingers in her face as an intimidation tactic. She had to tell him to back off and not come any closer. All this happened because they felt we hadn’t left the place clean enough and were “trespassing” when we came to collect the phone charger that we had forgotten at the apartment within 1 hour of check out. First off, their sink garbage disposal wasn’t working from day 1. I wrote to Mary to let her know, and she said that they would get it fixed after our checkout. We had to dig our hands into the sink to ensure that the water went down (even then, not all of it would), but we still didn’t want to make a big deal about it and just enjoy our stay. Apart from the sink and the dishes that we couldn’t wash because the sink was BLOCKED, we left the place clean. Mind you, it is not the guests responsibility to clean the place before leaving. We paid an $88 service fee for a reason. Still, we were courteous - we made sure to not leave any garbage lying around and even folded the bedding so it would be easier on them to change it. When Mary’s husband told us that we left the place “a mess,” we asked “what mess,” to which he responded “you moved the furniture.” They had a coffee table in the living room which we shifted to make some more space, and that’s all. We didn’t shift it back upon checkout, however, that didn’t deserve such a volatile reaction. The sink situation was totally out of our control - it’s not our responsibility to fix that and the consequences of a broken garbage disposal system is unfortunately a dirty sink and dirty dishes. When we came to get our phone charger we were met with incredible hostility. The man told us that we couldn’t go up for a minute to get our charger and that we had to leave the property immediately or he’ll call the cops (?). He was trying to be intimidating but failed to scare us. I told Mary that we can just talk politely to which she responded “I don’t want to talk to you” and then called me “stupid.” We refused to be bullied like this and insisted that we go pick up our belonging and they are free to follow us. Mary’s husband told her to “watch” me while my mom and him went upstairs. I felt like some sort of criminal who needed to be “watched” which was so humiliating. Ultimately he didn’t allow my mom to go upstairs, but was fine with my uncle (who had come to take us to the airport) to go up with him instead. I’m not sure why they treated us that way when we approached them politely in the first place . We are 110% sure that the charger was left in a socket in the living room. I’m certain that our charger was taken because of some sort of grudge. Overall, we had a terrible experience here. We paid almost $800CAD to this couple, including an $88 service fee, to be treated so poorly. The location of this place is decent, but the hosts don’t know how to behave and because of that this place is not worth it."
,,,It was terrible than I expected. The place has no yard and that is unusual here. The furniture and appliances in the house are very old. It is definetely not suitable for families with children.You cant sleep and have to get up early because the noises of the car and the sunlight prevent you sleep. All parts in the house are not clean. Also She is so Strict about the check out time that she doesn’t even tolarate a few minutes. I dont recommend it.
,,,"The house is not suitable for children. There are two stair and they dont have any doors so you should protect children from stairs. The house is not clean and tea, cofee and other supliances were not enough. I dont recommend it."
,,,Bed isn’t good at all. The bed sink in the middle. No television no hot water in the bathroom sink floor squeaky when you’re walking. No rub by the bed so please add a rug by the bed and towel needs to be newer because I used it and it’s full of white stuff that sticker in my hair and beard nice spot but needs to be updated
,,,"Joseph has an huge electric issue.. He has a kitchen with no working stove.. The light don’t work in refrigerator, an he was mad i Improvise by using a one single burner… then tried to accuse me of cooking in my room which is dangerous then tried to blame me for electric issues in which, I took a shower in the dark multiple times operating off of the light shining through the window.. Also for some reason he thought insulting BLM would get under my skin… when I offer to fix the stove which is only $50 an then he tried to charge $20 extra on side for guest limited to 2hrs max ..Never again …"
,,,"I left a day before my checkout because I felt as if Joseph’s place was not what was portrayed in the pictures and unclean. The room was smelly , and so were the pillows. I don’t appreciate how he did not try to help the situation or even send a sincere apology. That is very unprofessional I told him how I felt about the room and how I felt as if it was very unclean and he have not asked how he could make it better. I also tried to request my money for the day i did not stay there and it was declined. Also be careful because it is likely that the pictures probably wont look like the actual room."
