2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great for my family of six. 15, 12, 9, & 7 year old kids. Great base camp for exploring the area. We skied at Pajarito Mountain, roughly 10 minute drive, for three days and checked out Bandalier one afternoon. Convenient to groceries and restaurants. House had very modern touches to a mid 20th century style structure. Great views and I would definitely consider staying here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best-appointed AirBnBs we have stayed at recently. All of the essentials provided, well-appointed kitchen, paper products, etc. It is always a bit annoying when you have to go to the store to backfill that stuff mid-trip and Savanna’s place was very well set up with everything one would need. We will be back. Thank you!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and clean place to stay for few days.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place to stay. It was clean and comfortable. Very close to the places we wanted to see in town. I do have a couple of cautions, however. This house is designed for average height to tall people. I am only five feet tall. I could not reach any of the upper shelves, nor turn on the light over the sink, nor turn on the hall light. Those lights had switches on the lights themselves and the lights were almost ceiling height. Luckily, I have a six foot tall husband. One other caution is the dining area is a step down added-on room which also houses the refrigerator. This house would not be good for anyone with mobility problems. These are not complaints. Just a heads up to people wanting to find a house which meets their needs."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came up with the family for a ski trip at pajarito, lodging can be very hard to find in Los Alamos because it’s so small but savannas place was great for a family, the kitchen and living areas were spacious and there was plenty of room for 2 grown ups and 2 little kids. About a 5 minute drive from “downtown” Los Alamos/historical sites and 15 minutes to pajarito…"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We come to Los Alamos a couple times per year. Mostly driving from SC to CA. We always have our dog and hotel stays are stressful for all of us.

The house is in a nice quiet neighbourhood in a good location for most areas in and around town. Check in was smooth and easy and we really appreciated the off-street parking. There is a small porch which overlooks a gravel yard and a car park, but round the corner you see the mountains. There were no views from most of the windows. The bed was very comfortable and the heating and hot water worked really well. The kitchen was an excellent user-friendly space for cooking meals."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was cozy and cute, and the host was very helpful! The coffee supplies and LED fireplace were just what we needed post-hike and for a rainy boardgame day, and the host left clear directions to check in/out and operate the appliances. (For out of town visitors, Los Alamos has gorgeous trails and parks but not many food delivery options, so plan ahead if you want to stay in for dinner after working up a sweat on the trails.)"

The house was convenietly located to stores, the farmer's market, and many day trips (Santa Fe, Jemez Springs, Bandalier, and Ojo Caliente). We all loved the crisp, clean feel of the modernly decorated house. All amenities were quality and readily available in the kitchen.

The beds were comfortable and the space, overall, really made us feel welcome and relaxed. We will definately stay at this gem the next time we are in town!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dianne’s place was a beautiful, spacious and well appointed room; the bed was a cool tall four-poster with a good comfortable and supportive mattress and we enjoyed the beautiful view over the hillside from the front porch steps, surrounded by ponderosa pines and lovely gardens and landscaping. The space was private and had a huge walk-in closet kept our stuff out of the way; a great little snack center with a Keurig coffeemaker was a plus, with a great selection of coffee and tea pods. She had a great selection of books in the nightstand, and a well-stocked mini fridge and microwave. Loved being able to open the screened double door to let the fresh air in. The steep driveway and a flight of steps at top that led up to the entrance required a bit of effort but neither hubby and I had any trouble and we are of average fitness. Spacious private bath was clean and also well-appointed. Overall a great stay with wonderful and attentive hosts who responded to our every need. Will be back!"

Dianne and Scott were responsive, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and accommodated during my stay. I felt very well cared for. Keep in mind that this is not truly a separate unit - it is attached to their home and there is only a curtain in between the main house and your unit.

As stated, the room was up an outside set of steps, which might represent a challenge for some, but I liked it because the room was high above the street--kind of like a treehouse! Good views, too; I even saw an elk strolling down the street."

Diane has stocked lots of little items one might need - in the bathroom and drinks/small snacks for guests. Communication was good and check-in had specific details to help walk us through step-by-step. The outside area to sit in is beautiful and quiet (even while still in the middle of a neighborhood). Enjoyed our stay!"

Do not miss Chili Works for a breakfast burrito, or Bathtub Brewery for a beer after a long day!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent stay! The check-in process was very simple and I loved having the private bathroom. The room was clean, the bed was fresh, and everything about my stay was comfortable. There are motion-activated lights in the hallway as well, so you can use the bathroom when it's dark.
Although I did not need any, there were refreshments in the room along with a coffee machine. They have maps and books in the room that detail the LANL and New Mexico, which was a very nice touch. Very nice place to get work done and see Los Alamos!"

She is very responsive, and she knows her area so well enough to provide any recommendation you may need! I'd love to be back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I totally lucked out when Dianne posted her apartment for the first time post-pandemic. The room is spotlessly clean and airy, with high ceilings and cross ventilation from three windows making it extra comfortable. Many thoughtful touches including motion-detector nightlights for navigating the way to the hallway bathroom. The mini fridge was stocked with extras, the keurig and the microwave were life-savers. While the apartment is in a private home and one is aware of the owner's presence, it is not intrusive -- nice combination of privacy as well as safetly for a solo traveller. The few times we intersected, Diane was friendly and solicitous. I feel so lucky this room opened when it did and plan to return!"

It is a beautiful contemporary home with high ceilings in an upscale Los Alamos neighborhood. It was an excellent location to experience the town and all the history, stunning scenery, and easy access to Bandalier Nat. Pk among other great places to hike and explore.
Dianne was a sweet host and we appreciated her making the space available to us rather last minute! The driveway is quite long and steep and was slippery when we left in the morning with some icy patches. We heard that the weather was colder and wetter than usual for the end of Feb.
I look forward to returning."

She was so nice and had lots of information/advice to give us while staying in Los Alamos. Extremely clean and very private. Absolutely loved our stay with amazing hospitality!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite places. Such a beautiful house and atmosphere
2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Dianne's home is very comfortable and clean! We thoroughly enjoyed staying with her. The room was private and the location is great if you are skiing at Pajarito! Thanks Dianne!!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dianne's home is very clean, the directions were very clear, and communication was great. Her home was a convenient place to rest as we skied and explored the area. We would definitely stay again!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Bed was very comfortable and everything was nice and clean. Dianne and her husband were very nice. Would stay here again next time I'm on the hill.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is lovely, clean and welcoming. I will definitely stop here again if my business brings me to Los Alamos."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, roomy, & great value. Plenty of room for 2 & thoughtful bath robes & plenty of pillows & blankets. The host is nearby so all I had to do was text her & she could make it happen!!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy check-in.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was very enjoyable and the hosts were very kind and hospitable!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great room, hospitable host."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room is clean and bright. Quick responses to questions. My only note would be that the full size bed isn’t the best for two tall adults.
Nice neighborhood."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for LANL workers, it's a little out of town, but the neighborhood is quiet. There may be guests above you as well, which you will certainly hear (we heard cell phones on vibrate, booming footsteps and water usage, luckily it seemed everyone was on the same schedule). The hosts are great and left us snacks and were friendly if we happened to see them outside. The linens were very nice including the plush towels. The heated floors were great, but the thermostat seemed locked at 63 degrees so we were chilly most of the time and had to bring an electric blanket to keep warm at night (the room has a lot of windows for heat to escape). There is a private entrance, but the hallway to the bathroom is in the main house, a room divider is placed over the entrance to give a sense of privacy but you know you're in the house and can hear conversations in the kitchen/living room with your door shut/ smell dinner cooking. Compared to other places, it was awesome for the price."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent hostess. Everything I needed was where Diane said it was. Great private entrance and it was easy to find the home!! I've been using airbnb for 4 years & Diane is definitely 5 stars!!! I will be back!!!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone is right, this place is really clean, we didn't want for anything. The heated floors in the bathroom are super nice. Check in and entry couldn't have been easier. We felt right at home."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room is lovely and comfortable. I had a great stay!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They're such wonderful hosts and willing to work around my strange schedule.
I've added them to my preferred list."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very impressive. This was my first Airbnb experience, so I didn’t really know what to expect. A friend and I went on a last minute trip, and this host was very prompt and professional. There was a lot of thought put into it, and you could tell the host knew what they’re doing. It was very private, very thoughtful, and an amazing deal."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room has keurig coffee machine available. The mini fridge is convenient. I really enjoy the level of cleanness Dianne offers. Very quiet all day long. Great place to stay.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dianne's place is great. Private bath was super clean with plush towels and bathrobes. It was easy to find and in a beautiful location. Tea/coffee, beverages and granola bars were appreciated. Check in was easy. Thanks Dianne!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, stylish place."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room is very clean and cozy, and includes a stocked snack fridge and coffee. We definitely had a comfortable night's sleep there."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable and clean rental in independence, perfect for people who like to have a lot of privacy. It was nice to have little things to snack and drink in the room."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Space is very clean and comes with everything you need for a little bit longer stay, including mini-fridge, Keurig coffee, plates (and fuzzy robe!). Check in is a breeze, and the hosts are very accommodating."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dianne was quick to reply, accommodating and helpful. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Great place to stay."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful home! In a quiet neighborhood 10 min. from downtown Los Alamos. Dianne put lots of thoughtful details into the room: snacks, a Keurig, toothpaste, etc."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an amazing stay at Dianne's place. Communication was quick and responsive and the self check-in made everything easy. The house is absolutely gorgeous and in a great part of Los Alamos making it easy to sight-see and go to the attractions of the area. What we appreciated more than anything though was the excellent hospitality. We had mentioned
that we would be celebrating our first anniversary and Dianne went out of her way to make it special, purchasing us a sparkling rosé wine as a surprise. I highly recommend staying at Dianne's place when in the Los Alamos/Santa Fe area!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was comfortable, pleasant and very convent to everything in town. The room and bath are lovely. The bed is a very comfy, vintage four poster with lots of quilts in the closet. The private entrance with its little stoop with a view was great. The room has brand new appliances, a microwave, fridge and Keurig coffee maker plus a nice selection of coffee pods. (I only bought one meal the whole time I was there.) There were even a few cold beverages waiting in the fridge. All in all an excellent choice."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences that I have had. The room and private bathroom were very clean. The bed was comfortable. I loved the small touches such as the set of plates and mug set out and drinks in the fridge. There were also all of the toiletries that you could possibly need. I felt very comfortable and at home.
The location is beautiful and very quiet. It is a 10 minute drive to restaurants, Ashley Pond and the lab.
Dianne was fast to respond and the booking process was incredibly easy. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at her home."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, sunny and quiet room to spend the night."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter stayed here on her road trip and said the suite was super clean and the bed was very comfortable, everything you would need to shower etc. was provided, and the mini fridge and coffees were a really thoughtful addition! Dianne provided an info sheet about the area that was super helpful, and it was a quick trip from the house into downtown Santa Fe. Would definitely recommend this room to anyone traveling through the area :)"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely accommodations.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in Los Alamos. Dianne is a very thoughtful host.
2018-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Simple, clean, no nonesense room and location. Perfect for a one night overnight in Los Alamos."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice to stay at Dianne´s, the room was spacious, the bathroom wonderfully comfortable and clean. The area was far better than we expected, no problem leaving the car at the front door. We felt very comfortable and would recommend Dianne to everyone, who wants to stay in Los Alalmos."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay
Jennifer was extremely friendly and helpful"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"There was going to be 3 people for our stay but it was only 2. Very small space, reminds me of a dorm room. Issues with the television, when watching the top of screen darkens & makes it hard to see. The wall heater in the living room stopped working (we were cold very cold). There is no door on the bathroom (just a curtain), so there is no privacy. The shower handle in the bathroom was broken so controlling the hot/cold was difficult. In addition, the bathroom is located through the bedroom. This should have been specified in the listing and would have been helpful in deciding whether to book the stay (sound, odor, shower steam coming directly into bedroom.) Kind of pricey for the space. I paid a total of $558.73 ($183.26 a night for 3 nights). The other bed, which is a sleeper sofa, located in the living room, so when the other guest is trying to rest & you need something in the kitchen, you are disturbing them. This space reminds me of a dorm room. We left before out stay was over."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer’s place was conveniently located near the sites we wanted to see in Los Alamos and Bandelier National Monument. There was plenty of room for the two of us and we enjoyed the views of the canyon.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment would be ideal for one person, but is a bit cramped for two. It could also use an actual dining table. And we were unable to make the gas fireplace (the only heat source) operate by using the remote, but Jennifer and her husband were very helpful in explaining how to operate it manually, so it wasn't a big problem. Some of the reviewers complained about traffic noise, but we didn't find that to be a problem either (although we were there in March, and didn't have the bedroom window open)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Host is super friendly and accommodating. Room has a full kitchen with excellent appliances, tall spacious ceilings, and lots of wood that makes it feel kinda like a cozy cabin. 20 minute walk to TA-3 at LANL and 20 minute walk to the supermarket."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed at several of Jennifer’s places and I have never been disappointed! She is responsive and accommodating! They are always immaculate and as described
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay in Jennifer’s place, and with an extension discount, Thank you very much. We’ll be back as it suits our needs."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great accommodations for our needs. Jennifer was very responsive and sensitive about problematic cable television service and got it resolved quickly. We’ll be back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was amazing! I have stayed at several of her locations and have always been pleased!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jennifer was a great host! We were in a tight spot just a week before relocating 2000 miles to Los Alamos and Jennifer graciously accommodated our situation. Grateful to her and this Airbnb, would recommend her place to anyone heading to Los Alamos!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good apartment, as advertised. Jennifer was very helpful and responsive. It met our needs very well during this stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little apartment. Very cozy. Pull out bed was comfortable

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is just about perfect. Modern, clean, pleasant. Good location. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our 2nd stay at Jennifer's. Both times, we stayed for a week while visiting family in Los Alamos. Both times, our stay was great. The facility is well equipped and clean. We will be back."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Nice, convenient to town, quiet, and well stocked for cooking and laundry."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome little spot! Host was very sweet and fast at responding. Clean and comfy. Easy communication. Thank you
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Modern decor and convenient location.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer's place is lovely - the kitchen is particularly fantastic. Good location. She's also a kind person who went above and beyond for me and my husband. Would definitely stay there again!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The helpfulness and communication with the host was great. The place is nice and has good appliances. There was an issue with the heater when we arrived, but it was handled shortly after we asked."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very clean and cozy. I’m on a special home-cooked diet, and this place has a fully equipped kitchen that could meet my needs. Our host Jennifer was very nice and responsive."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jennifer and Curtis are great to work with. Their place is as convenient as you could hope for in Los Alamos.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was ideal for commuting to the lab. It’s clean, comfortable, and the hosts were very accommodating"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was so nice to stay at for five weeks before we moved into our house. Curtis and Jennifer were so kind and accommodating!
I will say that on hot days the living area can get warm, but it is doable and the bed is on the firmer side, just to be prepared for that.
During the night it is important to have the window open by the bed with the fan, since the nights are cool. Luckily we were never warm at night.
The kitchen was great and the location was perfect!"
2020-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, and with a great view. Some information about check-in and the WiFi was out of date, but the hosts responded to all of my questions fairly quickly. Other than that, the place was great!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really nice clean studio. All new great location easy access. Friendly helpful host. Thanks
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this rental for my uncle. Curtis and Jennifer were very prompt and responsive in terms of coordinating the check-in, etc. My uncle said that place was 'great'."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent spot in Los Alamos, centrally located, well-equipped and comfortable. If you are doing work at the lab, or spending a few days sightseeing, this is a great spot. Curtis and Jennifer are great hosts, and the studio has everything you need to be comfortable."
2019-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great hospitality, convenient location and cozy."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Staying right along Trinity drive was great! I stayed there as a summer intern and the location couldn't have been more convenient. Curtis is also a wonderful host and was very quick to respond to anything I needed.
This was a very comfortable spot for an extended stay and the view out back was wonderful for storm watching when they rolled in."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Curtis’s place was great. Very close to LANL and everything in Los Alamos. Very clean and great parking. Communication was very quick. Would highly recommend.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and clean place to stay in Los Alamos. This apartment provides a better value than area hotels. The appliances are fairly new and having a washer and dryer available is a plus. Just be aware that there is no a/c (typical of many homes in town) and other than hand soap, no toiletries are provided. Not a big deal as long as you know ahead of time. Curtis was a responsive and accommodating host."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice studio apartment conveniently located. Optimal for short-term visitors at LANL.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Delightful, well designed space. Well appointed with a lovely canyon view from the living space / kitchenette."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, functional space in Los Alamos. Best part: there's dishwasher, so you can hit the coop or Thursday farmers market & cook up a storm without having to do chores :) Chances are, if you're looking at this place it's because you have stuff to do at the lab, but IMO it's also good ""home base"" for vacations if you're into hiking... and it's waaaay more affordable than staying in Santa Fe. (Just be aware, vacationers, that Los Alamos is extremely spartan.)"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable.
2017-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent location and close to town. Curtis is always very responsive. It’s nice to be able to walk to town.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay in Los Alamos, this is the place. If you are working in the Hospital, you can walk to work!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2017-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place is outstanding before 8am and after 6pm. One can walk to the swimming pool ~10 min and to the lab. Location, size, kitchen are great. The place does not have AC. Sealing fans and open doors partially compensate lack of the AC. The TV has an HDMI cable than can be hooked up to a laptop: yielding a workplace with a screen at 3900 x 2000 pixel resolution :-)"
2017-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,This was our second stay here. Our comments for this time are the same as for the 8/16 trip. We would stay here again.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Exceptional location for a visitor to Los Alamos Labs - walking distance to lab and town. A beautifully organised studio flat with comfy bed in a beautiful location. Curtis bent over backwards to sort things out when there was a plumbing problem at the weekend. I would stay again here in a flash, and have recommended it to all my collaborators in the lab who are looking to put visitors up in peace and quiet when visiting.
Wifi is good, kitchen and bathroom have everything you could want, and you can start a hike down the canyon from the back door!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is on the main road, but noise was not bad with the fan on. The property is the only residential unit in a Medical office building that was not very busy at all. Very nice on the inside with a large kitchen. There is no bathroom door do to the size of the unit. Washer and dryer and all appliances are new. There is no AC and heat is from a beautiful gas stove. We used a box fan and were fine even though it was in the upper 80's. This is a great location to visit."
2017-06-01,3,Stayed one night,Unit is clean and convenient to Los Alamos activities
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment! Clean, quiet, private. Perfect for a weekend getaway. We enjoyed our time here."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great accommodations, great value. Highly recommend to any visitors to hotel-scarce Los Alamos."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment. Love the accommodations. Having a brand new, full kitchen and washer & dryer is so great when traveling. Great location too. Everything was perfect. I will be recommending this place to my sister and her husband when they come to visit."
2016-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed the location, which was within about a half mile walk of everything in town, and Chile Works. The unit was new, clean, and comfortable, although fairly small for two people with hiking gear. With the bedroom window open in the summer, there is a fair amount of traffic noise from Trinity Drive, and the living room is a little noisy due to the compressor next door during the day. But we were not in the room a lot and the noises did not bother us much. We would stay there again."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great little place, I enjoyed my stay."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great trip for us especially with how easy it was to deal with Curtis for lodging. There aren't many hotel rooms available in Los Alamos without booking well ahead. Having the airbnb option allowed our trip to happen! The location was superb within easy walking distance of Old Town and an easy drive to the Smiths Marketplace.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!!! Great place to stay! Clean and comfortable!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful accomodations, well appointed and very comfortable. Quiet neighborhood with nearby access to great walking trails. Mary was very responsive and provided welcome information about local restaurants and nearby attractions. Highly recommend this listing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently stayed at Mary's Airbnb in White Rock, New Mexico, for the annular eclipse, and it was an exceptional experience. The place was impeccably clean, spacious, and perfectly located. Mary and Caleb were an outstanding hosts, offering warm hospitality and providing thoughtful snacks.
White Rock and the surrounding area are brimming with exciting attractions and activities. Mary's valuable local insights and recommendations added to the overall enjoyment of our trip.
Thank you, Mary, for making our eclipse adventure so memorable. We hope to return to the area in the future as there is so much to see and do in this amazing landscape."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s rental unit worked beautifully for my friend and I! We were three nights there and had everything we needed. The unit was exactly as pictured, although it seemed even bigger than the photos made it look. The fridge and freezer are actually larger than I was expecting. We had no trouble fitting all of our perishables in them. Mary was a friendly and responsive host. We were lucky enough to get to meet Mary and her husband in person, which was a treat for us. The neighborhood is quiet with a grocery store, post office, gas station, and area visitor center very close by.
I would definitely stay at Mary’s house again in the future! Thank you Mary!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed at. Very well equipped and lots of included food etc, and a good bookshelf. Convenient location for both Bandalier and Los Alamos."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mary’s Airbnb was perfect for my stay and found it to be a pretty cozy stay. You can tell they are very proactive and offer beyond expectations. The house was clean and had nice decorations.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had easy access to White Rock Overlook which we painted daily for our plein air paint out. It was quiet and very private.
Mary was very responsive throughout the transaction. It worked great for our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was kind and patient, in spite of us changing our arrival and departure days at the last minute. She was very easy to work with and the place was lovely and homey. The ample parking was an added bonus."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Mary’s place was great to stay at! Nice neighborhood and the town is in a gorgeous area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s was very comfortable and spotless!! One of the cleanest I have stayed in. Nice little treats from snacks, drinks and breakfast goodies. Very peaceful neighborhood. Great stay for the price. We would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was a wonderful host. She gave us information that allowed us to enjoy the area more. I would have enjoyed a longer visit with her and her husband. The place was nicely decorated and the beds were very comfortable. The snacks and drinks were a nice touch.
The only downsides were the funky, musty smell and having to wash the dishes in the bathroom sink. A sink in the main room with the fridge would definitely make staying again more of a pleasure."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary was extremely gracious and accommodating. Her home was perfect for our little getaway to get in some snowboarding at pajarito!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,The host was very accommodating host was really good at communicating very kid friendly!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Hosts were great! Even offered to pick up a pizza for us while they were out!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice home in a quiet location! The place is well-decorated with thoughtful touches (drinks in fridge, extra snacks, notes, etc) throughout. Pretty easy to find and checkin/checkout was simple. The projector-tv on the wall was great. I’m not sure if it was being wiped from a day of travel or the beds, but I slept great through the night (I am a very light sleeper). Keep in mind that this is the front part of the house, so some noise from the other side should be expected, fyi. Overall, I would stay here again. Thanks!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sister and our husbands were very happy with our night's stay at Mary's home. The space was very comfortable with living room furniture that worked well for our dinner and breakfast together in the apartment. The beds gave us excellent sleep, and the place was super clean. Mary was very responsive to our communications, and helpful with our questions and needs. Mary's place is close to the Bandelier National Monument which was amazing, not to be missed. We'd recommend her place to anyone passing through!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great location, Wifi, nice parking, and a really cozy place to stay. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great place. Comfy beds, super clean everywhere. Our family didnt spend too much time at the house, really just to sleep after along day of adventures. But the beds were really soft and the bathrooms were clean.
Mary made check in a breeze, i had no issues with communication and no issues finding and getting into the house.
Its in a really nice sweet neighborhood that is quit and not too bright at night.
+ points for the coffee machine - we used that little guy plenty."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A really nice place and set up. The little snacks was appreciated. Will definitely be staying here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed staying here. The property was clean and comfortable, and everything was laid out for ease of use.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice comfortable clean place to stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, cozy, and had awesome amenities like Keurig, plenty of coffee pods, a refrigerator filled with drinks, a freezer that had breakfast foods, a projector with most streaming services and comfy couches. We arrived very early from central Texas and Mary let us check in early, which was so kind, because we were exhausted. The drive from Santa Fe to White Rock is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend this place to everyone!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home spacious and the screen is amazing to watch movies all night would definitely recommend
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super comfortable home and place to stay! Was super easy to get to and from town and biking trails! We would definitely stay again!!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Mary's place during my final research project. The place was so clean and nice. Their hospitality was so great , and they were really helpful (Once they helped me to get a 3D printer from their neighbor for my research) and kind. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting White Rock or Los Alamos area."

The bed was heavenly and so were the pillows! We loved that Netflix, etc. gets projected on a huge wall so it looks like you’re in a movie theatre! Everything was top notch! Great attention to detail throughout by the hosts who are very lovely people! Also it is a very quiet neighborhood!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mary's place was the perfect place for my family to stay while visiting relatives in White Rock.

Guests have the front part of a well-maintained and updated, mid-century ranch house, including a full bath with a tub and shower as well as two bedrooms with very comfy beds and blackout blinds. The kitchenette has a full fridge and freezer stocked with yogurt, Gatorade and frozen waffles. There are assorted protein and fruit bars, and a Keurig with coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Dishes, cups and utensils, too. It’s a great set-up. Central heat and the electric fireplace box in the main bedroom kept us warm and cozy when it was chilly outdoors.
And you can watch streaming movies or TV shows on a wide and tall wall that serves as a perfect screen.
The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. It’s close to White Rock’s scenic Overlook above the Rio Grande and hiking trails down to the river that offer up-close petroglyphs and blue grama grass that curls like Cheerios in the fall. Historic Los Alamos is an easy 10 miles away and Bandelier National Monument is just 8 miles away.
Mary and Steve are super helpful and quick to respond to Qs.

The house was amazing and perfect for our family! With four teenagers, the home's layout was perfect and provided ample space. The home was extremely clean and well stocked with amenities and everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. The kids loved the Christmas decor and we enjoyed the thoughtful card & little gift. After a long 13 hour drive, we found the beds and pillows of extremely high quality and comfortable. Before we even missed a couple of items the kids had left behind, Hannah contacted us, and arrangements were made to ship the items to us. This home, our ""base station"" for a four-day ski trip, was absolutely perfect, and you will have difficulty finding a more attentive and perfect host. The home was exactly as represented and we will be back next year! Highly recommend this home & hostess!"

We enjoyed a very comfy bed and the wonderful books they had about National Parks and local sites to see. A great place to stay when exploring Los Alamos or Santa Fe. Lauren was a great host, very communicative and quick to respond to any questions. Nice, quiet neighborhood with grocery and restaurant nearby. We would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren and her partner were great hosts. They were proactive and very helpful when we had questions. The space itself is definitely something to experience especially given the surroundings. The area in the immediate vicinity doesn't have many good options, but a short drive will bring you to many. Also, check out the local library, it's very cool!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lauren's airbnb was so much fun! what a unique experience my husband and I had. the bed was so comfortable, and though small, the shower was perfect! my husband is 6'3 and he had a great shower! everything we needed was provided, and the location is so private and quiet. we felt such peace!

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really nice little house, everything is clean and pretty and very well taken care of."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lauren’s airstream is a great launch point when visiting the area to explore Los Alamos, Bandelier National Monument, or even Valles Caldera. It is small, but comfortable and clean. Just what you need after a long day outside."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my first time staying in an RV. The owners communicated well about the various quirks and features involved.
There was a brand new in the wrapper dish sponge, which I thought was a great touch.
I wish the pots and pans provided had been a little easier to find. We are too short to see into the cabinet they were stored in, and didn’t find them for several days.
Adding the location of the light switches to the layout provided would have been helpful, though we eventually figured it out."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy airstream and a really comfy bed too.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The airstream was a fun place to spend a night. It was well equipped, clean, and comfortable. Would stay here again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay!! Hosts were amazing, everything was kept clean, and communication was definitely top priority. Will definitely consider staying here again next time I’m traveling near Santa Fe! Beautiful views and safe neighborhood definitely didn’t hue things!! 😁😎"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I chose this cozy airstream on a whim hoping it would be ultra close to some really great hikes. We didn't give ourselves enough time to explore the immediate area and I didn't personally see any trailheads within walking distance, but the mountains in the distance were stunning. And it was a good launch spot to Bandolier and Jemez mountains/Jemez Hot Springs. The trailer is pristine, private, in a very nice safe residential neighborhood. Only one restaurant a short drive away (and we were out of luck on dinner because it was closed for a private party - oh well!) next to a large grocery store so we opted for that. This spot ended up being perfect for what we needed for our one night. Thx!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Casa de Pajarito! Lauren & Curtis are lovely people, and they were great communicators They went out of their way to make our stay just perfect. The location is ideal for visiting Bandelier, Jemez, etc. The space worked really well for the two of us (and we like cooking). The space had everything we needed (we travel with our own salad spinner, since salads are our lunch staple). I was impressed how well the space was stocked, including Kuerig coffee and a nice tea selection. The bed was very comfortable, and the sleeping space was dark enough I didn’t need my sleep mask (yay!). And there is a view of the mountains from bed! Wow. There are great guide books (Bandelier, as well as other national parks). They also have info on local amenities (Pig + Fig!). I just wish we could have stayed longer! We’ll be back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! I will be back☺️
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space, very clean, very trendy. Lauren did a great job in her attention to details, she was always there when I needed her. Made me feel very welcome. I highly recommend staying there."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an excellent stay!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Although my experience with the hosts wasn’t exactly the best, I cannot in good conscious give this listing a low rating.
The listing is beautiful and it is in a beautiful neighborhood on the hosts property. They do an amazing job of keeping this property clean and it is extremely convenient. If you have never spent nights in a camper, be sure to read all the signs. They let you know exactly what you need to do. This is not a hotel, so you need to be careful of your water usage. Also, it is not like the local hotels that don’t require you to lists children. The price of this place is low and affordable, but can only be kept this way if you stick to the 2 person max (which includes children)
Why my experience was bad:
Due to my recent move and retiring from the military, things had been extremely tight financially. We chose this place because it was close to my new job and the children’s new school. We only booked for 4 days because I was scheduled to finally receive reimbursement after 2 months of living in hotels and Airbnbs with my children, and my property manager decided to allow us to move in early as long as we had the funds to do so. On the second night of our stay we needed the tank pumped and this upset the hosts. However they were extremely nice and accommodating.
My emotional support animal was living out of our vehicle which was parked on the street because this listing does not have parking on the property. I had been checking on her, feeding her, and making sure the car wasn’t too hot or cold. However, the window was cracked and she must have climbed out. I was extremely anxious, sad, and distraught about this as expected. When I saw the hosts’ cat while I was sitting outside the camper, I messaged the hosts about this and not only did I not get an answer, but to add insult to injury she falsely reported me to Airbnb support saying I had a cat in the camper. Which obviously if that were true, the cat would not have run away. She was likely spooked and was looking for a warmer safe place.
To make matters even worse, after me explaining our financial situation and everything that was going on, the hosts requested $200 for damages, even though there were no damages. This made me extremely uncomfortable. My plan was to send a thank you note after this stay because they seem like really nice people up until this all happened. My family and I stayed in my car until someone was nice enough to help us with a hotel for the night. It was in a pretty scary neighborhood, but we were still more comfortable there and able to take showers and use the bathroom without the fear that we would be inconveniencing anyone.
I truly believe that you will enjoy your stay. Which is why I still give this listing a 4 star. I feel that the host reacted emotionally which is unprofessional and that is the only reason it wasn’t a 5 star for me. Don’t let this keep you from booking this beautiful camper in this amazing and quiet neighborhood."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time staying in the airstream, everything was clean, organized, and Lauren was extremely attentive."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! I loved the airstream!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Airstream was clean, comfortable, and had everything I needed for my short stay. The hosts are super attentive to details.

A great environment for working/writing. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, well-appointed airstream camper! Although it is set in a neighborhood, the arrangement does provide a feeling of privacy for guests. This was a great home base to explore the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a couple nights while house-hunting in Los Alamos, White Rock, and Santa Fe. Just an awesome experience all-around. Lauren & Curtis are extremely courteous and thoughtful hosts. They kindly prepared the Airstream with all the necessities and more - the mini exfoliating loofahs were complimentary, right? :D I never found myself missing anything, or scratching my head too long at various buttons / fixtures in the Airstream. (Discreet instructions pasted throughout were very helpful for first-timers. But tbh, figuring stuff out is part of the fun! So many buttons and compartments….) The vibe in the sitting / dining area was also extremely conducive for writing and working, in my opinion. I highly recommend staying here for whatever reason brings you to this part of NM. (ps. There’s a Smith’s and an excellent restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner within walking distance of the Airstream, which was convenient for picking up things to cook or a meal.)"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Comfy bed
Very comfortable
Very clean
Lots of amenities
Location close to bandolier hike!
Great stargazing
Cons
- Very limited space for trash if you plan to prepare food or throw trash in general.
- Walking distance from parking to Airbnb is a little long and is a little inconvenient especially at night.
- not much outside lighting
With all this being said it is a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend.
Thank you again to the owners again for letting us stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a great quiet stay for a night or a few days. The camper is perfect for 2 people to be in. Also, the bed in the camper is more comfortable than any hotel bed you will stay in. The sights and the sight seeing around the camper is beautiful and well worth the stay. Lauren also left some great suggestions for places to dine and get a cocktail. Highly recommend staying here for a new experience or to try out if you want a camper in the future. Thank you Lauren and family for an amazing stay. We will be back in the future for sure."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,everything was good

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool airstream. Great and easy for a short stay
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! We LOVED this spot in the beautifully appointed new Airstream and the hosts couldn’t have been more supportive. They literally have thought of everything and it’s a lovely sweet spot, in a very quiet neighborhood and 2 blocks walking distance to wonderful hiking trails to overlooks of the Rio Grande gorge and mountains above Santa Fe. Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend a stay in Keri's place. The privacy, the views, and the town of Española are perfect for a family stay. Our kids loved it more than we did (especially the loft)."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Was the perfect break during our roadtrip. Very clean and homey! Keri was a great host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the most charming air bnb interiors I have seen. Everything was tidy and the well stocked kitchen was a welcome addition.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Keri has gone above and beyond in providing higher end amenities in her Airbnb. Spotless inside and the front porch is super nice for checking email in the morning with a cup of coffee.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Keri's place was an absolute dream and we would book it again right away. Unfortunately we were only there for two days during our USA road trip, but we felt right at home and were able to relax superbly.
Just great and super cozy!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Keri’s place. It was clean and comfortable. I would love to stay there again.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Keri was very helpful providing the instructions before my arrival and also printed instructions on the kitchen counter. She also answered by questions immediately. Becaused it‘s in a residential area, there is no view per se, but the RV is super luxurious and comfy. The heating was a bit loud but didn’t bother us too much. Overall a very nice stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed in Keri’s place with our two pups. It was the perfect amount of space. Comfy bed, easy parking/navigation even arriving super late at night, and private location."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Keri did a great job with making the area feel private. It’s about 20-30 minutes to Santa Fe, easy drive there and back.
Keri was quick to respond and made checking in and area recommendations enjoyable.
The camper is very clean and Keri has paid attention to all the details big and small.
Would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again if ever in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. The place was so quaint and clean, perfect little pit stop on the way out from Taos. Easy highway access and secure location. We loved the mini chilis hanging and the fireplace. Thanks for a great stay! We’ll be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I full timed in an RV for 5 years and I can tell you they did some great work to make this place feel inviting and like a home. It was very clean and comfortable. I would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Keri's place was an absolute gem. It was close to all the attractions we wanted to see, it was very clean and looked just like the pictures. We enjoyed our stay very much and if she'll have us, we'd stay again in a heartbeat."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a Awesome time, easy access from the Main road. It was just what we needed to get away from Albuquerque for a weekend, close enough and just far away. This would also be a great place to stay just for a day passing through. Would love to go back again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I very much enjoyed my stay here. Keri was very responsive and friendly! Her camper is awesome and super cozy. One note for light sleepers like me is that when the heat turns on in the main bedroom, it was a bit loud but I moved to the loft and found that quieter. Overall, it was a great experience for a great price!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay! Our kiddos definitely want to go back!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place and a great host!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this stay for a quick little weekend getaway with my husband while we went skiing nearby. It was SO beautiful and quaint, showcasing a camper decked out beyond my expectations. It matched the pictures and more! Despite being right next to a house, it was absolutely private and I never felt like I was encroaching on anyone's space, PLUS there was a fence on the porch that made it feel like I wasn't next to anyone at all. We will definitely be back next ski season. Keri was responsive and so friendly, even with some unexpected things that popped up! If you were wondering if it was worth the price - absolutely and more."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"wonderful place, very clean and comfy"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute, super clean—exactly what we needed for a spur of the moment over night trip :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome little spot. There were only 2 of us, so it was perfect and so cozy. We loved the gated entrance. That made us feel safer. This place has everything you need from the kitchen to the living room area and to the bathroom. I definitely would recommend this spot and will definitely end up coming back. Thank you Keri!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We just had to take very short short showers if 2 people needed to shower with decent warm water before it got cold... other then that was a great cozy little camper.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This RV was one of the best stay I've ever booked in Airbnb! I loved everything about the stay. Keri was awesome to help everything, even small things, promptly. I will definitely be back soon."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here! It is so cute and unique, very well designed and decorated. It was very cozy and we would love to stay again. It even made us consider getting our own camper one day."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Keri's camper was a delightful find! It is more like a tiny home rather than a camper after all the work Keri has done. The interior is tastefully designed and decorated. Everything is spotless and looks brand new.
The photographs do the place justice. It is on private land and is peaceful and secluded yet near to a main road for access to various locations. My adult daughter and I had a restful and comfortable time.
Keri was most responsive and helpful! She even warmed up the trailer and had the electric fireplace working when we arrived so it looked really cosy and inviting.
We highly recommend this as a great place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Keri’s spot is absolutely adorable. Everything was clean and as expected. This was a very unique and fun experience. Thanks Keri!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Was a wonderful little apartment in downtown Los Alamos. The apartment was very clean and modern. I will probably rent it again in my future visits at the lab!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Furnished with everything we needed.
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment will do in a pinch, but cheap construction and noisy neighbors make it difficult to get a good night's sleep."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and Meghan's place is perfect in every way. Exactly as described, easy check in/out, and spotless. Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place very organized with everything you need!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very simple and elegant layout for a single bedroom place.
Very well taken care of and supplied.
Great location where you can walk to the nature center, restaurants, museums.
The tree outside the window sounds fantastic in the wind.
The bed is the best.
Needs an extra blanket for those who need that extra piece, layer.
Indoor air quality an issue for the chemically allergic as it is in most places. Meg made a good faith effort to help out with different cleaners before we got there. Very responsive.
Would want to visit again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,As listed. All went as expected. No problems.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and extremely well equipped.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Megan and Matthew included things that one normally would not expect: Cleaning supplies, shampoo, conditioner, first aid kit, cotton balls, q-tips and numerous other supplies that one would not expect. When I had a question, they responded immediately. The apartment has a lot of nice touches such as candles, chargers in the lamps, and plenty of information on what to do. The laundry room was easy to access and had commercial washer/dryers. The kitchen was well-stocked. They had a lot of staples such as salt/pepper, coffee, and cooking spray, etc. The apartment was well-stocked with paper goods. The bedroom has a very thick super comfortable mattress. I think it might even have been 14 inches thick. This is virtually unheard of in a rental. The complex is very quiet and conveniently located. This is one of the best units I have ever stayed. in. I would give it 6 stars if I could."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Quite and cosy!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place for a long-term stay. The hosts were respectful.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was perfect for my onsite work. My office was close and there was easy access to trails. The 6 bus also has a close stop which was perfect.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Nick's place for 3 months during an internship at the lab and it was perfect. The studio was fully furnished with everything I needed for my stay. I could not have asked for a better place! The kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, a french press, kettle, and utensils. A back porch shared with the nice tenants of the main house with beautiful views of the mountains."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice studio for a short time in Los Alamos. Pretty well equipped kitchen.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment is located near the national laboratory. It’s clean and comfortable to stay. Also, the host Nick is very kind. I would like to recommend this apartment for visitors to the lab. Thank you Nick."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is great value for the money. It's comfy, accessible and spacious. it place has all one needs to adapt to life in Los Alamos, and has exquisite views to the mountains. Another stand out is Nick's affable personality. I arrived the property in dire need of something to eat and Nick offered me a ride to the grocery shop. Thank you Nick. May your tribe increase!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place if you’re traveling solo and doing a short stint of work for the labs. Nick was a great host and went above and beyond, which was much appreciated. Will definitely stay here again if it’s available."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Just what I needed in Los Alamos! My stay was cheaper than staying at the hotels nearby. I knew I was going to be out and about for a majority of my trip, so staying at this studio worked out perfectly. The only thing left out of the listing is that the main house is directly connected to the studio. There is a door in the studio that goes to the main house. It's possible to hear sounds from the main house too. I didn't mind any of this at all, but it's nice to know what to expect in advance.
My only complaint was that at night the studio got pretty cold, and there weren't any blankets to bundle up with. During the day the studio was on the cooler side as well. There is no way to control the temperature of the studio, except for a tiny heater in the bathroom that didn't seem to do much.
Everything else about my stay was great! The shower was very warm and relaxing. :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Really enjoyed my stay and am coming back in a couple of weeks. Highly recommend this little casita to travelers and lab employees. Communication with the host was always very friendly, genuine, and helpful. Thank you for giving me a home away from home!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Super clean and had everything I needed. The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking utensils, pots and pans and even some spices and coffee!
It is a perfect spot for long or sort term stays! I am coming back in a couple of weeks!
Close to the Lab.
The two off street parking spots on a first come first served, but the other tenants in the main house were always very accommodating if I needed to drive down the driveway to load or unload.
Nick is very helpful, kind, accommodating, and understanding. His wife is a gem! Very pleasant couple. I look forward to staying with them again soon. Thankful to their warm hospitality. Highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is our “go to” place in Los Alamos if it’s available. It has everything one needs for a comfortable stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Clean, quiet, and comfortable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nicholas is nice host. He responded to our queries promptly and offer any help he hen needed.

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This simple little studio met our needs while our stay in Los Alamos - clean, secure, nice little kitchen, great location for us, and the host was responsive if we needed to contact them. A great value if a person is looking for an economic way to adventure and visit Los Alamos and the surrounding area. I plan to recommend this place to family and friends."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was clean and had all the necessities that I needed. I highly recommend this place!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nicolas's place has a nice view of the mountains. As advertised, it is a simple place with a nice bed, a table with a couple chairs and a couch; the kitchen has a gas stove and fridge. Everything was clean and worked fine - I did have a brief text exchange with Nicolas about how to get the room to warm up a bit. He was very prompt to communicate and help.
Although it is in a normal neighborhood with mostly chain-link fences, we got to see many deer up close as they were wandering through (including hopping over the fences). They were well behaved although not very afraid of humans."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect place to stay! it was clean and well maintained! I highly recomend staying here.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and excellent value. Hosts are very attentive to any communication about your stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"In a calm living area near downtown and golf cc, wonderful separate studio with a small kitchen with all we need and a separate bath. So, no complaint."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,I really enjoyed my stay at the Studio. Nicolas and Leticia were very responsive when I had questions or when small things needed attention. The view of the mountains right out the window is amazing and the deer visited the yard almost every day.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"although listing is accurate
the kitchen felt smaller and the bathroom seemed tiny and the main room felt bigger
didn't realize that patio outside our private was shared by 5 other people
very pleasant stay
very convenient"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely studio space--had everything I needed!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,came to visit family in Los Alamos and this place was only 5 mins away from their apartment. good location with street parking. very clean. very reasonable price. as advertised.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Location nice, several nice hiking trails within 2 blocks. Nicolas was quick to answer any questions and meet-up was smooth. We liked the room, kitchen well stocked., bed good. Area great for hiking or trail biking. Lots of restaurants, but not many open for dinner. Visitor center has lots of info. Due to COVID not everything was open but maybe soon."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This apartment offers a wonderful mountain view, a great patio with a nice table and chairs. The location is very convenient. The lighting in the living area is exceptionally good. Nicholas is very prompt and courteous with communication."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely place to stay, and a good location within Los Alamos. The apartment was cozy and the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. Probably not enough space for more than 2 people, but it was perfect for what we needed. Incredibly clean and well-maintained. There is no TV, which didn’t bother us a bit, but if that’s something you are looking for in a location to stay, keep that in mind. The only thing I can even think to complain about is that the shower head in the bathroom was extremely tall and hard to adjust. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay in a perfect location. The host was very friendly and was great at communicating with me whenever I had any questions or concerns. Not to mention everything was offered at a wonderful price! Definitely would love to stay here again and recommend this location for anyone visiting Los Alamos."
2021-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This is a cozy, little studio with everything you need. Very clean. The view is stunning. Nicolas is the best host. My husband and I would definitely recommend this place."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is very cozy!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice studio apartment-style unit with everything you need and no extra fluff. The space is minimalist-stylish, very clean and well-kept, and it's got a nice back patio and yard area that really expands your personal space. And the northwest-facing view of the mountains and Pajarito is quite nice - good for watching sunsets. The kitchen and bathroom does share a wall with a locked door and part of the ceiling with the main house it's attached to, so if folks are staying in the big house or in the northwest room upstairs, you'll probably hear a bit of their activity. But this wasn't an issue for us. Nicolas was very accommodating and quick to respond, and we had a great time."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This casita was incredibly clean and very warm and cozy. I appreciated how quickly and thoughtfully Nicolas responded to my questions and the check in/out process. This place has everything you need, and I felt very safe to stay here during COVID."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nicolas and his wife are amazing people! They made sure I had everything I needed and checked in with me to make sure things we ok. There place is very cozy perfect for a long stay or a weekend get away I would most definitely recommend this property!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice Airbnb in a great location. Nicholas is responsive to any of your needs and the place is exceptionally clean. I highly recommend.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Things were exactly as advertised. Quick and easy communication with host.
2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the place is clean and comfortable. If you are sensitive to noise, you will probably not be happy. I had to sleep with earplugs and white noise playing because of the noisy neighbors who are in the attached room next door. If you like to sleep in, you might want to skip this one. The curtains are very thin and as soon as the sun comes up, it is very bright in there. The front door has a window that looks straight on to where the bathroom sink is. Anyone who is tall can look in and see a guest walking around with just a towel, which is kind of creepy. You can deal with this by bringing a bit of blue painter's tape and a trash bag to cover up the window. Despite these issues, the property is comfortable and a very good value. Much better than a motel!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient and quiet location. Clean and as described. Had a perfect stay, and was a good alternative to hotel (as this was a business trip)."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice studio. A zillion times better than staying in a hotel for a week long stay."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean, and in a beautiful area for hiking."
2019-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Spent a few months here and found it to be a pretty nice place. Some people may be sensitive to the small amount of noise and cooking smells which can permeate from the adjoining house, but those were barely intrusive (simply turning on the fan would mask the noise) and not a nuisance. Obviously this will depend on the tenants in the house, and one could confront them if it becomes too much of an issue. (They are typically post-docs who are quite friendly and understanding.)
Nicolas and his wife were respectful and courteous hosts during my stay. They responded quickly when needed, but there were so few issues (I think 2 during my whole time?) that it likely wouldn't matter if they were not so attentive."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute studio, very private and comfortable. I had one little issue right there and the hosts answered right away and took care of it. Would stay again."
2018-12-01,3,Stayed about a week,"This is a bright, clean apartment for those that need a temporary place to stay with more room than a hotel. The apartment is simple as advertised and was a great value for lodging in Los Alamos."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place worked out perfectly and was a great place to stay while transitioning for a move.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is in the perfect location for exploring Los Alamos or spending time in the area for any reason - centrally located! The room is quiet and private - and comfortable!! Nicolas welcomes us with great info about the area for our upcoming relocation... thank you!!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicolas was very fast with communications and was able to meet us at the apartment immediately even though we arrived in town sooner than expected. The apartment was clean and comfortable and worked great for our weekend visit.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A quite, clean, and well welcoming place. Totally suggested for anyone!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceptionally clean and comfortable.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicolas’s place was very cute and efficient. Everything was clean and bright. The location for what we needed was just perfect and the view was amazing as well! I’d for sure stay again if I come back to Los Alamos.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a very nice, comfortable space for an extended stay of several days. It is in a good location, and is near to a couple of the Atomic City bus routes, so access to the main part of town or the Laboratory is easy. There is relatively easy walking access to some of the trails in town (~3 minute walk) The view from the patio outside the front door is very nice, with a good view of the mountains. I would definitely stay here again."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Central location, clean, quiet. The little kitchen was all I needed, and there was ice in the freezer. I would stay here again!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend Nicolas's place if you're staying in Los Alamos. It's clean, quiet, and a very functional studio apartment. Nicolas also responds very quickly, and answered many of my questions about the area."

2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicolas’s place was great! Cute and clean, and a great location in regards to the center of town as well as the National Lab. We enjoyed it!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nick provides an outstanding space for travelers on an extended stay. It is great having a kitchen so that you don't have to eat out all the time! This is a unit attached to a couple of other apartments, but seldom do you hear the other tenants. The neighborhood is pretty quiet too! We enjoyed the mountain view!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed in Nicolas's apartment recently (March 9 - 17, 2018) for the first time. It is impeccably clean, with nice furniture, appliances and a clean up-to-date kitchen and bath. The bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet, easily accessible and close to everything in Los Alamos. The weather turned cold a couple of days while we were there with a little snow, but we were very cozy. The apartment was private and equipped with everything we needed for a 9-day stay. Nicolas was easy to communicate with prior to and during our stay. We certainly will book with Nicolas on our next visit to Los Alamos."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nick and Leticia’s space is cozy and easily accessible. Quiet neighborhood, but just off one of the main routes. We appreciated the well-appointed kitchen with pots and pans and cooking utensils. Nice patio outside with a view of the hillside. Response time was super-quick. Thanks for a great stay!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicolas' place is awesome. It's clean, and convenient. I like the kitchen best! Nicolas himself is the best landlord I've met on airbnb. I would recommend this place."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are very responsive and easy to communicate with. The apartment was comfortable and private. The kitchen is well equipped. Overall, it was a great Airbnb experience."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place had all the kitchen tools you needed and all the amenities were great! I was in a great location and was a cozy place. We had a great trip and experience with Airbnb staying here! Loved the hosts.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really loved this place, both in terms of the space itself and the hospitality shown by Nicholas and Leticia. The location is also very convenient and it's in a quiet neighbourhood. The apartment was very neatly organized and clean. The only thing I'd recommend is getting a few more amenities such as an automatic coffee maker etc. (though there was a manual coffee press in the apartment). Overall, I had a great time in the apartment during my month-long stay there."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is so far my best experience on Airbnb. The place was very clean and property well managed. Meeting arrangements, etc. were painless and the place was very accessible. Nick's place will always be my first choice when visiting Los Alamos."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicolas is a great communicator. His space is very comfortable, with a great bed."
2017-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This was a great little place to stay in Los Alamos and well worth the price. Nicolas and Leticia were very fast to respond about any issues. The kitchen is a little lacking in some useful tools, like a cutting board, bread knife, and toaster oven. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a good hiking trail nearby. If you need a place to stay in Los Alamos, this is a great choice!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nicolas' place has everything you need for a confort stay in Los Alamos. It is spacious, quite, and comfortable. You'll really feel like home. Nicolas and Leticia are perfect hosts, they are always available and will make sure you'll have everything you need."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily was an amazing host. Very nice, comfortable accommodations with the feel of camping, but a little more luxury. Loved the clear dome with view of the sky. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay in the cozy yurt! This was a unique experience and we enjoyed the ease with which we could get out and adventure. The bed is super comfy and we enjoyed the privacy. We definitely want to come back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a fantastic stay! Emily went above and beyond and had amazing communication. Great location and a super fun experience!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed with Emily's Airbnb in the midst of some very intense travel plans, and I loved how tranquil it was. Firefly lights and lanterns give a dreamy feel, and thoughtfully placed amenities felt so welcoming. Highly recommended, and I'd definitely stay again. If I needed anything, Emily was super responsive. I'd never been in a yurt before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I can see how the cloth/curtain design reduces outside noise while high ceiling and controlled port up top helps manage climate to some degree. It was really a highlight of my travel, thanks so much for a great memory ♥️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A truly fantastic stay! Such hospitality and so many thoughtful touches in the space. The yurt was clean and comfortable, and stayed cool in the summer weather. The outdoor bathroom and shower worked great and the shower was such a relaxing way to start the day. Emily was great with communication, and checking in and out was smooth and easy. The neighborhood is quiet and despite being in a backyard, the yurt felt very private. Lots of hikes nearby which was perfect for the dogs. A stellar experience!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique place and decorated very cute.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb is so cute and comfortable.Hosts are really kind and friendly. Thank you so much :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and cozy yurt for glamping! The weather was hot in the day and cold at night but fortunately there were fans and warm blankets/bath robes. Just FYI if you get cold easily it's best to shower before it gets too cold at night.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, quiet and comfortable. Great location to explore this part of New Mexico."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in the yurt. It is really like glamping, with plenty of amenities like a coffee maker and lots of water. The area was gorgeous, and we spent the day at Bandelier. Be sure to read about the bathroom situation before booking but don’t let it scare you off: this is a great place to stay. Oh and the shower was excellent, lots of hot water."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The yurt was super cute and cozy! Everything was clean, including the outdoor toilet and shower. Emily provides clear instructions for everything from check in to how to use everything in the yurt. We’re definitely looking forward to another stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were not sure what to expect staying in a yurt but it was a wonderful experience! Wife said it was like we were glamping with everything the property provided us! The room is way bigger than expected and the property was nice and clean. If ever in the area again, we will go out of the way tonstay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Emily's Yurt is a fun experience. Emily is an excellent host. Located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Emily gave me great recommendations for dining and hiking locations. White Rock is great place to visit. Highly recommend it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emily's yurt was such a wonderful experience! My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our weekend there! The atmosphere felt warm and homey! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything good. Cody yurt!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we loved our stay at the yurt! it was so unique and very well-decorated and cozy as described. Emily's notes and instructions were very clear and helpful and she was always responsive and available when we had questions or needed local food recommendations. there was so much thoughtfulness and detail with the amenities and pet friendliness of Emily's place. the bed was super comfortable too, my husband did not want to wake up and get back on the road. the stars at night were also abundant and clear. it was a cold night and the space heater worked wonders in the yurt. would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This unique stay caught my eye when looking for a place to stay in White Rock. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Emily and her place. It was so quiet and peaceful. There are great restaurants like the Pig and Fig Cafe nearby and the outdoor shower is amazing. It was 39 degrees outside and my morning outdoor shower was just the perfect way to invigorate me for a long day ahead. The bed is very comfortable and you will have everything you need in the cozy yurt! What a wonderful adventure.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely and unique place to stay. Emily is a fabulous host. Convenient to Bandelier National Monument, museums, grocery, and the Pig & Fig - local restaurant great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
The bed was like sleeping on a cloud or in a hammock, so soft and snuggly. The composite toilet was easy - after we read the instructions. Go, see, do in White Rock/Los Alamos it’s fun!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Emily's yurt was a cozy and charming place of retreat. She clearly communicates all the instructions for using the amenities of the dwelling and promptly replies to any questions. The setting was peaceful and private. Our first experience clamping was amazing!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emily's yurt was very cozy and decorated beautifully. The outdoor space was designed beautifully and felt very private.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was easy on check in. I thought the yurt provided a nice setting. The location was convenient. It was in a neighborhood setting so there was defiantly noise (neighbors, dogs barking, loud cars)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily was super kind and responded quickly to my questions even when I locked myself out😛. The yurt was peaceful and she had plenty of extras to make me feel at home. Thanks for such a cool experience!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I wish we could have stayed longer! I’m not super picky, but I thought the bedding was very comfortable and Emily had plenty of extra blankets available in the yurt. She had great hiking and food recommendations though we had a tight schedule and stuck to our plans. The only downsides are that when it is cold the hoses/water needs to be shut off so the pipes don’t freeze and the yurt can be a little chilly- however I didn’t really do some of the adjustments to the windows to make it warmer since it was nice for sleeping and the fireplace (not real fire) warmed it quite a bit. Emily was very responsive, so kind, and eager to help (one of my kids had a small issue before we got there so she hooked up the water for me so he could have a shower. She offered to help in so many ways, very empathetic.) I would definitely stay again if we come back to the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a super cute and cozy place to stay! Everything was clean and comfortable. I'm so glad we stopped here for the night along our drive!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved my stay with Emily! She communicated with care from the moment I booked, and I felt very welcome. There yurt is accessed from the side and has its own private area around it. The weather was not on our side but with the heater and the super cozy blankets we were very warm through the night. Emily really thought of everything, from motion sensor lights to warm robes. It is definitely more of a camping/glamping experience but if you think of something you need it’s probably already there. Also everything has a purpose and there are easy to understand directions for really everything which is amazing to have. The neighborhood was quiet and I only wish I could have stayed longer during a warmer time of year! Will definitely be staying here my next time in New Mexico."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily created an amazing place to stay! It was like a little cozy oasis from the chilly weather. She was amazing at communicating and had so many wonderful recommendations for things to do and places to eat!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,The yurt in the fall can get pretty cold but the experience is still worth it. You can see the stars and and the morning light through the ceiling! Beautiful!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was great! It really is cozy, and we had a wonderful time. Emily is a fantastic host, and location is perfect for a lot of different activities. The local grocery store was a blessing!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful little sanctuary. Next time we are in the area we will stay here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome space to relax and wind down. Hikes with awesome views 15 minutes down the road, and the yurt was super clean!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the uniqueness of staying in a yurt, to having a great private space to unwind and enjoy being outside, this is an AirBnB worth checking out. Great accommodations too; hot shower, easy access to restroom, comfortable furnishing."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Emily was an amazing host and the YURT was comfortable, cozy and such a fun experience. The communication was great, cool location for local trails, and next to a great restaurant. We loved our stay and will remember with fond memories!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Emily and her family were super welcoming; although we didn’t interact much, she communicated well through the app and offered text/call. The place was super cute and had all the amenities I needed. It would’ve been great to have a refrigerator, but my stay was short, and I didn’t need it. It was a perfect location with many hiking trails, and Los Alamos was nearby. If I am back up that way, I will definitely rebook. I won’t highly recommend it to my colleagues and friends traveling and needing a place to say for their hiking adventures."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome little gem of a hideaway located in the midst of White Rock, with a short hop away to some National monuments and trailheads. Yurt is comfortable with a bunch of how-to's scattered around the place to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Living here is an experience, bringing the outdoors into your living space. Said experience comes with a learning curve as you may be living greener than you may be used to.
If you are in the area, be sure to give this place serious consideration!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We throughly enjoyed our one-night stay in the yurt! It is so beautifully decorated, and the bed is comfy. Emily was great at communicating quickly when we had a question. We’d gladly stay again if we return to the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at this yurt. The check in and all necessary instructions for the outdoor shower/bathroom were extremely clear and useful. This Airbnb has a lot of nice small touches and was extremely clean. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was incredibly pleasant and comfortable! The yurt feels very private and safe and Emily was a great host! Arriving at the yurt we were immediately enamored by how cute the space is. We were greeted by a little goodie bag and welcome packet with clear instructions on how to operate the amenities and recommendations on local activities. The bed was very comfortable and the outdoor shower got hot very quickly. We were sad to leave and wish we could have stayed longer.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily was a fantastic host! The yurt was absolutely perfect. It was cozy and so relaxing. The cherry on top was being able to lay in bed and watch the full moon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily was a great host with excellent communication. We loved our stay in the yurt, it was very comfortable and I loved all of the amenities!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Had such an amazing stay. Emily was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely love to come back one day!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely adorable and private. This yurt is glamping at its best! Outdoor shower was hot & refreshing & such a fun experience, the LLBean bath robes make it complete. Emily does not miss a single detail! The little private pathway, the gardens & high end linens. Romantic & exotic vibe. A nice alternative between Taos & Santa Fe. Not many services in White Rock so stop for groceries/gas first."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost, the hostess deserves all praise and admiration. She asked about our children and specifically included activities and snacks just for them.
The yurt itself is one-of-a-kind and was a highlight of our trip that included staying at two other airBNBs.
The yurt includes a nice “patio” with a grill and fire pit for enjoying the crisp New Mexico evenings.
The interior is well thought out and is an absolute delight for lounging. The neighborhood is quiet enough at all hours to hear the birds singing in the mornings— a peaceful way to start the day.
All in all, 10/10 would stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So, we didn’t actually get to stay at the yurt (stupid Covid-19) but Emily was so responsive, easy to communicate with and helpful that I wanted to leave her a good review. Anyone who is that quick and helpful must also have amazing accommodations and we look forward to actually staying in the yurt next time we are in the area. It looks super cute and cozy in the pictures."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay with Emily! The yurt was so cute and cozy! I was also lucky enough to get rain in the evenings and fall asleep to the rain sounds! Such a unique experience!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place and hospitality. Wouldn’t hesitate to ever stay here again if we’re in town!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, cozy experience. Lots of privacy, but still attentive hosts."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,This was so cute and comfy. Me and my boyfriend came for only one night for our anniversary and it was just what we needed for a Lil weekend get away. we are definitely returning. The lil firepit was my favorite place to hang out. The outdoor shower was surprisingly hot and a must when here.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was an amazing place to stay. Really pulled out all the amenities needed for a week stay here and very easy to find. Very relaxing.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location and the way it is set up is more private than you might imagine it being. The yurt is beautiful and very comfortable. What a great atmosphere! The host warned us about the smoke from Cerro Pelado fire days in advance and offered to refund our money if we wanted to cancel, but we stayed anyway and were fine the whole time. Best place we have stayed in a while. I highly recommend it. Easy access to so many great places in northern NM, but also quiet and private."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Glamping experience! A wonderful spot to relax or to use as a home base. I loved not having to drive up from Santa Fe every day to visit family in Los Alamos. The camp shower outside was fun too! Wifi was strong, close to the delicious Pig & Fig cafe. Overall, it was a desert oasis!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Whatever expectations I had were blown out and beyond anything I could have anticipated. Simply gorgeous, serene, beautiful, peaceful and quiet. I always felt hosts were accessible yet respectful of privacy. This is literally an oasis in the desert. I am amazed at how this place is put together. Intricate detail, beauty, serenity."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily is a great host had everything ready when arrived! The set up is so cute yet so private we loved our stay with her!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily’s place is such a unique experience in a great location!! It was exactly what we needed to reset after several days of tent camping in the southwest.
Although it’s in a neighborhood we still felt like we had plenty of privacy to relax and recharge. We loved the proximity to Bandelier National Monument.
We’ll definitely be back next time we’re traveling through NM."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Emily's yurt was a comfortable and quiet place to stay while visiting the area. Emily was kind, helpful and available if I needed anything during my stay. The place is also walking distance to a market and the delicious Pig and Fig Cafe. If you plan on visiting the area then I highly recommend staying at Emily's yurt."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, one of the cutest Air BNBs ever! Super comfy and a sweet escape away from home. :) hehe hosts are so kind. They had everything we needed inside the yurt. Definitely want to make it back"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt is a gem in the mountains. If you’re looking for a cozy getaway with easy access to incredible hikes, Bandelier National Monument, and Santa Fe. The yurt itself is surprisingly large, with the couch and small table. We really enjoyed having access to the fans and the small heater. The little fire pit out back was awesome to wind down the evening. We enjoyed a nice shower and the bathroom was nice and felt private. Emily was a great communicator and we had all the privacy we needed while also knowing she was just a text or call away. Loved the little town of White Rock and enjoyed Emily’s recommendations for food and trails! We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the cozy yurt for our Spring Break getaway! We stayed with our two little girls and our pup. All 5 of us were comfy and cozy. The pull out bed was the most comfortable pull out I have ever slept on! Even though it was Spring Break, it snowed on us, but the little heater kept the yurt nice and toasty:) Our hostess was so accommodating and has done a wonderful job of making the yurt feel like home! It was very clean. It was an experience taking our little girls to use the compostable toilet! They were cold, but we survived! I wanted to try the outdoor shower, but didn’t get a chance because it was below freezing!! But the set up was very nice! Our little dog had a just enough space outside to do her thing. Overall, we had an amazing experience in the cozy yurt and hope to come back again sometime!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot, very cool ambience with a well-lit pathway and beautiful view of the night sky through the skylight window. Me and the dogs had a great, quiet stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this spot, which is spotless, well located and comfortable. Veronika is an excellent host who is easy to communicate with and very thoughtful."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and great view. Very peaceful area. And Veronika is always there if needed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Thank you for hosting us; it was a comfortable and efficient place for my purposes for being in Los Alamos.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful host and Airbnb! Veronika was very flexible and responsive. We loved our time in Los Alamos - highly recommend this Airbnb!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Veronika’s guest suite was absolutely perfect for our stay in Los Alamos! The mountain and canyon views from the patio were stunning. We loved being close to the neighborhood hiking trails and walking by the deer. The suite was very clean, well-equipped, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing getaway."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Veronika is an AMAZING host! She was friendly and communicative with me and my friends staying at her place. She even introduced us to some delicious Babovka ☺️ Would 100% recommend staying at her place…especially if you enjoy the outdoors!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Casa Bear! 🐻 Beautiful views and convenient to everything in Los Alamos. Veronika was an awesome host, so responsive, providing wonderful recommendations for things to do, and she even provided two snow discs for my kids to use while we were there! Casa Bear was comfortable with lots of thoughtful amenities like kids toys & games, coffee/tea, bottled water, lotion, lip balm and a welcome cake. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and with thoughtful amenities. Host is very communicative and responsive. Recommended!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casa Bear is a great place to stay. Veronika was a lovely host, responsive and accommodating. Casa bear has a stunning view just outside the door, the space was clean and we felt right at home. Everything we needed and a few special extras (homemade Babovka cake and water bottles) we will return to this great spot!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I absolutely LOVED staying here! The house was immaculate, cozy, and had all the comforts to make me feel right at home. From extra higiene products and fluffy towels to a fully stocked kitchen and coffee bar, Veronika really went the extra mile. She even included lots of games and brochures of fun activities and places to explore in the area. She recommended some great eateries as well. Everything about the place was great but my favorite thing was the outdoor seating area. I’d go sit out there every morning with a cup of coffee and just take in all the nature and beautiful scenery. Nothing like the smell of pine, the bustling sounds of birds, and the sight of mule deer passing by to really start your day off right! Her place is perfectly located for excursions to the Valles Caldera National Preserve (saw so many elk and a bear!), Jemez Springs, Bandelier National Monument, and let’s not forget Santa Fe. Veronika was the perfect host and I would absolutely stay there again!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay in Los Alamos. Quiet with a super view. Will return in the future.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little place in a great location. Great hiking area with views a short walk away. The place is very quiet and we did not hear any disturbances from above. My only complaint would be that there’s no air conditioning or temperature control. It cooled at night, but I prefer a cold room at night. Just a heads up if you like your ac!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED staying at Casa Bear. First of all, the setting is beautiful and peaceful. We drank coffee every morning on the patio listening to the hummingbirds and canyon wrens. The house was probably the cleanest Airbnb I've ever stayed at. The bed was also very comfortable. Last, Veronika has thought about the little things: I forgot to pack lotion and lip balm, which are really helpful in the dry New Mexico air, and Veronika had left a little tube of each in the bathroom for us.
Highly recommend a stay at Casa Bear."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Veronika's Casa Bear is a gold standard among Airbnb's. It is immaculate. It is not cluttered. We had a our own private patio overlooking the canyon. Veronika is a very genuine and warm host. She is responsive and accommodating. We definitely hope to return to Veronika's Casa Bear when we are again in Los Alamos.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a magical stay with Veronika and family! Casa Bear is spacious, clean and comfortable. The decor was fabulous, from the southwest furnishings to her phenomenal landscape photography. If you weren’t looking at the amazing view out of the windows, the beauty of the area was on the walls! The outdoor area was well-equipped and we enjoyed being outside watching the wildlife and birds. Veronika and her family were gracious and welcoming, checking in on us during the week but also giving us privacy. We felt right at home and it was hard to leave! We would return in a heartbeat to Casa Bear, and recommended it to others we met on our trip! Thanks for everything, Veronika!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Location was very good especially for the summer intern in LANL. Veronika was easy to reach and she was willing to help me a lot. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and caring family who have a lovely space available that is beyond peaceful. Amazing views of one of the canyons.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Veronika was an excellent communicator and an extremely thoughtful host. She welcomed us with some traditional Czech cake, had little snacks and treats, and we felt very at home there."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Greatvalue. Hosts have exceptional people skills. Would like to stay again. Will easily recommend. Much appreciated.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Casa Bear was a great stay while establishing myself in the Los Alamos area! A private location with a great canyon view, but still very close to LANL. The interior is clean, nicely laid out, and wonderfully decorated. Stunning photographs of local geological features, taken by the host, adorn the brick walls. Speaking of the host, Veronika was lovely to work with. I arrived a little early after a cross-country drive and she immediately helped me get settled. She was very welcoming and maintained contact throughout my stay to ensure I had everything I needed.
I’m locating to the area permanently, so won’t need to book again. But I would not hesitate to recommend Casa Bear to friends and family when they visit! 10 of 10!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful house and wonderful host. Quick, responsive and very accommodating!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The space was secure, clean, and exactly as advertised. It’s a quiet neighborhood in a quiet town (I live in this neighborhood and stayed here when we had maintenance on our house). Veronika was super helpful and easy to communicate with. I will definitely recommend this place to others!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a gem. Veronika was a great host. If you like quiet, and views and being near wonderful hikes his is the spot for you. We were only two people, but a family of three or four could easily be comfortable here. The bathroom is so nice and big, the table in the eating area was perfect for board games or setting up a laptop to work, and the bedroom was very comfortable. There's a view you can't beat right out the door with a couple of very sweet seating areas including a little enclosed fire pit. We did not have a chance to use it, but we could imagine a long summer night sitting out there curled up and enjoying the sunsets and stars. It's very close to a street called Los Pueblos where you can walk the entire street where each mailbox is decorated with a metal art-animal made by one of the neighbors. SO cool. It's also close to a hike called Deer Trap Mesa and other hikes too. Highly recommend can't wait to come back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described with lots of attention to detail and little touches to make it special. The neighborhood essentially located two lots of outdoor activities nearby. The host was responsive to any questions and gave great recommendations for things to do and local hikes.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Far and away one of the nicest and well provisioned Airbnbs we’ve stayed in. The setting is lovely, with views out over a canyon. The Airbnb is a very comfortable private one bedroom place with its own entrance on the lower level of the owner’s home. Veronika provided a drawer of snacks and a Keurig with a full array of drink options in the kitchen area. The bathroom had a great shower with soap, shampoo and conditioner dispensers. Veronika also included sun screen and lip balm for high, dry climate of Los Alamos. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful spot with a great deal of privacy and heavenly views. So much care and attention to details, with a full slate of amenities in both kitchen and bathroom, including sunscreen and homemade babka. A lighted gravel path helps you find your private entrance at night, and you can sit outside either with or without shade. Special requests are responded to promptly and with grace. Veronica is an excellent host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a very pleasant stay at Veronika's place. It's scenically located just outside the center of Los Alamos, with a direct bus to the lab (where I was working). There was enough space for us and our two kids. The place is nicely decorated (most airbnb's I've stayed at are more basic in that respect) and is well stocked with coffee, tea and snacks. Veronika is quick in communicating and accommodating, providing an air mattress (our kids sleep better in separate beds). I was worried about it getting too hot (there is no AC) but that is not an issue as it is on the ground floor and mostly in the shade."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Veronika is a gracious and accommodating host, excellent communication! This is a quiet neighborhood that is several miles from the main part of town. Could sit outside and watch birds."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, very private place with plenty of room. The private entrance gives a lot of ease for coming and going and the location is quiet and scenic. It also seems bigger than the listing looked. We would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casa Bear is an amazing place to stay in Los Alamos, the view is spectacular! Veronika definitely takes pride in providing her guests with a wonderful stay. We were welcomed with delicious cake. Casa Bear is immaculate, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathroom had many travel size toiletries at our disposal. The kitchen is well stocked with lots of coffee choices and many little goodies to enjoy. The outdoor space is perfect to enjoy a beautiful day in Los Alamos.
Veronika touched base with use to make sure all was well with our stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't recommend this apartment highly enough - it's meticulously clean, newly built so everything is crisp and fresh, beautifully appointed in the Casa Bear theme, has a private feel in the way the entrance and outdoor sitting area is set up, overlooking a sharp ravine. They have set it up with a very nice Weber grill and a high quality fire table, for socializing outside at night. Veronika add lots of personal touches to your stay, making it extra pleasant and welcoming, and is super responsive if anything extra might make your stay a bit better. We've stayed in lots of AirBnB's and this one is on our ""must-return"" list!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in Los Alamos. Veronika was very communicative and responsive to our needs. It was a very smooth stay and would definitely stay again.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I come to Los Alamos frequently, and we were able to stay at Veronika's for 10 days. It was such a relaxing and wonderful experience. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay for that long. The view was spectacular -- what a way to wake up in the morning! The beds were very comfortable and we had all of the amenities that we needed and more. We were surprised with homemade treats when we arrived, which added a touch of warmth to the welcoming. Veronika consistently checked on us throughout our stay via email to see if we were comfortable and needed anything. I would highly recommend staying here. It's definitely a hidden gem in Los Alamos!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Veronika accommodated all our needs in timely manner so that we could plan the visit well. Her thoughtful touch and preparation was better than most other super hosts. Even lip balm that we really needed due to the dry weather. I definitely enjoyed the canyon view from the outside table during the dinner. Comfortable bed, nice working desk, spacious place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casa Bear was a wonderful experience and exposure to Los Alamos. The apartment space was very welcoming, clean and well maintained. The entry to the space also felt very separate from the rest of the house which gave it a refreshing sense of privacy while still being part of the larger house. I would certainly suggest this space to anyone visiting Los Alamos."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views, lovely outdoor space, comfortable accommodations — this place has it all. Veronika went out of her way to make us feel at home."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The downstairs apartment where we stayed was cozy and well-kept. Veronika was a thoughtful host, leaving snacks and water, not to mention the toiletries including bandaids and an extra toothbrush, which came in handy! We enjoyed the area so much that we stayed an extra night. The location is great for convenient access to hiking at Bandolier and San Antonio Springs as well as downtown Los Alamos. Highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent experience! The place is super nice, very private and quiet location with beautiful views. The apartment was nicely furnished, everything that we needed was there, including TV streaming services like Netflix, HBOMax and Amazon Prime. The host was very friendly. Highly recommended!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an idyllic Casita! Angel was right there when we checked in and was most gracious. Everything was a cut above what was described and more. Huge trees in the yard and behind made for a gentle background ambiance of breezy comfort. Yard fresh eggs were an extra special treat. Truly a special place, unmatched in our travels anywhere. Thank you Angel !!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at Angel's casita. It's a very nice place and well provisioned. Relaxing on the patio was a treat. I liked the easy access to magical canyon trails and location that's close to downtown Los Alamos.
Angel is the best. She's extremely welcoming, generous and helpful. She has charming chickens with tasty eggs too. We'll be looking forward to staying there again. Thank you Angel."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this Airbnb. We were greeted by the host upon arrival. She was friendly and kind. She made gluten-free cookies for my husband, and stocked us with fresh bagels and gluten free bagels, along with additional breakfast items; fresh eggs from her chickens; and beverages. The place was sparkling clean, including the bathroom (which I’m always very picky about!). When we had an issue with the wifi, she responded quickly. Definitely stay here when you visit Los Alamos! Can’t beat it!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Angel’s Casita and again did not disappoint! We love the quiet and privacy and beautiful canyon views; comfortable beds, clean and well-appointed kitchen and bath, just everything is top notch. Angel is always so responsive and so sweet and we absolutely love the fresh eggs from her hen family aka the Fluffybutt Hut! Four of us were extremely comfortable and the new Serta Hideabed was the most comfortable bed we’ve ever slept on! Thanks for a wonderful stay during a potentially difficult time following the loss of my dear mom. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Angel's casita. The location is very peaceful and quiet, yet a very short drive from the downtown area, if you are visiting the Manhattan Project National Historic Park. The casita itself was very spacious and we loved the fact that we could do laundry on-site (which can be really helpful when you are traveling). Finally, thank you for the complimentary eggs and homemade cookies! Highly recommended (and we hope to be back!)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We always enjoy coming to Angel’s place. It is our home away from home while visiting family in the area.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this listing!!! The location is perfect - access to the mountains/recreational areas is just minutes away. It is PRISTINE, & I honestly don't think I've ever stayed anywhere as spotless and tidy as this casita. The bed was extremely comfortable, with a lovely view of the trees & canyon at the back of the property. Angel is an excellent host who has thought of everything! Some home-baked cookies, fruit & a kind note were waiting for me upon check-in. After a long day of driving and hiking this was most welcome <3 The kitchen was so well stocked that I was able to enjoy several slow mornings drinking coffee & enjoying fresh eggs from her family's beautiful flock. If you have time, ask about meeting them. They are so much fun to interact with! There is a binder full of local recommendations & Angel has plenty more tips should you need them. I am so grateful to have found this listing & look forward to staying here again. Highly recommend!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel went out of her way to make my stay comfortable!!! Nice touches like fruit, cookies, fresh eggs, juices and cream… very responsive to any questions. Super comfy bed…"

Thank you,
Patrice and Jim"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful, clean, and well stocked. The view of the canyon out the windows of the Casita are not to be missed.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel was such a darling host ! She greeted us like family, with such a welcoming smile. Her place was absolutely PERFECT for the location of Los Alamos itself, as well as access to Bandelier, the Valles Caldera, Jemez Springs, Gillman's tunnels and DOZENS of hiking trails - Las Conchas & Deer Trap Mesa being stunning.
The Casita was exactly as pictured , comfy bed - linens - all needed kitchen items for cooking our homemade meals, and a huge bathroom area with laundry capability allowing us to clean clothes and repack for the second wave of our road trip.
Angel stocked the fridge with juice, milk and butter along with some fresh eggs -- with the ADDED treat of homemade cookies and fresh fruit waiting on the table for us after a long day of mountain driving !! We really wished we could have planned to stay LONGER had we only known in advance just how beautiful the area was and how perfect this rental was for our needs !!

Hope to return one day :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As I sat enjoying a glass of wine and watching the sunset from the courtyard of Angel's Casita, a Taiko drumming ensemble started up in the canyon not far away. In the gathering dusk a string of little lights came on, casting a soft glow across the courtyard. ""This - this is perfect,"" I thought to myself.
The Casita itself is lovely, with clerestory windows, nice furnishings, a comfortable bed, a well-equipped kitchen, and a huge, immaculate bathroom with an alcove containing a washer and dryer.
Angel is a friendly, thoughtful, and very helpful host. She has created a beautiful place overlooking a wooded canyon. If you're planning a trip anywhere near Los Alamos and need a place to stay, do yourself a favor and reserve Angel's Casita."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita was perfect for our two-night stay. The house was very clean, more spacious than anticipated, and stocked with everything we needed.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a nice casita! I'll definitely stay here again the next time I need to overnight in Los Alamos. The entire Casita in a great location; nice amenities; great hosts; and all this for less than the cost of a local hotel room; PLUS fresh eggs from the chickens. Very Nice!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel is the nicest, kindest host ever! We felt very welcome and at home in the casita at the bottom of their garden.
The space is light and airy with high ceilings, and felt private, being well screened off from the main garden, with Ponderosa pine forests and a canyon on the other side.
We arrived to fresh eggs from the ""fluffy butt hut"", peaches from the tree, and home-baked cookies. The facilities were great - decent knives and pans, unscented laundry detergent, breakfast provisions, extra blankets, closet space etc.
We really liked the location. It is in a quiet and safe residential area between two canyons, but also fairly central to the attractions of Los Alamos. It is a 20 minute walk (half via canyon trails) or a 5 minute drive to the historical district."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel was very good host. So kind and so accommodating. The treat and breakfast items were so great! The eggs in particular were soooooo amazing!!
Thank you so much!

I definetely look forward to staying there again at the Casita del Cielo! Thank you very much for providing this space!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The best stay in Los Alamos I have had! Angel was a wonderful host, we loved the fresh eggs, baked goods and beautifully decorated casita.

Thank you for everything Angel!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angel is a gracious host and incredibly generous and thoughtful. The fridge and cupboards were conveniently stocked with essential items. The casita was an ideal size for two and very comfortable. It was the perfect location for a ski weekend and the backyard view was serene and lovely.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I've stayed in!
Angel was an amazing host. She answered all of our questions and provided suggestions for good hiking and places to eat and see nearby. We couldn't have asked for a better stay and was much better than any hotel stay we could've booked. There were personal touches that made the stay that much better.
The airbnb was clean, well maintained, and cozy. It's located in a convenient location for many hiking trails just around the home and ~30 mins from other great trails like those at Bandelier National Monument. Other things like Jemez hot springs and Santa Fe aren't too far either.
Highly recommend booking your stay here as you won't be disappointed!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a nice set up and extremely nice place. Angel is a super super host. I look forward to my next stay with Angel.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel's place was absolutely perfect for us. It was amazingly clean, private and had everything we needed, plus many personal touches of things we had no idea we would need, but appreciated that they were there...like a bathrobe and half n half in the fridge as well as the ability to make ice, cook our own meals, and do laundry.
Angel is a sweet and kind host and if you want local knowledge, she is happy to provide it. We took her advice on conquering Bandalier and some smaller local hikes, which made for two great days. Don't underestimate Los Alamos as it is rich with history and hiking. The bed was comfy, the patio was great and the views from the Casita are fantastic."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely delightful stay. So comfortable, pretty, and peaceful. Excellent attention to detail, and Angel has a true gift for hospitality."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Angel's Casita was a wonderful experience. The Casita itself is lovely, clean, comfortable and outfitted with everything we could want for our 4-night stay. I appreciated details like a good selection of pots and pans, a washer/dryer, and even a hair dryer and curling iron. Angel was tremendously gracious and helpful, answering our questions about hiking near Los Alamos and providing a generous assortment of breakfast items. We would definitely stay here again !"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely casita is perfect! Angel has truly thought of EVERYTHING! The neighborhood is beautiful, the views from the bedroom and kitchen windows stunning, and the location is central to all that the Los Alamos area has to offer (Bandelier, Valles Caldera, Santa Fe, etc). We wanted for nothing and were pampered with fresh cookies and fruit upon arrival, bath robes, fresh chicken eggs, oh-so-comfortable beds, a fully stocked kitchen for meal prep, and an enclosed private patio filled with potted flowers... the list goes on. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice casita

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel is the most gracious of hosts who has gone over and beyond to make the Casita very special. It is centrally located, yet quiet and peaceful with beautiful surrounding. Angel has set everything up perfectly, cozy and clean with all the comforts of home. The space is perfect for long or short stays and well suited for work and leisure travel. Don’t hesitate to book Angel’s Casita!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Casita de Cielo was fantastic! Hostess Angel provided us with everything we needed to make our stay pleasant and memorable. Beyond the cute private cottage overlooking a tree-lined canyon, she provided us fresh eggs from her hens, greeted us with fresh chocolate chip cookies, fridge stocked with dairy and breakfast items, a stocked K-cup coffeemaker and luxurious bath complete with full sized tub and rain shower head all combined for unbeatable comfort and value. Memory foam toppers for the beds made for easy sleeping! She was super accommodating of our party of four adults and a baby, and even provided high chair, Pack n Play and toys for our nine month old grandson. Five stars all the way through; you can’t miss with the Casita, if you can find an opening! We will be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel’s Casita is wonderfully light and warm and overlooks a gorgeous canyon with pine trees. The canyon rim glows red at sunrise. The stars twinkle at night.
Angel has the gift of hospitality. There was a large supply of coffee pods, fresh eggs from her hens, and she even baked us cookies. I didn’t expect to feel sooo welcome. Stay here… it’s beautiful and close to everything!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Angel was a great experience, hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Her hospitality is unparalleled, we enjoyed excellent breakfast food each day, and the casita was quiet, relaxing, and easily accessible."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time I have stayed at this Casita, and it truly is a gem. Angel is a perfect hostess with offerings of warmth and generosity with her homemade cookies, fresh eggs and delicious fruit! I travel often, and when I do, my two objectives are to find a place with comfortable beds and a quiet environment. This place offers both and much much more. My favorite time of day is looking out of the window in the morning when the sun hits the mountains across the canyon. It is just so magical and beautiful. I highly recommend staying here. It will not disappoint!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We all would love to live in your casita permanently. Your decor is great, the design is great as well. I will recommend your place to everyone I know. That’s a million."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super host! Angel is truly an angel! Her casita is nestled behind the main house but is very private, extremely clean, cozy and comfy with everything you need. Angel is extremely helpful, thoughtful and knowledgeable about the area. She provided fresh eggs from her chickens at the Fluffbutt Hut next door. The casita has amazing views of the wooded canyon rim where we saw mule deer and other wildlife walking by the windows. Our family plans on going back one day."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was amazing. The personal touches made me feel welcome and right at home. So excited that I found this treasure!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angel is a great host. She was there at the front to greet us as we arrived late in the evening and ensured we were settled in comfortably. She even made wonderful eggless cookies as we are vegetarian. The place is clean and well kept.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place! It is located right next to the Pajarito Ski area, just a 15 minutes drive. It truly felt like home, with all the nice details that Angel had for us, from fresh harvest eggs, to mini home-made cheesecakes! We loved our stay and fell in love with the Canyon view we had, a magic spot that will stay with us forever."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Angel is an amazing host and quick to respond to inquiries. The casita was easy to find, was super clean and comfy! Angel added extra touches that made our stay memorable! We arrived to find home baked cookies w/a cute welcome note, bagels, fresh eggs from her chickens other goodies she included like cereal and lemonade! We had a late arrival and Angel made sure we walked in to a warm casita with the lights on! I'd definitely rent this spot again when I'm in town!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Angel was extremely kind and warm; she is beyond superhost. The Casita was very cosy, well located and well equipped. In a nutshell, the perfect place for our stay in Los Alamos."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Big space for the money. The bathroom is super spacious too and the showerhead is fantastic. Breakfast bagels and cereal and whole milk were provided along with breakfast bars and tea and bananas and apples. Saved a lot of money on breakfast for sure making this an even better value than it already is. And it's super clean. Youtube and netflix are provided too. Just a super place to stay if you've got business in LA. Angel will tailor make it to your pleasure.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was really great ! Great location with great views from the windows. Angel was an amazing host ; excellent with communication and making sure we are comfortable and got everything you need. My family and I had a great time !
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angel’s casita was a perfect stay for our vacation in NM. The location is near Valle Calderas which is highly recommended for scenic views and for a quick dip in the Jemez hot springs. Angel is a great host and made our stay very comfortable. The well stocked fridge was a nice touch. She was very communicative during our stay and kept us informed of changing weather conditions. We definitely will be staying here again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay at Angel’s place. Comfortable accommodations, good communication, and thoughtful touches like breakfast items including fresh eggs from her own chickens. Recommended!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect and cozy spot to stay while on a business trip in Los Alamos! Angel is a wonderful host!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've often had very positive experiences with AirBnB hosts, and yet our visit to Angel's casita set new standards for fabulous hosting. The charming house behind the main house was perfect for us (2 adults, a 3 and a 6 year old). Angel had thought along with us about perfect sleeping arrangements for the little ones and the house was in perfect condition upon arrival. Everything we needed was there, including a laundry machine and a dryer. Angel checked in with us via texts and several times provided delicious food and snacks. It was absolutely amazing! Extremely warmly recommended."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay - even more comfortable than the first. The cottage is very light and comfortable. The goodies and breakfast items add a welcoming touch.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved this casita! Angel is a great host. The location is close to trails for hiking and running. Very peaceful and quiet.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, quiet, well-provisioned casita in walking distance to the historic town center. Angel was on hand to greet us and immediately provided us with recommendations for several hikes. We also appreciated the well-stocked fridge and bathroom - everything one could need was available. Truly a home away from home!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This property was awesome!!! Everything was perfect for our weekend get away. Angel thought of everything. The casita was comfortable and just what we needed to relax. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this property!!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, comfortable casita. Angel is a wonderful host."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and lovely host!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can't imagine a better play to stay in Los Alamos. Angel has provided everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay. On top of that she's a great host and gave us tips on the best restaurants and hikes in the area. If you're lucky enough to find Angel's place open when you're in the area book it before someone else does.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Angel's casita fit our family of four's needs in every way. Everything was in great condition and spotlessly clean - something I can't say about every place I've stayed in! The place felt warm and inviting from the moment we stepped in the door. Angel is a very gracious host and we felt lovingly welcomed. :-)
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel's place is one of the loveliest we've stayed in and we travel a lot. She has excellent taste and includes so many little high quality and healthy comforts. The space worked well for our group of 3 adults. We made good use of the kitchen and appreciated the fresh eggs from Angel's hens as well as her yummy home-baked cookies. After 2 weeks of camping, it was a pleasure to pamper ourselves in her sumptuous bathroom and be able to wash our clothes. Los Alamos is built on a mesa top riven with canyons and Angel's casita is very near a canyon rim trail system that is an incredible escape into another world. Don't miss it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel and her place are amazing! Great conversations, and the place has a nice view of the canyon. She shared fresh tomatoes from her garden, there were two delicious cookies waiting for us on arrival and it was so fun feeding her chickens. We would love to come back and stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Comfortable, quiet, very clean, convenient. What more could you ask for? A wonderful host, fresh eggs, homemade muffins? You’ve got it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay! Angle is a super nice and a very generous host, she happily introduced me to her chickens and patiently answered all of my chicken related questions . She was also extremely generous with recommending places to explore in the area forwarding me links to places I was interested in which was very helpful. The space is the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Angel has provided many lovely and practical touches to make it feel like home. I highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"In have not done enough Air BnB trips to tell you Angel is the best host they have, but I am fairly confident they have none better. I can't imagine how any human could have improved upon how she hosted us."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel is a very considerate and well organized host. We really enjoyed our stay - quiet and relaxing with more than everything we needed at the seperate cottage. We visited in August and really enjoyed hiking around the area then coming back to a clean and comfy place to relax. Angel shared her cookies, fruit, veggies, and fresh eggs! highly recommended place to stay in Los Alamos."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel's place was fantastic, probably one of the best places I've stayed in airbnbing. She's quick to respond, very sweet to talk to and offers an amazing stay in Los Alamos. Everything was clean, spacious and very comfortable. I'd definitely suggest staying there and I'd love to stay again if I find myself back in town."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most amazing Airbnb experience to date. Lovely casita on the top of a gorge with fresh air and quiet 24 hours. Every amenity and such a sweet hostess, made this one of our lifetimes most memorable visits."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay while visiting family in the area. Check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow. The casita was very comfortable, clean, and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked including a nice selection of breakfast items. Angel was very welcoming and responsive. It was the perfect place to relax and rewind during my stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying at an Air B&B and we couldn’t have asked for a better start. Thank you so much, we will remember our trip fondly!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The casita was an absolute dream! Beautiful, comfy and spotlessly clean, and the perfect location! Angel was an amazing host— she was extremely responsive and welcomed us with fresh baked cookies and fresh eggs from her own flock of chickens! She provided everything you could possibly need— including all sorts of goodies in the pantry and every pan and utensil you could need. Our family of 4 loved the view overlooking the canyon, hiking the canyon to downtown, hanging out and watching the chickens, and lazy naps during afternoon rain showers. One of the best AirBnB experiences we’ve ever had— we will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay in Los Alamos. The Casita de Cielo really lives up to its name.
We left early in the morning and came back in the evening, but Angel was available for whatever we needed. Angel’s communication is very good and her family is great.
Canyon hiking right out back; a great spot with short access to everything there is to see in the area; and there is a lot to see! She also includes suggested activities and dining in the guest packet.
The Casita is very clean, and the beds are really comfortable. Everything you need is there.
Choose this one!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Angel was an incredible host, and her home was perfect for our family. Everything was exactly as described, perfect accommodations for a family of four, beautiful scenery with canyons and hiking trails all around us. While I would highly recommend Angel’s home with or without children, it was absolutely a great choice for traveling with our kids. They got to meet Angel’s chickens, swing in the trees, and explore the playground down the street!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend for over 40 years and I have found ourselves in separate states. We met to catch up and also get a much needed R&R. This was a great place. We felt very safe. It is clean and comfortable. We both slept well. The kitchen accommodated our ability to prepare ""old favorite"" dishes.
The view out our back windows is lovely and peaceful. We could hear the chickens, but they were apart of the peaceful environment. We also enjoyed our fresh eggs.
It is 5 minutes from downtown Los Alamos, but our place was private."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and Angel is an amazing host. The casita was very clean and well stocked. Angel even provided us with fresh eggs from her chickens and home baked chocolate chip cookies upon our arrival! She really goes above and beyond to make your stay great. Communication was also excellent. I would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the Los Alamos area.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There are many things that I enjoyed about staying in Angel's Casita. The pictures on the AirBnb website do not do this place justice. It's located on the edge of a canyon, tucked privately behind the front house. My favorite part of my stay (besides the COMFORTABLE beds and amenities) was listening to the coyotes howl in the canyon in the evenings. I felt very far away from the hustle and bustle of life and was able to relax completely. I travel to Los Alamos frequently, and I will be sure to check to see if Angel's place is available from here on out. I highly recommend staying here!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Casita that had everything we required. Wifi was good as we worked a few days while there. Communication and help was excellent. Quiet residential street but you could hear the coyotes in the canyon behind the house at night, which was cool. Highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel and her beautiful home are both Airbnb gems. This is one of the best stocked vacation rentals you will ever find. Angel has gone above and beyond in her accommodation of guests; providing coffee, snacks, breakfast foods, and toiletries.
The property itself is incredibly scenic. Your backyard view is a natural canyon landscape with deer, if you’re lucky. Her gorgeous chickens are there to greet you in the morning. There are several good food places close by and best of all, you’re situated close to two incredible national monuments. All in all, this was one of our favorite Airbnb properties amongst many, and we hope to return someday."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay whether your in Los Alamos for a few days or and extended stay. Angel was wonderful to communicate with and took steps to make our stay extra comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful private place, great location, clean, beautiful!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need in a great location. Angel is a very accommodating host and attentive to details. I’d like to keep this place a secret.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you have the opportunity to stay at the Casita, please do! This host is not only super clean and professional, but also adds thoughtful touches that really go above and beyond. Great location with a fantastic view, and the most comfortable air bnb beds I’ve had the pleasure of sleeping on."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are able to stay here, you are so lucky to find this gem. Angel is an amazing, warm and thoughtful host. She covers every detail - even things you may not think of like a shower cap or ear plugs. The kitchen was stocked so well - even with fresh eggs from her chickens just outside the casita. The bed was lovely and the shower was glorious!
The sitting area outside the casita is wonderful - nature surrounds you! We saw many deer and the birds sang beautifully. Also, her beautiful and unique chickens were friendly and inquiring - we loved them.
I cannot more highly recommend a stay at Angel’s casita. I cannot wait to return!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amenities and special touches made this little place homey. Bed was comfy and rooms were spacious. Once Angel adds additional seating it will be over the top. It was a bit chilly this stay, otherwise we would have used the relaxing and peaceful patio more. We loved watching the deer along the canyon. Close to food and trails."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,The casita is very private and very comfortable. Angel provide so many extras to make our stay special. The canyon views are beautiful and we saw many deer. The hiking trails are nearby and you can walk for hours with amazing views. The location is close to shopping and downtown. We will definitely be making this our Los Alamos accommodation when we visit. Just hope it’s available!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This Casita was wonderful. It had a good bed, a big bathroom, great Wifi, and a well stocked kitchen area. Angel keeps chickens too and gave us fresh eggs, along with fruit, milk, cereal, coffee and other snacks. The Casita is at the back of their property so it is very private and when you look out your bedroom window you are in a pine forest. We saw deer and even a coyote one morning. At the front of the Casita there is a private patio with nice furniture. We have stayed in a number of Air B&Bs over the years and Angel is probably the most considerate host we have ever come across. We highly recommend this Casita and Angel and hope we will be able to stay there again the next time we are in Los Alamos."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent here a few days and we got everything we expected, actually got a lot more! The place is clean and cozy and provided everything we needed. We cook a lot and there was everything. But there was a lot more - snacks which my kids explored really quickly and ate all (sorry Angel). But also everyday ""breakfast stuff"" too, from butter, milk, juice and more. This was great that most of the things we forgot to buy were in our fridge ready for us. Kids really liked fresh made cookies. I must highlight Angel, our host, always warm welcome and asking if need anything, providing always something above. We enjoyed fresh eggs from their chickens (and even got resupply because we loved it). Our kids cried when we leaved, because they talked to the chickens every day. Did I mention that we had a close observation of deers right from our bedroom and kitchen? this was awesome! This place is nice, cozy, reasonably priced but the host Angel makes it few steps above. Will return or recommend to my friends. Thank you!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel's Casita is a perfect home away from home. It has everything you need, including breakfast treats! If I could rate it above 5 I would. It is in the perfect setting, close to town but nestled next to a canyon with spectacular views and wildlife. Angel makes sure the home is sanitized and clean and provided cookies upon our arrival. I stayed with my son who was relocating to Los Alamos. Angel made us feel welcomed, connected with my son after I left as he forgot something and offered to help if we needed anything. She is wonderful and I highly recommend staying at this Casita if you are in the area. Also Bandilier National Monument is a must!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I feel that their description does not do this beautiful little place justice! This little casita is tucked away on a canyon behind the host home. The kids were able to hike and sled back there and we saw tons of deer from our window. To top it off, Angel is so well prepared and hospitable that you want for nothing! 10-15 minutes from Bandelier and Parajito too!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Angel's place and we were very happy to go back! Our kids were excited to see their deer friends again stroll and lay in the canyon as they gazed out the back windows. A couple snow storms blew thru during our stay, which added to the natural beauty surrounding the casita. There is plenty of heating with the baseboard heaters inside and Angel was very courteous to keep the path clear of snow while making sure we could get out of the driveway if need be. She even let us know where the kids could sled on a nearby hill and let us borrow some sleds. Baked goodies and fresh fruit are provided as an added bonus while staying. I would recommend anyone make arrangements with Angel if staying near Los Alamos!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Casita de Cielo in Los Alamos is a perfect home when you're not home!
Our recent relocation to New Mexico led us to Angel's casita while our house was finishing construction in the area. It had everything we needed as a family of 5 with cozy sleeping accommodations, a great tub / shower combo, all the kitchen supplies necessary, and the most amazing views of the natural surroundings. Our kids adopted a family of deer that lived behind the casita above the gorgeous canyon view and watched them with wonder thru the windows. Angel's chicken coop also gave the kids a new experience that they loved as they got to interact with their new winged friends. The location to all the main parts of Los Alamos was also very convenient for us and the scenic, smooth 40 minute drive to Santa Fe is beautiful. Angel and her family were very welcoming and always prompt to address any questions or issues. Be sure to book this casita when you're in the area and if it's available!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The casita was perfect for my mom and I. We were comfortable with the one bedroom and twin bed in the living area. Angel was a great host. We enjoyed peace and quiet at her casita. We were not lacking for anything. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed and more! Highly recommended!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Angel is an amazing host - one of the very best Airbnb's ever. She went above and beyond to be kind (she shared her baby chicks with my little kids, she baked fresh cookies for our first night, she set out toddler plates and booster seat for us, and much more). The place is a great location, has an open bathroom, feels very private and clean, and has a well-stocked kitchen. Lots of nice ""extras"" like extra pillows, breakfast, parking spot, smart TV, and so on. Overall, just a really comfortable, perfect place!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I have stayed in so many airbnb’s and Angel’s casita is up there with the best. It has def. been one of the cleanest places we have stayed in. She is also an amazing host and goes above and beyond to make sure you have what you need! If you are ever in Los Alamos, please do yourself a favor and book with Angel. You will not regret it! We will def. be back again! :)"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great customer services
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angel’s Casita de Cielo is a relaxing oasis in the beautiful town of Los Alamos. The Casita is situated in Angel’s back yard among Ponderosa Pine trees and provides a peaceful retreat where you can watch wildlife right from the back windows! The bedroom was comfortable and quiet. The living/dining space has a comfortable pull out sofa, and Angel set up an additional portable twin bed so that my teenage kids didn’t have to share a bed - which they both appreciated! Even with both beds out, the living space was comfortable and roomy. Angel stocked the little kitchenette with eggs, milk, cereal, frozen pizza, etc. which made it so nice and easy to get the day started - or to just have something quick and easy in the evening. With all the little touches Angel has provided - food, board games, books, bathrobes - and easy hiking trails close by, it would be easy to just relax and enjoy, without ever having to venture out! Although, Los Alamos is a great town and the Jemez Mountains and northern New Mexico has so much culture and beauty to offer - it really is worth an excursion or two.
Angel is a fantastic and thoughtful host and we hope to return to the Casita de Cielo on future visits to Los Alamos!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here several times now because angel is such a great host and the casita is an amazing get away!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four came to stay at Angel’s casita in July and fell in love with Los Alamos, the casita and Angel and her family. The casita was perfectly situated facing pine trees and trails. We have seen deer out of our window every single day. The amenities were perfect for us. Comfy beds, kitchen with all necessities, bathroom with the shower that had an exceptional water pressure and even washer and dryer. Angel even provided some breakfast items! She was also incredibly responsive to my numerous questions and was a valuable resource to local trails and places to visit. Our car broke down once we got to Los Alamos and Angel had generously offered us to borrow her car to drive to the car rental place while our car was in the shop. How many strangers would do that? Just incredible family! We all highly recommend Angel as a host and the casita as a place to stay in Los Alamos. We are looking forward to our next trip perhaps in the Fall or Winter to enjoy different side of beautiful Los Alamos."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot begin to describe what a wonderful stay we had at Angel’s Casita. Our family stays at a lot of Airbnb rentals and sometimes the house is what makes it special and sometimes the host is what makes it special. In this case, both the house and the host made it exceptionally special. If you like looking out the window of your bedroom and living room and seeing a giant canyon with mule deer walking by, that is what you will find. The location is very close to everything and you can access hiking trails through the back door. Angel constantly made our stay so wonderful by checking in with us and even giving my daughter a birthday present as that is what we were celebrating on this vacation. She is truly one of the kindest people you’ll ever meet! I cannot wait to return for another stay."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying at angels place. It was just as great as the first time.

I can’t wait to visit los Alamos and this casita again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for a few days during our transition out of town. It was a neat and cozy place to stay while in between homes.

Angel is an excellent host and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is comfortable."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Definitely worth it. We enjoyed our stay. We are taking a scenic route from Fort Worth, Texas to Colorado Springs, Colorado. We arrived very late so I didn’t get to fully take in the environment. I woke up with sun shining through the window and amazing view. There was a local hiking park (4 mins away) that my kids and I went to right after I made breakfast with the food provided in their kitchen. We came back showered up and got going. Definitely will come back if we are in the area again."

The Casita was clean and bright with many small stylish touches. We were welcomed with fresh cookies and celebratory beverages, the beds were very comfortable, the breakfast items in the fridge were perfect (including homemade jam), and the washer and dryer came in handy. Angel answered our questions promptly or, in most cases, anticipated them which was very helpful. The entire experience could not have been better! Thank you so much, Angel!"

If we’re back in the area there will be no hesitation for us in staying at her place again. Cannot give her enough accolades for all the extra special touches she includes at her casita. She even noticed that I practice yoga and put a yoga mat in the place for us, then as we were leaving she came out and presented us with homemade brownies she baked after we arrived night before!"

You don't get much better than that!"

She and her family were very friendly, welcoming us when we arrived. I would definitely stay again."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Casita de Cielo is beyond expectations. It is superbly clean. The bed is most comfortable. The breakfast foods—fruit, cereal , oatmeal, English muffins, tea, coffee, juice and more, are a wonderful to start your day. It is very quiet and we feel very safe when staying here. Located on a canyon, the view is spectacular and wildlife such as deer can be scene walking behind the Casita. The kitchen is well equipped for any meal or snack you want to prepare. The bathroom has a spa feel and there is a washer and dryer, ironing board and iron, should you need to freshen your clothes. Angel goes the extra mile to welcome you and makes sure you have everything you need to make your stay comfortable. We make the Casita our priority when visiting our children in Los Alamos, if it is available. You won’t be disappointed!"

The home is comfortable, private, peaceful, and well-appointed. The best part: incredible views out the back windows of the canyon it’s situated above. We loved being serenaded by birdsong, and seeing deer meander by. Angel is a very welcoming host; she greeted us with warm cookies, and offered other goodies during our stay as well. The modern casita is well lit and its kitchen stocked with many essentials for brekkie and basic meal prep - much appreciated! Angel provided excellent suggestions about local restaurants and points of interest. We loved our stay here and highly recommend Angel’s place to others who travel to Los Alamos."

The casita itself is spotless, cozy and inviting and it truly felt that Angel had tended to every detail. My family and I really appreciated that Angel provided coffee, tea and breakfast foods as well as extra towels, soap and anything else that we needed during our stay. It is a perfect place for families and groups to stay and is only a short drive away from the museums of Los Alamos, Bandelier National Monument and a wide variety of trails and interesting sites. My family and I had a wonderful time during our trip to New Mexico and it is largely thanks to Angel and her kindness and hospitality!"

2019-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed. Far exceeded expectations from past experiences. Angel was great. If every Airbnb met the standards of Angels place, hotels would become extinct. Angel made us feel extremely welcome, helped with parking issues from the snowstorm, and went the extra mile for having fresh fruit on the table and a refrigerator and drawers full of breakfast items. This is a fully furnished extremely clean rental unit. Angel is obviously very proud of what she has and does to keep it that way.
Amenities included everything a hotel would offer and then so much more. Hospitality was amazing.
The price was perfect; not too much, not too little. Angels place is truly the best of the best of all Airbnbs. Angel is the absolute perfect host and deserves to be recognized as such."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If you are staying in Los Alamos and looking for a quiet cozy place, give this Casita a try. Angel is a great host and very responsive."

We hope to come back during our next visit to Los Alamos.
