2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, cozy home in a quiet neighborhood. Fenced in back yard with a table and chairs, lights around the patio. Full kitchen with everything you need. Not far from shopping and restaurants. Joshua is quick to respond. Not my first stay here and definitely not my last."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"3rd time staying here, it was excellent as always."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua kept us well informed. He let us know when the house was ready for check in and even brought in a welcome box that had been left for us on the front porch. Very thoughtful. We didn’t have any issues. We appreciated the snacks, coffee pods and tea bags in the kitchen. Everything was clean. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. Beds were very comfortable. Would stay there again. Unfortunately because of weather we were not able to enjoy the back patio."

The hosts were very responsive and took care of me very well. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb calls Swan House: “One of the most loved homes on Airbnb…a guest favorite” with a very high rating of 4.96 -- and once you visit it’s easy to see why! Joshua & Gillian have poured a lot of their time, talents, and energy into this home in midtown Jackson (close to the hospital). It is, as others have said, a cozy two bedroom home full of wonderful decorative and thoughtful touches. A lot of care has gone into making this a special place. They are also very accessible and easy to communicate with regarding any house questions. It was exactly what we needed for our weekend in Jackson for a family wedding."

- Loved the luxurious, extra thick fluffy towels I enjoyed so much!
- We used the hot water tea kettle every night and made tea. We love tea in the evening. I’ve never seen one of those in an Airbnb.
- and really enjoyed the mini chopper several times too and crock pot!
- All the window treatments are very nice great having blackout curtains in the bedroom.
- also, of course we loved the fire pit only wish we could’ve used it a couple more times just had that one evening but it was great! Super backyard… could have used a leaf blower since it was fall when we were there just to blow off the patio."

A 12 hour drive turned into a 15 hour drive due to an issue with my daughter’s car and I was thankful that the property was well lit so I could back a U Haul in properly in the dark. When I walked in I was so pleased with how nice this home is, made the end of a long day such a relief! Loved the book with all the details on the house, the recommended restaurants and clear instructions for check out, we were exhausted and appreciated all the information at hand in one book. The beds were so comfortable! My only regret is not being able to stay longer."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Joshua’s communication is the best! He was very fast to help answer questions we had. He even sent over a new shower curtain when it was pointed out the curtain was very dirty in the bathroom. Overall the house was an older home but had a renovated kitchen and mudroom, and the security monitor made us feel safer in the area the home is located in. Joshua is a great host big thank you to you Joshua!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a fantastic home for a long stay. The location was perfect, 2 minutes from the hospital. It was comfortable and quiet. Since I worked a mid-shift until 11P, the dark curtains allowed me to sleep soundly as late as I needed. Great kitchen and I loved the gas stove/oven.
Joshua is absolutely the best. There were a couple issues that came up, as they will especially during a long stay, and Joshua had them taken care of immediately. However, he always had repairs or yard work done according to what worked with my schedule.
I honestly don’t think I’ve ever had a more comfortable and welcoming stay.
I hope to be back! 🙂"

Only minutes from the Farmer’s Market with huge, amazing Amish donuts and delicious pizza from Rockn Dough. This house is BEAUTIFUL inside. The rooms are spacious, uncluttered, and beautifully decorated! The back yard is private and has an amazing fire pit. We had great family time here. Nothing we sought was missing - a lighter, Saran Wrap, kindling - you name it. Loved reading on the porch swing. Why oh why did we learn about this place at graduation instead of freshman year?! BOOK IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a gem in Jackson. Beautiful home. Jeffery was responsive and helpful. Our family of 6 felt right at home. Kitchen included kids cups and dishes and all items needed to cook a great meal. Close to downtown and shopping. We will be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely stunning and pristine home. Looks just like the pictures. I've never stayed at a more well stocked kitchen airbnb. Jeffrey was a pleasure to communicate with. Lots of cute little touches around the home that made it feel just like home. Thanks Jeffrey for a great stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is so nice. Everything feels nice and new in this home. So much so, it felt like we were the first patrons to stay at The Gregory House. It is a charming home with everything you might need for an extended stay. It is clutter free and spacious. We enjoyed the fire pit out back and the swing on the front porch. The kitchen is fully stocked, and the washrooms are nice and clean. It was very close to downtown but nestled in a quiet neighborhood. We will keep it on our list of places to stay when we're in Jackson.
We did not communicate with Jeffrey much after receiving his check-in instructions because it was so easy to get in the home and get settled. The Gregory House information binder in the house was beyond any other airbnb info we've ever received. If we had not already been familiar with Jackson, it would have been a great guide for us.
Excellent job setting up this airbnb, Jeffrey. The snacks were a nice treat, too! Thank you for hosting our family!"

She is really organized, and provides detailed instructions; it makes it very easy to utilize the space, plus provides ease of check-in and check-out. Her place is spotless and beautiful also.
We arrived late and were weary. She waited up and kindly gave us a call once we had arrived to make sure all was well and we didn't have any needs. The beds were sooooo comfortable, and we rested well. It is also quiet and peaceful there.
Unfortunately, due to schedule constraints on our end, we were not able to explore the area a lot, but would love to come again if we are able!"

Nice place and would stay again!"

There were extra necessities (like shampoo, toilet paper, etc.), comfortable beds with extra blankets, and a welcoming living area with local magazines and a tv that included streaming options. As another guest mentioned, the shower is great—amazing water pressure! Christine also responded quickly when we needed something and graciously helped when we needed to change our reservation. We highly recommend this home and would definitely stay there again."

For any future visit to the area, I will definitely want to revisit this lovely property."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"what a wonderful oasis. wish we had more time to stay and explore what Jackson had to offer. we stopped overnight on travels from NC to OK so arrived around dusk and departed early morning. it was soooo much nicer than a hotel. the gated driveway leading to the private guest house was easy to navigate, even in the dark. the guest house had everything we needed and felt comfortable. I commented to my husband that this was much nicer than a hotel room after a long day of travel. I was thankful Christine permitted a one night stay. when we had some questions about the WiFi and TV, Christine was quick to answer our questions and we were successful in watching the end of the Cubs baseball game. I would certainly stay here again and recommend to others. it felt like a little slice of heaven. thank you."

It was easy to find, directions were great, guest house was very clean and everything was as she listed on the site. I enjoyed my 9 days at this guest house very much. My trip was to visit with my family and their ""newborn baby boy"" along with my current grand daughter. Not wanting to be ""under foot"" with Mom/Dad and new baby all the time, this guest house provided me with the ""perfect"" opportunity to be close to my family and to rest and relax in the evening after spending wonderful time with my grandchildren. I highly recommend her place. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. I will certainly be staying here again on any trips to Jackson, Tennessee."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb property. Adam was great at helping us understand how the process works and keeping us informed every step along the way. We will book other locations because it was nicer than staying in a hotel for a few days.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay at Adam’s Airbnb.
Pros: Adam was friendly and offered good local tips; beds were super comfy (I had the upstairs room and slept amazing); the house was clean and had great parking options; the area felt safe; loved the decor - simple and clean and not cluttered; good AC - the house stayed super cool even without the AC running; good location for everything we were doing on our trip; basket of goodies and welcome book were great; the pictures were accurate and the three bedrooms were a really good size.
Cons: nothing major! It could use some hand soap in the bathroom upstairs and maybe some large pump bath washes in the showers (little ones were provided but not enough for multiple people for a long weekend so bring your own); wooden gate sticks so have to push hard to get in; it is an older house which gives it a ton of character but can be loud as people walk around if others are sleeping.
Overall I would definitely stay here again if I were visiting Jackson!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house felt like a modern cottage in the woods. House is surrounded by large and in charge"" trees, loved it! House was clean and just as is in the photos.

The winery that’s 20 minutes away was a high light, century farm & tasting macaroons and matcha at sprinkle me sugar was nice too!

There is space in the backyard which is gated that the kids took full advantage of. It was also close to some really good restaurants. We ended up getting sushi from Rock n Roll Sushi and Hibachi and it was absolutely fantastic and was very close. If you have littles, the house is located on a busy intersection. This didn't bother us because we have sound machines for the kiddos, but I did want to put this here just in case anyone else is thinking about staying with little kids."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thought and care went into this immaculate home. The AC worked great around the house.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed at this AIRBNB to spend time with my mother. She loved the house so much we spent the entire weekend in the house. Everything I needed to cook breakfast and dinner was in the house. Had my choice of eating on the patio outside or spacious dinning area inside. This will be my spot when traveling again to this area.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s a fantastic location, easy to find, and very clean. The very large backyard and ample space in the house make it ideal for large families with kids."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a family weeding in town, looking for a place close to family and church affordable and clean and this place had everything we were looking for . the location was very convenient, the pictures match the house very comfortable and it feels like home
Very recommended, large space, huge yard and the house is in a nice and quiet neighborhood
We will stay there again"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and house. Plenty of room to spread out. Enjoyed the ping pong!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks I really enjoyed my stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed there for 12 days to visit family. It is a super comfortable and spacious home. The home has plenty of games, you will never get bored if you have to stay in because of a rainy day. It is located near plenty of shopping centers and restaurants. Misty is a wonderful host, she answers you back very quickly. Thanks Misty, your home is a little piece of paradise!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This has been my best experience with both the host and the property. Totally accurate description. Host was top tier and professional. We were a 4 man work crew in the area working long hours. House exceeded our ability to relax, cook, eat, enjoy group time, as well as private space for
Each team member. Very comfortable beds and quality furnishings along with all amenities described. It was a great location, very close to everything that you could possibly need, and in a very nice neighborhood. Also very convenient to highways, which was important for us.
I would stay here again and will consider any of Misty’s properties first, if back in this area. Cheers!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. It is a nice home. It has a big back yard. Very spacious and a very welcoming home. The neighborhood was quiet and very enjoyable.
Thanks for sharing your home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful, large & was pet friendly. The location was great & close to everything. We will be staying here each time we come if it’s available."

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Misty is a great host.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful spacious home
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,location was great and owner was very helpful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay. Very neat, clean and spacious. Huge fenced back yard. Nice neighborhood and close to everything. Didn’t deal with Misty much because we didn’t have any issues at all. She did touch base before we arrived and was very quick to respond to one question I had at checkout. I’d highly recommend this property."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was very toddler friendly for our family, which was awesome! The 3 one year olds loved the play kitchen!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great neighborhood, great place, awesome backyard. We loved the stay."
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our use. Clean and outfitted with everything we needed and more. We were in Jackson for one night for a wedding and this was perfect for our family and my father. The only awkward thing is that the 4th bedroom appears to be a converted dining room with a chandelier hanging in the middle where adults can bump it with their head and there are two doorways into the room with no doors, so no privacy. It really is more of a common space with two twin beds than a fourth bedroom. We would stay in this house again when we visit family in Jackson, but it would be good if doors were installed and the light replaced with a flush mount fixture in that 4th bedroom."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My stay was awesome a home away from home. The pictures does no justice. The house was a beautiful oasis. I felt at home until reality set in as vay-cay came to an end. I loved the layout of the home, patio area and decor. Complimentary items awaited us. My family of 10 enjoyed their stay as well and home accommodated us all. The home is close to any and everything you can think you will need. Will book again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was an absolutely beautiful home. We were very comfortable and it had all we needed. Definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Good
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Call it luck or just good pocking, but we were in town for our family reunion and the location of Misty’s place was perfect for ever event of the weekend! The huge back yard was great (only in the daytime). Lights in the backyard would enhance the space."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This Airbnb is very quaint and private, and quiet. We appreciated the easy check-in and found the house to be extremely clean which is very important to us. Perfect house for a couple or 4 guests, although we only rented it as a couple. Bed was comfortable but we always bring our own pillows when we stay. The house was 7 minutes from our meeting locations. We would stay there again if we had business in Jackson."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The lace was very clean and comfortable for my husband and I.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joey and team were wonderful hosts. They were promptly responsive and proactive in solving a minor technical issue we ran into. Would definitely recommend this place - it was very accurately described. Enjoyed my stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A cozy spot to stay and only a few minutes away from different shopping areas and restaurants! The place was very clean and we loved being able to travel with our dogs with a secure fence for them to have safe outings!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our time at this unit. It was clean and in a perfect location for our visit. There was a private entrance and patio. Beautiful kitchen area that was fully stocked. Check in was easy and the host was very responsive. We will definitely consider staying at this unit for our next visit to the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place for my husband, five year old and me. Nice peaceful location in a cute neighborhood. My son loved the coloring books and toys. I loved the fenced in backyard area for end of day quiet downtime. Perfect for a weekend trip to visit family. Will be back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and cozy. Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a safe, clean and comfortable space."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joey,Katie,and Amanda are amazing hosts! I’m grateful I was able to find them!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very cute but the directions had us on another street. We finally found it and were impressed with the living room and kitchen - very well decorated. The bedroom was large but the bed was VERY soft and not supportive. Having a washer and dryer was convenient but they were located in the kitchen and very loud. I tried to hang a hand towel on the hand towel holder in the bathroom - the hand towel holder fell off of the wall. Compared to other Airbnbs that we have stayed in, the cleaning fee was extremely high. These are just a few items that might matter to other travelers. We liked the two sinks - one in the bathroom, one outside of the bathroom. We also appreciated two TVs. The fenced-in lawn was great for our little dog. Unfortunately our stay was cut short by a family emergency but we appreciate the one night."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joey's home was exactly as described and as the pictures show. It is a small house tucked away from the main street. It was bright inside with lots of windows. The kitchen is well equipped for any kind of meal prep. A nice touch were the provided K-cups for the Keurig. Thank you! We were blessed with perfect fall weather and have spent all of our time outside on the private patio. The party lights are a cute accessories and make you feel welcome when coming back to the house later in the evening. The location was great for us. Close to I-40 and Union University, where our son attends college. The big TV in the living room was perfect to watch some football games. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. We can highly recommend Joey's home. The communication with him and his wife was also easy and prompt. Thank you! We had a great weekend. We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, I would stay again!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed with Joey for an extended trip during which I was working from the AirBnB. It was quiet, cozy, and everything we needed. The kitchen bar worked great for me to plunk my laptop down on and work from. Great little sitting area outside with a tall privacy fence. Very comfortable king-sized bed. We got a little confused finding it when we first came in because it is tucked back a little, and the few times I ordered delivery they also had a hard time finding it, but not a big deal. We would definitely stay again if we are ever back in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great host would definitely stay again if in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would recommend felt right at Home! Looking forward renting the place out again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, definitely would stay again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joey's place was clean, with a beautiful, WELL-LIT seating area outside. We felt safe and actually didn't realize how close we were to family! It was very peaceful! I felt like we overpacked as they thought of everything you might need, down to air freshener in the bathroom, extra blankets, Ziploc bags, and an ice cream scoop used to celebrate my birthday that Thursday! It's the little things. There was one issue with check-in, but we counted that as a user error, (lol) but Joey and his team were responsive and apologetic anyway. We look forward to using this place again when we return home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much.
This was my first time renting an Air B&B
and the experience was pleasurable and painless!
Would / Will recommend to others coming to Jackson Tennessee!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Joey’s place was very enjoyable. The house was located in a quiet neighborhood yet close to main roads, restaurants, and stores. The outdoor area was perfect and private with a bistro table.
The king-sized bed was comfortable for sleeping with pillows that provided the right support. The large-screen TV in the bedroom was perfect for watching movies and relaxing. The en-suite bathroom was well-equipped with towels and toiletries. The extra sink in the dressing area was much appreciated.
The kitchen included all the cookware and utensils to create a meal. The appliances were in new condition. The front-serving ice and filtered water dispenser in the refrigerator were an added bonus.
The hosts were very responsive and helpful.
I would recommend this location for a single person or couple wanting a lovely, private place to stay in Jackson."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay! It was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed and more. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We very much enjoyed our stay. It was not a regular vacation for us, so the place provided a great refuge and home away from home for ourselves and our pets. We plan to stay again in the future if it’s available.
The only minor issue I would mention is that the neighbors’ dog came through the space in fence around behind the AC unit and surprised my wife and our dogs when they came out. The dog is even smaller than ours and ran back out with no further incident. Just want you to be aware.
Thanks again. My wife always books our beach condos and she said that I did good choosing Joey’s place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This is a great place to stay. It is very clean and well maintained. The host is very responsive to any questions and concerns you may have. It is located in a very quite neighborhood. Conveniently located to shopping and resturants. This was our second three week stay there and it will not be our last.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an excellent find in the area I needed to be in. It was close to the highway, near the hospital, and had many dining and shopping options within very short driving distance. The kitchen was stocked well with utensils and coffee, although as a short person I was glad to find a step stool in the apartment to reach everything. I loved the privacy of my little yard, and enjoyed the mornings hearing the song birds and watching the squirrels play outside the windows. The air conditioning worked great, plus the fans were all operating perfectly. My ONLY comment is it would have been nice to have a bath tub or at least a larger shower but for 5 minutes of every day who cares that much? I loved everything about this place and the hosts, so would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Jackson."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place! Felt like a recent build or remodel. Games and activities are available. Would stay again

We will certainly be back, and we recommend it without reservation!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We had to relocate due to pipes bursting in our home in Jackson. This worked out perfectly. Joey was easy to get in contact with and I we loved that we could bring our fur babies. The yard is fenced in and makes it so much easier when letting them out! I would highly recommend this rental!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I found Joey's place to be clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. The location is convenient to the freeway, restaurants, and grocery stores, as well as the hospital, where we were visiting a relative. The TV and wifi were great.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I visited Jackson for my father's abrupt health condition and needed a clean + safe place to reside at the last minute. Joey's place was very comfortable and satisfied my taste to ease my mind as I worked through the night to then support family during the day. The night was calm and peaceful. The place was clean, stocked well-which I appreciated. I could tell that Joey and team has placed a LOT of thought into this place from softness of fabrics to smells. It is very ""home"" feel. I did have some spiders in the home, but not to bother as Fall is upon us. I highly recommend this place!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for what we needed
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was cozy and comfortable. We were just in the area for a night as we were in the process of moving and just needed a place to rest. The parking behind the house was nice as we had a U-Haul trailer which was less visible.
The beds were really soft and comfortable. My wife, 2 kids, and I all got a good night of sleep which was much needed after driving all day with another day to go."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This home was very clean and fairly nice. Only problem I had was all of the noise in the area, motorcycles were racing up and down street the whole stay, other than that it was great!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heather's Airbnb was a delightful retreat for our short stay. The cleanliness and tasteful decor and delightful scent of candles set a welcoming tone, complemented by the array of games and activities available. The ample space and fresh linens ensured a comfortable night's rest. Its convenient location near restaurants and the interstate made it a practical choice. Plus, Heather's accommodation of my brother's dog was greatly appreciated. Overall, a fantastic spot for a quick night’s stay, a brief getaway, or a longer stay."

They even had dog bowls, treats and toys. The hosts thought of everything to make the stay comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heather's place was perfect for us. We were moving my son and needed a place that we could park the moving van and feel that it was safe. The house is located a short distance from I-40. There were many places close by to eat. The house is conveniently located to restaurants and I-40. It was very clean, cozy, comfortable and nicely decorated. We were only there for less than 12 hours, so we did not have a chance to enjoy the game room. We will definitely return so we can explore Jackson. Highly recommend this place!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I will come back and I would like to book the same home
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for me and my family. Much thought was put into the decoration and amenities. Very clean, comfortable and inviting. I plan on returning soon and staying here again."

We were looking for a place close to town so that we could go and enjoy and evening out with our friends and get an Uber to and from where we were going. Every little detail seemed to be thought of, even down to toiletries and toys for the dogs. We plan on booking again the next time we want to spend the night in Jackson. Thank you!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,GREAT STAY!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy to find and very comfortable. Cozy at home feeling. Perfect for what we needed for the weekend to transition the kids back home from the holidays.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Tinker Retreat was truly refreshing. We loved the down home feel. It is pretty quiet in the area. The house was very roomy and homie. The only thing that we didnt like was that there weren't TVs in all the bedrooms. And that there were too many ""What-not's"" , a little too much decor.
I'd definitely recommend this location still."

The host was so responsive to everything that I asked when I messaged her. We will definitely be back my family loved the additional game room with the popcorn machine. It made my grown kids feel like they were home again with me.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was in a perfect location for us. It was clean, and the small things around the house they had, like books, playroom, massage chair (worth a sit), and a covered parking area. Everything we used worked fine! The walk-in shower was larger and very clan. We would repeat. Just the two of us this time, but they are pet friendly!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kids liked the game room. Beds were comfortable. We wish we had more time there- it was just a one night stop for us. Younger kids appreciated the herbal tea and the teenagers liked the coffee and creamers.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time. The home was well decorated and very comfortable.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super close to i40
Massive parking /great for car trailers
Home was super nice and full of amenities"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the look and feel of the place, it was very homey. Loved the coffee and creamer options. The water pressure in the bathroom was the best we have had for years. And slept like a rock. Thank you for making your place available with a late check-in."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, very clean. Hosts were extremely friendly and communicated extremely fast to all our emails. Don’t hesitate to stay in their house. Great location!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"location was good. close to restaurants and church. clean. Foosball was fun.
we tried to clean the game room up (hopefully our host found it acceptable). the two little ones (3 & 6) found the ""101 games in a box""...a billion little pieces. I think we found them all. they liked the Monopoly money also. We got that organized as well. we really enjoyed the note on our dresser welcoming us! Wifi was a breeze. And, even though I'm not savvy enough to figure out the unlocking app, you provided a key so we could get in the old fashion way. (We put it back in the lock box). it worked well!
thank you so much for your hospitality!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Heather’s place was lovely and after traveling long hours it was such a wonderful place to land for a night. She even left me a little card and treats. Very thoughtful and a fun house. We wish we had more time to enjoy it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to find in a nice, older neighborhood. Everything was clean and well equipped. An issue we had with the WiFi was quickly resolved.
The house was kid friendly and that helped us since we were traveling with our two young grandsons. Over all SO NICE! A great value and we would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Tinker place retreat was wonderful. Several bedrooms, supportive of dogs, laundry in unit, and so many great amenities for our situation. I will warn it is quiet noisy with dogs and what sounded like drag racing- which isn’t anything you can do anything about. 10/10 and hopefully they will let us stay again. It’s the perfect half way point between my parents and us. I got plenty of rest!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather is fantastic and such a delightful hostess. Communicates well, and everything was tidy and clean. Really enjoyed and would love to stay there again in the future! We couldn't have been happier with our stay!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place and a great host Heather Beds were so comfortable Enjoyed the game room and coffee would definitely stay again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s place was exactly like the pictures, spacious, and with fun little details scattered about. My daughter liked the books and game room area. The bed was comfortably soft, but I do prefer a more firm bed. We arrived after dark and it was a bit of a challenge to find the back door. We should have pulled the car further back, but didn’t know how far to go. The digital lock tied to your phone is easy, once you get past the first time. The house is older, but has style. Overall, it is a great place to stay and Heather is a great host. I would go back again and do recommend it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great but short stay at the Tinker Retreat. Will definitely stay again if in Jackson TN. 🫶🏼

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for the weekend! The house was spacious and plenty of room for the entire group. It was clean and looked just like the picture, if not better.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family was traveling with 2 young kids and we did not make to our hotel for the night. I looked at AirBnB for a place and Heather's came up. I reached out very late hoping she would respond and she did!
When we arrived at the house it was great to park outback and not have to pull everything out of the car. Getting inside was interesting, since there was an app that needed to be downloaded, it took both of us to figure it out (we were tired).
Inside was great! My son found the gameroom and he loved it and my daughter found the sofa.
The beds and pillows are 10!!!!! The whole house was awesome."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"this place can be described in word CHARMING 💕 the attention to detail is great when traveling with kids, friends, & family! Heather has thought of everything! from the extra toiletries in the bathroom (sunscreen, first aid, makeup remover- you name it she’s got it for guests) also the game room had plenty of board games, coloring books, and the foozball table & massage chair! be aware there is only one bathroom and three bedrooms but that just makes for extra bonding & memories!

Very large yard for dogs.
We did not use the game room. But I saw it as a wonderful way to keep children entertained during their stay.
Would highly recommend the rental. Hoping that it is available during our next trip to Jackson."

The kids were sad that we only stayed one night. The house was so cozy and the added game room was a joy to see. The hosts have gone out of their way to stock the house in such a way that shows that they are very considerate and care about their guests! We didn’t want for anything. We have decided that any time we’re in the area visiting family in the future, we will check for Heather’s house first! Can’t wait to stay again for a few days so that we can play games and hang out for a longer time!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not a bad place to stay. But experience could have a been a bit better.
We got there well after check in and the pin wasn’t set for us to get in. I had to call 3 times before I got an answer!
The place seemed clean but there definitely needs to be a visit from pest control. Which was addressed when I brought it to the host.
The house is cute. So is the neighborhood. It’s spacious. The location is great. I wouldn’t stay there again but I’m not completely disappointed by the place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sparkling clean, brand new home near the activities that brought us to the area. Exactly as pictured and described.

Paw-Paw still reigns at old school games!"

there were a couple of small things that i communicated with the host about, and he was very responsive!
we thought we left a set of keys and decided to drive back. He happened to be there.
they weren't there but he was very friendly and helpful.
the area isn't the GREATEST, by the looks of it, but we didn't spend much time there, so it was ok.
we come to Jackson every year, and we will definitely be checking the availability of this place first!
thanks for everything!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you have not been to Jackson TN it is a must and Shane's home is incredible. The location is also incredible, you can walk to food or shopping, parks, jumbo outdoor chess and all of the neighbors were so kind, they all wave and talked to us about their dogs. Such a unique experience and a great vacation spot. Shane was so helpful and communicated with us about parking and check-in, food recommendations everything was so clear and he was so kind and patient. The game room is awesome! The bedroom has wireless chargers anywhere you could ever want, the upstairs rooms are able to control their temperatures, the house is just above and beyond.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Shane's place was great. We enjoyed the new house and the amenities. He was very responsive and helpful. The reason I rated the location lower was due to the surrounding neighborhoods. The house behind the home was falling apart. The street the home is located on was nice.

This is my hometown and in the event we need to book an airbnb again this is the place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our family spent a fantastic Christmas at Jeff and Kimberly’s lovely home. The home is spotless, comfortable, well-equipped for cooking at home and enjoying fun and peaceful family time. Kimberly had the house beautifully decorated for the holidays.

I would highly recommend this spacious and well equipped home to others traveling through Jackson, Tennessee. Especially if you are traveling with children. The backyard of the home is spacious and has a “playground” as my grandson called it along with a trampoline. Can’t say enough about the kind and gracious owners of the home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This location was perfect for the 8 of us. We were visiting our grandchildren and choose this close getaway during their fall break. The layout of the home was wonderful. The play structure and trampoline and large backyard provided lots for the 4-11 year olds to burn off their youthful energy. Only one minor detail- we could have used more than one dishwasher tab since we were there 2 nights. Not a big deal as we had to make a trip to the grocery store anyway. Beautiful, comfortable and clean home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kimberly's home is just lovely! We've stayed in numerous great AirB&Bs in the area, but this home was, by far, our favorite.

I messaged her around 4:30 one afternoon needing a place immediately due to a water leak in our newly renovated bathroom. She rushed to the house and cleaned everything as quickly as she could to get us in there that night even though guests had just left that morning, she always responds quickly and is absolutely wonderful! We arrived to a clean house around 10 that night, stayed 3 wonderful nights there. Can't say enough good things about them or their beautiful home! We will always keep their home #1 on our list when we need a local place to stay. Thanks again! 💙"

She was always quick to respond when I messaged her, she let me extend my trip by two days because we couldn't get back into our home yet due to renovations. Her home was clean, the beds we're comfy. Had a few internet issues but we restarted the router and that seemed to have fixed things. They leave soaps, toothpaste, qtips, snacks including popcorn, coffee and even to go cups! It was all very thoughtful. Kimberly did a great job setting up her home. If we ever find ourselves in need of a place to stay in Jackson, we hope she'd have us back. We'd love to stay again. Thanks for everything!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and cozy house, was very nice to stay at. Everything was very clean and organized when I arrived. Host was very flexible with my itinerary changes and needing to stay an additional night."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent beautiful home! I frequent Jackson to see my family and this home was perfect! Will definitely stay again. Was able to have my family over for dinner instead of always going out to eat or putting other family members out. The host was always responsive via text and all amenities were available.
2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"The home is beautiful, inviting, beds were comfortable, plenty of space, ample towels/linens and the host was communicative. The kitchen was well stocked. It’s a beautiful home. My second air b and b ever and I wished this had been my first experience
My only suggestions are as follows; on my last morning with a strict 10 a.m. check out time, I don’t want to be responsible for stripping beds and starting loads of laundry. I’m amiable to putting linens and towels in the laundry room yes, but not washing towels and sheets.
A hand held Swiffer to easily sweep up dust, debris, or food after meals would be helpful. My allergies were in overdrive not being able to dust those beautiful floors. The robot vacuum didn’t quite work
Lastly, the house is surface clean but housekeeping needs to deep clean the corners in the bathroom, kitchen and on the sides of the fridge. Bugs are plentiful and deep cleaning cuts down on critters. I like this house but i like/need the flexibility of hotel."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,As advertised
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay at this airbnb, host was super nice and easy to deal with. I highly recommend booking your stay if in jackson tn"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was easy to find at night, well lit and had a big driveway for a 6x12 U-Haul and my SUV. It was easy to get in and move around, clean, comfortable, well maintained (looked / felt like a recent renovation). I only needed a room and bathroom but inspected the whole home which I could see a group or large family easily use.
The neighborhood was quiet and the yard is large but not fenced in (for those traveling with dogs).
Gather all of your needs on the way in from the highway as everything is there and this is completely residential.
I would come back when passing through Jackson, TN."

The first night there, after spending the day decorating the venue, I came home to make all the cupcakes and sweet tea and other miscellaneous items for the wedding reception, and the kitchen had everything I needed to get the job done quickly. I got to spend time chatting with my brother and his family in the cozy livingroom--he had flown in from out of state. The house was very clean and welcoming, the backyard was great, and the little game room kept all the kiddos busy while we visited with relatives. Would definitely recommend this home!"

Everything is very clean. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans. Couldn't find a can opener and the owner brought us one within the hour. They are very responsive.

Seven people stayed there easily, enjoying the spacious living room almost as much as we did the clean, well-sized bedrooms and bathrooms. The large backyard made taking care of the pup quick and easy and peaceful neighborhood made walking the dog easy, too. Interestingly didn’t cost much more than a hotel would cost, too.
The only downsides were the lack of toilet paper in the house and difficulty getting quality sleep, waking each night too hot, but too cold with any other blanket."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Billie (remotely) welcomed my Mom, sister, me and my two 5 month old Cavapoo puppies for 3 nights for us to attend a lovely family wedding. We were delighted with the location and house layout and especially the fully fenced in backyard that allowed the pups to run and expend energy in between times in their crate while we were away/sleeping. The instructions to get in and out were not functioning as easily as hoped but I did not contact Billie as I was able to eventually figure it out. We enjoyed our stay in this lovely home and would very likely return if back in the area. Thanks Billie!"

,,,"I wish I could attach pics of her place. This is not a house. This is extended to the garage space. The old, extremely smelly carpets made me cough all night. I had surgery that day. The TV screen was smaller than my laptop computer. Hamper looks like they've been put dirt in. The
trash cans lined in with Kroger
bags. The kitchen cabinets
were full of used, leftover
sugar, flour, condiments.
I am surprised by how this place runs as Airbnb!?
We both didn't even take a
shower. It's an extremely
nasty place I've ever slept.
If you open the garage door
from the living room, it's an
unbelievable view of full of junky inside of garage! The garage full of smelly stuff, old
jeep, full of old smelly, dirty something left in the garage
I am still feeling sick when I
think of this place."
