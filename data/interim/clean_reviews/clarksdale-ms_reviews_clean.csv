Even though it was frigid outside (highs in the 40s /lows in the 20s), the cottage was cozy and warm. The bed is just as comfortable as others have described.
I saw a deer and tons of bird life from the cottage windows during my stay. The full kitchen was handy and the water was piping hot, which was much appreciated after a long day of hiking in the cold. Host Libby was easy to communicate with and very responsive during my stay."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My husband and I had a wonderful time at this cottage! we brought our baby and Libby left a pack n play at the house for us to use which made packing much easier. The view was very pretty of the trees and the river was a little farther than we thought but still so peaceful. We loved bringing food for smores that we enjoyed around the campfire we made out back! The bed was extremely comfortable and it was very clean. The guest book with local information was very thorough and organized - it was helpful to know where to go for dinner and breakfast the next morning to hear the blues! We had a very relaxing time at this cabin that feels like a home and loved the seculded and quiet location so close to town! Thank you for a fantastic stay!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby was very communicative, but also gave us all the space we wanted. The dogs were friendly! The view from the bed window was better than anything you could find on the nice, giant tv on the wall! Close to downtown, with all types of suggestion for things to do. Can’t wait to stay again!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures don’t do it justice. The cabin is adorable! It was the perfect weekend getaway, and we will definitely be back. Libby has thought of everything.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would give 10 stars if I could! All the comforts of Home are here in this cottage. Close to town but this stay has a secluded and unique feel. Beautifully ecclectic decor full of local Delta items and books. We will return for sure!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay in Clarksdale. It’s close to town but you feel like you’re in the country. Nice view of the grounds. The place was well-stocked and had everything we needed.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway! Very quiet, and very comfortable. The location was great because even though you're only a couple miles away, you felt like you were very far away. Loved it!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Sunflower Cottage. The space is decorated with Asian, African, and seaside influences that make you feel like you are on an adventure. The views from the cottage are beautiful and private. The place was stocked with everything you could need, even a variety of milks and creamers for coffee in the morning. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Levon’s, live music at Ground Zero, and a lively breakfast with music from 19th Street Red and Watermelon Slim at the Bluesberry Cafe. I hope to be back again in the future!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great little spot off the beaten path in Clarksdale.
WiFi was pretty fast, over 100 mbps. The house was super cozy and well stocked. It was a lot of fun getting to run down the river and explore with our pup, as well as the location has quite a few friendly dogs that are very cute. We saw lots of wildlife, and were so grateful the house came with some bug spray.
The fire pit was nice and easy to use.
Libby was very communicative and accommodating. It was an absolute pleasure staying here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,House was a lot of fun. Wish it wasn’t raining the outside looked like a lot of fun too
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great and had everything we needed. Big backyard with view of the Sunflower river. It's a small space but with all the seating and outdoor area it's not cramped feeling. I highly recommend taking the audio walking tour suggested on visitclarksdale.com. Free app and the tour is free. Very informative and will give you good introduction to this little Delta town.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunflower cottage is private, clean and cozy and close to downtown. Libby was quick to respond to questions and had lots of suggestions for things to check out around Clarksdale. We HIGHLY recommend this listing!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, verdant view from the porch and back patio, in such a peaceful and natural setting. A cozy cabin interior, a little old-fashioned in that there are lots of books, pictures and knick-knacks about. Chairs and sofa were all comfortable, and the sleigh bed was particularly comfortable and we got a great night's sleep. The size of the cabin is perfect for a couple, or a couple with one child. More could squeeze in if necessary by using the sofabed, but it would feel tight -- however, there's lot of room to play outdoors. We appreciated being able to bring our dog, and she was greeted by a couple of the neighborhood dogs as well, which was fun after a very long car trip. Kitchen and bathroom are tiny but you have lots of towels, soap and shampoo, etc. -- everything you need."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Not far from town but secluded enough to relax.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Libby’s place was perfect for our needs. No stairs was a big plus for us & due to rotator cuff surgery the king bed was exactly what we require.
We had everything we needed to cook breakfast. The coffee/kuerig was five star. Safe parking for our Jeep and not having to worry about theft was important.
We will definitely return."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby's Cabin on the Sunflower River is amazing. Not far from downtown Clarksdale, it's a beautiful country space that I wish I had spent more time at. The inside of the cabin is like a super cozy hunting lodge vibe as well. Highly recommend."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing stay! We had the best time sitting on the porch, kayaking, and hanging around in the house. We highly recommend! (and will definitely be back!)"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautifully decorated cottage that provides a wonderful get away for anyone wanting to relax and enjoy some quiet time.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A restful retreat! This cabin feels very homey and private Even though there are other homes nearby, the building faces the river and the outdoor spaces allow you to absorb all the natural beauty around you."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is amazing. The artwork and decorations are beautiful, cozy and perfectly placed. One painting in particular, I will never forget. The cottage is mind blowing. Every thing you could think of is provided, pardon q-tips (and they were probably there, we just didn't dig). We had a very relaxing Saturday, cooked out and relax like we hadn't relaxed in a long time. Great find!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My favorite place in Clarksdale
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great spot. If you get a chance to stay here. Do it. So quiet and relaxing. Loved every minute of it
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love this little place. An unassuming, quaint and quiet retreat."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Libby's place is a nice hideaway in Clarksdale with the feel of being in the woods but very close to the attractions around Clarksdale. Her cat who frequently visited me during my stay was a great unexpected company!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my greatest experience with any air bnb. The house was absolutely beautiful and so was the river. The host did an excellent job.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this little cabin which was so warm welcoming and comfy. The bed was dreamy, wood paneling, beautiful rugs, tons of throw pillows, thick towels & nice window coverings made this little cabin feel luxurious, like a little haven right above the river. We made fire in the fire pit and enjoyed the weather. There's a bit of traffic noise but nothing major (I was hoping for owls). I would definitely stay there again. There's room for more people."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful getaway. Place has everything you need! Check it out! We enjoyed it"
2020-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,What a pretty cottage next the the sunflower river! We loved sitting by the fire in the evening and exploring the big yard and river.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most stylish and comfortable AirBnB I have stayed in yet. Gorgeously decorated, great amenities, very close to downtown Clarksdale and a huge outdoor area on a hill overlooking a small river. BUT THE BEST PART WAS THE BED! My god this thing was like sleeping on a cloud. Most sleep I have gotten in months.
- Tourist Tip: Make sure you visit the Hopson Plantation nearby."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nicest Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in. It was over the top. Will no doubt be back. Top notch place. The most wonderful bed.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great spot. We had an awesome time. Will definitely visit again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a wonderful getaway from the world while still having modern conveniences and being extremely close to shopping/dining options. The scenery was gorgeous and we spent most of our time outdoors enjoying coffee on the porch or reading by the two fire pits! The cabin is eclectic with Old South memorabilia and artwork/kitsch from around the world. There is almost everything here you could possibly need for whatever type of vacation you're hoping for. The only thing we didn't realize before coming was that the river is quite a ways from the cabin down a relatively steep hill. We walked down there every day with our dogs, who loved the huge yard to run and play in. There was not launching access to the river (the river was quite low while we were there, and it might be different if it were higher). Libby was wonderful, though, finding us other options for launching our kayaks on the river. We would highly recommend this cottage to anyone wanting a weekend getaway and/or passing through/visiting the Clarksdale area."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Super cute and chill. A wonderful spot to hang out for a few days with a big backyard and fire pit.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Libby’s place is a gem. Great WiFi, full cable, comfortable space inside and out... air conditioning is glorious! Peaceful to grab a book and read outside or get cozy and comfortable with a movie inside. Highly recommend!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed Libby's place and Clarksdale. We used it as an overnight stay on a longer trip, but now that we discovered, it we will be back to spend more time."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great view. Had a lovely time in Clarksdale."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little cabin that’s secluded enough that you feel “away from it all,” but still close enough to Clarksdale that you can get what you need.
The water isn’t for swimming, but it’s still a lovely place to chill out, sit by the fire, and unwind (although there are many modern amenities like TV and Wi-Fi if you aren’t quite so rustic), and the cabin has a lot of extras like DVDs, board games, and a pretty well-stocked kitchen. Great for couples or small families!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! Was private yet close to town. Check in and check out were simple!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing host and wonderful place to stay

2020-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very quaint home perfect for a quick stay! Thanks!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Libby's cottage on the river is absolutely beautiful. She has literally thought of everything you will ever need. This cottage sits directly on the river and is surrounded by gorgeous trees. Though the cottage does come with a nice flat screen television, in the week we stayed at Libby's we did not once turn on it on as the views from every vantage point in this cottage were stunning. Lots of bird, lightening bug and deer watching. Libby's place is the place to go when you want to get away and be in tune with nature but still close enough to everything Clarksdale has to offer. There is a large comfy bed that MAKES you relax and two chairs by a large window that beg for you to sit and and reflect. We truly felt like we were home. Libby is a great host and so friendly you'd swear you've been friends for years. We will be back."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I wanted a random getaway that was withing driving distance of Nashville. Luckily we found Libby's place! It's a little oasis in Clarksdale and has every amenity you could think of. Libby was kind and responsive. The home was beautiful. I loved the decor and it really felt like a home away from home. Would definitely recommend!

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is MUCH better in real life. We loved it so much we stayed for an extra night, and wanted to stay even longer. I could go into lots of detail about our stay, but just go for yourself and experience this lovely cabin for yourself.
This was a real highlight on our trip."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Cottage was the perfect little getaway for my family! The bed is the most comfortable bed ever!!! And we loved all the MS Delta touches throughout the cottage. The location is perfect, very close to downtown! We truly enjoyed our stay and will stay again the next time we are visiting Clarksdale!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby’s place is perfect! Super cozy with a great view. It’s only a few minutes drive from downtown Clarksdale where all the restaurants, shops and bars are located. She is very quick to respond and I’ll definitely be coming back soon!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Libby’s place is amazing. We highly recommend a stay there and we will definitely stay there again if we’re in the area. Fully stocked kitchen including bacon and eggs. Who does that? Libby does. Bed was as comfortable as home and WiFi easy to set up. Thanks again Libby
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Libby's Sunflower cottage was perfection on the Sunflower River. Cozy, comfortable, clean, great cottage decor, all amenities one needed and 2 fire pits. The King Bed was so comfortable!!! Quiet, down a laneway with only a few other houses. Libby was easy to communicate with and very prompt. Only 2 kilometres from Clarksdale where all the blues happens, a quick taxi ride from CDry.org if you need. Thanks Libby!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Libby's place is truly spectacular. It is located close to town but in the middle of the country. It's much larger than it appears in the picture and the front porch just ads to it. Libby had left a lot of breakfast food. I highly recommend Libby's place.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,The sunflower cottage is a beautiful shack in a safe and quiet area. You are at few minutes by car of downtown Clarksdale. It was clean. The bed is confortable. I recommend this place.

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Libby’s place was fantastic! An excellent place to stay while in the Mississippi delta. The place really captures the feel of this region!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Libby's cottage on the river is truly magical. The moment we walked up, we saw a deer run across the yard and it felt like a good omen. The cottage feels like a log cabin in the woods and it is immaculately decorated with beautiful little flourishes, like the tables made of natural wood and artisan designed coasters. She left us breakfast items and a wealth of coffee options. You could use a Keurig or a traditional coffee maker. She even left out some mosquito repellent that came in handy to use before we headed down to the river which is a stones throw away in the backyard. The yard is huge and we would often sit out on the porch to drink our morning coffee. The Sunflower cottage is very close to the downtown area and was a perfect location for exploring all that Clarksdale has to offer. Libby left us some wonderful tips on things to check out, including the Cathead website that lists all of the music and good restaurants in town. Thank you for your amazing hospitality. We hope we will get a chance to return!
Best regards,
Molly and Joey"

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cute and exceeded our expectations! Libby’s hospitality was outstanding even though she herself was out of town on vacation. We booked last minute and everything was ready for us when we got there. The coffee maker was acting up (or we just weren’t using it correctly) and When we got back to the cabin that evening there was an extra one waiting for us on the porch. The home had everything we needed and more thank you!!

If you're visiting The Delta you want to stay here, just not on the same week I need cuz I'm coming back."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby's ""shotgun shack"" is anything but a shack! We loved staying in her stylishly decorated and amply outfitted cottage. We will definitely visit again.

2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little cabin. We were pleasantly surprised to find that, despite its rustic look, the cabin is extremely well furnished and supplies provided. The king bed is exceptionally comfortable; the single bed is a little soft, but it was okay. Many thanks for the insect repellent provided - definitely mosquito country! Charming touches in wall hangings, photos, etc. Lovely, lovely place!"
2018-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cozy with lots of character! I would definitely recommend this quaint cottage. Convenient to highway and downtown....but felt like I was miles away! Morning was best! Coffee and muffins provided by host on the front porch while taking in the beautiful outdoor scenery.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby is an unsurpassed host. She designed the cottage and decorated it wonderfully and with great accessibility. The view of the Sunflower ""valley"" and easy access to the river brought back many childhood memories at our home upstream. As a native of Clarksdale whose family has long since been gone, I had a good idea of how the city is laid out. Libby's recommendations were excellent for dining and entertainment. The cat and kittens were a great bonus. Libby is down home friendly and worldly. Our family recommends a stay of any length to explore the northern Mississippi Delta."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent place to stay during our quick trip to Clarksdale. The directions to the cottage were detailed and accurate and we found the place with no problem. I always say it’s the little things that make the biggest difference. We had coffee and even breakfast food in the fridge. The place is quiet yet not far from all of the local restaurants and museums. We would definitely stay here again!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view of the trees and river.
Very peaceful and relaxing. You can see outside from almost every area of the house and all the views are at the river.
Cabin is set up wonderfully, slept 2 adults and three kids perfectly.
Breakfast foods such as eggs, bacon, bagels, muffins, and cereal where provided. Loved the coffee and tea counter. I can’t say enough great things about this place! Bed was so comfortable.
Would love to come down on our next anniversary. Libby was wonderful at answering all of our questions, and we had quite a few since we have never been to Clarksdale."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is awesome. It in a great location and has great natural surroundings. The cabin is very clean and is set up very nicely. We had a really great stay.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was exactly like the pictures. It was very clean. Both hosts were easy to speak with and gave clear directions and instructions.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space - two bedrooms and large living/eating area. Very comfortable for a mulit-day stay. Also a great location - right in the heart of the music district. We could walk a couple blocks to many music venues and restaurants. Would love to have room darkening shades in the bedrooms... a bit bright at night. Otherwise all was really good

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,John was a great host. This was a last minute booking but he made everything easy for us .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"John’s place is the prefect location in the middle of it all! Walking distance to everything in Downtown Clarksdale. Very comfortable and very clean. Note, there are stairs to get to the condo, but also nice that the condo is upstairs and private. Cool exposed brick walls and comfy furniture and bed."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, great location. Kitchen is poorly equipped; no cutting knives, spatula…and crappy Teflon frying pans. One of the bathrooms had some drainage issues and the shams were looking less than clean. Gatorade bottle under the bed…for festival prices I expected more."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,Nice
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I simply love high ceilings. I was sold then. The location was in the heart of Clarksdale. I felt like I was in Buffalo New York again on the lofts’ arrangements.. 10 out of 10

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is very nice. Maintain the essence of the city. It's comfortable. The air conditioning works great considering the heat for the time of year. But the highlight is its great location.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a wonderful space- centrally located downtown, in walking distance of things to do and great restaurants. Looks exactly like the pictures, it’s a very open space and very well kept. Absolutely worth staying!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall the place looked just like the photos and was close to everything. Probably one of the best looking areas to stay so far. Definitely could’ve been cleaner(shower, toilet, smell)"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,The airbnb looked exactly like the photos. It was clean! The only downfall is they had very old hard towels and wash cloths. They smelled like mildew even after I washed them. The washer is also old and smells like mildew which may be part of the problem. They didn’t provide extra sheets for the pullout bed so if you are using it bring your own sheets and a comforter. They did however provide extra pillows in the closets. Honestly this is probably the best airbnb you will get in this area!! Host was great and responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,John’s place is the perfect place to stay in Clarksdale. Right in the middle of it all on Delta Ave. Extremely comfortable and clean—it had everything we needed. We walked everywhere and were easily able to enjoy everything by foot that Downtown Clarksdale had to offer. Added bonus—there are easy to reach outlets at both ends of the super comfy new couch and both sides of the bed.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic apartment in a great location. If you are visiting Clarksdale, we would highly recommend it. It is 5 mins walk down the road from Ground Zero Blues Bar. Don't be put off by the Internet pictures of the area as this is part of the local art scene"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect experience!! ❤️
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are planning a trip to Clarksdale, this is the place to stay. Centrally located and easy to get to. Very clean place with plenty of space. We went during an ""off"" time for the Blues scene and found there wasn't a lot of action in March. We would definitely do our homework and choose a time when there was more scheduled music. But that was our fault. Regardless, we were very happy with our stay at John's place and would highly recommend it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another awesome stay!!!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location. Just wish there had been shampoo and soap for shower.
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Food left in the stove from previous guest causing a really bad smell. Other than smelling that for 1st day not knowing where it was coming from it was a good stay for a good price.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John's place was really awesome. Hannah is the best when it comes to answering any question you may have. The condo is right down the street from Ground Zero and is surrounded by little eateries and other shoppers.
The unit is pretty large and the bedrooms are very comfortable. The place was super clean, too! The full kitchen was nice with an island in the middle and the dishwasher made our final clean-up easy-peasy. I would definitely rent this place again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and to discover the city. We especially loved the balcony with view on the river and had a visit of a bever every morning. At walking distance from the center. We recommend this highly and would book this again when we visit Nashville again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"John and Laura were great hosts. They were very responsive when I had a small question.
The house is large and I think we were the only ones there. I would love to come back with my family or friends to take advantage of the great kitchen and dining room.
It was an easy walk down into Clarksdale and I felt safe at night walking with a friend back to the house.
John has an amazing collection of music posters and art that you could spend hours looking at.
Thank you for a great stay!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience - easy access to space, great common space, well-equipped kitchen, central location to downtown blues scene. Hannah was responsive to all my needs/requests."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott & I loved the spaciousness & charm of the old home with its big staircase leading up to bedrooms . Although we didn't use it much except for the refrigerator, we appreciated the roomy, well-appointed kitchen.
Not least, we also appreciated the host's responsiveness to our occasional questions/ concerns. And, enjoyed the chance to chat with John's brother (forgot his name, unfortunately!) who came by to replace/repair a loose front door knob. He gave us some background on the house about which we had been curious.
Our room was small, cozy, & cutely-decorated--if a little hot when we arrived due to the sunlight that had poured in through its large windows. Due to its size, it lacked a place to hang or store clothing we had brought for 3 nights; this was not a big deal, though a few wall hooks or shelves would've be helpful. Overall, though, our stay here was delightful & definitely enhanced our visit to Clarksville."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, ideally placed to explore Clarksdale on foot.
All the decoration is very well chosen and we had all the necessary amenities at our disposal.
Very good communication with Hannah who was responsive and accommodating.
Recommended!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a quirky house to stay in. Enjoyed seeing the town a lot and the host was great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here in Clarksdale at John’s place. This is a gem and I loved the artwork of the blues and old photos of the Deep South. I even got a chance to meet a Clarksdale Historian on an upcoming documentary on the history of the blues. You never know who you will meet at the Chateau !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is very beautiful; it's like a Four Square with an additional wing, and you get to stay in one room with communal spaces downstairs. It's beautifully decorated with photos of blues and rock icons, and there are a few string instruments lying around for any visiting musicians. Clarksdale's a small town, so getting around isn't really a problem, but even then, the airbnb is pretty centrally located. Clarksdale's a very artsy place too; I was pleasantly surprised. The legacy of Robert Johnson lives on. Will definitely try to come back sometime for a longer stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! We made an extremely last-minute booking as we were driving north, and we're so glad we did. The house is beautiful and decorated in a great retro way. Huge kitchen, beautiful furnishings. Its well worth going off the beaten path to stay here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice house in a perfect location!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Johnny's place is a hidden gem. The art work and amenities were fantastic. Coffee and creamer in the kitchen. The bed was comfortable and furnishings were beautiful. We were. able to walk to all the bars and jukejoints. We were the only people staying there so we had the run of the mansion. We felt right at home and plan to come back for two nights on our way home from the gulf coast.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The decorations were very interesting and eclectic. The kitchen could have been cleaner. Location was great for walking around town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our (brief) stay at Chateau Debris. The house was unique and delightful to be in. All the places we wanted to visit (music, food, museum) were in walking distance. The host was very friendly and had good recommendations."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was very nice to stay in a full home all alone, we got lucky! (No bathroom sharing) it is a huge house, and reminds a historical place! Very cool!
John was very polite and helpful, we came to the city in a Sunday afternoon in a cold weather and he gives us a very nice tips! Thanks for the hospitality John!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect place for a group of friends to stay. Fabulous space and the eclectic decor is amazing!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Grand Manor Luxury Mansion lives up to its name. This stately home is located in a pleasant neighborhood an easy walk from delicious restaurants and just beyond the edge of Galveston’s beach bustle. Grand Manor was a reward for my wife after she endured two nights’ hot and humid camping outside Austin, so we were ready for the comfy bed, the hot soak in the jet-tub, the quiet neighborhood, and the pleasant balcony off our room. Usually one would have to splurge for such luxury, but we found Grand Manor remarkably affordable in a beach town that surprised us with its charm and architectural beauty. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,abc
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has probably been my favourite airbnb to stay at so far. Maybe its a personal preference but the decor was amazing. It enhanced the feeling of Clarksdale in a great way. If you're coming to this town for the blues this is the perfect place to stay. Everything you need to see is within a 10 minute walk.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The air conditioner in the room worked but was not effective
The entry locks were damaged and difficult to open the house"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,great location in a very cool old building. Spacious and great views of the baseball stadium.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fabulous stay--just a short walk from many cool blues attractions. The space was clean, cool in the heat, and really well-decorated. Check in was easy and the property manager was in touch for anything we might need. Price was also quite reasonable. Will definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay at John's due to an unexpected issue. Due to this issue, I was given a full refund. I will try another time to stop here. The low ratings were only because I didn't stay there. I appreciate the good communication with his backup before and after this situation."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Room in a great house, with lots of character and memorabilia yet with all the comfort needed.
Close to all of rhe town attractions

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked this place again. It was so good. My first review says it all.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing time here. Initially we were only going to stay one night and then last minute I booked the place again for the next day. Hannah was super flexible.
The place has amazing interior design but you’re not paying extra for it as this place has basically the best price in the area. The house just adds to the blues experience.
Area is pretty, feels safe. Ground zero and center is easily walkable.
Would absolutely recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was wonderful, very friendly. He told me a lot about the town and things that interested me. He showed me everything in detail and made sure to answer all my questions. I would definitely return if I find myself in the area."

The older home has been renovated and has several rooms that are clean and comfortable. Hannah met us in front when we arrived and explained everything we needed to know about the place. We definitely recommend this place."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great few days at Chateau Debris with the blues music. Easy location to walk into town from, and parking was always available on the street. Hannah helped to check me in and was very communicative and easy to work with! The space was large and included a living room and kitchen for guest use. The house is really charming and has some creaking to it, but that was never an issue, even with the other guests. The bed was comfortable and house was a nice temperature, especially given the humidity. Will definitely stay here again my next visit to Clarksdale."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a very nice place to stay! A very historical home indeed. Nostalgic atmosphere of blues music.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great and the hospitality top notch. The house was charming and such a convenient location to explore Clarksdale. I will definatly be happy to stay there on my next trip.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Château Debris, such an awesome find. The decor makes it feel like a museum and it’s worth visiting Clarksdale just to stay here. We were there for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. The château is a stone’s throw from the town centre, parking is super easy and the neighbourhood felt very safe."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy walking to everything with lots of interesting items through out."

2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great host who is very accomidating. Flexible on check in & check out times for night shift travelers. He aims to please & has a well decorated & comfortable place to stay short or long term. Well worth the stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John and Ward were incredibly accommodating to my late check-in time, had lots of helpful suggestions for things to do, and have a home with fun decor. Other people staying there were cool, too!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chateau debris was very nice! John introduced himself and walked us around, told us local history, and we even saw him around town at a good local spot (hooker grocery). The AC was having issues but we managed quite well, John was very open and accommodating due to that. Would absolutely stay again :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We did not get to stay at Chateau Debris because the room was double booked through AirBnB, so this review refers to the room in the house across the street that John also owns. This house isn’t on AirBnB (yet, I think). The location is very good— a nice quiet block by a church and a grocery store, if you want to get supplies while you’re here. And you can walk to everything in downtown Clarksdale.
Communication with John was easy and fast, and he gave great recommendations for where to see music and get dinner.
I do wish we could have stayed at Chateau Debris because it looks like a really cool space. But the house we did stay in was fine."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice gentlemen and helpful with events around town.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John & his brother Mort are gracious hosts and helped me out when I had a complication. Couldn’t be happier with my stay. Easy walk to town, nice hanging out in house or on porch. Safe parking in front. I’ll be back."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at CD was exactly what I hoped for. Beautiful home, convenient to historic downtown, spotless accommodations. John and Ward were both helpful and easy to communicate with. Heartily recommend."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I even begin showing my gratitude for this place- the location, cleanliness, amenities, comfort, and eclectic personality of this place checks all the boxes. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need, and the whole place is just so clean. I had the sheer luck of being the only tenant here during my stay, so it felt like- as John put it- I was Elvis in the House!
John as a host is so personable, understanding, and communicative. He gave me helpful tips to enjoy my time in Clarksdale to the fullest, and truly made me feel at home. I felt moved by his hospitality. I’ve paid more for Airbnb’s, and most of them don’t hold a candle to the truly unique Chateau Debris.
Loved being a tenant and I love Clarksdale. Thanks again, John!"

They have a kuereg, which is nice because I must have coffee first thing in the morning. I didn't meet John in person but he was very communicative and his brother met me and gave me lots of great tips. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to spend in Clarksdale, one night is NOT enough. As a solo woman traveler, I found John's to be a very restful stay and I felt totally comfortable there. Everything is very clean and well run, it just felt EASY. I would absolutely love to stay at John's place again!"

I really recommend this place, it is clean and has the character missing in so many hotels."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"John's place is an absolute gem. Our room (and the entire house) was clean, comfortable, stylish, and quirky.

I would also recommend a visit to Cathead Gallery- extremely informative with great memorabilia and music.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Chateau Debris is a beautiful house in a great location and John is a welcoming and helpful host.

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is stunning, what all air B&B should aspire to. All of the rooms are big and airy and sparkling clean.

He's even thought of little things like spare toiletries in case you've forgotten anything. the house is in the centre of Clarksdale and all of the Blues sites are all within walking distance."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and great home! recommend it to everyone!!

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"You simply must check out Chateau Debris: the house is a work of art. Every room has its personality. The kitchen, the dining room, the living room, the staircase... All are full of details than cannot be missed! The room was big, comfortable, light, quiet, and clean. The bathroom is shared but it is spotless and has everything you need! John has great tips to get around town and places to visit or eat! Grazie, John! Hope to come back soon!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at John's house was amazing! He is very welcoming and knows a lot about the town and gave me very helpful information and advice on what to do and where to eat. I could use the kitchen and living/dining area, and loved the decoration.
The airco in the room is not very strong, so during the day it can get a little hot, but I was out most of the time. There is a fan that cools and at nighttime the temperature had cooled so no problem sleeping.
Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The decor in the house is really interesting and fun. John was very helpful with recommendations for restaurants and bars in town. We had a great time and would definitely stay here again!

2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Chateau Debris. John was a superb, sociable host, and his house was spotless and has considerable charm. Hard to imagine a spot more convenient to downtown Clarksdale or a better guide to its music and night life. We would definitely stay here again."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John is a very nice person and great host. He gave us good recomendations for music venues. We had exellent gigs on each of our 2 evenings. Johns house is a very interresting place and our bed was perfect.

2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chateau Debris is very well appointed, with beautiful new finishes and thoughtful touches to give you the comfort of home. John was very prompt to reply and a good communicator. Having things like maps of town with key attractions was superb! I would certainly stay here again. Sky room was cozy, not too much floorspace around the bed, but perfectly comfortable for a good rest and beautiful views of the church across the street. Great experience!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"John's place is quiet, but a short walk will take you to good food and great music, be sure to stop by Red's. His decor is fun and relaxing and it is obvious that John enjoys being a great host."

2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Clarksdale revelation will stick with you... Don't believe all those recommendations though! The place isn't really spick'n'span, friendly and welcoming, it doesn't really have a funnier or wilder or more beautiful decor in each room. John isn't really a gas to talk with, you can't really go out and listen to the blues every night of the week in Clarksdale. What, are you naive? You think he'd let you use the fridge and the stove and make coffee like you were at home? C'mon!"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic space in Clarksdale and a wonderful host!
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL Airbnb house ever ever been! Incredible touches to the house whit a lot of Delta touches to it. John knows the city very well and has some great tips. I doubt you can get anything better than this to get to know downtown Clarksdale. Once again, this house is INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where do we start. Such a lovely house, beautifully furnished and maintained , a short walk from lively venues downtown - our favourite Reds Juke joint and Levons for dining and music. Ground Zero is too commercialised for us. Guests at John's are exceptionally well provided for . You will be staggered by the quality of kitchenware - better than some would find in their own home. Whether you are a couple or a large family, there is abundant space and more . Thank you for your generosity John. We'd love to stay again. And thank you Meghan for welcoming us and showing us around."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A creative and comfortable spot! Would absolutely return.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Hooker Hotel did not disappoint! We had been wanting to try it out for a while and am glad we did! It was rustic, primitive, funky, artistic, and well thought-out. The location can't be beat. We were right in the middle of Clarksdale within a short walk to just about everything. If you are looking for a place that speaks to the flavor of The Delta and pays homage to the bluesmen who laid the foundation of The Blues, I'd highly recommend giving The Hooker Hotel a try."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we're in town for a wedding. place was really nice and host was excellent. highly recommend
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A+ really fun place central to everything Clarksdale has to offer. host was great. space is very cool and fun. If you're into the Delta Blues and the history of American music get to Clarksdale now! the area is changing year by year as the town has formally embraced it's past. my guess is it's going to get more and more crowded as the years go by. go to Reds!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hooker Hotel is THE place to stay in Clarksdale!!! Right in the middle of everything. We parked the car in front of the place, and we were able to walk everywhere. Inside, total immersion in the Mississippi Delta experience. But also spacious, comfortable and with everything we could want! Perfect place for a home base in Clarksdale and on the Delta!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 2 nights in Clarksdale. It is our 3rd visit and again it didn’t disappoint! There is so much blues history around there, so if that’s your bag it’s perfect. It was our 2nd stay at the Hooker Hotel . It’s a really quirky place, so much to look at and enjoy."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little space, loaded with Blues memorabilia and supplied with good beds and bedding, and 1st class bathroom supplies (towels, washcloths, etc.). Great location for walking through every part of downtown. Good tv reception (who watched that?) and a clean facility. Only problem was he water supply, very weak, and the shower was a trial to get adjusted correctly to get hot water. And since there was construction going on in the unit(s) next door, there was a lot of noise during the day (but not at night). All in all, a good visit to Clarksdale"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space and location. Very nice hosts! Highly recommend!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying at this cool and unique place. Wish we had more time there even though he let us have a late check out. The longer you stay the more you notice all the cool little details in the decor. Really super cool! Loved being able to walk across the street to Hambone for some music. He showed us his other 2 airbnbs next door to this one and they are equally as cool yet different. I highly recommend any of the three.

Loved the quirkiness of Hooker Hotel, our host was great and it was a very comfortable stay. Perfect!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The place to be 😎😎😎😎
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My return to The Hooker Hotel was just as expected--I love staying here! Check-in here is a breeze. It's always our goal to get into town before Cathead Blues and Folk Art (just around the block) closes. The owner, Roger, is The Man to talk to about what's going on in town. I also have to pick up my souvenir. I never leave town without a bluesman (Google J.D. Sipe). Also around the block are Yazoo Pass, Bluesberry Cafe, Grandma's Pancakes, a convenience store, a bank, Levon's, Quapaw Canoe Co. who are so generous to show you around and what they're creating. If all that isn't enough, the coolest thing about the Hooker is the décor! It's fun to go out, hear great musicians, come home and see their portraits on the wall. Also, I must mention the fabulous beds. They're as luxurious as those you find in any upscale hotel. Repeating myself: LOVE this place, LOVE the host and LOVE Clarksdale!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the decor and the place had everything we needed. Note there's very little natural light ( didn't bother us). The beds were great and we all slept well. It's quiet, comfortable and well located for blues bars."
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect location and theme. We were met promptly at check-in by John, who also is responsible for the great handiwork in the Hooker Hotel. Furnishings are creative, antique, and perfectly themed for anyone visiting Clarksdale for the Blues. The use of materials (towel hangers, shower walls, wall hangings, etc.) is truly unique, functional, and ingenious.
Thanks for the treats in the fridge. Special thanks to John for mailing us a heavy picture book that we mistakenly left in the room.
We definitely hope to get back to Clarksdale, and the Hooker Hotel (or one of its 2 sibling properties) will be top of our list."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a ton of fun! Looks funky and basic on the outside but is funky and plush on the inside. When you look up eclectic interior design on wiki, this should pop up! Super easy to work with, quick to respond, took me in on short notice while out of town and made special arrangements to get me in. Beds are king size and nice with quality linens. Fast wifi, TV with plenty of channels, full size refrigerator and equipped kitchen. Easy walking distance to everything downtown. Helpful Clarksdale info in the room. The best part (other than the name!) is the art and photos of local blues greats hanging on all the walls. There should be admission just to see them! Great stay and will recommend to others."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hooker Hotel is supercool! All our needs were met without having to worry about hurrying out to the store as you do with many vacation rentals. Location is great! We love being able to walk to restaurants and shops. We'll be back!
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Check-in was very easy - big shout out to John for being so flexible with our times after we got delayed due to a flat tire!
The place is amazing, and we wished we had more than a night there! The location is perfect and the apartment is beautiful. The beds are so comfortable and the linens luxurious, and everything is catered for.
Word of warning - the water in Clarksdale is very metallic so not great for drinking or cleaning the teeth."

2016-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely LOVED this place. I 110% recommend that you stay here. It was one of the highlights of our trip and would love to come back some day. The place is beautifully designed and a real joy to stay in. The people that manage this place are super friendly and really made us at home. There were a couple of beers in the fridge when we arrived which was a great touch. We also found the people in Clarksdale really friendly and we're convinced that there's something special going on in this town. Stay here.... you will not be disappointed. I promise.

2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were met by Mark at the premises at the agreed time and he gave us a quick overview of the area and recommendations for music and food, all of which we found were as he described.

Thanks for the welcome beers Mark. We enjoyed our stay and can confidently award the Hooker hotel a 5 star rating."
2015-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hooker Hotel was wonderful! We had been on the road for over 12 hours on our motorcycles and it was like a breath of fresh air when we walked in. The place was very clean and eclectically decorated with so much artwork and detail - we couldn't take it all in. Bottles of water and beer were cold, waiting for us in the refrigerator, and in the freezer - ice cream! And I can't tell you how comfortable the beds were. Needless to say, they were a welcome sight to four tired travelers. Hooker Hotel was above and beyond our expectations. The only bad thing we can say - we wish we could've stayed longer. We highly recommend Hooker Hotel to anyone wanting some place clean to stay and something different than the normal mainstream hotel. Look no further!"

2015-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hooker Hotel. It's style in very unique and comfortable. The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in in a hotel. This includes the hotel which is willing to sell you their beds for an enormous price. Checking in was simple as was leaving. We will stay there again.
2015-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark made us feel very welcome and told us about Clarksdale and what was happening in town that night.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,A great place to rent for the area. If you do rent must be okay with pets. There was one incident where the dog was loose and approached but wasn’t aggressive. Also the dog got in the pool which wasn’t ideal for me but once I spoke with James about it he was proactive and reassured me that it wouldn’t be a repeat. He cleaned the pool and again which was satisfying for me the rest of my stay. I will rent again!!!

Hannah and John were excellent at checking in and communicating throughout our stay. The rental is located right downtown close to shops and restaurants. The rental was exactly as described and the photos accurate. We liked the two en-suite baths. The beds were comfortable and the linens and towels were really nice. If you are sensitive to night time light you might want to bring an eye mask as the lights that are strung up in the nearby courtyard do keep the bedrooms not as dark as some would like.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved it!!! Host was easy to contact. Great location and very clean! Easy check in. Will definitely book again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ground Zero is a must.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great location.. love the view. Wonderful hosts to work with.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is central to everything and the condo has a lot of space and nice light. The hosts were easy to work with and very helpful. Nice spot!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was amazing. I actually booked the same day and didn’t have any problems. It felt like a home away from home. It was quiet, peaceful and relaxing. I truly recommend staying here if you’re in the area."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Overall great spot. Could've been a little cleaner but that is easy to remedy. I expect the host to address that for the next guest. Clarksdale was very charming. Great coffee shop right around the corner. Red's is a must to attend.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous location and easy check in.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect location to become part of Clarksdale special vibe. We loved the condo and will be back!
2022-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Good location, needs updated furniture, and repairs."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable place in the midst of the downtown art/music district. Good communication, information and resolving of a difficulty we had with the lock"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Good location for visiting Clarksdale. Simple and zero-fuss check-in. A few minor repairs needed, but overall a good stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much for everything! I enjoyed the place!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect very comfortable stay.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was perfect for a weekend getaway for my husband and me. It is very spacious, clean, and cozy."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This property is a beautiful place in a great location. The special touch of seasonal decorations in the shared foyer of all apartments made the place feel warm and welcoming. The host was super responsive and addressed/acknowledged all issues in a very timely manner.
As far as amenities, the kitchen was exceptionally nice. Based on the description, I had made plans to do a lot of cooking and came with a few bags full of groceries to prepare. The dishes (plates, glasses, cups, eating utensils) were adequate and in abundance. As for actual cooking, the kitchen was not as well stocked as I expected with pots, pans, knives acceptable for chopping veggies, towels, paper towels. This required a trip to the local Walmart for a set of pots/pans and a couple of other utensils I needed to cook. If you are eating out, then you will have everything you need. If you want to prepare your own meals and really do some cooking, you will need to bring your own pots and pans. The paucity of kitchen pots/pans set back would not prevent me from staying here again. I would just bring pots/pans back with me."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was nice and clean. Everything has been updated inside even though it is an older building. Love all the space and the privacy of being able to close the bedroom from the bathroom in the 2nd bedroom. We would stay here again. There should be additional rolls of paper towels (atleast one extra roll) somewhere inside of the loft, such as the kitchen, in case extra is needed. The hand soaps in the bathroom and kitchen should be filled up completely before new guests come to stay. The toilet in both bathrooms may need to be bolted down to the floor. Water gets stopped up in the tub as you are taking a shower in both bathrooms and you have to drain all the water after your shower."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! As a Clarksdale native, I thought it was fun to stay downtown! Hannah was totally helpful. Location perfect and actually very quiet!
We love going home to the Delta and will be back!"

Spacious 2BR apartment with separate en suite baths for each bedroom. Nicely appointed living room and kitchen that is great for work or play. Convenient laundry closet with washer/dryer."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"High Cotton has a cool urban vibe, and is right in the middle of everything. Virtually every place in town is a short walk. We were in town to hear some blues, and weren’t disappointed. It is a second floor walk-up with impressive security at both the street entrance and the door to the apartment. We were two couples, so the two bedrooms with two full baths served us well, and the living room and kitchen are large and comfortable. There was ample street parking right outside our door. John communicated well and gave very good, specific instructions for our check in."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For our first visit to Clarksville we sure hit on a gem!
It was walkable to all the blues joints, breakfast spots and restaurants! Would recommend and would return. It is a walk upstairs to the loft so I suppose might be an issue for some but we were fine at our mid 60’s with it. Wonderfully decorated felt like home in all the best ways. Folks in town were so welcoming and friendly! Parked right outside the door."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is fantastic and the unit met all of our expectations. We were so pleased we immediately booked it again for our next stay in town.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were here for a friends daughter’s wedding. This place was exactly as described. Had everything we needed and was walking distance to everything we needed. Host was easy to commute with and answered questions quickly. Will stay here again if back in Clarksdale.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We Love the Blues and really appreciate the 1 1/2 Blocks to Ground Zero and other venues!! Highly recommend Blueberry Cafe for Breakfast🎶♥️
We enjoyed it!
We had a great time and would do it

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location in the city. Walkable to everywhere. 26 steps to get to the upper level. Quiet, clean and comfortable. Would stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice little apartment right on Delta Ave. access was very easy from the sidewalk. It’s part of a group of apartments in what appears to be a late 19th century downtown building. Many of those have just a door on the street leading to a staircase to the space upstairs above public facing retail spots. This is one of those. The space was very up to date and modern. Everything was in working order and appeared brand new. Check in instructions were clear and easy to follow. I wasn’t sure what to do on check out, so I washed the cup I used and locked up. Would recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice space, comfortable, and clean."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place right in the middle of downtown Clarksdale. Highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to enjoy some time enjoying blues music and feeling loads of blues and southern history, this place is perfect. You are just steps from several of the juke joints, good restaurants, and surrounded by the spirits of blues greats! Enjoy looking down on the very streets where music legends walked."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described in the listing great stay. Only downside is you can hear anyone up or down and the outside door.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"clean, comfortable 2 room apartment on the second floor of an old commercial building with character. 26 steps made for some exercise but it felt safe. On street parking was available. place was clean and comfortable with plenty of space and furniture for a group of 6 or 8 to gather, snack, and visit. Bedroom and closet were spacious. Bathroom was clean and modern. Instructions for getting in were clear."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay would do it again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm a Delta girl who comes back here once or twice a year for both work and play. We rented this sweet little loft spot overlooking Clarksdale proper for a one-night turnaround trip to our family reunion in Helena.
Check-in was much later than anticipated due to an accident along the way, but we were delighted to find parking right out front and a lovely, well-lit courtyard next door. Check-in process was seamless. The unit is spacious, well-appointed, and carries a great vibe. The bed and couch are so comfy!
Woke the next morning to the sound of blues wafting up from the sidewalk. Nothing better than a bluesman sitting in a doorway picking on a Saturday morning.
Make your morning coffee stop at Meraki. The house roasts are terrific. The baked goods there are made fresh from scratch by a baking genius named Teddy.
If you've never been to Clarksdale, you're gonna love it here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Even got to enjoy some jazz music from a nearby venue

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to enjoy a very cool, laidback town. The second floor windows looking out on the area are fabulous! As mentioned by others, the stairs are pretty significant, so I'd recommend no large baggage!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I have stayed at High Cotton several times. Always a good experience. John is an excellent host and very flexible.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had some trouble with the code and lock to the apartment but it was easily resolved and not owner’s fault. Someone had activated a lock in a way they were not instructed to. There are some steps if that’s an issue. Great location.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The unit was comfortable and clean. My partner has bad knees and the stairs were difficult for her.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"If you want a comfortable place to stay that is close to everything downtown, this would work for you. You do have some steep steps to get up but they are not that bad. I like being close to the venues we visit to hear music and there are a lot of cute stores right there.
I have stayed at High Cotton several times and would do so again. The furniture is showing some wear in the living area. Also, there were no bathroom amenities (shampoo, body wash, etc.) so plan on bringing some with you.
John and Hannah are very responsive and helpful."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Apt A , the location is the best in town if you like being in the middle of it all - we had a fantastic view of shows at Cathead and Bluesberry, and lovely views over the rooftops of Clarksdale. Massive loft windows and tall ceilings, amazing light all day long, spacious open plan living/dining room, fully stocked kitchen tools and handy and easy combo lock system. John was a wonderful host and easy n clear messager, he even loaned us one of his personal bikes from his other great bnb, Chateau Debris. Can’t wait to come back to this fun and soulful town and stay at High Cotton again."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Great stay! Clean convenient and comfortable. Easy access and simple check-in and check-out. Would stay again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, good a/c which is most important in the Delta.
No bath soap that I could find but I brought my own. Kitchen was good. We brought our own coffee for drip coffee maker, thank goodness. Overall it was a great stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,very comfortable and quiet apartment close to ground zero blues club. 5 stars
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"High Cotton Condos are in the center of downtown Clarksdale across the street from the noted Cat Head Delta Blues and Folk Art. Everything is within easy walking distance.
The accommodations are great, the apartment is clean and the management is very responsive and communicative.
The only issue for some may be that the units are located on a high second floor and there is no elevator. If you have mobility issues this may not be the place for you. Otherwise, you can’t go wrong staying at High Cotton."

The bed was comfy and the wifi was lightning fast. Hannah was quick to reply to questions and checked in with us to make everything was working for us. The apartment is two blocks from Ground Zero Blues Club and around the corner from Our Grandma’s Pancake House. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay while we were in town!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cool, funky place with a lot of character. Gramm is a great host. Be aware the property is on the ground floor right by the street, so you will hear traffic whizzing by at night."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gramm’s place was perfect for our family’s stop through Clarksdale on our history of the blues tour. And it was a plus when we found out that Gramm is a musician! We enjoyed reading through some of the books and reading materials about music and Clarksdale, really well-curated selection! The apartment has a cool vibe, and is very close to Ground Zero and other music venues."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cool and funky place. It's really big inside with high ceilings. But it's cozy. If you are going to Clarksadale then you already know not to expect the typical tourist experience. Gramm’a place has real vibe. And it's got a kitchen and clean bathroom and a laundry, which is very handy. If you're coming to clarksdale for blues music and history, then Gramm’s is THE place to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second stay at Gramm's place and I'm sure I'll be back again. It is an appealing space, convenient to downtown music, and very comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! Great quirky interior, which is more spacious than the photos would suggest. Walk to sooo many of the great juke joints and eateries with no hassles. Gramm was the perfect host. Can definitely recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were pleasantly please with this place. The place was extremely clean, the water pressure and hot water temperature met our desire. We felt save, comfortably warm/cozy, and the bed was perfect (not over used or smell old.) I liked the historic location within the small town, the old building we were in, and having every amenity we could ever want. We even decided to extend our stay one more night! You should try this place! Very unique!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the place and the unique location and room so much, we booked one more night."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gramms place was just down the street from Bad Apple Blues Club and around the block from Cat Head and Ground Zero, which I definitely recommend checking out. We were there during a snowstorm and the indoor fire was cozy and appreciated. Lots of room for activities and the local coffee was a nice touch. Thank you for having us!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic eclectic space in a great location right in the middle of all the Clarksdale fun. Great for artsy, music lovers with its decor and location within walking distance of Ground Zero and the Blues Museum, Meraki Coffee, and Hambone's Art and Music. The space itself is very comfortable with lots of great books for a rainy day, a TV, a very comfy bed, and quite cozy for being an open space. Listening to the rain on the tin roof at night made the stay perfect."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to stay while in Clarksdale. The place was huge and well decorated. We walked to all the clubs. Check in was easy.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,From booking to check out everything was seamless and easy. The space was pristine with great attention to detail and lots of locally inspired and acquired art and literature around to subtly enjoy! It’s close to too many cool places within walking distance to name including awesome food and music venues! Loved it!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Over all great location and responsive to our call as we were having trouble with the lockbox. Had everything you could want plus walking distance to Ground Zero Blues Club-if it hadn't been raining. Would stay again but next time have him help us unlock back door.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Cool pad and great location. The room is more spacious than the pics suggest. Great for a couple of friends but maybe not for a romantic getaway- we had to remove two dead cockroaches from the bathroom when we arrived.. lovely otherwise!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both Gramm's place and Clarksdale are fascinating and cool.
We wish we had decided to stay longer.
Will be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The coolest place to stay in town and a great home base for music and delta day trips. It’s an old store that’s been artfully converted into a comfortable pad. 19th Street Red and his dogs next door are also super friendly.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We, humans, remember our first time at anything new good or bad.
The “Flat”, was our first Air BnB, and it now has set the standard for others to follow.
Loved the place, the vibes and have no complaints
The Flats is authentic and is as advertised, one can anticipate to drop your kit and roll out for the night.
Of course, if the history and Blues experience outside the Flat is the reason for your sojourn well you have landed in the epicenter, welcome to steel guitar Meca.
Hosting is on point, Gramm had a vision for this place and it shows. Best of luck all"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Music forward decor, very colorful, neat, and clean."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We're on a 22 state ""paint in every state"" trip. Clarksdale was a great stop before Memphis. We experienced friendly and welcoming locals. Thanks to local Greg we headed off to be entertained by Deak Horn for the evenings at Reds.
The Blue's Hound Flat had everything. Washer and dryer, lots of hangers, kitchen was complete with a few pantry items, plenty of cookware, dishes, etc,etc. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was great.
We only spent one night but felt a little cheated not being able to spend more time.
And super sorry that we didn't get a chance to meet Gramm!
We did enjoy the Bakery on corner, and th Delta Blue's Museum is well worth the time and offered a great experience.
Thanks for having a very comfortable room for rent!"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"A loft-style apartment in the center of Clarksdale, well appointed, but could use a background cleaning. Also to know, Mondays in Clarksdale are dead! It's best to choose another day and ask the host for their feedback. Communication was very easy and cordial."

Gramm's place had everything we needed for a Saturday afternoon to Sunday stay and is so close to the restaurants, bars and other fun we parked the car and walked everywhere. The loft is squeaky clean with a cool vibe and a comfortable bed, nice kitchen, great hang-out space with multiple couches and a big TV for catching up on football scores and the news.
Everyone in Clarksdale was absolutely lovely. What a gem of a place. We bought some art at Hambone Art & Music, had dinner at Hooker Grocery (delicious), saw a band at Ground Zero (terrific fun), ate a big breakfast at Our Grandma's House of Pancakes, and listened to live blues and picked up souvenirs at Cat Paw before heading out on Sunday. We ran into many of the same people during the weekend and struck up conversations with all. People from Australia, Canada, France, North Carolina...who knew Europeans and Australians love the blues? We will definitely return and book Gramm's place again."

The area doesn't seem to be the nicest but I didn't feel unsafe at any point. It is in the middle of downtown with the museum, a couple of restaurant, and a coffee shop within walking distance. Parking is street parking is easy and right in front of the building. The only issue is the apartment isn't well insulated. Needless to say it was rather cold but there are blankets."

We loved the proximity to downtown restaurants and all the juke joints. Be sure to visit The Bad Apple Blues Club to hear Sean’s history of the Blues and watch him perform, it was the highlight of our trip! We walked all over town and went into almost every place that was open. We seemed to be the only tourists in town, on Wednesday, Dec. 15, to celebrate my birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our visit!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at the Blues Hound Flat! The location is perfect, within easy walking distance of all the downtown music joints. The apartment itself has lots of room to spread out in and the architectural details (from the painted tin ceiling to the exposed brick walls in the laundry room) made it a truly uninque space. The kitchen area allowed me to cook some meals in (and save money so I could tip the bands I heard around town!). Recommend this place for any single traveler, couple, or family of four as it has a queen bed and two futons for sleeping."

Carolyn couldn't have been nicer, and the house was a PERFECT home base for us while we were in lovely Clarksdale. I would absolutely stay there again. Thank you, Carolyn!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very nice and clean. The area was private and quiet and if I ever had to come visit Clarksville Mississippi again I would love to stay here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is very clean and comfortable and the host is available as well as very responsive either phone or text! Nice quiet neighborhood and a few feet from my family which is a definite plus!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,very cool vibe. be sure to check out the light board control above the bed to highlight the cool pics.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. It has a cool vibe and is right in the middle of Clarksdale’s blues. We appreciated all the effort put into furnishing the space.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Property was clean, comfortable and conveniently located. Great experience and will definitely recommend and return in the future!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The Squeeze Box is definitely unique in a good way. The location is perfect. The bed is comfortable but not new for sure. Its not fancy but its a great place to stay. Ill be back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Mark's place was super unique. For those who are really into blues this is the place for you. Only a couple of blocks from Ground Zero and great restaurants. It was a super cool experience. Def top of my list as most unique decor in an AirBnb. Would def recommend !
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect! This place is so cute and funky!
Great location. Definitely will be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay! Everything was as described, clean and hosts were very cooperative and responsive with any questions!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Celebrated a birthday doing the Blues Trail through Clarksdale. This location was walkable to everything, we never moved our car. Great spot and great town, we will be back!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here. It was very well decorated to represent the town. It was easy to walk to anywhere downtown. Hannah met us to let us in and show us around the place; which we were very thankful for. It was clean and just a cool vibe all around. We will definitely be back
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Neat place

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cool place to stay in a really suitable fashion for any blues fan. Overall a very positive experience. I would recommend it!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt this rental was exactly as described and a perfect location. The host was very responsive and even allowed me to get the room an hour earlier. It had all the amenities needed along with Netflix that I watched a lot of, as there wasn't much to do in Clarksdale. Perhaps the Tuesday thru Thursday stay in July caused my disappointment. However I want to fair with the readers that I do believe the days and season you select in this town is extremely important. Example the Stone Pony is the only bar-restaurant open in till 5pm. Yes there is two breakfast locations, but if your looking to keep your car park and enjoy some cocktails just know the Stone Pony is your only option. I end up eating here 3X's because of it. Then at 5pm you may get one other bar that opens, depending on day. Then the blues clubs don't open till 6-7pm, which by then for myself it's difficult to get motivated as I've been sitting around all day. I won't be back, but perhaps your experience is different."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Squeeze Box is a great place to stay. It’s a fun space to hang out and is right in the middle of things, and yet it’s quiet. The decor is super cool and funky, and adds to the whole Clarksdale experience. I was in contact with Hannah who helps manage the property and she was great, and always responsive and helpful. I know a previous review mentioned a mildew smell, which I also noticed, but it wasn’t anything crazy. They even had 2 cold beers waiting for me which was a nice thing to find after a long drive. It’s definitely right on the street (parking is great!) so as I was checking out with suitcase in hand, a homeless woman actually walked into the place outta no where which has never happened to me before, and took me off guard. I calmly just told her I was trying to check out and she had to leave. But there are some characters out and about so just be aware. It never felt unsafe though, and I’d absolutely stay there again and recommend to others. Such a great spot. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Space was as described. Very walkable to restaurants and blues clubs etc...

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’m so glad I picked this space to stay. Everything was within two blocks and the host was amazing!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience great location
2023-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, the musty, “damp basement” smell in this apartment negatively affected our stay. It was very unpleasant.
The positives were that it was a unique space and it had a lot of fun artwork. The location is the major asset as it was close to several restaurants and music venues downtown. It provided the basics that we needed for a very short stay. But because of the smell, we would choose another place next visit."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing spot to enjoy the Blues. Authentic and real. Loved our stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing spot! I lucked out to find it available last minute, and I can imagine during peak time it books up very early.
Loved all the artwork and hanging instruments and unique design of the converted apartment style. It was very clean, comfortable and Hannah made check in super easy."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay again and will be back-
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We can't really say that we visited Clarksdale without sleeping at Mark & Hannah's!
This apartment is part of the city and the blues experience.
The musicians will be amazed. It feels like a museum.
Everything is beautiful, comfortable, and enjoyable.
The best bars are on foot. You can easily park by car.
Hannah recommended us lots of great places to go.
A joy to feel like a local in Clarksdale!:)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! Great communication!
For a very unique place to stay in a very unique town, this is a great choice!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our visit to the little jewel town! Heard some great Delta Blues. Great location!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My goal for the weekend was to immerse myself in the blues. I took a solo road trip from Austin to Clarksdale. weather was sub freezing the whole time. I arrived around 6p and was greeted by Hannah. Super nice, and helped me setup. I was staying at the “squeeze box”. Great place that was exactly as hoped. Great for a couple, but also great for me. The decor was incredibly vintage and fun! Exactly the vibe I had hoped for. Right smack dab in the middle of Clarksdale across from Hambones. Had it not been freezing, would have worked like a charm. The pipes froze so I had no running water. I let Hannah know and she quickly got back to me. She had space next door at The Hooker Hotel. The next morning I made the switch and goodness gracious, it was love at first site. shotgun style with vintage everything, a ton of Charlie musselwhite influence and the great John Lee Hooker. 2 rooms, and super cool. Perfect for my portable turntable. :) if looking for a front row seat to the blues,do it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Eclectic place…focus on blues musicians but other decor just makes it a great place to hang for a few days. It’s not full of bells (my wife complained there was not enough light for putting on makeup, etc) and whistles (although there is a trombone and squeezebox hanging on the wall)…it has soul. I really appreciate that and would return should I come back through Clarksdale. And the only place where the host met me to go over things which I think was a nice touch…welcome to the south ya’ll."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at The Squeeze Box last weekend. Perfect location, awesome decor, comfortable bed & extremely quiet. I will continue to recommend it to friends and family. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really and truly the location was perfect! It was a really cool spot too, lots of neat art and cool touches. It was definitely as described and a great spot to land after a day of listening to the blues. Also, the bed was SUPER comfy!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Squeezbox has so much personality. It is filled with so much fun, music-themed art. The light-up pictures above the bed were my favorite.
Everything was really comfortable. I really liked the variety of pillows. I like a down pillow that sleeps close to the bed. I found the perfect one! The shower head was really nice as well, with good spray and water pressure. These are the details that are often missed and really matter.
The location is incredible. It is right in the heart of downtown. I was able to walk to dinner and coffee in the morning.
I will stay here every time I come to Clarksdale and highly recommend it to others."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I LOVED our stay in Clarksdale!! We inquired about an oven and stove top available, and when he told us the squeeze box didn’t have these features, John was BEYOND accommodating and kind enough to let us stay in the Hooker Hotel instead (the 2br apartment directly to the right of the squeeze box). You will not regret staying at any of John’s properties or a trip to visit Clarksdale!!! The atmosphere of the apartment perfectly fits the vibe of Clarksdale and the pictures are super accurate to the space. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable and the people of Clarksdale are some of the kindest, friendliest people you will meet — even though we were visiting under pandemic restrictions, we were still able to enjoy the walking tour of the historic town, rent canoes from John and Mark at the Quapaw Canoe Company and paddle the Sunflower River, and experience our own private blues concert at the Bluesberry cafe during a live stream virtual concert where we saw local musician David Dunavent (and met the couple who directed/produced the walking tour!! Colleen and David, as well as the awesome owners of the cafe who let us sit in with masks for just a $5 cover!). Without the normal bustle of tourists, Clarksdale was a perfect escape where we were able to safely enjoy a couple days off:) 10/10!!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow!!! This place was unbelievable! Decorated with artwork, photographs, and unique crafts all inspired by Delta Blues, this was possibly the best place we have ever stayed. Amazingly restored and repurposed furniture, such as an x-ray print display light illuminating the bedroom (don’t worry - not the radioactive part of the x-ray!), adorned the entire unit. Right across the street was an intimate but hopping live blues show! Seriously amazed! We will DEFINITELY be back!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Squeeze Box is the perfect, centrally located themed accommodation in Clarksdale. If you want to immerse yourself in the Delta Blues this accommodation is brilliant for achieving this but at the same time is luxurious with everything thought of including a couple of pecan beers and waters in the fridge. Your hosts are extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about the area. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."

John, the property manager, greeted us with 15 minutes notice and gave us the lowdown on the area - restaurants, music venues, etc. In addition to its vibrant music, Clarksdale has a rich civil rights and African American history. Stop into the Crossroads Cultural Arts Center at 332 Delta Ave to speak to Chandra. She's passionate and doing such good work. Thanks for a great stay!!"

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Squeeze Box is centrally located in downtown Clarksdale and easily accessible from Highway 61. From here you are walking distance to museums, shops, and eateries. The space itself is large and uniquely decorated to feel specific to the area, but not overdone. Highly recommended!"

Thank you John for sharing the squeeze box and the blues with us!"
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One can't say enough about the decor. Nicely done! The space isn't necessarily appointed to lounge around all day, but, with plenty to do (within walking distance), why would you? The nights were quiet and restful in the comfy bed. We enjoyed the coffee and ""starter drinks"" in the fridge. Easy access and parking was a nice change from the average hotel stay. We had everything we needed for our stay.
We love this place!"
2016-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Squeeze Box is exactly as described. It is in the middle of downtown Clarksdale, easy walk to the New Roxy, across from the Hambone and around the corner from Cat Head. This was our second time at the Squeeze Box. Fun, funky place. We were here for the Deep Blues Festival and had a great time."

2014-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Honestly, it feels like you are living inside of a jukebox. Music all over Clarksdale and the same charm inside the Squeeze Box. All the amenities we needed and a KING size bed! Right in the heart of the blues! Perfect & so much fun!"
2014-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Squeezebox was the perfect accommodation for us in Clarksdale. Amazing decor, plenty of space and great location.

2013-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and in a fantastic central location. Clean, with great facilities and complete with Funky decor. Amazing sound system that beams around the whole place and friendly cleaners. We did not meet John, but a big shout out to Stan Street in the art shop opposite who let us in and helped us in our exploration of the art, history and music of Clarksdale. Not only is he an all round nice guy, but a great musician too."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Clarksdale! Walkable to the downtown area, but with enough distance to stay quiet. Nice renovation of an historic building. Appreciated the off street parking. Would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,As always the location cannot be beat!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a beautiful, spacious house in an old Temple, on walking distance to the city centre, bars and the Delta Blues museum. A perfect place to stay when in Clarksdale."

2023-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The house was stagged and decorated beautifully. However, the floors were structurally unsound and had soft spots throughout home. The full bathroom toilet leaked, and smelled moist and moldy. Harvey explained that bathroom had work done on it, but he neglected to mention that all the floors were soft and unsettling."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing. It met our recommendations and it gave us more. Location was perfectly placed downtown near restuarants. The beds are very comfortable and the place was cozy. Host was very friendly and very helpful. We loved our stay and will definitely be staying here again during our visits home (Clarksdale, MS)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy place. Great location.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described. The bed was so comfortable. It was cold when we checked in and it took a while to get the place warm only because of the HIGH VAULT ceilings. So the little space heater came in handy for the bathrooms to shower. Overall everything was walking distance and the area was so quiet and peaceful. We parked in the front area and we had NO problems. Great Stay!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location couldn’t be better! Walkable to many venues!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The home was just as pictured and there were no surprises in terms of the pictures and offerings. It’s been recently renovated and the kitchen is very nice with great appliances. Harvey was a great host and was flexible with check in and prompt to address my questions or concerns. As for the beds, they are extremely firm and we didn’t find the beds to be comfortable. Bathroom cleanliness could be better, especially the shower. Also, the wifi is slow, disconnects, required reset and unfortunately just went out a couple of times, if you work remote or need reliable fast wifi, this is something to take into consideration. Additionally we experienced electricity outage in the city, (note this was out of Harvey’s control). Lastly, the flooring in the home is very unlevel and I was very surprised they didn’t take the time to re-level before renovations."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. Everything was walking distance from the apartment.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Harvey’s. It was very nice to have parking and two bathrooms. Walls are fairly thin so you can hear the neighbors if there is someone else staying at the other place. We just used our white noise to sleep. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,69 Delta is great spot. In the heart of downtown & near all the great restaurants & shops this is the place to be!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first priority when staying at an Airbnb is a great bed. Waking up tired from terrible sleep is no fun way to vacation. The beds at Harvey’s are exceptional. My husband and I both slept well each night. This location was exactly what I expected. The kitchen had everything we needed but we mostly dined at establishments Harvey recommended! Having an extra half bath and washer and dryer really added to the functionality of the apartment.
Our purpose in Clarksdale was to hear some genuine blues. When Harvey was asked for suggestions, he not only gave us options for listening, he went “above and beyond” what most hosts suggest. Having been raised in Clarksdale, he recommended local restaurants that were exceptional and local shops where the owners were friendly and welcoming. He was quick with responses and since he was visiting, even came to meet us. We will return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we stayed here for 2 nights while we roamed Clarksdale experiencing the Blues. Within easy reach of everything in town we walked everywhere we needed to go.
The inside is just like the photos and a joy to stay."

Harvey and Karen was very pleasant and accommodating towards us during checkin. I would highly recommend this hidden gem. 5 Stars!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harvey's place is a set of suites in a beautifully renovated historic old synagogue, and we stayed in Suite A. The style is modern but comfortable, even though the space is compact. It is nice to have 1.5 bathrooms (and also laundry available) if you have two couples sharing the space. The kitchen is very workable and the beds are comfortable. Be aware that one of the bedrooms is open to the main living space, so this affects noise for whomever occupies this room. The location is very conducive to walking to downtown Clarksdale and all of the great sights. Harvey was very responsive and helpful with any questions we had and our stay was seamless."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place within walking distance of all of the downtown restaurants, blues clubs, and shops. Very nicely furnished with modern, high end appliances and very nice furniture. It has everything you need for either a short stay or even an extended stay. I definitely recommend it to anyone coming to the area. Even if you are exploring other areas in the MS delta (Grammy Museum, casinos, etc.), this is a great place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautifully refurbished space, steps from Clarksdale's attractions. One of the best-appointed Airbnbs I've ever stayed in, from the kitchen -- the cookware and dishware were fully stocked -- to the bathrooms -- even the toilet paper was high-quality!"
