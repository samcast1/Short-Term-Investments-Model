It is removed far enough from the main Avenue that you have peace, but close enough that access to food, shopping, and entertainment is just around the corner. I had to make a last-minute trip and had something come up. I contacted Luis, and he was extremely helpful and went out of his way to ease my situation. On top of it all, I didn't get in till later the first night and didn't grab food, but Luis saved the day, there were snacks and water. Not the most extravagant meal, but a saving grace nonetheless. Highly recommended if you need to stay in the area."

Because of the ice my wife slipped and fell earlier that evening, so the hot tub was a nice for the muscles! It was underneath the stars had a brisk 12°! The bed was small but super comfortable. I slept like a baby don’t even remember waking up! And as for my wife, she was snoring by the end of night! We actually overslept! The living room area is actually My favorite. It was separated, brother, the rest of the house yet connected to the fireplace.!! Everything was brand new top-of-the-line and will be staying back at this house if we’re ever back in Fort Smith! ! I never give five stars either!! I’m pretty up front but this house I really can’t find a complaint on !! This one is perfect!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved my stay here. It was close to everything and in a quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The patio area with the hot tub was amazing! Beautiful kitchen and living area. Bedrooms and bathrooms were very basic compared to the rest of the home. Host was quick to respond!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home is nicely decorated and comfortable. The kitchen is fully furnished with everything we needed. The huge plus for us was the hot tub which we enjoyed everyday we were there. It was especially nice being out there after the freshly fallen snow. Communication with Mariyem was excellent - immediate and very friendly. Will be looking to stay here again whenever in the area again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mariyem and her place was great! Stayed there to celebrate Christmas with family. She was very proactive and communicated well to make sure our needs were met. The kids had plenty of room to play and our dog LOVED the big back yard!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating. Thank you very much 😊
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was adorable! The kitchen and living spaces are done so well. It’s very livable and great for visiting with family and friends. There is a Roku Tv in the living room so you don’t necessarily have to log in and remember to log out of any of your streaming services. Kitchen was well-equipped and the outdoor space is excellent!
We loved the see-through gas fireplace but had no idea how to use it and there were no instructions.
The lighting in the bathroom is bad. There are Edison bulbs over the sink and no overhead light. For my elderly father, he said the shower was so dark he could hardly see. It’s impossible to put your make up on in either bathroom because the lighting is so poor.
The beds are adequate. The bunk bed is not made for an adult, obviously, so the mattress isn’t the best. But is fine for a few nights.
I would absolutely stay here again because the kitchen, living areas, and outdoor space."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and looked exactly like the pictures. Private fully fenced in backyard.

We would definitely stay again but we do wish it had been cleaner. There wasn't anything hugely disturbing it was just obvious the home hadn't been thoroughly cleaned. Other than that we highly recommend this stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Mariyem's place. It was tastefully decorated and met all of our needs. Mariyem was very helpful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. This is such a beautiful home.
We mistakenly thought there were two bunk beds but there is only one. A misunderstanding on our part. We appreciated the air mattress to help sort that confusion out. We had zero issues.
The outdoor patio area was my favorite feature of the home. Such a relaxing atmosphere. We would most-definitely stay again, and recommend this lovely home to anyone."

It’s centrally located and minutes away from several restaurants and shopping centers. I travel to this area frequently and would definitely book here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an absolutely amazing stay at Mariyem's charming Airbnb in Fort Smith! The cozy and well-furnished space instantly felt like a home away from home. One of the highlights of my stay was definitely the hot tub, it was brand new and was perfectly operational and clean.
The convenience of being near the airport was a major plus. It made my travel arrangements smooth and stress-free. Despite the proximity to the airport, the area was surprisingly quiet and peaceful.
Mariyem's thoughtfulness truly stood out, as soon as I needed assistance she sent someone to help us out within 30 mins!
It's evident that she takes pride in ensuring her guests have an exceptional stay, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay in the cozy blonde bungalow. Everything inside and out was neat and tidy. The best part was because of it being dog friendly. Our dogs had a great time running around the fenced backyard, chasing bunnies and rolling in the clover. The location was perfect. The off street parking was nice to have for unloading. It has all the charm of a historic bungalow while being well appointed with all modern conveniences. We enjoyed our stay, recommend 10/10"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blonde Bungalow exceeded our expectations, it was updated and spotless. We especially enjoyed the kitchen and the staging was great. Jean is very communicative and even went out of her way to get a hair dryer for us which was much appreciated. We will rent again because it was so comfortable and had plenty of room for us to invite family over for dinner"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I’m so glad we found this place to stay! It was cozy and there was plenty of room for the two of us and our two dogs. The house has been restored beautifully! Lots of little touches that made it feel like home. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe. The bed was comfortable.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute little 2 bed-1 bath. It was clean and did remind you of your grandmothers home in the decor. Centrally located....nice remodeled kitchen and it was pet friendly which was the deal closer. It worked out beautifully....close to alot of things

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super easy check in, super cute home. Jean and William have the house decorated cute for Valentine’s Day. Very clean home with tons of extra stuff in case you forget something. They have it all. It’s the coziest home I’ve rented and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very comfy beds. Loved the little reading nook. Would stay again if we return to Fort Smith."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our second stay here allowed us to feel even more at home. The house is near perfection and the hosts prove themselves to be wonderful people. We can only hope this home will be available if we need to stay in Ft Smith again.

Enjoy looking outside or opening up windows the shades are top down bottom up for privacy.
Nice eat in dining room and gorgeous kitchen.
Only thing needed would be more kitchen pots and pans.
The backyard is amazing!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the most family friendly stay I’ve ever experienced. The hosts made sure we had everything we needed for our toddler. He had a blast. Our dogs had plenty of space, and were comfortable as well. Very clean, and accommodating."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home is charming, very well decorated and set up perfectly to make it really feel like home. Just like the home, communications with Jean were comfortable and pleasant. We are already looking for a reason to return and try for another stay....Thank You!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable and clean home. Jean was very responsive and thoughtful. She knew we had toddlers and left a high chair and some toys/books for the little ones.

Even when we received an Amazon package, they went to the house and put the package in the home!!!! I really appreciate what they did!!!! If we ever travel again in that area, we will definitely stay there again!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Erica was extremely helpful and responsive during our stay. The place was absolutely gorgeous and was perfect for a a group to attend a wedding. The area felt very safe and very cute area to walk around!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house. Very clean and organized.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erica's place is the ideal Air BnB. Very Magnolia Farms. There are four perfectly appointed bedrooms each with their own en suite. Such luxury. After a long day of roadtripping, we had plans to go out and look for a cute local restaurant. Instead, we were within staggering distance to Las Americas (?) restaurant where we drowned our traffic stress in chips and delicious margaritas then staggered back to our luxury bedrooms and passed out. I slept HARD in total silence. In the morning I had to take pictures of the pillow brand because I need them for my house. Grandma took pictures of the cushy towels. The next two nights we're in different hotels on our road trip, and I wish so badly we were still at The Porches."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful, four bedroom four bathroom house is located in the most beautiful part of Fort Smith, near the medical school. The setting is beautiful. The house is so lovely and I love the porch with swing. Everyone enjoyed the stay, it was a perfect place to be for my daughter’s Graduation."
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,It was a beautiful place to stay. Beds were comfy and we all had plenty of room.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Highly recommend
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome location and beautiful place. Will stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Excellent value. I’ve already booked my next stay with them.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, well stocked, beautiful little location. Had everything we needed for our one-night stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was all great! Thanks for the lovely stay!
Only thing is I received two different codes for entry and both worked. I was worried thinking maybe one previously used was never deactivated. It was a very safe place. We didn’t felt unsafe even with that concern. Looked like a wonderful neighborhood. I was on the porch around 10 pm on my own waiting for others to make it to the stay and still felt very safe. Thanks"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location with a park within walking distance for the kids, which was great. We had 3 kids with us, and the house was perfect with the front porch and park to play in."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home which was immaculate! Very quiet and spacious for our family! We hope to return!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Airbnb was beautiful! Well furnished and very clean inside and out. We loved being able to sit on the porches to relax when the weather was nice. Great place to stay for a weekend trip with friends or family! Local coffee shop within walkable distance. Minutes from ARCOM, local restaurants, and Walmart for any shopping needs!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, in a great location. Only knocked the review down from 5 to 4 stars because the description was 4 bedroom/4 bathroom. We only had 3 guests so this wasn't a huge deal, but if you were expecting a 4th bathroom for a 4th person. Then you would have probably not been very thrilled.
Everything else was as described if not better! I recommend staying here, just hope the host updates the description."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Spacious and a beautiful place Very peaceful and quiet neighborhood. I love that each room has its own full bath. Will stay again.

Thank you!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home perfect for our big family.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was honestly one of the best stays we have had anywhere! The house is incredibly nice and the layout is fantastic. Not to mention the neighborhood is very homey and safe. If you’re staying around the Fort Smith area— this is the jackpot! You will love it! A big thank you to the owners!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Comfy and warm. Beautifully decorated. Everything was as described. This was our first experience with an Airbnb ever. We will be back. Thank you
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and convenient location. Already making plans to book again
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice, clean, comfortable, well furnished and well kept"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at The Porches. Perfect place if you've got a group that all need to get ready at the same time. A bathroom to each bedroom was perfect for our needs. Great place to stay, I highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed in Erica's beautiful home for 4 nights to attend my son's wedding in Fort Smith. The house was spacious with ensuite bathrooms, very clean and comfortable beds & furnishings. Well worth the money!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay as always.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was beautiful!!!!!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House is very nice, spacious, and pretty clean. I do wish there were tv's in all the bedrooms. The surrounding area is very peaceful and gorgeous. The front porch with swing is relaxing. ACHE/ARCOM is directly across the street. Heritage village with restaurants and some shopping 30 ft away. We felt safe walking, even at night."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,New construction. Very clean. Convenient to local businesses.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was so cozy for our couples weekend! There’s coffee and restaurants nearby if you choose to go out but the kitchen had everything we needed when we cooked at home. We would stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved this place! A great spot to stay if you might be headed back south from a game in Fayetteville or somewhere in Oklahoma.
2023-09-01,3.0,Group trip,"Clean, comfortable beds, good location. Fort Smith has some great restaurants. However, would not recommend for more than a couple or for more than a couple of days. We have stayed in at least 35 Air BnB properties and this is the least customer aware we’ve encountered. Amenities are at a minimum, no wine glasses, no clothes hangers in the upstairs closets. As the house rules state clearly you get a starter set of kitchen soaps, one packet of dishwasher powder, for instance, yet you are asked to start the dishwasher before you leave. A 5 night stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This has got to be at LEAST the 5th time we've stayed at The Porches. We've stayed in multiple units here over the last year or so (this was the first time in a 4BR) and EVERY SINGLE STAY has been PERFECT! The units are ALWAYS SPOTLESS, the appointments are exactly as described and pictured. The location is a longer drive from OUR destination while visiting, but we book it without hesitation each time and are never disappointed. There is an AMAZING park within walking distance, and a small mall area with nice restaurants and cafes walkable as well. All in all, it's a FANTASTIC location and always a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay! Photos matched the location. We had no issues during our stay and the hosts were very kind and responsive.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Have stayed here multiple times. Great host and wonderful Airbnb.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host.
Very helpful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay near Fort Smith. We were in town visiting with family and stayed at Erica's place. The house was clean and well stocked. We loved the ceiling fans in every room. The king bedroom did get a bit warm, but the box fan found in the closet made it much better. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb! Would stay again!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a perfect house for multiple couples in town for a family celebration. Its a very new property, and in very good condition. The 4 bedrooms - each with ensuite baths allow for 8 people to stay without feeling over crowded. The only issue we had was the difficulty the AC had keeping up on very hot days in Fort Smith...but this can be adjusted, and we would have no issue staying at this property again. Overall - a great property."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a full house, with eight adults and an infant—all in town for a family wedding. Having bathrooms for each bedroom was fantastic. The house faces a beautiful shared courtyard, and all of the neighbors were friendly and welcoming. If you intend to cook, bring some staples…there are pots and pans and a good coffee-maker, but it’s not set up with a full pantry or spice rack. We were extremely pleased with the host’s responsiveness and with the rental overall."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great! The house was perfect for our family and we absolutely loved the front porch swing!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, homelike feeling. Close enough to the places we visited. Large enough to accommodate the max guests with visitors. Appliances were modern. Good selection of dish ware. Stairs are steep and narrow but easy to climb. Bedrooms are spacious. Internet is fast enough."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and neighborhood. Erica was friendly and proactive!!
We only stayed one night because we were passing through but my group wanted to stay longer because the place was so inviting! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean house, comfy beds and a safe cute little neighborhood!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Erica & Amanda we’re fantastic; quick to respond & extremely helpful! The Porches are amazing; it was a fantastic stay, with everything you could think to need! I highly recommend booking your stay here! You will not regret it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect Airbnb for our family as we were town for my daughter's wedding! Exactly the set up we hoped for, which helped make the long weekend what it needed to be ♥️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,A lovely place to stay! A beautiful home with beautiful surroundings. It is located within walking distance of the ACHE/ARCOM school. It is a very safe area. The house is spacious and so cozy. I would stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Erica's place was better than we had hoped because it was hard to tell the size of the living area from the photos, and we were concerned it would be too small for our group. It was not! The back porches that fed into all the other back porches and grass area were a hit. We had multiple houses booked between friends and family for a wedding and it was so sweet to get to see everyone hanging out and easy to talk to everyone. And in the early morning, the sunrise is so pretty and it's so peaceful. At night, the torch lights were gorgeous on all the houses. The house was very clean and furnished well downstairs. The upstairs bedrooms lacked furniture, interestingly enough, but the en suite bathrooms for every bedroom are a huge plus. We really enjoyed our stay and thought the area was super charming. The only downsides (and they were minor): no extra blankets for those who got cold at night and a fan in one of the upstairs rooms wasn't working."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. Very nice house, quiet, and peaceful. 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms made 3 granddaughters very happy!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,I have stayed at Erica’s before and will only stay at one of Erica’s places when I’m in town. Everything was perfect and it made for a very smooth wedding weekend.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! We are actually already booking again. Our home had a water leak and we needed a quick place to stay for a few nights. This was a perfect fit for our large family!
Very clean, easy check in and check out. Washer and dryer was a big plus."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a shorty stay but it was wonderful and exactly what we needed for a large group. Wonderful location. Super clean. Would love to stay there again when in Fort Smith.

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This stay was the best that I could’ve asked for on my wedding weekend. I had my professional photographer come and take pictures the morning of my wedding here and I can’t wait to see them! Erica was very responsive to anything we needed and the place was beautiful!

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family had a great stay at this house! It is new and in pristine shape. The neighborhood is perfect for a weekend away with cute sitting porches, local restaurants, and friendly people. Each bedroom has its own bathroom which made it a perfect stay for us as 4 different families (of 1-2) were in our group. Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was so beautiful, extremely clean, and the beds were the most comfortable! The house was stocked with everything we needed!

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amanda and Erica were extremely accommodating. We were set to stay in another property, but the air was not cooperating (it is summer in Arkansas, so not anything out of the blue). They responded within SECONDS of us reaching out to them and moved us to this property, which was bigger than the one we were initially set to stay in. Only 2 of us stayed the night, but Saturday we had a group of girls over to get ready for a wedding and also did photos there. The house was PERFECT and the front porch/lawn was perfect for bridals. Could not recommend ENOUGH."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emily’s place met all of our needs! We were happy enough with it. While the leather sofa was quite hard, the beds were SO comfortable. We all had the best nights sleep we’d had in a long time. They also provided us with snacks and water, which we are so grateful for!
My only real concern is that the home is in close proximity to some train tracks, which meant being woken up early by train horns blowing. This may be a consideration for light sleepers. Other than that, my family was very pleased! Such a great deal for a modernly decorated and newly renovated home :)"

Emily were very responsive and the place was as advertised. It is close to downtown but in a quiet neighborhood. Clean and comfortable. Homey.

2024-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"*I privately communicated this to hosts & was ignored so I have recanted my decision to refrain from a public review*
After two nights at another of the hosts' places, I booked this place b/c the weather was still bad. The back door wouldn't lock and was being pushed open by the wind. I pushed a chair up to it until it could be fixed, but for two days my dog, my belongings, and I were in a place I couldn't lock up. I didn't have much of a choice.
This was after the stay at the other place where the heater
heater broke upon checkin (during freezing weather and ice covered streets). I was fine with space heaters (I get it), but I couldn't leave my dog in the house with the heaters on during the day (as suggested) so I took him to my house & put him in a bedroom while I worked (the point of booking was to separate my male from my female in heat - I couldn't get him to the boarding facility b/c of the weather). I slept in my coat.
No acknowledgment from hosts. Very disappointed."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Plenty about this place I liked. Good neighborhood, quiet, no noise from others in the triplex. Big TV and comfy couch. clean towels and sheets.
Had hiccups with the HVAC unit though. It is just that style machine I'm not a fan of because often you set it but it doesn't actually blow warm even though it's on the sun setting for heat etc. Then after doing it several times to same setting, eventually it'll take. (other airbnbs I had same issue with this type unit)
Unfortunately the beds primarily kept me from giving rating 5 star. The king bed was soft but very saggy, I couldn't handle it. The queen bed was better...it was more supportive firm with softness but it had lumpy areas so took while each night to find a grove I could rest reasonably in."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, will book again when next in town"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I don’t smoke I don’t understand but it was a great place

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here if in town for a short or long while. The space is decorated well- we felt right at home and had most things we needed during our weekend stay. Rebekah communicated effectively and made sure we had everything we needed. Check in was seamless as well.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came from Amarillo, Texas to spend a few days with my teenaged granddaughters. Rebekah's place was clean and cozy with everything we needed. I cooked a lot for the girls--the kitchen had everything I needed and was easy to work in. Even though the place is small, it doesn't feel small at all! Maximum use of every bit of space without clutter.
The back gate didn't latch, and I would have felt better if I could have shut and locked it. Other than that, we had three very nice vehicles out front for four nights without incident, and I walked in the neighborhood every day without any problems.
I hope to stay again and again when I visit my girls!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Having travelled through 5 states to arrive at the ParkHill Studio we appreciated how easy it was to access the studio, check in, and get settled. Our trip was not a vacation but due to a family emergency, so we ended up extending our stay twice and were grateful to be able to move to another unit in the same building for the remainder of our visit. Our hosts were very helpful and responsive to our needs at all times, eliminating more stress from an already stressful personal situation. The accommodations were exactly as described and very clean and comfortable. Thank you, Rebekah, Sarah, Tedd & Emily! Special thanks to Sarah for quickly responding to our unanticipated need to extend our stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tedd, Emily, and Sarah were amazing hosts and we very much enjoyed the house. I cannot express how kind, generous, and accommodating they all were to us. My wife and I were in town waiting for the birth and adoption of our daughter, and Sarah met us the first day with a baby gift and several helpful recommendations. We were both overwhelmed by the kindness. They also went out of there to get us a package that arrived after our stay ended. This was by far the best host team I have encountered on Airbnb. The house was also exactly as described and close to several great restaurants. Green Papaya was our favorite. We highly recommend this house. Thanks again!"

We were a but skeptical when we pulled into the neighborhood, lots of older houses, but it was quiet and felt very safe. their home is exactly like the pictures. It felt like we were in a friend's home, super cozy! the only criticism I have (minor) is the main heat/air was in the living room, so it took a while for the apartment to warm up but once it did it was fine. This is a perfect spot if you're looking for a 2 bedroom airbnb"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is right across the street from Kelley Park Ballfields so if you’re in town for a tournament, it’s a great option. Just a note: there’s no freezer so if you need ice or to freeze your ice packs etc. just keep that into consideration. My only suggestion to the owners would be to do some sort of air filtration, as it smelt of stale cigarette smoke. The owners were great with communication and overall it was an easy stay. The bed is really comfortable too!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"absolutely wonderful place! The price is absolutely worth what you are getting. Amazingly clean, well kept, and overall a beautiful little rest stop.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent place to stay, very close to Fort Smith. Quiet, walkable neighborhood. The bed was comfy and the place was very clean and tidy. I would highly recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host at a good location and excellent price. Would recommend for both short and long stays. 10/10
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I enjoyed staying there. The only knock on the place is the loud furnace. It was like wind tunnel in there. I ended up turning it off and let the place chill down with plenty of blankets to stay warm.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here but the first time since the place had a facelift. The bed is always comfortable and the nice additions definitely brightened up the room. The location is superb for anything going on in fort Smith and I love the place so much I started and extra night.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We always stop here when driving through Arkansas, and for a good reason. It’s one of the most comfortable air b&bs we’ve ever stayed in. Definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cute little room. Enjoyed my stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to break up my drive and sleep! Most comfortable bed and huge TV to really relax! Melissa and Rob were great to communicate with
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a nice stay. Basic garage conversion room, but good value for the money for my overnight stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was incredibly easy to find and access, the hosts were incredible. It was a great spot to stop for the night and just reset before another day of driving. I would definitely stay here again. :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another relaxing stay! Rob and Melissa are the sweetest hosts. I recommend Rob and Melissa’s place.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is described very well by the hosts. Communication was great and when they found out I wasn’t traveling with a pet as initially planned, they initiated a refund for that portion of my rate. The location is easy to get to, easy access to I 40 and near restaurants. The best part of the stay was the bed, it was very comfortable. The cleanliness is hard to rate. While some things seemed very clean, the unit as a whole could use a deep cleaning. Overall, with the price in consideration, it’s a pretty good stay. Especially if you are mainly interested in a place to sleep. I will say that the food smells coming from the adjoining unit are very strong and if you’re sensitive to that, this place may not work for you. I found that keeping the bathroom door closed seemed to help."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect fit for me. I enjoyed my stay. Super close to an event I attended. Hosts were great( thank you for the Pizza/drink😋). The bed was so comfortable. I loved vanity mirror/seat that is a new addition. Used the fridge/microwave/ coffee maker/iron. It was peaceful ,safe and nice and clean. I always bring my own extension cord with many plug ins , that did come in handy. 😃"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little room close to lots of things.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob and Melissa were amazing hosts. The place was comfy and peaceful and easy to check into. I would definitely stay there again:)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,loved our stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely somewhere I would stay again whenever I’m in the area!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was fair. Improvements from my perspective would be to improve the number of outlets available, need for more towels for two night stay as they did not dry, the threshold into the bathroom was dangerous with a two inch rise."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice decor, place was still being finished."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rob and Melissa were very responsive and even promptly refunded us when we other family had rented another place that fit all of us. Will definitely stay again when visiting.

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Was passing through and needed a place to rest. The free welcome pizza was certainly a plus.
Room was ok as it seemed to be a converted garage. Though it could need some refurbishment. Didn't sleep well enough because of an undefined smell in the room. Would not stay there again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a one-night stopover on a long drive and I never had to contact the host. However, both cell phone numbers were posted on the wall by the desk so if a problem arises the guest can count on getting a hold of someone to address it. The Wi-Fi signal was strong and the bed was comfortable. I don't ask any more than that in this situation."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Melissa and Rob were very kind and friendly. Whoever cleans does a fantastic job. The room is in an old garage and is a bit cobbled together and in need of touch ups.
Whomever did the initial decorating did a fantastic job of coordinating the colors repurposing the room and furnishings.
The free pizza dinner was a welcome treat. We felt much safer and comfortable there than in a hotel at a comparable price!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy and quiet little place to stay! Easy check in… the pizza and 2 liter were a DEFINITE bonus. The bed was really comfortable. Communication was quick and easy! You can tell they really want their guests to feel at home.
If I was going to give any kind of feedback to help the hosts is that the place could use a few minor touch ups and a really good dusting. Also, the lights around the doorway, as well as, the solar security light would not come on, so that might need to be changed.
Overall, still a 5 star stay, in my opinion! Especially for the price!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Price was right for a quick stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rob & Melissa were very thoughtful with each response & allowed for a pleasant stay along with complimentary pizza & adjustment on checkout time! We greatly appreciated the price and space provided!

Our way driving across the states! Affordable and so helpful to be able to stay just one night for travelers such as us who just need to sleep in comfort before hitting the road again! Communication was excellent and prompt, this helped our stay go smoothly. The bed was so comfortable and there’s a little of everything one might need for a stay away from home. Fully recommend this Airbnb!"

I always look to see if they are available first if I need somewhere to stay
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Avoid this place!
The best thing was the free pizza... BUT, the place was dingy, needed new paint, new furniture, and the computer desk didn't have a proper outlet.
The bathroom cabinet was filthy, unsafe electric: 2 prong outlets, a three prong outlet had extension cord with multiple appliances and it was stretched out so it hung in the air. This is a basement room that should either be condemned or totally refurbished. Very disappointed with everything except the hot water and free pizza. We couldn't wait to leave and would have not even stayed, but it was too late at night to get another place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay. Sweet little amenities, like shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The hand soap matched the body wash, nice touch. Also, paper plates, paper towels, cups, coffee pot, microwave, small fridge, huge TV with Netflix, Free WiFi. The bed/bedding was super comfy.
Will stay again, when I'm in Ft. Smith.
Thank you! 💜"

The bed frame broke the first night we arrived and Josh had it completely replaced the next day and he left us with some drinks and snacks for the inconvenience. The massage chair is a very cool perk. The kitchen is large and has been remodeled. There could be bar stools for the kitchen counter, a bbq and a few other things for the kitchen. The floor is tile throughout the house and is cold in the winter so bring slippers or extra socks. Overall we were very pleased with Josh and his house and would stay again.

2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"“Cheerful “ is inaccurate. The living area is dark and not pleasantly furnished or inviting. The bathrooms were not clean. We foun whiskers around the fixtures of both bathroom vanity fixtures, and long black hair in the master bathtub. We found 2 wet towels hanging in the main bathroom. I spilled a small amount of water on the kitchen floor. I mopped it up with a paper towel, and the towel was black when I picked it up. The house was so cold that I needed a blanket to sit and watch tv. We were unable to adjust the temperature due to an over ride on the thermostat. We were there for a funeral, so, thankfully, did not ndid"

,,,"The house was great. I have 0 complaints about that. But the issue was with the host. I was in town for work. I booked the whole week with intentions of staying all week. But the job I was sent to town to do was not ready for me. So I was sent back home. I paid for the reservation with per diem. My company is now requesting the per diem back and tedd and Emily refuse to give me a refund. I even just asked for a reduced refund. I paid $375 for the whole week and I only asked for $200 back for the inconvenience and they still refused. Terrible hosts. Never again. Inconsiderate, cold hearted people. Never stay at any of their properties."
,,,"The patio door was broken. WiFi didn’t work. Now here is where this absolutely disgusted us: there was a toenail clipping in the bed upstairs. Found a fake eye lash next to the toilet, my son found a fake finger nail on the floor. Bathroom had mold. The pictures did not come close to what they actually looked like."
