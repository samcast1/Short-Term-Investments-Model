2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located right in the heart of downtown Lawrence, this beautiful historic loft space made for the perfect two-day stop! It’s one of the coziest Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. It was clean, comfortable quiet and directly accessible to Mass Street. Note that the metered parking can be kind of a hassle, but I didn’t mind because it’s not expensive and there were always spots available right in front of the building. There is a parking garage within a block if you want covered parking. Host Jeremy was friendly and very responsive. Highly recommend!"

This was a great place to stay during our trip and if I ever go back to Lawrence, I will be staying here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely a phenomenal place to stay for a concert that runs late into the night. It's decorated very modern, but comfortable-- we felt right at home! The bed is also the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is easily my favorite Lawrence AirBnB. It is a fantastic deal and exactly as advertised. We've stayed twice, and we had so much fun both times. I love being able to walk everywhere."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. It was a bit warm and you don’t have access to the thermostat. I read in a previous review you did so that encouraged me to book. The bed was a bit small and uncomfortable. Other than that I would maybe stay again

He makes sure your stay is as comfortable as possible and it's the best location to stay on Mass! Cannot wait for our next stay at The Suite Life!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay here and just like the first time, it was amazing. We will be coming back again, and again, and again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So easy and great communication:)
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The inside is beautiful and all what we thought we would get, however not good for someone with knee issues. The stairs case was longer than normal. Also, very noisy on Saturday night, parties on Mass Street."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A very atmospheric and very Lawrencian space. Jeremy was quick to respond when I had questions. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about this place or Jeremy. I met him while I was in Lawrence. He was cleaning the next place over. If there was a category above super host, he would be in it. Top 1%"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication, place was very clean and a fun vibe!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was so cute! Really nice bathroom and super comfy bed. Having control of the AC temp was a huge plus, you don’t find that in all AirBnb’s. And it was so nice to be able to walk everywhere! We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Jeremy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite place to stay. The location is great for visiting our kids who live close.
Thanks again Jeremy"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely little loft apartment with lots to do nearby. Jeremy was also super flexible and friendly, would definitely recommend to anyone."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique place, and with a great location. Want to stay again next time we are in Lawrence.
My only complaint is that the bed is extremely uncomfortable so we ended up sleeping on the couch and ottoman."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and very comfortable suite. The loft was spacious and quiet. We stayed one night and the accommodations were perfect for us. Bed was very comfortable. I was worried about light from the large windows affecting my sleep but the window coverings blocked out all street and sunlight. We occasionally heard street noise but even as a light sleeper I was not bothered by it. We looked through his guide on Lawrence and found a delicious bakery that is right around the corner. It’s great to be able to walk not only around the business district but also around campus. If we pass through again we will definitely try to stay here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another great stay. Both of Jeremy’s suites are as advertised. Right on Mass and right in the middle of everything, yet private. Bed is super comfortable too. I wish I had the opportunity to stay here longer than just one night."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy is a great host. Very polite. We’d be happy to stay with him again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is ideal! Aside from a great location, the apartment is just really cool. I love the old rock and brick with exposed wood, mixed with modern amenities. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy was fantastic. His communication was terrific (especially as I was a disorganized guest and had to re-request some information he previously shared). The space was clean and had a terrific location on Mass Street. A great alternative to staying in a hotel while in Lawrence.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing stay in a great location! The stay had such great character and Massachusetts street has so much to do. Felts very safe too, with many doors with locks to enter. Would recommend to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cool spot and a very helpful host.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This studio is in the best location in Lawrence, the price is right and Jeremy was communicative / responded quickly"

We will definitely be back for our next visit to Lawrence.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of restaurants, bars, shopping, coffee shops, and entertainment venues. Beautifully decorated and cozy with an interesting history. Also, the linens were soft and smelled like apples! Had trouble getting in at first, but Jeremy answered his phone right away and remedied the issue instantly. His instructions are clear and very helpful, especially regarding parking. Excellent host and experience, 100% would stay again and hope to in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy’s place is very clean and comfortable and in an excellent location with plenty of shopping, sightseeing, and restaurants and bars within walking distance. Great care is taken to provide a comfortable, safe place to stay. Bed is super comfortable, linens are divine, he even provided us with an additional portable air conditioner (it wasn’t needed, ac worked great). Everything was really fantastic! Where he really stands out is communication - very clear and comprehensive instructions, kept us up to date on everything. I highly recommend a stay at Jeremy’s- you’ll be very pleased."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Perfect location, has everything you need, and Jeremy was very helpful."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Couldn’t have asked for a better location! We stayed during Busker Fest, when Mass St. right in front of the location was blocked off. Jeremy was great about communicating what free and convenient parking was available, before I’d even thought to consider the issue. The place was clean, full of information about things to do in Lawrence, and had lots of character. Would not recommend for those who have trouble with stairs or those who want a kitchen to cook in, but for everyone else, don’t hesitate to book this space!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This a beautiful, unique space in a historic building. The bed and pillows were among the most comfortable I've experienced, even better than home! I couldn't imagine a better base from which to explore Lawrence."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great price! Jeremy provided clear instructions, and great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. Bed sheets were incredibly comfortable! One small disappointment was not having a “kitchen” sink to wash off dishes, fill water bottles, etc and only the bathroom sink was available which was a bit small and awkward to access. Overall a great place to stay in the middle of all the action!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"awesome loft for a weekend on Mass Street and visiting family. enjoyed the space, just what we needed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in a perfect location. Just what we needed. Nice attention to detail and architecture. Definitely will be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a neat and convenient place! Steps away from our favorite food and shopping. The place was spotless and easy to get into. Jeremy left some literature on things to do in Lawrence which came in quite handy!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great place and Jeremy was excellent to communicate with, he was very responsive and helped with issues promptly."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Na
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended!!! Beautiful little spot above downtown.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in a fantastic location, the host was wonderful. I'll stay there again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Wow! Wow! What an amazing property. I felt incredibly lucky that I found this listing. It was everything and more. I was visiting Lawerence for my son's Mom's weekend and didn't think that I would actually use it that much because I had so many activities planned. Boy, was I wrong. The property was so impressive that I actually wanted to just hide away in it and have myself a wonderful staycation!
To start off Jeremy was an amazing host. He was extremely quick in his responses that I felt like I wasn't left alone trying to navigate my way around the property. I told him that I just had knee surgery and he was very caring about how I would handle the stairs.
The property itself was gorgeous and immaculate. It was classy with a fun twist. I couldn't have found a better location. It was right above my favorite store on Mass St. My son and I were able to pop in and out while shopping and eating around downtown.
If i could give this 10 stars, I would."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in downtown. Convenient restaurants and bars, good parking in back. Used the app Jeremy recommend and only paid one dollar for parking. Would definitely stay again. Jeremy was very friendly and responsive!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful little space with gorgeous architectural character. Clean with pristine linens. Was able to reserve last minute with no problem. No kitchen, but there are dishes and fridge/microwave. It looks out on Mass St., which may not be ideal for some - but perfect for those that love that type of thing. Curtains maintain the privacy. All in all I would jump back to it next time I want to spend time on Mass."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommended! Thanks Jeremy hope to come back again soon.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy's place is in the heart of downtown, right on the main strip. You will have plenty to do. Apartment was what was advertised, clean, spacious, with some unique features. If I have an opportunity I would definitely rebook."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, perfectly clean, comfortable bed, excellent stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful condo in THE BEST location in Lawrence. Walkable to everything, beautifully decorated, great bedding and all the comforts of home. Jeremy was extremely responsive and an exceptional host.
We will look to stay here every time we visit from KC."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down, the best Airbnb experience I've ever had!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host and a lovely loft !
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Our second stay here and we will be back again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommending it to anyone that plans to visit Kansas/Lawrence area. It felt really nice to venture on the Ave and when I was ready to go back it was a quick walk and I’m home. And the bathroom is amazing lol I really liked the stone work. Everyone was friendly in the town and the food and bars were great
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First things first, Jeremy's place was absolutely amazing! Spent a little over a week at this lovely place & we both lo0ved every bit of it. Jeremy is the perfect Host, he was always quick to respond to any questions I had & I felt very taken care of. I can't recommend this place enough, will definitely be staying here again when the time comes!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place in the heart of downtown Lawrence. Comfy bed and furniture. Hip, vibrant decor. Perfect for a night or two in Lawrence!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay. Great location with so much to do and see in downtown Lawrence right out of the door. Clean and comfortable and the host was friendly and great with communication.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay here. I always enjoy staying in Jeremy’s place. He’s a great host. I’ll definitely be back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. So convenient. Would definitely recommend if staying in lawerence.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, in a very ideal spot. Parking garage one block away for free. Every restaurant was delicious and affordable. All of downtown is at your front door."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time here and it was just as fabulous. The location is prime, the amenities provided are thoughtful, the decor is stylish, and the door codes for access is easy to use. We are excited for our next time we get to stay here. I highly recommend Jeremy and his suites."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Right from the very beginning Jeremy was the most thoughtful and outgoing host, probably the most insightful initial messages from a host I have received. Honestly, everything was taken care of so well that we didn’t need Jeremy’s assistance, but I feel like he would have been immediately responsive had we required something.
The space itself was so clean and ready for our arrival, it had just the most amazing feel and atmosphere. For us, it was the small attention to details that really made this place stand out and you’d just have to stay here to understand. Also, you could not pick a better location to stay - you walk out the door and you are right there in the middle of it all on Mass street.
Easily a 5 star stay, and we agreed before we even went to bed that night that we would be retuning to stay again. If you’re wondering if this is the right space for you…just book it, you won’t regret it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"For us at least, this is about the perfect air bnb venue. Granted it does not have a kitchen but we don't need one; just a small fridge which was great. Jeremy piles on the info and communication so you have no worry about what to expect. The bed was perfect, the view very nice of the activities on Mass street. Clean as a fiddle. Accomodations were value plus; the furniture was very nice and comfy. Top top top rating on this place."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,GREAT LOCATION! Very clean place and the bed was super comfy!! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I hadn’t been back to Lawrence in almost a decade since college. The location was great to walk up and down Mass st. There is always so much to do and many shops to wander in and out of. The space was unique and very clean with the right amount of amenities. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night here, but it was worth it! It was roomy, and the location is smack dab in the middle of all the goings on at Mass Street! I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in the heart of massachussets street. Extremely cozy and the pictures don’t do it justice. We will be back and hopefully be so lucky to stay here again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Jeremy is a fabulous host...very clear with everything and super responsive. We loved it!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time! The walls are kind of thin so you can hear others pretty clearly so you also have to be really quiet. Overall it was a great stay! Perfect location and great vibes.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my stay. Jeremy’s place is in the heat of downtown Lawrence. Lots of bars, restaurants, and shops within easy walking distance. Jeremy was very responsive and helpful. Look forward to coming back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Centrally located on Massachusetts, clean & comfortable, historical building elements with modern fixtures and plenty of amenities."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to explore downtown Lawrence!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We always wanted to stay on Mass when we lived in Lawrence, and it was fantastic to find this place right above one of the coolest art shops in town. Definitely the best location you could stay if you want to be in the bustle of LFK. The only thing that surprised us was the exposed rafters and how much the building creaked. We did, however, stay on the coldest night of the year and the building is historic, so it was understandable. Would 100% stay again if looking for a place on Mass. Jeremy was one of the most detail oriented hosts I have met and gave us an insane amount of info prior to arrival. Fantastic host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place right downtown. Easy walk to both ends of downtown but immediate area is free of loud bars. Loft and amenities were well thought out.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This suite is perfect for a short trip to Lawrence for 1-3 people with little luggage. Like the post says, there is no full kitchen but there was a table, small fridge (with bottled water), coffee maker, single-use cutlery and microwave. The stairs are a little steep going up to the loft so don’t bring heavy bags. A is similar suite would cost more than this at a hotel. The high ceilings make the space feel surprisingly large. Location is perfect. Parking was easy to find close by. Host provided lots of information."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here recently, and had a relaxing time. The property was just as described, just a bit smaller than I expected but still very cool. Comfy couch/sitting area, soft blankets and pillows, really nice huge windows and close to everything downtown. The only con I found is that you can't control the temperature in this unit, it's controlled by the other unit - so it would go from freezing to extremely hot. (a space heater was provided so I used that instead of messaging the host). Overall I had a nice stay, in a cool property and would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If the place is available I will be staying there in the future top-notch!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft was exactly as described in the listing, Jeremy was easy to communicate with, and the overall location was ideal for the stay. Inside the loft, Jeremy provided notecards with features of the loft and included local guidebooks with excellent recommendations.
The furniture and bed were all very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower wasn’t the strongest but it was a bonus that two different types of shower heads were available. Accessing the actual loft was very easy with keyless, lock pad entry.
We came specifically for the Christmas parade and Jeremy was nice enough to delay our checkout time so we could watch the whole parade from inside. We had the perfect view and could even hear the announcers.
This is a wonderful loft and we will definitely be back again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love staying here. The location is perfect for us to walk to restaurants and close to where our kids live.

We chose this space to stay because it was located downtown and within walking distance of The Granada Theater, but we were also able to walk to several shops and restaurants. Even though it was located right on Massachusetts St, it was super quiet! Jeremy had everything clearly marked within the suite and provided a detailed visitor's guide. I really enjoyed having bottled water provided in the fridge when we arrived too! Would definitely recommend!"

Their home was in walking distance (for us) to all of the places we wanted to go in downtown Lawrence.

The hosts had muffins for us each morning, which was a nice touch."

Erich & Amy were awesome and made us feel right at home immediately. Pictures do not do justice to the warmth & charm of the house. It was very clean - which is an important criteria for me. Our hosts were extremely personable & accommodating.
We slept great in our cute & unique room. Our stay ended with Amy’s famous breakfast muffins, OJ, and even a latte. We’d definitely recommend this B&B to any out of towner. Thank you Erich & Amy for your incredible hospitality- you went over and above our expectations!"

They met me with smiles and gave me a quick tour of amenities and features of the place. I made great conversation with them that me feel welcome, and learned a lot of cool things.
The entrance is private and easy to access by car. The surrounding area has a lot to offer.
My room was on the top floor and i had a good time staying there. It was quiet, clean, and comfortable to rest. There are a lot of amenities and access to some shared spaces that make the the stay sweeter.
Speaking of sweet, Amy made awesome muffins for guests the morning i left. They were delicious and I had a good time hanging out with Erich during breakfast.
This is a definitive AirBnB experience, well worth it in a cool town. Would def stay again!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was made to feel very welcome by everyone here but it would be understatement to say only that. From arrival I felt like part of the household. For example, Amy offered the dining room so I could host a lunch for a friend in town. The guest fridge was priceless since sharing food with family and friends was a big part of my trip. Being able to read in a comfy chair in the living room was a relaxing gift at the end of a long day driving. I enjoyed Amy's delicious fresh-baked muffins a couple of times.
This is a large and graceful older home that more than bears out the photos. It is close to the most visited parts of Lawrence: less than a mile from the University and downtown, as well as being surrounded by streets that are calm and walkable. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Erich and Amy were lovely hosts and graciously accommodated an early check in so my friend and I had more time for dinner before our concert.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Erich was great to work with. I had to make last minute changes and send someone else in my place and Erich was very accommodating. The space was great for what it was needed for (overnight before Freshman orientation at KU) with only some minor concerns, which were not unexpected for a room in a historical home. Also, the lock on the room was not very secure and could not be engaged from outside, which was a cause for concern."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay with Erich and Amy at their home was phenomenal. I stayed in the cherry room on the third floor and it was a quiet and comfy room with everything I needed and a private bathroom. I love the architecture of the home and its charming character. I got great sleep and I hope to stay there again. This place gets my highest recommendation. Also, the latte and muffin in the morning was delicious. The beans were so fresh and tasty."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Erich and Amy were lovely hosts. I stayed for a week and this really felt like a home away from home. They know Lawrence well and had great local food recommendations. They were also very responsive and communicative. The location is great, too--a very easy walk to the grocery store, and you can walk nearly anywhere downtown or on KU campus in 30 minutes."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with Erich and Amy for a week. They were lovely hosts, very walm and welcoming. I felt right at home! The house was pristine and exactly as advertised. The location could not be better: right next to a supermarket, the University is about 15 mins walk, and there is plenty of bars and restaurants about 10 minutes up the street. Would definitely stay again if I'm ever back in Lawrence."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! Beautiful house in a great location at an affordable price. Everything we were looking for!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My stay at Eclectic Queen Anne Revival-The Cherry Room in Lawrence Kansas was absolutely amazing! The room was perfect for two guests, with a private bathroom that made everything so convenient. The hosts were a lovely couple who made me feel right at home. Plus, the location was just perfect – I was able to walk to the school for my college orientation, and there were plenty of other tourist attractions within walking distance as well. I also appreciated the flexibility of being able to use the kitchen during my stay. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Lawrence!"

Rooms are clean and private as well."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I actually stayed in two different rooms at Erich's under different reservations, and my experience was great. It's walking distance to the cool part of Lawrence while still being very affordable. The place was quiet and clean. I don't usually stay in someone's home, but this was so well located, and I'm glad I did."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a brief but very pleasant stay. Will book again if I come back to the Lawrence area.

Erich always greets you at the door and Amy has fresh muffins and coffee ready in the mornings….what else could you ask for? While this is an older house with its own kirks, it is extremely quite and you really do have your own space. Can’t wait to stay there again."

On a rainy day, they also lent me an umbrella, which saved me from getting soaked. It was just one of the many examples of their exceptional hospitality.
Location-wise, this house is in a great spot. It's close to a grocery and it's also conveniently located near the university.
Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone. The hospitality, delicious breakfast, and convenient location all make for an amazing experience."

I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s in Lawrence and this one has been by far my favorite! 🌟"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great stay! Six stars.😀
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We lived together for 2 months and spent a day or two thinking about what I could do. First of all, they accepted us as an individual of their own family. We came as father and son. We were out of English. We were strangers in many ways. They invited us to all their activities, all their lives. They introduced them to their friends. They supported all our challenges. We cooked in their kitchen, did laundry, and celebrated the 4th of July. It couldn't have been a better choice for us. We learned a lot about how to behave and what to say. I want to mention one by one. Amy is truly a superhero, a solo army can do her job and also have a time for you. Even the cheerful beer doesn't diminish. Erich is a calm and fun person, he let us into many areas of himself, we played in the living room, we ate at the table, chatted;) Cathrine's daughters won our hearts with her English speaking, kind and kindness to my son. I have no doubt that the future will be a very bright young man. When we met Spencer late, his humility, musical talent, and respectfulness increased our hopes for the new generation. Of course, I can't tell the dogs about Atlas. She is a total love, she has a pure heart. We can call it my first dog love in my life;) Overall it was very difficult to leave this house where I lived for two months. I hope our communication will always continue. Always keep smiling faces… We love them so much…"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely hosts, beautiful home, and easy, comfortable walk to historic downtown Lawrence. The Watermelon suite is a treat, but any room is clean, quiet, and nice. Worth finding this place and ask about the bakery near by for great coffee and bread. You want to stop in again at this perfect Airbnb property!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erich and Amy's place was perfect for our quick trip to Lawrence. The room was exactly as advertised and was perfect for my daughter and I to share.

Since we had to head out early, we missed her famous muffins...maybe next time! Highly recommend Erich and Amy's place!"

Amy’s breakfast muffins were delicious & served with lattes made with locally roasted coffee beans; the best way to start a road trip day. Amy even made us double shot lattes in our travel mugs for our early morning departure. Thank you Erich & Amy

I would recommend this AirBNB to anyone who is traveling to Lawrence, Kansas."

They went above and beyond to help me feel like I had a home away from home during my stay. The home itself is beautiful.

I will be returning to Lawrence in April and plan to stay here again. Highly recommend!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with great historical architecture and details. The host couple was so very accommodating and lovely to interact with. I will absolutely rent from them again the next time I come to Lawrence. My room was on the 3rd floor and even though there were other lodgers, it was very quiet and I was able to rest well without interruption. That's not always easy to do since I'm a very light sleeper. The room had an on-suite bathroom with an adorable clawfoot tub/shower. The pricing was very reasonable and I feel, a good value."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a quick trip but me and my grandparents enjoyed Fernando’s place! It was clean and easy access and the decorations are adorable! Convenient location as well, would recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, easy to walk downtown. Fernando was very helpful and proactive about making sure we knew how to get there and where to park!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fernando was an incredible host! He responded kindly to any queries we had, but to be honest, there weren’t many (aside from asking about the 24/7 gym, which he offers free of charge!) because the place is incredible! It was so nice and well kept, and we were blown away by what a steal it was for the price. The location is also great; you’re steps away from mass st and very near campus. I imagine it would be pretty loud on a weekend during the school year (Tennessee St is one of the big party streets for the undergrads but we stayed here in the summer so we evaded them), but Fernando has truly thought of everything and has a jar of earplugs if needed! Cannot recommend this stat enough, and we’ll definitely try to snag this place again when we come back to visit the alma mater"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fernando’s place was just like the pictures. It was clean, had everything you need in the kitchen and very comfortable beds. There were great instructions. The monopoly place was a great location and close to mass street, shops, and restaurants. When we stayed it was pretty quiet and calm. My kids slept great and so did we. We would definitely stay again!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We traveled from Pearlan, TX, to attend the Chiefs game in celebration of my birthday. Fernando was aware and out of the kindness of his heart decorated for my birthday
with a banner and balloons. We were very comfortable and felt at home on top of feeling very special. We would have stayed there the entire time we are here but needed to be closer to the stadium. We definitely would be back and stay at his place. I highly recommend Fernando's place."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment matched the listing and was well furnished, even if a little minimalist. We did not use the kitchen more than for tea/coffee, but if you were looking to cook a bit more you may want to bring some supplies. The bed was super comfy - maybe even a little too plush! Shower had great water pressure. Check in/out was easy. It is a garden-level apartment near more a ""student-oriented"" neighborhood, but we didn't have any issues with that - so fear not if that's your concern! Very walkable to Mass St as well as campus."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, exactly as advertised. The apartment was comfortable, spotless, and well appointed with coffee and tea.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for a bike race, originally booked here due to proximity to the startline, but race organizers moved it to another location - no big deal, super easy to get around, the place was great - clean, relatively quiet, covered all of our needs nicely. Great hosts, easy communications, very functionally appointed kitchen made it easy for us to prep our meals and rest effectively before and after the event."

You won’t be disappointed so give Fernando’s place a chance if you come to Lawrence, KS!"

I would definitely stay again for a future trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Fernando's place. Very comfortable and welcoming. The decor was fun! He is a wonderful host, responds very quickly to questions and always ready to answer more. The kitchen was well equipped as we like to cook for ourselves. The huge screen in living room was a great treat. And we all loved the small quiet office space in one of the bedrooms. It was used by a few of us as a place to be alone or to use a computer or to write. The beds were comfortable and the sheets soft. Air-conditioning perfect as it was really hot outside. From Fernando's you can walk to the City swimming pool as well as the lovely Wheatfields Bakery for a nice breakfast or lunch.
We've stayed in a number of places in Lawrence over the years visiting family and Fernando's is the best. And the price was great. Thanks"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When my family and I arrived, Fernando’s place was spotless. My mom couldn’t herself and took lots of pictures.

I definitely recommend Fernando’s Airbnb for family visits to KU or vacation stops!!"

We definitely would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was nice and clean and in a good location. Great to walk to stores and restaurants during the day in the area. In the evening there seems to be a lot of active homeless walking around, didn’t have any problems though."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay.!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fernando has proven to be a great host by responding quickly to requests . Impeccable space with all the amenities and welcome pampering. My family and I felt safe and at home even away from home . Would definitely recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. Everything was very accurate as described. The host was very friendly and welcoming. The location is perfect especially if you are planning on visiting downtown, it was a quick walk and we felt safe walking in the neighborhood even at night. We only used one of the two bedrooms, but the bed in the blue room was so comfortable, it felt like sleeping on a cloud! If we ever need to stay in Lawrence again, we will definitely try to stay here again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, and host was extremely friendly and quick to resolve any questions. Would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was exactly what we wanted it to be- it was close to downtown, very clean and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had great stay! Fernando was very up front with expectations of outside noise. We have kids so we had no issues with noise. We enjoyed the local restaurants and shopping. It’s the perfect place to stay for a weekend. We were moving our daughter out of her dorm and just needed a place to crash. It was a home away from home. Thank you!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fernando is a great host. He's responsive and accommodating. This unit is nice and well appointed. As of our stay, everything is newish and works well. The linens in the bathroom are fluffy and new. The TV is huge and has a great soundbar. The walls and ceilings are thin, so the talking, TV, music, etc. (the general natural noises) from the neighboring units is loud, but he supplies ear plugs for that. As someone else mentioned, there is no dining table. There is a small pull-up counter in the kitchen, but, surprisingly, there is only one chair in the unit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Fernando’s place. The place was spotless and everything seemed new and very aesthetic. The bathrooms were clean and well stocked. The place also had a kitchen with all amenities, which was super convenient. It is also located on Tennessee St, close to all the local restaurants and pubs on Massachusetts St. An absolute steal for the price, and will definitely consider and recommend staying here if you are visiting Lawrence."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean apartment and a great location. Within 10 min walk to several restaurants. Host was very responsive to my questions.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a clean and well cared for place. The parking was great. It was quiet and easy to get in the property. There were a few bumps in the road. The listing says toiletries such as soap, shampoo, conditioner, wash cloths are provided but there were none. Fernando responded and brought them by but it was a pain not having those things at 8 AM when I was getting in the shower. It said the wifi did not need a password, which is true, but it wanted my full name, email address and DOB which I was not comfortable providing to a strange network. The other strange thing is the only place to eat is a fold out counter with one chair—there’s not a chair for a second person. Overall it was a nice place with a few misses but I would recommend it to others."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fernando was an AMAZING host!!! Extremely accommodating, my son had surgery and wasn’t doing well, we needed a place last minute and needed access hrs before checkin. Fernando accommodated us no questions asked and waived the early check in fee. The apartment was spotless, theme was cute and the beds were comfortable! Will definitely book again when back in the area!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ari's place was not fancy, but it met our needs. The rental is located in the backyard of the owner's house. It has an open floor plan with minimal furniture and essential amenities. The kitchen area and appliances are fairly small. The air conditioner keeps the main floor cool, but the upstairs loft where the bed is can get quite warm. The little floor fan helps. Be careful not to hit your head on the sloped ceiling when you get out of bed. The house is in a nice location on a quiet neighborhood street. It's about a 1 mile walk to Massachusetts Street. Ari and his family are super nice and we enjoyed our conversations with them in the backyard. I thought the price we paid was a little high for what we got, but that could be due to high demand during KU graduation. If you're looking for a simple place with nice hosts, this should do the trick."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Plenty of room, lots of character, very friendly and pleasant hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet neighborhood. Great space. Comfortable and clean. Nice kitchen if you cook

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay. This place is one which is call the AirBnb OG, ad it started.
It was someone’s space, had its own personality and style, in someone’s garden as opposed to a commercial investment with minimum care."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is so lovely and perfect walking distance to downtown! My friend and I are KU alumni and stayed here together while we were visiting. The architecture is way cool; the skylights make it feel open and spacious yet cozy. Impressive library and thoughtful hosts. We used both beds including the memory foam downstairs and both were incredibly comfortable. We want to stay here every time we’re in town!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lara was an exceptional host. She was very responsive and quick to provide restaurant recommendations. The location was ideal for us! It was close to Mass. Street and campus, but still tucked away enough to feel serene. The condo was beautiful! Very clean and well laid out with plenty of natural light. The loft bed was super comfy and the living room area was a perfect spot for morning coffee and reading a book! Would definitely recommend it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent stay in this sunny spacious apartment! We made good use of the well-stacked kitchen and really enjoyed walking in the neighborhood.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and such a cozy place so close to Mass St and only 25 min walk to Memorial stadium.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property was clean and as described in the listing. Neil was very accommodating allowing an early check in for us. The property is located beside a trail and playground— perfect for morning runs and a place where my son could play. Walkable to downtown, quiet and clean. We enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Neill’s place was exactly as advertised! It’s primarily designed for handicap accessible people. Beds were firm but comfortable. Bathroom was ADA designed (wide open area with huge shower). Overall the place was small but cozy.
The only downsides were things out of his control: water pressure was low. The bathroom light and vent work off the same switch, and the parking lot/road did not have a sign at it so our map app said ‘turn left HERE.’
All in all, great place that we will rent again if/when we’re in Lawrence next time!"

It really did help us out. AND we won the overall championship!!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was perfect for an overnight stay in Lawrence! Super easy access, free parking on site and very quiet community. It was clean and comfortable and fairly close to downtown! We ubered to mass but you could certainly if you don’t mind a 30 minute walk. (We were on a time crunch and it was kind of cold otherwise we would have walked or taken the bus). Thanks Neil for a great spot! Will definitely consider staying here again!"

Nice touches with amenities like shampoo/conditioner/body wash and laundry machine with detergent. Host is very responsive and made everything easy.

I pass through pretty often and plan to stop here with my 5 yearold on my next road trip."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Neil’s place was great. Location was ideal, comfortable beds and sofa, clean and stocked. Personal thank you for not caring that the kids and grandkids came over. It was wonderful. We hope it’s available the next time we come to Lawrence. Thank you again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space is perfect. it's a very cheap drive to downtown or KU, but it's far enough the way that it's so quiet. if you come with a family you are literally next door to a park that has a splash park, and if you go to the back porch in the evenings there's a table and two chairs in a big completely enclosed courtyard! it's always clean, they charge a cleaning fee and don't ask you to actually do anything - I still like to help because they're just so nice!
Communication is excellent! I had to reset the TV (just like all TVs need reset sometimes, there was NO issue with it!) but they still came out and offered to look at it had there had been a problem. They are so quick to respond and always available, but never in your space and respect your privacy.
I was telling the owner, that even though it's smaller than our actual family home my kids absolutely love this place. what kid isn't going to love a place with a big bed right next to a park and an enclosed courtyard where they can run freely??
as an individual, it has everything you need. it's always stocked on coffee, creamer, cups as well as shampoo, conditioner plenty of towels. I've never seen an insect, linens are always definitely clean.
A+ and 5 stars!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and so convenient if you’re wanting to explore Lawrence. This was my 2nd time staying here and it’s so easy/quick to get to Mass St. but far enough away where you can enjoy some peace and quiet. The beds are always super comfy. There were great smelling air fresheners around the house but I liked that they were not overpowering scents (sensitive noses will appreciate!) I also love that it’s got two reserved parking spots so when my friend and I both stay we each have a place to park. Definitely will book again next time I stay in Lawrence!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This place was a perfect place to stay! We should have booked a day longer. The town was so cute and we had fun exploring! Would definitely come back if in the area again. Townhouse was easy to enter and everything inside was clear when entering and leaving.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome stay, great people. thank you"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"When you are on the road, you usually end up in some cramped room or house. This spot was spacious in every way - the living room, the bedrooms, the height of the ceilings. The space lets you relax immediately when you walk in. The TV is big as well and just the right distance from the sitting area. The brick interior was classy and the work table and games allowed for mixed use. Yes, it is on the east side, but very walkable into Massachusetts Street and Lawrence Brewery is just next door. You won't go wrong with this pick."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this space for our family of three for a night in downtown Lawrence. Very fun!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, good setting, clean walkable to restaurants and coffee. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
- Incredible location for walking downtown
- Comfortable queen size beds
- Industrial cool aesthetic
- Quick, easy communication with hosts
- One floor layout
Cons:
- The industrial cool aesthetic includes very limited furniture:
— No chairs in the bedrooms
— Not enough living room-type chairs for four people to watch TV in the living room (we lined up 3 on the hard couch, and one sat in a desk chair or lay on the floor)
— Need more lamps in living room and on bedside tables
Overall, the location made this very clean Airbnb worth it for us 4 healthy people; we walked everywhere. But I personally wouldn’t recommend it for six people or for travelers who want to hang out comfortably in the living room."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The loft is spartan, but clean and had what we needed.

Checking in and out was hassle free. Thank you! We enjoyed our stay and we'd stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was even better in person. Quite and games to play in the loft. Easy access to parking and for unloading the vehicle.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was neat. It has extremely tall ceilings in every room. It’s got a cool vibe with the giant tv, velvet couch, and art on the walls. The main issue we had is that when we arrived at about 4pm, the air conditioning was off. It was 80 degrees in the Airbnb. The high for the day was in the mid-80s which is way too warm to have the air off. We immediately turned it to 70, and it took 2 hours to only go down 3 degrees. When we came back to the Airbnb at 1:30am, it was 75 degrees. This was really frustrating, but it was also the only real complaint we had about the place. It did finally go down more by the next morning."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is better in actuality than the photos. Spacious, well equipped, secure and private, yet conveniently located to a great part of Lawrence. We had so much fun staying here and there really is no aspect I would improve. Highly recommended with any reservations!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cool spot and as a former local, it was a bonus that downtown Lawrence was so close. I was also there for some on-campus events and it's a quick cab ride, around $10. All of the communication was timely and clear, and that's worth a lot with Airbnb. The place was in great shape and had a creative vibe that was just right for our group. I'd happily stay at any of their properties again - it was a great weekend in Lawrence!"

The bedroom was on the second floor it was very warm even though the vent was closed and the window was open all day.
My only suggestion would be to move the dresser to the closet and put the small fridge on top of it.
That would the space in front of the window usable for a portable a/c unit in which the renter could use the a/c or fan.
We had fun exploring Kansas and Missouri and would recommend this Airbnb for others!"

I would absolutely want to book again if I re-visit and hope they’ll contact me if they come over to the UK."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in multiple locations through the Lawrence area, due to availability. Rhonda and Larry’s home is my favorite. You couldn’t ask for a nicer place.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I decided to go to Lawrence, this was the first listing to pop up. I've never booked an airbnb that was not an entire place for 1 or 2 people, so I was a little worried about renting a room. Her photos were wonderful and the explanation was quite clear.

They warmly welcomed me into their home and daily lives and I felt safe and at home straight away. Getting to know Larry and Rhonda better over the course of time, I can wholeheartedly say that staying with them was a novel and unique experience.
Aside from my personal experience, they are incredibly kind and friendly people who’ll help you find your way around town. As for the house itself: the bedroom is big and warm with a comfy bed and has everything you’d need for both short and long stays. The private bathroom is an added bonus and because of the house’s layout, you’ll enjoy a lot of privacy. The neighborhood’s a quiet area yet everything—from shops and grocery stores to Kansas University, as well as hiking trails and restaurants—is close by and public transport to downtown is just around the corner.
I would return instantly if I could, so do yourself a favor and book your stay here!"

The one thing I might suggest would be a chair, short stool, or small bench near the entry, as shoe removal is awkward from a standing position."

The price! You seriously can't beat it. I WILL be back again and again! Thank you, Julie for a warm welcome and wonderful stay!"

Her and her home were absolutely amazing. It was exactly as described and I wish there were more places out there like this."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie could charge a lot more for her AIRBNB, and it's great that she makes it so affordable. Her home and neighborhood homes are beautiful, and in an attractive neighborhood. We came to town for a Jayhawk game. Our plans kept changing about our ETA to check in, and she was fine with that. Julie was very friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable, and the large bathroom was great. The notes on the wall here and there did help us to know the best way to make our stay a good one.

She resides in a pleasant neighborhood of Lawrence and makes a concerted effort to offer a reasonable price for her guests. The twin bed arrangement worked especially well for me while traveling with my son for an event at the University of Kansas. The bathroom and bedroom were clean, and I appreciated that a quiet air purifier was running in the room since we use one at home as well.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Important to note that you are very much inside your host's home - utilizing same front door, staircase etc. The room had amenities of TV, fridge and microwave and is directly across the hall from the spacious bathroom.
Keeping doors shut at all time is a House Rule, which was just a little tedious while going back & forth across the hall & hearing the click each time especially during the middle of the night.
House rules are posted in every room - I guess there have been major issues with previous guests which was unfortunate as it seemed a little less friendly that otherwise would have been. But, very clear expectations are stated.
Overall, we got what was advertised and had a restful night stay. The location is convenient while in Lawrence and I felt totally safe and it met our needs very well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie had great communication & the space worked well for our visit to Lawrence.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was like home and obviously at a very reasonable rate. Julie was very nice during my one week stay. This is my first time in US and I felt really good Whenever I talked to her. Quite a few times I got to chat with her and I must say she is very jolly and can entertain with lots of stories from her experience. She also gave me couple of tips on boots, mattresses etc. So it was really, ""Home away from Home"". As an international student beginning at Kansas couldn't be better at any other place.Best of luck to her."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie was a great host and very kind and accommodating. I would stay there again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I give Julie and her place all the stars! She's a personable, friendly host with a spotlessly clean bathroom & bedroom for her guests. What's not to love?! I consider her a friend now that I've stayed with her several times. Highly recommend. She has notes posted everywhere explaining all the rules, and those help a LOT. If you frequent Airbnbs often, you'll understand how difficult it can be to recall all the rules for each and every separate place. She's a terrific host! I look forward to staying with her again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"julie was very nice to us. it was our first visit to the USA. we were happy that we came here. she gave a lot of life hacks to get by in Kansas. she also gave some of her stuff to us for helping us set our home.she found and suggested houses . overall she is a wonderful person, excellent storyteller and a great host.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay with Julie. Best value in town. Clean, just-as-described, friendly and accommodating. no frills, though she has added a microwave recently. I enjoy my stays here, which are frequent. She does ask a for a little more cleaning at the end of the stay than some hosts, but she also has the lowest cleaning fee of anywhere I have stayed, including the place that had us start the first load of laundry."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay, just needed a place to sleep because I had 2 dental appointments a day apart and didn't want to drive all the way home and back, so this was extremely helpful. Though I was flying solo, the room was perfect for 2 people, it has a mini fridge, microwave, bed tray for food and a television with remote. The bathroom was huge and I didn't feel cramped and wishing for space. In the future, if I need a place to stay in Lawrence, I would definitely reserve a room at Julie's."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I planned a last-minute trip to Lawrence and Julie's place was just what I needed. It is on the edge of town but still easy to get around, and the neighborhood is super quiet. Yes, there are lots of house rules, but they are easy to follow! I would stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"As always, home is very clean. Julie is always pleasant. Nice private space. Small with few amenities, but great for she charges. My first choice when in Lawrence visiting family."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s unit was very tidy and exactly as was provided in the description. Her and her boyfriend are kind individuals; I had the pleasure of conversing with them during my stay. Her cat are also very friendly if you get a chance to see them in the common areas such as downstairs in the living room. Overall, the stay was great, easy to find, quiet and clean."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place-everything was as advertised. If you are staying in Lawrence, this is a wonderful find. Hope to return soon."
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Julie has lots of house rules, none are unreasonable, but multiple notes posted on bedroom and bathroom walls is a little off-putting. Would suggest two things to make the stay more enjoyable. First, since guests are asked to not wear shoes in the house, please put a bench or chair outside the front door. Secondly, Julie is very honest about the temperature she maintains in her house. It was warm for me even with the vent closed. I would suggest providing an oscillating fan in the bedroom. Even the ceiling fan was not adequate for me."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very clean and comfortable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, a great stay at Julie's. I have family in the area, so this is primarily a place for me to sleep and clean-up. I love the secure check-in lock she has. She does keep her place at 74, which is warmer than my 68 degree home, but with the ceiling fan, light clothing, and light covers, I am able to sleep."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie was a great host! Stayed up on Christmas Eve to welcome me in! Bed was super comfy! Great deal.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying here and it was as great as I remember! Very clean, private and quiet."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Much enjoyed our stay yet again and looking forward to the next visit. Location convenient to U of Kansas and Lawrence. Much appreciated the neighborhood sense of safety, the quiet, and such a clean, relaxing space. Our host was friendly as always and enjoyed talking with her. Wishing we could’ve seen the cat more but there’s always next time."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie was a great host. I stayed for a short overnight visit. For people with cat allergies wondering about booking- I had no issues as Julie is very good about keeping doors shut. The bed was comfortable, place was clean, and Julie checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed. Julie does ask that you strip your linens and clean up after yourself- if you have a problem with this minimal cleaning, this is probably not the place for you. Personally, I was very happy to find someone who isn't charging a $100 cleaning fee so I was happy to oblige! Thank you again, Julie, for a cozy stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect and clean place with clear instructions and tremendous privacy. It was quiet and the bathroom was spotless. I would definitely stay here again.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This host is so kind and understanding about everything. She made sure my stay was safe after I informed her about my medical issues and we discussed is for as long as I needed to. Her cats are so sweet and friendly (hint; use a low voice not high). The place was spotless and when my medical issues became an issue she didn't shame me and she made sure I knew it was alright and it happens.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I felt really comfortable, we slept well and it was welcoming. I would recommend this place for future trips and may stay again. Julie was extremely responsive and very nice."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is exactly as it appears on the ad, and honestly, was perfect for what I needed when I was traveling. I just wanted a comfortable, clean, cheap spot to sleep as I was driving across the US, and this was exactly that. I'm not used to staying in Airbnbs where other people actually live, but this felt totally comfortable and unweird. Julie has a great and really clear system for having people stay at her place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie’s was the perfect accommodation for passing through town, which is just what I needed"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed another stay in Julie's bedroom. She is very affordable. Offers no-frills, at a no-frills price. Place is always sparkling clean, and meets my needs for a private bedroom with two twin beds, and a bathroom. She does have cats, but they do not come near the bedroom, and this time I did not even see them at all."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie is an incredible host. This will be my go to for Lawrence area.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Slightly outside the University and downtown area, Julie's airbnb provides a clean and cozy room perfect for a college visit. Given that this is slightly outside the main areas this is ideal for people who drove in or have a rental car if you plan to do a lot of exploring. That being said, it is in a peaceful, quiet, and well kept neighborhood. It was easy to come and go too. Just, know that you have to take your shoes off when you enter. Normally, I prefer not to as I like my insoles. This was a very small inconvenience though for the price."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie was an excellent host and very responsive to all requests and inquiries. Her place was super clean and very nice! It is a very nice place to stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie's AirBnB was perfect for what I needed--a room to stay in for Thanksgiving.

I'd be happy to stay there again on my next trip!

2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Julie’s room was nice and comfortable for our one night stay. I mostly loved the bathroom cleanses and size. I didn’t mind much about all the signs as it shows “hopefully” guest before us also tried their best to keep the space clean.
Thanks Julie for hosting us :)"
