2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We came for the Bridge to bridge race and this was the perfect place one block from the start. The apartment was quaint and cute and had what we needed. The walls are very thin and could hear the neighbors and outside easily.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartment in great location in downtown Georgetown. Great sushi restaurant right downstairs and lots of cute cafes, bars and shops nearby. I was there for a wedding and it was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable and safe."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The place is extremely convenient and centrally located. Every restaurant and bar and town was easily walkable. We appreciated the local recommendations on things to do! Will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Georgetown is an extremely walkable town. We parked the car and left it there...restaurants, bars, Harbourwalk, museums, shops, the beautiful streets...all very short walks away.
Bring your own toiletries and ice...and because other folk mentioned these items, we were prepared.
Not a big apartment, just perfect for 2.
A ""walk-up"" on the 2nd floor...11 steps...a landing...plus 13 steps.
Clean. Comfortable. Cozy."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Awesome efficiency apartment in downtown. All main restaurants and coffee shops are walkable. Residents of the two neighboring apartments were quiet. Balcony is a nice touch if you like your coffee with some fresh air. I knew there was going to be 700+ extra people in town (I was one of them in town for the event) and parking downtown near the apartment was still super easy. Street patrons did get a bit loud at sunset but when I came time to call it a night it got all quiet. Your directly above the restaurant but you barely hear a thing even at its busiest times. Will definitely see if it's available for next time visits.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location walk to everything, private and clean. Will stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is just perfect! Great space, nicely done. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I needed a relaxing weekend away and this was perfect! We did not have to drive anywhere! Everywhere we wanted to be was in walking distance. The apartment was very comfortable and the neighbors were very friendly! We can't wait to book our next stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable bedding and linens. All about the location and balcony. No shampoo or soap for shower like most, so just be prepared for that but not a big deal. Host was very accommodating! Would recommend and will book again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic historic apartment in the heart of Georgetown! I loved the quaint downtown area and able to walk everywhere. Perfect for a quiet weekend getaway. Place was just as described! As others mentioned it is loud at night with city noise and no black out curtains. Bed is super comfy, but if want to sleep in bring ear plugs and night mask üòÅ. No shampoo, hairdryer, or shower soap included so be sure to bring own. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Convenient to main street and tours. Great job keeping the old architecture with current furnishings.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Victoria!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Victoria was responsive from the moment we booked & throughout our stay. It was easy to find & easy to get in. The unit was clean & fresh- nicely decorated, renovated, & charming. Loved the location & nostalgia of the building but, we did have some pain points. The birds would perch on the balcony and start chirping at 5:00am. With the bed placed against the window, they're basically chirping right above your head. The bedroom lacked black out curtains, so if the birds didn't wake you, the sunrise will. The linens were clean, pillows plush, but the bed was squeaky. Anytime either one of us would rollover it would wake the other. No shampoo, conditioner, body soap, or a blow dryer. The trash comes Saturday at 7:00am. A restaurant is directly below the unit- the noises weren't too bad. From time to time you'd hear clanging from the kitchen cleaning up at the end of the night & then prepping in the morning for the day. No designated parking made it hard to find parking from time to time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space for a weekend getaway!! Everything was nearby and the apartment was beautiful!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Close to everything downtown. We came by boat and were able to walk everywhere. It was the perfect place for the two of us. I would defiantly say there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool apartment with balcony overlooking the town. Great location. Loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect location to spend a weekend. The apartment was absolutely beautiful and in a prime spot. Everything was lovely and very comfortable. A few things to note‚Ä¶you can hear all the outside noise during the night and the floors are creaky which is expected in a building like this so if you are a light sleeper be prepared with a fan or app for white noise. It is a little difficult to find parking on the same street during peak hours like lunch and dinner. Perfect location for walking to shop and eat if staying in the downtown area. While not bothersome to us, the smell of the neighboring apartments cooking can be fragrant and I believe there is a pet in the building so if allergic that‚Äôs something to know. I would definitely stay here again. We tried River Room, Rollin Local, Indigo Bakery, Bluebird Coffee and Coffee Break. Everything was excellent."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place. Beautifully furnished, comfy bed. Only cons-hard to find nearby parking, and the noise at night was off the charts from loud weddings and motorcycles. Made it very hard to sleep. There is no noise ordinance times in Georgetown.
The location is amazing if you are not bothered by noise at night."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Victoria's place is absolutely lovely! The decor is coastal chic and the amenities just as described. Truly appreciate Victoria providing a quick alert regarding a local water advisory. This is a gem in Georgetown and I look forward to staying again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret has a beautiful place and the description honestly did not give the place justice. The views are simply amazing. It's very spacious and there are beautiful screened in patios allowing you to relax and take in the views. Margaret's place included extras, games, fishing rods, kayaks, etc. She was a friendly host and her instructions were clear and precise. I would highly recommend this place and would love to visit again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to say that Margaret has made the best first impression imaginable! Her house feels like home, and she‚Äôs so responsive and friendly. The area is so peaceful and comfortable - if you need to decompress and relax, this is your best option."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret's Black River Refuge is simply amazing! If you are looking to relax, enjoy beautiful surroundings and sunsets and be in a home away from home, this is it.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a large, beautiful house in a peaceful location overlooking the Black River. We especially appreciated the kayaks, which we used twice to paddle the river, and the plentiful birds which are attracted to the bird feeders Margaret provides. Excellent bird watching, and the house is just a short drive to Georgetown, Pawleys Island beach, Huntington Beach Safe Park and more."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoy this house so much! It‚Äôs remote and peaceful without being too far from restaurants and stores! Everything in the house is so clean and beautiful, I can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is wonderful! The property is beautiful and so is the house. I‚Äôve never been to South Carolina and this experience makes me want to come back. Margaret was very responsive and helpful with everything.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Totally agree with the other folks - the pictures don‚Äôt capture the beauty of Margaret‚Äôs place! I think my husband and I both said, ‚Äúwhoa!‚Äù as we walked in.
We had a lovely stay over the holiday weekend - reading on the screened in porches (there are 3!), kayaking and exploring on the river, enjoying the peace and quiet, and visiting Georgetown and Pawley‚Äôs island. Only wish we had booked more time there.
And yes, echoing others - Martha is a kind, generous and responsive host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful to be back again in this beautiful house on the river.
Margaret is a great host. House is clean and well equipped with everything you could possibly need. Had a great time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can‚Äôt say enough about our time spent enjoying Black River Refuge other than it was too short!
Margaret‚Äôs home is beautiful both inside and out. She is an incredibly gracious and accommodating host and will not only give wonderful suggestions of eateries and places that are close but genuinely cares about her guests, their travels and that they have what they need. She is very easy to communicate with and responds quickly and in detail.
Although the pictures of the house, dock and setting are beautiful, they don‚Äôt compare to being there in person. We made memories, enjoyed the many birds, and spent time relaxing and enjoying the beauty around us. Can‚Äôt wait to go back for more of Black River Refuge. In one word ‚Äì Amazing! Thank you, Margaret!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Margret was a great host. I have never had a host be so responsive and helpful.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful house, loved the view of the Black River. Fishing and relaxing was the rule of the week. Margaret is a great host, was very helpful and nice. Wedgefield golf club was a well kept course that we played twice, it was about 20 minute drive from the property."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it. We will be going back. We stayed here because it was close to the shooting complex and it was everything she said and more. It was absolutely beautiful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much loved our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"10/10 recommend for a relaxing getaway! We have no words to express how much we fell in love with this home! It was well stocked with pots and pans, condiments, some fishing gear, life jackets, etc.... but the VIEWS were the absolute best! We loved sitting on the dock watching the boats ride by. We didn't leave the whole time! After we got home we realized we left some items there and with no hesitation Ms Margaret told us she would ship them to us. She was extremely quick to answer our questions. If you don't book this house, you are REALLY going to miss out on an amazing little gem!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful setting. Lovely home. Great place to stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I grew up in the local area and have spent many days on Black River.
Black River Refuge is an awesome spot with a great location. Browns Ferry boat landing is in great shape, so close for boaters wanting to use the provided boat slip. The local store, Mingo Shop has been a favorite of mine for years. Good for a quick bite to eat
Started our trip with a fishing trip to the bay. The weather was great.
The next day was a boat ride down to Winyaw Bay. It takes 1-1.5 hrs by boat depending on your experience. It's better not to rush. You can always tie your boats to the docks on Front Street and grab a bite before heading back.
For our last day out we took the boats northward and traveled the small tributaries that contribute to Black River.
Lots to see and tons of birds. Margaret provides some great bird feeders and high quality bird seed. I was able to check quite a few migratory birds off my list for this year. All and all we had a wonderful trip and only wish we could give more stars."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Margaret‚Äôs place was absolutely stunning. We loved sitting on the porches the dock. We were able to grill out and eat on the porch overlooking the beautiful river. There were so many kinds of birds out there, and it was extremely peaceful. The views were amazing and we had a glorious and relaxing time. The house is cozy and well equipped. Margaret was a fantastic host. I highly recommend her home for anyone wanting a peaceful getaway. We rode into Georgetown one day and it only took us about 20 minutes to get there. The house is amazing and once there, you really don‚Äôt want to leave. We can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thanks again! Enjoyed every second of this weekend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway. The house is beautiful with lots of special spots to hang out in, including the screened in porches and fabulous dock on the water. There are lots of special touches and beautiful artwork throughout the house and the outside is surrounded by the most incredible trees. We really enjoyed our time hanging out on the Black River and would definitely recommend Margaret's place to anybody looking for a wonderful place to spend time during your next vacation!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is WOW! This place is a hidden gem. Pictures truly don't give this beautiful house justice. Margaret was the most responsive, generous person we have dealt with since we have been doing AB&B. The peace and quiet, the kayaking and the fishing was everything that we needed to get back in touch with reality. I can't say enough good about our stay at Margaret's house. 10 stars in our book."

She offered many suggestions for things to do in the area and even informed us about recent bird sightings. Her home and location offer a peaceful and restorative retreat. We will definitely return."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful house with a gorgeous view. It was wonderful to be able to go kayaking in the morning/afternoon and relaxing by the fire at night. Kitchen was stocked with lots of cooking supplies as well as grilling supplies. There was even spices and condiments available for us to use just incase we had not brought our own. I will absolutely be staying here again in the future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here. Enjoyed the piece and quite alot. House had extremely fast wifi too. House had all we needed and the Host was so sweet to leave treats for us. Will definitely be staying here again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time enjoying the scenic river and some peace and quiet!I took my 4 year old son on his first duck hunt on the black river and accidentally forgot his life jacket back at home but thankfully there were already some at the river house!!!! We Finished our trip with some fireworks on the dock to ring in the new year. This is trip #2 for us and we will surely be back!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely LOVED our stay at Black Refuge! What a gorgeous home - cozy and warm! It was perfect for our family since we were visiting family who live in Georgetown. Our only regret was we came when it was so cold! We will be planning a trip back in the springtime or summer months so we can take full advantage of all the outdoor fun! Cannot recommend highly enough! A gem of a place and a great host!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a few employees stay at Margaret's place for work. They enjoyed the home. It was nice and a great place for them to relax after work. We would definitely book again if we were in the area working!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"If I could give this place 100 Stars I would hands down!!! The home is decorated very well and very clean. The house is well stocked and very open with light. My dad and I walked to the dock in the morning to fish and my dad (76 yrs old) love waving and talking to pasing by boaters. My mom enjoyed sitting on the screen porch. (She would yell down to my dad: ""Did you caught anything hunny?"" Lol! My dad would always say: ""Yep!"" This is an ideal place to relax and chat with the neighbors while at the dock or just peaceful time in the yard. Ms. Margaret is a very friendly and caring lady. She answers all questions promptly. The beds are comfy and you can see the moon from the bedroom upstairs which is very romantic. All I can say is book it, book it book it!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Margaret's home is lovely and the view of the river was more than we expected. The location is quiet and peaceful a great place to relax. A good place for all ages to stay. The dock is great for kayaking and fishing. The home also has easy access for an elderly person.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent location, awesome host, loved everything about our stay! Margaret has thought of everything and has wonderful, timely communication."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"June 18th 2022
We really enjoyed, this vacation house at the river. It was so nice to stay put for a week without go, go, go! My family and I love swimming everyday, and fishing. This house is spacious and have large rooms which is a big plus. Very open to the lake view, and the birds are all so fun to watch on the porch and from the window. Margaret is such a great host and always checking to see if everything is going good!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot on the river! Fishing off the dock is great. Almost anything you could need is available at the house! The master bathroom shower is a dream! Book it, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything you could need and more. Like Margaret said, it is a little drive to get there, so bring groceries. Paradise."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Margaret‚Äôs black river home is like Heaven on earth. The views were definitely painted by the hand of God! We loved it! A wonderful get away and close enough to the Grand Strand and Georgetown to enjoy the whole coast!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at this lovely rental, it is convenient to the coast, restaurants and stores but you may not want to leave the beautiful location on the river. The beds were super comfortable, it was quiet with only the sounds of nature and the owners wonderful wind chime. We enjoyed the variety of birds that fed from the feeders. All you could ask for in a vacation rental."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in the most peaceful area on the river. Margaret is a great host and did everything to make our stay the best. House is immaculate and well equipped with everything you could possibly need. Had a great stay and will be back again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a fabulous stay we had! We felt at home right away. Margaret is an awesome host amaking sure we were both comfortable and having a good time. The house and it's location is beautiful and very relaxing. We especially enjoyed hearing so many birds singing and seeing them flitting through the trees. The river views are awesome too! Highly Recommend!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous house. The best view I‚Äôve ever had. Margaret was the best air bnb owners I have dealt with in all of my travels. Will definitely book again. Great place at a great value. 5 stars all the way!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great stay! Wish we booked for longer.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying here was so much fun. It was great to get away from the fast pace city and relax here. Margaret was great and answered any questions we had. Would recommend this place for anyone going to the area!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Black River Refuge is amazing!!! Seriously, do not hesitate for a second to book this place! If you do, more than likely it is going to be gone, and for very good reason. Location to all of the top coastal areas is perfect. Just over a half hour to the hidden gem of Pawleys Island, and Georgetown has that low country coastal town feel for some refreshments and food after getting your sunburn on. It is about 20 minutes out if that. We commuted to Charleston and Myrtle Beach with ease being around an hour or so away and our favorite location was Huntington Beach State Park. It was only about 40 mins out. The home is exactly as described and all the amazing reviews for this place are on point. Lots of space for all the friends or the whole family and you really get the sense of being in a cabin in the mountains. The home was clean and well stocked and we had everything we needed to make breakfast and dinner for the 6 nights we were there. The access to the river was a huge bonus that you just don't get at most AirBnBs. We used the kayaks and took our kids along the bank to see some local wildlife and don't forget to bring some chicken livers for the catfish! All the fishing gear you needed really was already there to reel in some channel cats literally with almost every cast. My daughter had a blast catching them before breakfast even. Book this place before it's gone!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is great , quiet with lovely views. The host is super and went out of her way to make things extra nice. Hope to stay again someday.."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay if visiting Backwoods Hunt club, we enjoyed relaxing on the Black River for the long weekend. Quick drive to Georgetown for dinner if needed. Can‚Äôt wait to come back for our next visit; Margaret was was very informative and a pleasure to work with."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful play to stay. Clean, quiet and close to everything."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was a great stay. Clean and peaceful. The view is amazing and Margaret provides everything you need for a comfortable stay. Can‚Äôt wait to come back soon.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great holiday get-away for our family of 3. The house is lovely with great views of the water! We took advantage of spring-like temperatures to sit on the decks and porches. This is one of the best equipped houses we have rented----lots of kitchen items. plenty of linens. extras like hand soap, tissues, hair dryer, and even food staples in the cabinet and refrigerator. We enjoyed exploring to the Georgetown waterfront, Pauley's Island, Murrell's Inlet and Huntington Beach State Park. We thought it was well worth it to have a 20-40 minute drive to these spots in exchange for the nice privacy & beauty at the house. Margaret was very responsive whenever we had a question. Hope to return!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a really beautiful place where my friends and I had stayed for a few days. Margaret was very welcoming and accommodating. We had a good getaway with some bbq, kayaking and quietness."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This River Retreat property is a hidden gem off of the beaten path. A place for rest & relaxation for those who love nature and peace! This beautiful home was very well-kept, well-stocked and made us feel like we were right at home. The kids even caught a few fish off of the river dock. This is Southern peaceful living at its best!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Black River Retreat is a lovely property in a quiet, wooded area well out in the country. The house is spacious, sunny and comfortable, with beautiful river views). And the host is most accommodating. (Also the WiFi is very good!) We‚Äôve stayed here 3 times now, and hope to come back next year!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Margaret's place on the river is so relaxing. The views are breathtaking. The house was well equipped with everything you need. We were close to Georgetown and Pawleys Island wasn't to far either. We will definitely book with Margaret again.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place, beautiful views of the river, so peaceful! House is well stocked for cooking and grilling. Many outdoor spaces to enjoy nature. Being from Florida, we especially enjoyed the fall foliage and cooler weather."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This river house has a beautiful view with an awesome interior. The layout was perfect for my family and we had plenty of space. There was an ample supply of towels and the house was stocked with cleaning supplies and toiletries, as well as basic cooking necessities. It was easy to find and it was a wonderfully peaceful and quiet location. Ms. Margaret was the perfect hostess and she also had the best communication of any host I‚Äôve ever dealt with. She provided great advice and directions. Her thoughtfulness made our stay even more enjoyable. We will definitely be booking here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you stay here you will not be disappointed! It‚Äôs private and peaceful, yet in close proximity to Georgetown which is a great town! The river was beautiful and the kayaks were a huge bonus! The house was clean, cozy, and spacious and has everything you need. We enjoyed every minute here and would definitely stay again!!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Great for a group of friends!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love my stay here on the lake. It was peaceful and secluded and created the perfect environment for my first birthday getaway. It was a double coupled getaway so we enjoyed the company and the scenery. We went out on the river, sat outside all night, cooked on the grill, enjoyed the sunrising above the water! It was mesmerizing and the king's suite was exquisite!! The shower was my favorite part I took more showers then a normal day haha !! Margaret and Pam was amazing with communicating with us during our stay, providing great suggestion and local attractions and great restaurants better than Google provided to us! I celebrated my 27th birthday here and one of the first text message I received on my birthday was from Margaret, I was feeling really special by everyone's attention to details and that is something I would cherish the most during my stay! Thank You I look Forward To Our Next Booking we WILL BE BACK AGAIN üòÅ our stay was from 10/12-10/15 my birthday was 10/14 and they still remembered me mentioning it from a week before checking in!
My Only Issue Was Minor and to help Prevent other people from encountering the same minor setback, I will highly recommend bringing your own entertainment, the tv provided had the basic dish package(no good channels other than news) but we purchased a Roku TV from the local walmart and was able find a suitable arrangement! We also got a projector and projection screen and set it up outside, the house had extension cables and it was truly a magical night to remember!!
A true GEM !
Thank you for hosting us for this quick getaway ‚ù§"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will not be disappointed. Is exactly as advertised plus . Margaret is great host and wants you to enjoy your stay. We will be back .
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great location and accommodations for a quiet and restful getaway. Everything you could need is in the home. Love the pay it forward concept leaving any unused items for the next guests. The home is spacious, clean and comfortable. Lots of natural light and great views of the river from multiple porches and decks. It truly felt like a home away from home. Queen and twin beds are a little on the soft side but still very nice. We brought our boat to enjoy cruising the river. You can go all the way to Georgetown and enjoy some secluded beaches or downtown and have a nice restaurant meal. Or just enjoy hanging out, relaxing, fishing or floating from the dock. I would recommend bringing your boat only if it is 20 ft or less. The drive is narrow and its tight but doable for backing it into a parking spot. If larger, launch at Browns Ferry prior to arrival to the home and once you pull/back partially at the home, have 2-3 persons ready to help position the trailer manually. We kept our boat at the dock the entire time and it was well protected and safe with just two standard fenders. We thoroughly enjoyed out time there and hope to return many more times."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Margaret is a fabulous host and so kind. The pictures really do not do justice for this place, everything was clean, roomy, and beautifully decorated. My family and I had a wonderful time exploring the area and spending time together. If y‚Äôall want a getaway place this is it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful relaxing weekend in this beautiful house. It was the perfect size for our family of four, though it could easily accommodate a few more. There are several screened in porches and a dock for fishing, swimming, or boating on the kayaks included in the listing. Margaret has made sure all guest needs are accommodated and was easy to communicate with. This is a great place to stay if you are looking for peace, relaxation and comfort not too far from Georgetown, Pawleys Island, and Murrels Inlet."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our visit to Black River, near Georgetown, SC was above and beyond what we expected. The beauty, quite and back to nature cannot come across in the picture in the Airbnb ads. Margaret is an exceptional hostess and was always there when we needed her. We will definitely be back again and hopefully will spend more time there as well."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We came across Margaret's listing somewhat by accident, and were immediately enamored by the photos. I'm happy to say that the house turned-out to be everything that we had hoped, and more! The second-floor suite is huge (and has a ""wow"" bathroom). The first floor bedrooms are spacious and comfortable, and there are at least 4 screened rooms plus a deck with outdoor table and chairs. The kitchen is well-stocked and provides easy access to the gas grill. The living room is comfortable; the open concept with the kitchen creates an airy atmosphere. The wood floors, cabinets, and doors throughout the house are beautiful. The river view is spectacular, and having access to 2 kayaks was very nice.
While the neighborhood is rather secluded, it is an easy drive to local attractions. We spent an enjoyable afternoon at the beach at Pawley‚Äôs Island and another afternoon in Charleston. In Georgetown we enjoyed the Harborwalk, where we visited a local gallery and antique shops; we also bought fresh shrimp and grouper, which were delicious.
Margaret is a fantastic host, very responsive, and cares deeply that her guests are comfortable. When we had an issue with the air conditioning (in mid August!) she was able to get the technician to come out the same day to fix the issue! Since three of us were going to be working full-time for most of our stay, we were a little concerned about internet bandwidth, but Margaret went WAY out of her way to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue, and it wasn‚Äôt. We had the opportunity to meet her in person, and had an enjoyable visit.
Overall we had a delightful 9-day stay, and can easily recommend Margaret‚Äôs house for your visit to the Georgetown area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quite are.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely wonderful! Ms Margaret is so sweet and hospitable. The property is in a great location and offers great access to the Black River. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors are very nice also! Our 2 week stay ended far too soon and we will definitely be back! Thank you Ms Margaret!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! The views, house, host, and location are fantastic. We really enjoyed our stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a beautiful home on the river! We loved the wildlife, birds and the peacefulness. Margaret is an exceptional host and is helpful in letting you know what there is to do in the area. Need to reconnect with God and nature this is your place. Or just need to get away book it! We will be back!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful time staying at the Black Refuge. We were able to disconnect, enjoy the various birds & squirrels throughout the day, the views of the river is amazing and can‚Äôt say enough about the private dock. Everyone in our family enjoyed fishing from the dock and most of us got lucky and caught several fish while staying the week. We did take the kayak‚Äôs out a couple times and that was equally fun. The house is clean and is stocked with the basics and then some. Margaret is very responsive and provides great ideas for things to do if you decide to venture away from her lovely home. I do want to mention that for OUR family extra consideration is needed when choosing to stay at the house because of the distance to town. The drive to the nearest fast food restaurant or grocery store is about 30 minutes so when you are staying at Margaret‚Äôs home you are really out in nature‚Ä¶which can be a good thing if you are trying to get away from city life, but you do have to make plans accordingly because a round trip into town is an hour. There is a Dollar General about 15 minutes away and a convenient store about 12 minutes from the house, but those two places didn‚Äôt fit the bill for our needs while staying at the house. Also, there are some great local beaches which are about a 35-40 minute drive from the house. We went to Pawley‚Äôs beach which has a cute town to stop and grab lunch or shop, but our favorite beach was Huntington Beach which was absolutely great and well worth the 5 minute extra drive!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What an special place this is! The river vista is incredible and we couldn‚Äôt get enough of the screened porches. We had a truly unforgettable experience here. This home is very comfortable and has everything you need. The kitchen is well stocked with great appliances. The couches are very comfortable and we love a king-size bed! Margaret is so thoughtful, communicative, helpful and on top of everything. Really a wonderful host. As an avid reader of previous visitor comments, I try to be really thorough in my reviews here, and there are few things that we would have wanted to know in advance‚Äîthat are no fault of the host‚Äôs and didn‚Äôt necessarily detract from our experience‚Äîbut nonetheless, are important to note. Keep in mind that we were here for 3 months and were working from here, so some of these things may not be an issue for short-term stays and off-the-grid vacations. First, you‚Äôre deep in nature and surrounded by woods and water‚Äîthis means incredible birdwatching‚Äîand also sometimes unwanted visitors. We had a particularly aggressive season of palmetto bugs, so know that this is the type of thing that can happen. This is no fault of Margaret‚Äôs, has nothing to do with the cleanliness of the home (it‚Äôs very well-cleaned!) and she was so responsive and on top of addressing it. Second is that Verizon cell phone service does not work here, so know that if you have Verizon you won‚Äôt be able to receive or make any calls/texts. In the same vein, the internet was questionable at times. Margaret was incredible at doing everything to get us set up with high-speed internet in advance but again, you‚Äôre pretty far out in the country, and so we ended up on the phone with tech support as well as also purchasing our own separate high-speed internet service while we were there. Again, these may not be issues if you‚Äôre here vacationing, but we were both working remotely full-time during COVID. Fourth, for long-term stays, there is no regular garbage pickup, so if you are there for more than a few weeks, you either have to take the garbage to the dump yourself or arrange for a pick-up with Margaret. Not a huge deal, but something to note. Lastly, just know that you are 20-30 minutes from *anything*, so stock up at the grocery store before you come or do a big shop upon your arrival as you probably won‚Äôt want to be doing regular grocery store visits. Again, this was totally fine for us during COVID, but just know that you‚Äôre (delightfully!) far from everything else! If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely be back!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway location. This was my first trip in over a year and I wanted a spot with space to relax. This was perfect. Close enough to do activities in Georgetown or Pawleys Island but also perfectly set up to enjoy doing nothing but look at the water and watch wildlife. Would be even better in warmer weather when you can kayak or enjoy the dock more. Margaret was awesome in responding to questions and helping with tips for local area. Highly recommend.
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"Hidden gem near the Black river. The place was awesome. Don‚Äôt think just book it. We really enjoyed the stay and the place has plenty to offer. We would really recommend the place. Best place to be outside of the busy city life enjoying the beauty of nature.
Margaret (the host) was quick to respond to any queries and always attentive to ensure we have safe & wonderful stay."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! It is an amazing place to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of the water. The surrounding trees have a delightful variety of birds. The house is spacious yet cozy with beautiful finishes. We loved cooking in the open kitchen while looking out at that sparkling view! Everything was well stocked, organized and very clean. Margaret made our holiday visit special with her thoughtful touches and warm hospitality. She lives up to her Superhost status! Thank you so much Margaret for sharing your exceptional home with us. We can't wait to return!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Margaret is a fantastic host! She is thoughtful and attentive, without being overbearing. Her house on Black River is very nice, with large bedrooms, lots of great outdoor spaces, and a well stocked kitchen. We had everything we needed for a quiet, serene Thanksgiving week. Do yourself a favor, and book this house for a peaceful getaway!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thanks so much. You were a great host. We loved the house and location. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice. Such a relaxing place. We really appreciated all the extras Margaret did. Absolutely would recommend this house.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nothing can beat that river view! We loved the three screened in porches that gave us different views of the river. Margaret made sure we had everything we needed prior to coming and you could tell the towels and sheets were freshly washed.
The house has pretty much everything you need to make coffee (there‚Äôs even a coffee grinder!) and to season food, but if you want/need more, there‚Äôs a Walmart about 30 minutes away. We stocked up one day and spent the rest of our time cooking on the grill and in the house.
We didn‚Äôt go down to the dock too much (we had brought our 4 month old with us), but there‚Äôs kayaks available if you want to do more outdoor activities.
Overall, amazing trip! Would book again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a great place to stay!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret‚Äôs place is lovely, larger than expected, very clean, well stocked kitchen & bath including toiletries you may have forgotten. It was a beautiful, peaceful, and private location That exceeded all our expectation and we will be back. We were also impressed with the quain & friendly town of Georgetown, also known as Little Charleston. I learned after making the reservation the town is listed as a top coastal vacation spot in USA Today & Southern Living. The restaurants were fabulous too."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Margaret‚Äôs place is simply amazing! We truly enjoyed staying here.
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"I have NO doubt in my mind that anyone traveling to Georgetown and staying at Margaret's beautiful home - WILL be back! It is peaceful, tranquil, inviting, and SO comfortable!"
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"The Black River Refuge is a unique find in the area, located up the River in a pretty secluded spot. Spacious, comfortable house with lots of decks and porches and a dock, to enjoy the beautiful view and the river. And Margaret is a great host. We look forward to coming back next year!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved our stay here. Beautiful home with lovely artwork and squeaky clean. Many thoughtful amenities. This is one of the nicest places we have ever stayed. Looking forward to a return.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was perfect to Georgetown and the Blackwoods Gun club! The views of river and space in house were exceptional with lovely upgrades. The screened in porches as decks were an added bonus!!! We would suggest bringing bottle water as it didn‚Äôt taste like home, but the extra amenities in the kitchen met ALL our needs and then some! We would stay again next time coming through the area! Also, we have family member in a wheel chair... it‚Äôs not completely accessible, but with help in the front door (one large step and turn in front door), there was plenty of room for getting around and able to make room for the wheelchair getting around the first floor through kitchen, living room, 2 bedrooms and porch/upper deck! An electric wheelchair or someone with no assistance would probably have trouble though.
This house was exceptional for cleanliness, space and views in all other manners!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Margaret's house was amazing! We had an excellent visit. The rooms were large and comfortable with plenty of space for everyone. The Black River was very peaceful and everyone had a great time fishing and going out on the water. We highly recommend a visit here!
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"We booked this location due to the fact of being so close to Georgetown where we had work all summer. This worked out so much better for us than it would be for us to stay in a hotel. The location is great, being directly on the river as well as 10-15 minutes from the center of Georgetown. We asked to extend stays multiple times and Margaret helped us out every bit of the way! The house has plenty of space and in a great neighborhood as well. Would always recommend and will stay again in the future!!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay and we can‚Äôt wait to visit again! Beautiful view, peaceful getaway! Could not ask for a better host!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a peaceful getaway! Very relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed the convience of being able to dock our boat. Ms. Margaret was very kind and accommodating! We can‚Äôt wait to visit again!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to relax and drift with the river. Margaret is a lovely host.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Margaret is a wonderful host! She was super helpful and super quick with her response time when I needed her! Her home is beyond gorgeous and the king bed and twin beds were soooo comfy! (Didn‚Äôt sleep on queen) the views out the windows at the back of the house are stunning and it‚Äôs a short walk to sit on the dock on the black river!
If you‚Äôre going to be in the area or even just thinkin of booking Margaret‚Äôs place, do it! You‚Äôll be so happy you did!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing place everything you need and so much more
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,"The Black River Retreat is a really nice and comfortable home on a bluff overlooking a quiet bend in the river. Lots of spacious windows, porches and decks to enjoy the view. Comfortable beds and sofas and a well-equipped kitchen. Margaret the owner is very responsive and helpful, too.
Our extended family had a great time at the house and look forward to coming back next year."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ‚Äúshort version‚Äù of the review is: The hosts are great, the space is fantastic with excellent amenities, and the location is peaceful & relaxing‚Ä¶ just book it! Very well appointed river home with fantastic views from nearly every room---and the porches are FABULOUS! Soft & comfy beds, excellent high end linens and a well appointed kitchen. We cannot wait to return. Thank you for sharing your home with us :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't Say Enough A out This Place, Awesome, Awesome, Awesome"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AWESOME
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Experience
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"‚ÄúThe Vogue‚Äù was as advertised. It‚Äôs centrally located, yet very private and quiet. We immediately felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù. We ate dinner - our anniversary - at a great restaurant across the street. Georgetown‚Äôs Front Street is very walkable and there are many dining choices.
Steve is a great host, friendly and communicative but not intrusive. A visit to the downstairs ‚ÄúPurr & Pour Cat Cafe‚Äù is included. After enjoying the several cats‚Äô company, we sipped our complimentary glass of wine in the other room and watched the cats cavort through a window.
If you want to just isolate and chill or if you want to enjoy activities and night life - ‚ÄúThe Vogue‚Äù will fit your needs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely enjoyed our stay and booking with Steve. He is an amazing host who goes above for his guests, and has great communication. He's very friendly, and the details provided for check in were on point. His place was exactly as described, a great location, and has an added bonus of a benefit visit with the Purr & Pour cat Cafe. This provides a lovely social environment for a great cause. We would stay again, and encourage you to check out the Cafe as well!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve and Patricia's place was wonderful. A nice quiet place. Georgetown is a quaint little town and their place is right on the main street. The town closes up early so it is quiet at night. It is close to the water front. Patricia runs a cat adoption program so it is really sweet seeing the cats through the windows at night. The bed is very comfortable. We highly recommend this place. There is a lot of nature places to see. Brookgreen gardens is a must to see.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place
Right in the heart of downtown Georgetown. Highly recommended"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is perfectly located to allow you to walk to all the shops and restaurants, and there are plenty of both from which to choose. The apartment is adorable and very comfortable. We had all that we needed, including friendly conversation with our host, Steve, who made perfect recommendations for what we wanted. To be able to visit the Cat Cafe, snuggle with the cats and learn about the remarkable work the hosts are doing for the cat population is an added unique plus to our visit. We hope to return often."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo has everything we needed. Peace and quiet very comfortable; time felt like it passed by slowly which was very enjoyable. Georgetown was so lovely to visit and everybody was so friendly. We hope to come back sometime in the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. The location is in the heart of downtown Georgetown. I walked everywhere. The accommodations were as described. Roomy and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed.
I will definitely be back next year."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, excellent location, accurate desciption and detailed instructions, all first-rate‚Ä¶and clean!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt, this airbnb was hand down better than any hotel. It‚Äôs so nice to be away from home and still have the comfort of home feeling.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve's place was neat and clean and just what we wanted. The location is right in the middle of downtown and convenient to all the museums and historic homes. Steve made a point of meeting us and was very welcoming.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! The place was an amazing location and right by everything. Never heard a peep from the other tenants or the business downstairs. The only thing we wished was that it had a small outdoor space, but said we‚Äôd bring chairs next time for the small stair stoop outside. Loved the historic area and everything about Georgetown. Rental was easy to get to throughout the day and we never got in our cars. Loved the stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place in the middle of historic Front Street. The place has nice amenities and a great bed ! No trouble sleeping. Quiet. Steve was very helpful with any questions. I would definitely stay here again. Enjoyed the historical town and especially restaurants, Between the Antlers and The River Room.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve was an excellent host and the place was great! Fabulous location and we were able to walk to restaurants and shops which was a nice change from trying to find parking. The unit was very clean. I would recommend this to anyone going to this area!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vogue was like being in a big city studio apartment with a lovely small town feel. It was wonderful to be able to walk around Georgetown to all the restaurants and shops. I highly recommend renting from Steve. We had such a lovely time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was really clean and walkable to shops and restaurants. Steve was an exceptional host. My husband needed to work remotely the next day and had an issue connecting to wifi. Steve didn‚Äôt hesitate to come over at 9:45pm to help figure it out. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exceptional, Steve was an excellent host !"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an awesome experience at the Vogue apartment. The location could not have been better and really enjoyed being close to all the restaurants! Steve was a great host - could not have been a better stay.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Thank you for letting us stay, we had a great time in Georgetown!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you decided to live here permanently, all you would need to move in is your clothes. Everything else is there. The apartment is directly in the center of the historic downtown making everything easily walkable!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve was a great host. He allowed us to check in a bit early so we can get ready to attend a wedding that was a few minutes away. The place had everything we needed (even a few extra things like snacks and makeup remover wipes - lifesaver). I loved that it was walking distance to the harbor, shops and restaurants. And loved visiting the cat cafe and playing with the different cats. I would definitely stay here again if I‚Äôm back in Georgetown!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was convenient to down town Georgetown with easy parking, Steve responded quickly to inquiries and was friendly when we met him on the street one morning. He also made him self available by cell if needed
The place was very clean with the exception of the inner shower curtain which was starting to get typical shower mold.
The bed would be great for one but with two it sink to the middle making you feel like you were in a taco!
All else was great and amenities were perfect as far as kitchen. Parking. Wi-Fi‚Ä¶."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great find. My wife and I live in Charleston and were looking to do a quick weekend getaway. She‚Äôd never been to the Front st/Riverwalk area of Georgetown and I hadn‚Äôt been in years. Steve‚Äôs ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù apartment was the perfect home-base for what turned out to be a great evening with excellent food options, bars and shopping all within close walking distance.

2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"this is a nice place, just a few notes. The parking is very tricky and during the day, was very hard to find a close spot.
The cleanup instructions say to fold the bedsheets and to leave the pillowcases to be cleaned, so I'm confused as to why they should be folded only to be washed later.
This is a touchy subject for airbnb, but I don't appreciate having to pay a cleaning fee, then be told I have to take the trash out AFTER finding clumps of hair all over the shower.
If you don't mind all this, then it is a pretty stay."

INTERNET/WIFI worked wonderfully well -> my wife and I both worked online including client meetings online and we both had excellent connections at the same time.
FIRM BED --> my wife and I love firm mattresses and nowadays so many places have pillow top squishy mattresses that make you sink sink sink, this was also a pillow top-type yet it was comfortably firm.
WASHER/DRYER --> added convenience to have the washer and dryer in the hallway; both machines worked quite well making it easy as pie to keep our laundry done.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were looking for a getaway after dropping our daughter off at college. Georgetown is quaint and Steve‚Äôs place is across the street from the waterfront. We enjoyed walking through town and through the neighborhoods under the old oak trees and amongst the historical homes.
We stayed in the one bedroom suite. Loved having three distinct areas to hang out in, a sitting area with couches, a full kitchen, and a bedroom. Very quite and tucked away. While there is not a window with a view it‚Äôs so conveniently located that did not bother us.
Loved seeing the cats as we came and went in the cat hangout spot next door.
I would suggest staying here."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have asked for a better location; it is right in the heart of downtown Georgetown. The hosts were very friendly; they provided some great local insight.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve's place was great! The perfect little town near the harbor where you can walk and get ice cream. It was nice to be 20 mins from Huntington Beach where we spent most of our day. Back in Georgetown everyone pretty much wore a mask and stayed within social distancing regs. so it wasn't an issue. It was just a nice get away for a weekend!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greattttt venue!! Definitely a new getaway spot for me in the comfort of my hometown
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve's place was very clean, stylish, and in an awesome location. The apartment was stocked with snacks, some drinks, and various dishes.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First things first: the bed was comfortable and the shower was great.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had stayed at Steve‚Äôs other listing - the Vogue- however Above it all- really is above it all on Front Street in historic Georgetown. Lots of space and 2 private en suite full baths. Filled with antiques and plenty of space- two balconies off the main living area are so worth it. Coffee in the mornings and nightcaps at night while viewing Main Street and the river walk- wonderful! There are private balconies off each bedroom as well- but the front one is the best. No worries on street noise- as both bedrooms are behind the living area and quiet . As usual the apartment has all you might need in the kitchen and baths. And where do they get those great bath towels - so fluffy. It is well worth the cost- whether a base for the beaches to the north, Charleston and hour south or staying in historic Georgetown. We took a shell /barrier island tour- well worth it‚Ä¶ Steve is very attentive and friendly- quick to respond!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were two couples staying at Steve's apartment in the downtown of Georgetown. It was an ideal choice where we could park the car and walk to everything for the whole stay. The apartment was clean, spacious and comfortable with a veranda and seating that overlooked the main street of Georgetown. We spent several mornings sitting out on the veranda sipping coffee and taking in the town sights. The kitchen, baths, and bedrooms were lovely and well kept. Every convenience including restaurants were all just a brief walk from us. We could explore the town, knowing that at any time, our unit was close by to retreat to for a break from touring. Our host was friendly and helpful. We hight recommend this stay.We had a great weekend with friends staying at Steve"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and his wife were so lovely and personable. They are very nice hosts. If you are a cat ""fan"" you'll be delighted to learn of the Purr and Pour downstairs. They run it as a fostering location for felines in need. Staying in the AirBnb helps defer costs associated with this labor of love."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Steve's downtown apartment in Georgetown, SC, was absolutely delightful! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality. The apartment itself was easily accessible and comfortable, making it the perfect retreat during my visit to this historic town.
Location-wise, you couldn't ask for better. Situated right in the heart of downtown Georgetown, I was just steps away from great shops, delicious restaurants, and the waterfront.
The apartment was spacious and impeccably clean. The living area was ideal for relaxing after a day of exploring, and the kitchen had everything I needed. The bedroom was spacious and provided a peaceful haven for a restful night's sleep. The balconies were great for morning coffee!
We're definitely looking forward to a return trip to Georgetown and will stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Steve's place. It was very convenient to walk to resturants and see the downtown area of Georgetown. Since I was from Georgetown and grew up here, it is like coming home for a brief time. We had stayed here in 2023 to attend the Rotary Club Shag Festival and the time here was just as good as before. We hope to come back at the same time in 2025."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful long weekend at Southern Sighs. Steve and Patricia were excellent hosts. The apartment is in a very convenient location to shops and restaurants. The apartment is lovely and perfect for two couples. It was nice to have a balcony overlooking Front Street. It is a convenience to have a washer and dryer, but we did not use the laundry room during our stay. We most certainly will return to Southern Sighs on our next trip to Georgetown! P.S. Having Purr and Pour downstairs was a wonderful way to enjoy visiting with rescued cats that were available for adoption!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy our stay at Steve‚Äôs Airbnb. Great location for enjoying Georgetown. Airbnb is spacious and comfortable. We ate out or with family so our use of the kitchen and dining area was minimal but both are well equipped. Would have enjoyed the second floor deck overlooking Front Street but weather prevented us. Purr and Pour Cat Cafe is always a delight. We will be back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start, from the street we already felt in love with the area. The apartment from the moment we entered, have this unique flow, super comfortable, spotless, bright, love to open doors and see the historic street from the balcony. We didn‚Äôt have to bring any pots or plates etc everything you need is there and even more. The experience at the cats cafe OMG it was delightful. Patricia and Steve are a lovely and adorable couple that knows how to run a business for sure. So many thinks to do around and the boardwalk is very nice too. My friend adopted a cat from them and the entered process was so easy and fast. Thanks so much and we will definetly be back hopefully soon."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a perfect place to stay in Georgetown. The accommodations were perfect in everyway. The view of downtown was so pretty, especially with the Christmas lights along the street. Restaurants within a minute's walk and everyone is so nice.

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! The balcony was great to sit and relax all throughout the day/evening. The living area with the shutters opening up to the outside balcony had a special feel and lots of natural light. Front street which you are on and the boardwalk right across the street are perfect to enjoy the charm of shops and dining. For us the proximity was wonderful to visit Pawleys Beach and Huntington Beach. The kitty caf√© was adorable and such a pleasure to see.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved it
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed again because we love this place so much! The hosts are second to none and this home away from home is our fav on our AirBnB list that is ever growing.

Thanks so much Steve and Patricia! Cheers to you both!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location is fabulous. Walk to everything Georgetown had to offer! Super hosts that are available and live close. The purr and pet cat cafe is a remarkable way to help the local shelter place cats. One hour from downtown Charleston and 20 minutes to beaches at Pawleys. Georgetown is a hidden gem and you will love this spot!

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nicely appointed apartment.
We enjoyed our stay. The beds were on the firm side, just an FYI.
The only down side to the small town is that most of the businesses are closed early and on Sunday.
It made eating out a bit more difficult.
This apartment has a full kitchen, so bring some food to make your self and there will be no issue.
We loved the veranda overlooking the street, that was fun late night when the bars close. some really good people watching :)
Enjoy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a roomy, clean, comfortable and bright apartment in a nice area of town - everything was very walkable. I jogged and we took walks in the neighborhood behind the apartment, visited the shops and museums and had breakfast, lunch and dinner ‚Äì all on foot. My wife made a cake in the kitchen for a reunion we had later in the weekend in Atlanta. Grocery, department and liquor stores located within 10 minutes by car. A very nice stay."

The location is great, right on Front Street and we really enjoyed the balcony, watching people passing by. For two people it was a bit expensive but if you are traveling with 4 people it is definitely a good deal. I'm glad we got to stay there. I had a chance to chat with Steve in the Cat Cafe, it was really interesting to learn about their business and it looked like a really nice place to spend a few hours with the cats. In a nutshell...we recommend strongly if you are traveling near Georgetown!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. The Purr Cafe was the highlight of the trip for my son and his friends and they haven't stopped talking about it since they left :)

We loved the double sinks in the master bath, the balcony, and the thoughtful addition of pamphlets for things to do and snacks. The complimentary visit to the cat cafe downstairs was also very fun. The only thing we regret about this trip is that we couldn‚Äôt take a cat home with us."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and Patricia's place above their Purr and Pour Cafe is lovely. From the well-appointed kitchen with the generous snacks, the pretty and light decor, to the extremely high standard of cleanliness - the only downside of this Airbnb is the having-to-leave part. You'll have a balcony for morning coffee and evening sunset gazing and rescued kitties (in the non-profit cat rescue downstairs) to pet and play with. In my eyes, rest and rejuvenation are the name of the game here."

It was clean, quiet, and comfortable with a fully stocked kitchen. We loved sitting on the balcony at night and otherwise enjoying a very homey environment. The beds were comfortable, the towels were soft, and he left snacks! It‚Äôs in the perfect location right in downtown Georgetown, and you can walk to dinner and stroll the boardwalk after. Highly recommended!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A+ all around! The apartment is spacious, sparkling clean and impeccably decorated. We loved the view from the apartment and spent a lot of time on the balcony. The hosts are wonderful and responsive. It is a breeze to pop downstairs and find the town and all the amenities right on your doorstep.

We would love to come back!"

Everything was needed to cook any meal. Do not hesitate to book"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a local gem in downtown Georgetown. It was a home away from home. It offered all of the essentials you need. The towels were fluffy, the furniture was comfortable and the kitchen was stocked! The balcony over looking historic Georgetown was comfortable and relaxing. Laundry available on site was a huge plus for us! It was meticulously clean and tastefully decorated."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful little apartment in an adorable town with the most responsive and friendly hosts! Steve and Patricia have restored my faith in Airbnbs. We came for an academic writing trip and were drawn to the spacious apartment with lots of natural light. There were so many places to write and the space was perfect. The pictures do not do it justice - a historic feel with modern comforts. The internet was fast enough for two of us to have multiple laptops going with no slow downs. The kitchen was stocked with coffee and breakfast, and there were plenty of great local restaurants just a few doors down. The best part was the cat cafe! we went down during the afternoons and got to know the cats and more about the business model and purpose of the cafe. Steve and Particia have hearts of gold and were the best hosts. They have thought of everything. Even had a bucket with flyers for local restaurants and things to do. This will become a new yearly tradition for us!"

This was our second stay in one of his 2 apartments, and we'll be back again! We also had a lovely time in Georgetown, which is a charming town."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Georgetown because we were attending a wedding. Steve's place is lovely, very comfortable and inviting and the location is the best, right on front street and literally 2 minutes across the street from the Broad Walk Water front. Great place to stroll around. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cat cafe below called Purr & Pour, Im a big cat lover and hanging out with these amazing cats (up for adoption) for a couple of hours was a great way to spend the afternoon."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was wonderful! Huge space and convenient location. We loved all the French doors! Everything was perfect.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We come to Georgetown fairly often, and stay here as often as we can.

All the downtown restaurants are on your doorstep, from a good brewery to a sports bar to fine dining, enough to suit any price point. Steve was the consummate host--welcoming and extremely helpful, and his place was spacious, clean, and one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at. Don't forget the cat cafe downstairs! This was a work trip, but I'm definitely going back to stay there for a vacation in the near future."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was delightful! It is right in the midst of the historic section of downtown Georgetown so the location can‚Äôt be beat! The apartment was beautifully furnished as well. There is a front porch overlooking the town that we particularly enjoyed. It was an added bonus to be able to see the cats through the large window as we arrived and came back from the sights in the area or our small town shopping or restaurant visits. We loved supporting the mission of the cat cafe as well.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay! The pictures do not do this place justice. It is gorgeous, spacious, immaculate, and quiet. My guest and I were heartbroken when we had to leave.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was BEYOND charming.
I can not stress that the pictures really don‚Äôt do this place justice.

We‚Äôre already planning our next visit."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Southern Style is an incredible place to stay while visiting Georgetown and the Hammock Coast. Great communication from Steve from the outset and the ambiance of his place is amazing. It‚Äôs superbly furnished, kitchen great for cooking, and has extra touches that made this stay one of my best ever in an AirBnB. Comfortable mattresses and pillows, lots of reading material and games, spotlessly clean and meeting Steve and his wife Patricia was a highlight. Great people! Be sure to visit the Purr and Pet Cat Cafe below the unit and applaud Patricia for facilitating the adoption of over 147 cats. We‚Äôll be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and his wife were gracious hosts and we loved staying in their home for our beach visit. The home is charming & clean and was very comfortable for my family of 4. The rental is located in a very quaint part of town and it situated over top of the Purr & Pour which is a lovely cat cafe. I'd have to admit that interacting with the animals was probably the highlight of our beach trip so if you have an hour or so to book a spot, make sure to jump in on that activity."

Furnished like someone's very tasteful home with the best furnishings, art work, and a nice library. Wonderful bedrooms and bathrooms. Fully equipped kitchen. Two delightful balconies. And if you're into cats, its above a Cat Cafe with 12 cats (adjacent coffee and drinks bar). My friend and I could not have been more pleased and hope to return. Georgetown is a very cute town with many good restaurants, art galleries, and shops. Our five day stay was not enough!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there was ever a perfect experience with an Air B&B, this was it. Steve and Patricia have managed to make their place as welcoming as can possibly be. Everything was immaculate and their attention to detail was incredible. The check in was super easy, the location was convenient to everything. I cannot possibly rave about this enough - you just need to see for yourself. It is nice to see that this sweet couple cares enough to make their place, YOUR place while you are there. If I ever own a place that I can offer to travelers, I will certainly model what Steve and Patricia have done with this BEAUTIFUL place. I miss it already! Thank you so much for making our stay so perfect!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful Airbnb! It is SO comfy: the beds, the loveseat/couch, and the 2 large armchairs. Having balconies off of every room, including one long balony with outdoor chairs & a table overlooking Front St. was incredible! Steve & his wife Patricia are wonderful people & hospitable hosts. Throughout our stay communication was great. The 2 bedroom, 2 bath Airbnb is clean & also has a full kitchen with all the things we needed to prepare meals in. It is beautifully decorated throughout with lovely art & antique pieces, fitting of a home in this nice historic district. My parents & I enjoyed days of walking along the Harborwalk and surrounding blocks of tree-lined streets , eating at sidewalk cafes & restaurants, & visiting local shops. Their Purr & Pour Cat Cafe was a fun & memorable place to visit on our stay, as well as nearby Huntington Beach State Park & Pawley's Island."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Steve's place in Georgetown. His attention to detail with he little things in his Airbnb such as the basket of snacks, travel guides, toiletries etc. were by far one of the best I have seen in an Airbnb. His home has beautiful southern charm and is very welcoming. My husband and I felt right at home the moment we walked in. The location is perfect if you are wanting to explore Georgetown and Front street. We are looking forward to returning in the near future!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Our checkin did not go well. We were given the door code but it did not work. We texted Steve, no reply, we waited for him to get back to us. We went to a hotel and left a message for Steve to contact us in the am.. We did checkin the following day and Steve explained he omitted the code and refunded our stay. As an Airbnb host myself, I would suggest an optional checkin or alternate accessibility to reach the host The place is in a good location, great views on the Main Street in Georgetown, very clean and full of amenities. A nice place to stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and Patricia were amazing. Quick to respond, super clean and comfy place. Much better than I could have hoped for and the cat cafe was so amazing."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Steve was a very responsive host. We enjoyed the opportunity to meet him face-to-face when we arrived. The photos of the apartment are very accurate, but I will say that it looks even nicer in person. We loved enjoying our coffee on the balcony, and after a busy day, enjoying an evening of Scrabble in the very comfortable living room. Beautiful and homey, and right in the middle of things. We walked comfortably to restaurants and along the intracoastal waterway. Easy walk or drive to many places of interest. We would happily stay here again on future trips to Georgetown!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, great amenities, immaculately clean - you could not ask for more!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Steve and Patricia‚Äôs flat, it was comfortable and a great location in historic Georgetown. It is a true gem and their hospitality makes your trip! Thank you and we will be back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and Patricia are a delightful and classy couple that have equipped their place as if they themselves were in need of a wonderful respite. I have about 30 AirBnB's under my belt, and this is by far the cleanest, and with the most practical of thoughtful touches. Lights automatically turning on to light your way, flashlights next to each bed. There are too many of these to list. Comfortable beds, lots of space to spread out, with plenty of horizontal space as well. The main deck facing Front street is indeed the best place to ship your coffee or tea while you watch the world go by. Antiques, lots of wonderful books, games, etc. Free parking in the rear of the building is super close. Everything that you need is withing walking distance, except for the grocery store, which isn't far. I will absolutely stay here again, and I highly recommend. Locations, amenities, walkability, and super hosts. Thank you Steve and Patricia for the wonderful memories. Hope to see you again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Great host! The apartment is larger than expected. Very clean and tidy. Location is perfect! The balconies are a nice treat! When it‚Äôs warmer weather, we plan to go back to Steve‚Äùs - looking forward to sitting on the balcony and watching the action on Front Street. Check-in and check-out are easy."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Center of town, very clean, totally the place to stay for a weekend in a quaint small town."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional! Words cannot begin to do justice to the stylishly decorated, spotlessly clean, and ideally located property on Front Street in the heart of historic Georgetown. Most importantly, the warmth & generous hospitality routinely extended by its wonderful owners place ""Above It All with Southern Style"" literally head & shoulders above any comparable property in the extended area. Can't wait to return for our next visit - thank you!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying in Georgetown at Steves place. The unit was exceptionally clean and very spacious for our stay. Perfect for couples get away. I loved being on the main street and hanging out on the balcony. We spent most our days on Pawleys Island which was a short drive. The bed was on the firm side but comfortable. The kitchen was stocked for any cook. I was nervous about the parking not being right by the unit but it worked out fine.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Steve‚Äôs place. It was very clean and included numerous amenities. The location is perfect in the heart of downtown Georgetown. The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed their collection of interesting books and personal art pieces.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The booking was incredibly centrally located. We were able to enjoy the Georgetown food festival so easily. Even with the festival, parking was still convenient. My one note would be that there is no door separating the two beds. I don‚Äôt think I realized this when we booked. It was totally fine for us, but I thought I‚Äôd mention it for other people in case privacy is needed. We would 100% rebook."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is situated over a wonderful chocolate and ice cream shop in a historical building. Our reason for visiting Georgetown was to compete in the Bridge2Bridge Half Marathon. The location was perfect. The restaurants were all easy walking. The historical homes beautiful and the locals very welcoming. We will return.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here! Loved how you walk downstairs and at right in the middle of ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù! The beds and pillows were comfortable and everything was clean. Would definitely return!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked Jerry's place for a mommy-daughter weekend getaway for my daughter's upcoming 7th birthday. We had driven through Georgetown a few months back on our way back from Myrtle Beach. I was drawn to the cute downtown area and booked Jerry's place while in the car LOL :) Jerry was great at communicating and answering all the questions I had about places to eat, shop, etc. We spent the bulk of our time enjoying the shops, the cat cafe, and dining on Front Street. The apartment itself is well appointed with everything that we needed and it was cozy, quiet, and safe. It was very easy to get into the apartment and checking out was a breeze. As soon as we returned home, my daughter said, ""I miss Georgetown."" :) Great apartment, a wonderful historic downtown, and worth the stay and trip."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a nice, comfortable, well-equipped apartment. There was everything I needed for a two night stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay very much. It was right in town so we could walk to most places we had a need to go.
The apartment was as described. It was very comfortable and cozy.
We had to leave a little earlier than expected and Jerry offered to make the day lost up for us pn our next stay. We will definitely be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in Georgetown and thoroughly enjoyed Jerry's place.
Very comfortable and perfect location. Loved the coffee bar!
Jerry was a great communicator and couldn't have been any nicer. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice (and affordable) condo in Georgetown. Jerry was very accommodating but also very respectful of our privacy. The location is next to the Harbor, stores and restaurants. If you‚Äôre looking to stay near the Charleston area (about an hour drive) but save money, and prefer a more quiet environment, I‚Äôd highly recommend this listing. The only disappointment I had is, based on the photos, I was under the impression that the condo has a back porch water view, but that photo must be from another unit, nevertheless, it‚Äôs only a few steps away from the river area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry was wonderful! We loved the apartment. It was downtown in cute Georgetown perfect walking distance from everything. We enjoyed the boardwalk, restaurants, and treats from sweeties right below the apartment. Highly recommend this place to anyone coming to spend a quiet weekend away in Georgetown."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this place above the ice cream shop. The exposed brick wall and clock tower were quintessential historic town. The host was very nice and responsive. He even mailed me something I left behind for no charge.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry‚Äôs place was extremely clean and convenient to everything downtown Georgetown. The bed is very comfortable with luxurious feeling sheets. There‚Äôs many extras such as coffee, creamer, and bottled water. Be sure to stop in at Sweetie‚Äôs (downstairs) for ice cream. There was some street noise but that is to be expected with the location right on Front Street."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while our 2 boys played in the IP Classic Tournament. Love that we are close to the field plus all the restaurants are walkable too. Lots of great restaurants- felt like we ate nonstop this weekend lol. Will definitely stay here next time we are in the area. Jerry was on top of things and all his recommendations were spot on. Best thing was Sweetie‚Äôs was below us :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Very cozy and comfortable. Perfect location.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and lovely stay. The ice cream amd sweets shop below was busy as we stayed over valentines but it didn‚Äôt interfere with our peace and quiet or enjoyment of the space. The location is exactly as advertised and the only call out that I would offer is that the bathroom is compact. So small shower stall, single sink so plan time for each person to get ready."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location! Within walking distance of excellent restaurants and shops. Jerry was such a nice, responsive host. We hope to go back!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was quiet despite the location. The only issue was all the stairs to get to the suite.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really wonderful place! I was in Georgetown for work and this place was so convenient. It was so neat and clean, the bed was very comfortable and I felt right at home. Jerry is a wonderful host. If I ever get assigned to Georgetown again, this will be my first call."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Husbands birthday needed a getaway from our normal routine‚Ä¶Jerry‚Äôs place was one of the first thought of when discussing our options.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot in Georgetown! We were in town for a family get together & Jerry‚Äôs place was very convenient. Incredibly clean, comfortable bed, and the space matched the description exactly. Jerry was responsive & the extra amenities were thoughtful. Some noise from the shops/street downstairs, but totally expected since it overlooks Front Street. A very cute place to stay- we will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great. Unit is located in the middle of downtown next to numerous restaurants and shops. The harbor walkway is right behind our unit, which we walked every day of our stay. Also, there was an ice cream shop right below us, so we were able to meet our sweet tooth needs. We made the right choice staying here at this unit."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place in historic Georgetown. Not riverview but on the river, with great restaurants and a ton of great places to dine within a short walking distance. Lots of 1700-1800 history to absorbe as well: Rice Museum, Maritime Museum, great colonial architecture. And the local population is open and friendly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful restful weekend at Georgetown Harborage. Everything you need or want is close-by. The unit is extremely well located, comfortable, and clean.

The place even had lots of extra amenities including makeup wipes, half and half for coffee drinkers, beach appropriate accessories, a few games, and lots of extra linens. Jerry is a very responsive host and gives very clear and easy to follow instructions, restaurant suggestions, and even shopping suggestions. Jerry even paid for ice cream from Sweeties! We really enjoyed this beautiful space!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry‚Äôs place was perfect for our trip to the Wooden Boat Show! We just walked downstairs and we‚Äôre in the middle of it. My husband had wanted to attend this show for years but his health is not good, so being able to rest frequently without driving somewhere was perfect. The apartment was charming and SO clean! Would definitely recommend"

Thank you for the bubbly for our special weekend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With our husbands away, and a long weekend ahead, my friend and I were on a mission to return to a favorite restaurant in Murrells Inlet and shop. Harborage suited our needs perfectly due to the Georgetown location. Murrells Inlet a quick 35 minute drive for dinner‚Ä¶next day 60 minutes Charleston for a day of sightseeing and shopping. Our last day we spent exploring the surrounding areas of Georgetown and evening stroll down Harborwalk‚Ä¶(so many restaurants, so little time)...Sweet, Sweet, Sweet!
Harborage is ‚ÄúThe Sweet Spot‚Äù for Georgetown and the Coast‚Ä¶in more ways than one!
Let me just add‚Ä¶the shop below the apartment makes their own ice cream and candy‚Ä¶BEWARE they ship nationwide! No ice cream for us‚Ä¶but we had some delicious candies.
You have been WARNED!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our short stay at The Harborage!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jerry's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Great location!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time in Georgetown. The apartment is even nicer than the pictures show, and we loved being steps away from so many great places to eat and the beautiful riverwalk. We kayaked around goat island, swam in the bay, toured the Kaminsky house, spent a day at Huntington Beach State Park (20 minutes away) and ate great food while watching the fish (mullets?) jump out of the water. One day, we unfortunately lost the keys to the apartment, but Jerry was so, so kind about it and immediately was there to let us in and give us replacement keys. He was an incredible host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was an excellent place to stay, everything was as advertised, Jerry was quick to respond with any request and the place was very clean. thank you Jerry for an excellent place to stay will definitely use again when going to Georgetown."

Would certainly love to come back another time to stay there!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Georgetown Harborage. The apartment was comfortable, clean, and close to the Historic District's restaurants, shops, museums, and Harborwalk. Beautiful old houses, some dating back to the late 1700s, are within a few blocks of the Harborage. I recommend going to the Thomas Cafe for breakfast, Indigo Bakery for baked goods (some gluten-free), and Sweeties for ice cream and candies. Brookgreen Gardens and Huntington Beach State Park are about a 30-minute drive away and well worth the visit.
Jerry is a welcoming host and quick to respond to messages. We plan to return to Georgetown to do things we didn't have time to do on this trip and will definitely stay at the Georgetown Harborage again."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, just as described. The bed was very comfy. Walkable to everything on Front St. The only downside was the street noise."

The place was well stocked and check-in process was easy. The location is right on Front street and easily walkable to all the shops and restaurants (great restaurant options, btw). I loved hearing the town clock ringing during the day. The street noise and busyness of the shop downstairs during business hours was noticeable at times so if you are sensitive to noise, come prepared. Definitely would not keep me from staying at Jerry‚Äôs place again though."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the Harborage. We live right down the road in Charleston SC, which has become TOO popular of a destination.

Many good restaurants, bars, & several museums are within easy walking distance. Just blocks away, literally. Additionally, there is a nice riverfront boardwalk right behind it.
Georgetown is a lovely, clean, port city on Winyah Bay. Wide, live oak lined (and covered) streets, with over 50 homes & buildings that date back to the 1700‚Äôs. Lots of revolutionary war history and Southern charm here, folks. That includes Indigo Loft. It‚Äôs located in one of the 18th century buildings. With high ceilings, tall windows that look out onto Front Street, wide old hard pine floors, and a cast iron staircase, the loft maintains its period roots while providing guests with modern amenities. The updated bathroom was especially nice. It‚Äôs a very comfortable place to just sit and enjoy the view of visitors coming and going down Front Street. We loved our stay at Indigo Loft!"

The space is impeccably designed and full of light. The location was perfect - less than 1 minute to Main Street that had a lot of shops and restaurants.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous and specious place. I love the small thoughtful touches and the willingness to make the place workable for people with kids.

A few suggestions:
Shower mat under sink for guests w/children
Rug in bathroom that doesn't slide
Fix dishwasher (Dana was unaware but was accommodating)
Fix microwave Dana was unaware but was accommodating)
Bed rail under bed for toddlers on bed
You'll Iove this get away location."

Convenient parking right outside the door but be prepared for a large staircase to get to this lovely apartment on the second floor! Georgetown is a growing town with nice restaurants If you want to get away from the normal hub-bub."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Corner of Broad! It was the perfect location‚Äîeasily walkable to downtown Georgetown and just a short drive to the beaches at Pawley's Island‚Äîwith lots of space for our family. Not only was it was clean and comfortable, but we also appreciated all the little extras there for our convenience (like Q-tips in the bathroom and sugar and creamer for our coffee) that made it feel even more like a home away from home during our visit. Dana was an excellent host as well‚Äîsuper helpful and quick to respond to us. We can't recommend Corner of Broad enough and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"

The interior is very elegant with coastal vibes, great architectural details and furnishings out of a design magazine. Check-in was seamless, and it‚Äôs good value for money.

This space is exactly as described and just as comfortable as it appears. My husband and I came to get away together after a very stressful time. It couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect that this beautiful place.
We enjoyed our walks to the historic harbor walk literally one block away. It was so easy to get into the sweet little downtown shopping and harbor area that once we walked back simply to change for dinner.
One more thing. Get your waiving hand ready. Everyone in this town is very friendly. We were greeted warmly everywhere we went.
Do not hesitate to book this darling, restful place. You‚Äôll be so happy you did."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the things I've loved about AirBnB over the years is every now and then you stumble into a property that absolutely wows you. Dana's property is one such overachiever. The value provided for the price is ridiculous. The neighborhood is charming, the location is walking distance to coffee shops, river views, multiple parks, and local stores. The space is very clean, the bedding is comfortable and new, and all of the fixtures/electronics are new. I had never been to Georgetown before, but my wife and I are already planning a return visit. Book with confidence, you're in for a great time!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can‚Äôt say enough great things about Dana‚Äôs place! It is beautiful, clean, comfortable and clutter free.

A block from the Main Street and river walk! The town is gorgeous with live giant oak tree lined streets everywhere! Dana and her husband gave us excellent restaurant recommendations and golf and anything we asked! Go to Franks!!!

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Talor's place in Georgetown! It was exactly what we expected and was great for our family visiting in town for a wedding!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talor was very accommodating. I drove in from Florida and got there early. She allowed me to go in earlier. The house was adorable, bright and cheery. Very clean and well maintained. By far the best airbnb experience. I would highly recommend Talor‚Äòs home to prospective renters."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communicating with Talor was super easy. She let us know any/all pertinent information in a timely fashion. We had the info we needed, just as we needed it. We planned a very busy 4 days, and the location was perfect for what we were after. The home isn't huge, but had more space than we needed, and it has seaside CHARM but not overdone. Also Georgetown's setting cannot be matched, perfect for checking out Merle's Inlet, Pawleys Island, and Myrtle Beach as well but was a quiet place to retreat to in the evenings... We couldn't be happier with our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This humble abode was situated 7 minutes from downtown Georgetown and offered such peace. We enjoyed the clean, open space, close proximity to downtown and the view."

We thought that the location was great for what we wanted out of our getaway. We were able to spend a few days up on Pawleys Island and a few days exploring Charleston. The place was charming and was the perfect size for the 5 of us. Everything was exactly as described in the listing. The neighborhood was in a bit of an odd location, but it was quiet and safe. Talor was very responsive before and during our stay, and check-in and check-out were simple without a huge list of things to do (all check-out requests were very reasonable). One thing we wish we had while we were there, but didn‚Äôt have (or didn‚Äôt see) was a toaster for breakfasts. Other than that we had everything we needed and had a great stay! Thanks!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Neither words nor pictures do justice to this location, setting and home! The location is excellent for easy access to a main thoroughfare and yet walking distance to the waterfront for shopping, eating, boating, and exploring. This home is an apartment with separate entrance, over a very quiet realty company run by the hosts. It's next door to some of the oldest churches we've ever seen (1700-1800's). The neighborhood boasts the same era homes, and is interesting to explore in its own right. This home has everything you need - including little extra touches like a sound machine, Apple power cord/outlet, dish towels, salt and pepper grinders, water in the fridge, additional toiletries (including shampoo and conditioner in the shower), a washer/dryer, tv with Netflix/YouTube/etc., ice in the freezer, books about the area, and Keels's wonderful artwork! We felt so at home, so safe, so comfortable we didn't want to leave! We'll definitely be back! Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with off street parking. Easy walk to historic downtown Georgetown and harbor walk.
This place is brand new!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely apartment close to downtown Georgetown and the Harborwalk. Thoughtful amenities and everything showed care for the littlest details.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful pristine place that has everything you need. Short walk in private neighborhood to front street. Host is easy to contact and super nice. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While I gave the location 4 stars (it's less than a block to Hwy 17), I must say that once you are in the apartment, you cannot hear the street traffic at all. We were pleasantly surprised. Also, we walked to to Front St. to dinner one night and felt completely safe walking down Broad St.
The apartment is well furnished and seems completely new. As others have mentioned, Keel's artwork is beautiful throughout the space. We enjoyed the books about the area and felt comfortable in the home. We would highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay again. Even got a book that the host illustrated
Beautiful"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Keels were unbelievably responsive and kind. My sister and I were in town because my mother was in the Georgetown Memorial Hospital, she is doing fine. It was the care and the follow up that the Keels exhibit that tells me about the character of these individuals. The cottage is unbelievably, clean, well kept and exactly as pictured, I hope to visit again under brighter circumstances."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay! We loved it. Extremely clean, comfortable, modern... It's very apparent that a lot of thought and care has gone into setting the place up. Subtle, clean colors, a variety of textures... Keel's beautiful artwork on the walls was a wonderful surprise, and is complemented perfectly by the color scheme of the decor. As for the location - it's close to everything - an easy walk to the waterfront, shops, restaurants & museums. Just a great experience. Thanks so much, Keels!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Keels were so accommodating and helpful. Such a great location; the area is free from a lit of light and we saw the Milky Way in the sky!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve ever stayed in. It was so clean and charming and had everything we needed. Georgetown was great. We went to the beach in Pawleys Island - 10 minutes away and easy public parking. We had the best meals in Georgetown at Between the Antlers, River Front Restaurant, Thomas‚Äôs Cafe (breakfast), and Big Tuna. Downtown was lovely and we enjoyed walking and driving around discovering it. Keels place made for the perfect long weekend. Keels‚Äô artwork adorned the Airbnb and kept us smiling from room to room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great host, great location. If you have the opportunity to stay here I recommend it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the most inviting Airbnb we have ever stayed in. It was beautifully decorated, comfortable, well stocked with any necessity you might need.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hi Keels,
We had a ball. Easy walk to waterfront. Great restaurants. We did several guided tours downtown, then drove to Hopsewee Plantation and did the tour with Vinny & Yancy. Excellent guides. Also drove to Brookgreen Gardens one day and walked all over. The pontoon ride was a wonderful summary to what we learned at Hopsewee.
Your artwork is beautiful. We began the close up picture of the crab puzzle and only got through 1/4 of it since we didn't have too much time in the room.
Thank you very much for making our stay such a nice get away. : )"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Keel was very accommodating and responsive. I was in town for business and my other booking fell through. Keel got me in at the last minute. I loved the loft apartment. It's a well optimized space for its size, and I enjoyed the aesthetic choices in furnishings."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were able to make a last minute booking for 1 night to visit our daughter who is working in the area. The apartment is beautiful, clean, had everything we needed. Keels was so helpful. We would not hesitate to recommend it and hope to come back! We want to express our most sincere thanks!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Keels was excellent and went above and beyond to make our vacation a memorable one.
The location is great (close to downtown, but still very quiet at night!). Everyone we met in town was very friendly and kind.
We ate at El Cerro Grande every night we stayed (yes it is that good) and had Thomas Cafe for breakfast (they weren‚Äôt open on weekends during our stay).
Huge shoutout to Keels for converting the couch into a second bed for our toddler who LOVED it.
If you‚Äôre thinking about booking, just do it, you won‚Äôt regret it!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience!!! Facility is a precious gem. We are returning very soon. Already booked it again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying at Keel‚Äôs during a wedding weekend. It is central to downtown Georgetown, walkable to restaurants and boardwalk. The apartment was beautiful, felt brand new, and came with all necessary appliances and amenities. It truly felt like home! I highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a great place to stay! My wife and I enjoyed the house and the location! Several restaurants, bakeries and boutique stores are within walking distance. You can control the pace of your visit, whether you want to comfortable isolate yourself from the world, or embrace the rich history and small town charm with values to match. We chose both and had an excellent Anniversary vacation!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay on the Harbor Walk in Georgetown! The apt was clean, had a comfortable bed, nice linens, and everything we needed for our stay. We spent a lot of time on the screened porch enjoying the view (I loved the Purple Martin colony next door). The only negative was the nearby industrial area which is noisy and smelly when the wind blows the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way.
We love the low country and Georgetown with its beautiful vegetation, southern hospitality, rich history, and walkable downtown didn‚Äôt disappoint. We hope to be back and would definitely stay at Goudy‚Äôs place again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really a lovely location. Comfortable sleeping and lounging on the couch or porch or deck. Walkable to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, ice cream, little museums. We would stay there again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was spectacular. My husband and I run a plumbing company in NC and this was the relaxing weekend we needed. Mr. Goudy was so kind and helpful. We would highly recommend this property and we will definitely be back. Thanks so much,
John & Katherine Repasky"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem! Perfect location, great views. Quiet, comfortable, and well appointed. We will be back!"

Thanks!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay and fantastic and responsive host! Great view of the marina right out your backdoor and centrally located to everything in downtown Georgetown. Would definitely stay in Goudy's place again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the PERFECT place to spend a few cozy days & nights with my bride of 19 years! I would highly recommend it for a long weekend getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Goudy‚Äôs riverfront home was exactly as described. It was cute, comfortable and in SUCH a great location right on the water and in the heart of Georgetown. Cool restaurants, coffee shops, and boutiques are all literally steps away. Goudy was a friendly, responsive host. We would definitely stay again and also highly recommend his place for anyone wanting to visit Georgetown."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! We will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I found the place quite unique since the entrance was only by the Harbor Walk. The large private screened porch with table made it fun to order takeout dinners to restaurants also connected to Harbor Walk. The place was clean and cozy. Lots of places to walk and explore. Beautiful tree lined streets in a historical town. Would love to go back some day. Thanks Goudy for sharing your place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really loved our stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Goudy‚Äôs place was wonderful. Beautiful view right on the water. Lots of places in walking distance and just a pretty area to explore.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful!! We loved everything about our stay. Even with the rain we had a beautiful screen porch to sit on overlooking the water. Will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place and great host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Goudy is a superb host and his rental is amazing. The view is spectacular. We walked everywhere‚Ä¶to restaurants, shops and local museums. I especially enjoyed sitting on both porches (screened and not) reading and sipping coffee in the morning. The neighbors could not be more friendly. When we had a problem with the AC, Goudy was immediately on it and made arrangements for us to stay upstairs until the until cooled. Parking is easy and unloading is a breeze with the on-site cart. Our bed was very comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked including cold water in fridge and coffee with supplies.
My son just moved to Georgetown and I will always stay at Goudy‚Äôs place when it is available. Honestly , I didn‚Äôt want to leave. It was a little slice of heaven."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our best experience with Airbnb. My husband and I could not have asked for more! I‚Äôm not sure if our next experience could exceed this one. Goudy was a wonderful host and a wealth of knowledge regarding Georgetown history. He (and the neighbors) made us feel like family. Southern Hospitality at its finest!
Not only were the accommodations absolutely charming, clean and everything we could possibly need on was provided for us. The dock cart made unloading a breeze. It was close to 100 degrees when we unloaded and to find cold bottles of water for us in the fridge was such a thoughtful amenity! The view from the screened in porch was great with our morning coffee; so peaceful and quiet. The bed was super comfortable and linens and towels were great quality.
It's a perfect location; a short walk to bars, many restaurants, shops, museums, and marinas.
This coastal town and this cozy gem is 5 stars. Thank you again Goudy for making this a great experience. We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and great clean space. Nice and quiet waterfront. Goudy had coffee pods for us. Easy to walk to close by restaurants, museums, tours, and shops. Great studio space with king-size bed separated from living room with cabinets and a heavy drape. Even so, some light shines into the bedroom from the above the cabinets and the far side of them."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location! Thanks Goudy for being such a great host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mr. Goudy was a great host. Everything in the house functioned as it should. Will definitely stay again.

We love this place!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit! The home was exactly as described and better. Goudy is a very gracious host and very accommodating. He made us feel like we were part of his family. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary weekend. We are going back in June for another visit. Thanks again Goudy! See you soon!
Dickie and Donna"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Easy to unload luggage from nearby drive and close parking. Host was wonderful.and even had an extra toothbrush when I forgot mine. We cant wait to go back.and enjoy the porch with the best view in Georgetown.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Goudy was perfect! Beautiful location, right on the water. The apartment has everything you need, 2 min from all restaurants and shops. Goudy was a great host, friendly and helpful, we will recommend his place to our friends visiting the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most adorable and charming place right on the harbor walk. The location can't be beat, shops and restaurants are just a few steps away. Everything was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, the pictures do not do it justice! Goudy was super friendly and helpful, as were his family that we met, they all made us feel right at home. 10/10, we will definitely be staying here anytime we are visiting GT!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! Would highly recommend staying here when visiting Georgetown! Shops and local restaurants are all within walking distance.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! Very comfy. Great, walkable location right in the historic downtown area. Quiet at night! The apartment is very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bedding felt luxurious. The screened porch is a nice little refuge. Almost everything you need was provided including extra towels, a great selection of bath products as well as some bottled water, Keurig coffee, sugar and creamer. Goudy is such a genuinely friendly person. We had the honor of meeting him as he was staying in his apartment upstairs during our stay. He was very helpful when we needed assistance.
Parking is on the street on the opposite side of building which is a short walk. A cart is provided for unloading your stuff. You‚Äôll have to maneuver the cart up two sets of two steps on the deck. Not a big deal for most people but almost was a bit much for our arthritic and debilitated senior selves. We managed it though. Despite that, it wouldn‚Äôt keep us from booking again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We really enjoyed our time in Georgetown. This unit is right on the Harborwalk with easy access to the shops, restaurants, and museums on Front St. Everything was just as described. Goudy was a gracious and helpful host. Highly recommend."

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice setting, very comfortable and clean. Close proximity to shopping and good food. Nice area to walk around."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb visits we have had to date. Boated from Charleston. The owners gave great directions and landmarks to facilitate easy location and docking after dark. The property is as described, if not better. We had everything we needed. The location in regards to the town couldn‚Äôt be better, walk to dining, shopping, exploring the town."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space had everything you could need for a fabulous weekend in Georgetown. Hosts are friendly and hospitable and eager to make everything easy for their guests! Loved it!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cleanest home in which we‚Äôve stayed. It is comfortable and has good wi-fi.
Very thoughtful hostess!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really liked the house, fenced backyard, and town. It was nice having a place so accommodating and comfortable. Washer and dryer worked great. On a dead-end street, so traffic in front of the house was minimal. Neighborhood was fine to walk the dogs, but we preferred driving to the park a mile down the road for our afternoon walk. All in all a very nice place and highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great three day stay at Rebecca's place. Everything was exactly as listed. I chose this location due to the ability to park my boat in the driveway. For reference, a 23 foot boat and truck fits perfectly in the space. Close to the main boat ramp in Georgetown, but an easy drive to Pawley's / Surfside. Quiet street, we had zero issues. Would recommend, will stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here and would come again! Loved the house
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home! We brought our dog and he loved the fenced in yard. Very nice to let him out to do his business without having to walk him on the leash. The house itself was very clean and tidy. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. We cooked most of our meals at the house and Rebecca has pretty much all of the essentials needed for cooking, which was great. We had something come up while we were there and Rebecca was quick to respond and help out. She is a lovely host and her house was great. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet safe neighborhood. Comfortable and cozy home.
Will stay again in the future."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We took a spontaneous weekend getaway. Decided late Friday Night to go somewhere within a couple hours, on Saturday. Rebecca made it happen at the last minute. The house was pet friendly with a nice private fenced in yard, so we could take our fur babies and they were very comfortable. The house was perfect for my husband and I, and it's less than 10 minutes from the beautiful historical downtown and harbor of Georgetown with great restaurants and shopping. We want to visit again in the spring time."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Rebecca supersedes the Super in Super Host. We were there over the holidays and was able to cook Christmas dinner with ease as the kitchen is well stocked with the right cooking needs. Rebecca was super responsive as we traveled during an incredible rainstorm that flooded the roads leading to her house - one of those freak storms. She was very helpful and generous. Highly recommend Rebecca's listing. Thank you so much for everything. Karen and John
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time. Just around the corner from our son. Loved the location.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca's place is perfect for a trip to Georgetown. Conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. I visit Georgetown frequently and plan to visit again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca has created an Incredibly clean and organized space.
The kitchen has everything needed to prepare a meal. Full sized refrigerator and easy to operate cooktop and oven.
Washer(centerless) and dryer look to be new.
The bathroom has multiple shelves for guest toiletries and the water pressure in the shower is more than ample. The linen closet is stocked with plenty of additional towels and blankets and ,might I say, perfectly folded!
The fully fenced backyard is perfect if traveling with fur babies(especially when you have one that needs to tinkle at 3am!)
Very private and safe space."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a fun time staying here! The beach is just close enough that we could easily drive there for a walk with the dogs every morning.
Rebecca has thought of everything to make your stay perfect starting with comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen, and even bowls for the dogs! It was the perfect size for 4 people to comfortably hang out and eat meals.
The dogs loved the fenced in yard! Do note that this won't likely be a place you'll want to spend a lot of time outside at. Inside the house is great, but the neighbor's dog will often bark anytime you are outside (even just standing out there) and the area has a bit of an odor when outside (but was completely fine inside the house!) It wasn't a huge issue for us as we just worked inside instead, but is something to note.
We loved exploring the area restaurants and it wasn't a bad drive from the Charleston airport either!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! Would absolutely stay there again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rebecca was quick to respond to messages. The home was perfect, attention was paid to details, from the dog necessaties, to the beach chairs, to the well equipped kitchen. Very cutely decorated, I have put several of the decor items into my Amazon shopping cart because I liked them so much. Wonderful Host, Wonderful Home. Truly felt at home. Hope to stay here the next time we are in the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's home had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. Our dog enjoyed the big fenced in backyard. We loved the clean, comfortable home with all the little extras like toiletries, blow dryer, coffee, and even a welcome basket with goodies in it! The bed was very comfortable with nice linens, there were lots of puzzles and games available, and there were plenty of cozy blankets to use. We were there for work in Georgetown, so we didn't get to use all the beach extras that were provided, but there was a good sized cooler, lots of beach chairs, sunscreen, beach umbrella, and beach towels available for our use. Check-in and check-out were very easy. Rebecca was very responsive to any questions that we had, and we would definitely come back to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at ""Almost there''' It is truly a fitting name for this home. When we arrived there it was easy to get in. From the moment we walked in we knew we made the right choice. This house is beautiful. It is very well kept, clean and smells amazing. We traveled to SC for a wedding. We wanted to stay in the middle of all the planned wedding events. This home was right in the middle. It has pretty much everything you need. It had some nice touches like a welcoming basket with some treats. There was shampoo, conditioner and nice soaps. It has a fully fenced in yard. While there was plenty of space for our small dogs to run around they loved having their daily zoomies and chasing each other up and down the hallway. We didn't get to do much sight seeing due to the weekend being filled with fun wedding events. We hope to make another trip someday and we hope this home is available. You will feel right at home if you stay here because it's more than a house it's a home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Love Rebecca‚Äôs place. And she‚Äôs an awesome hostess. Would definite stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a wonderful stay and great experience with Rebecca. The Airbnb was clean and well represented in the description/pictures.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, close to downtown Georgetown and not a bad drive to Pawley‚Äôs. Nice space inside, with a great fenced in backyard for our pups."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca is great, super responsive. Many thanks for allowing dogs‚Ä¶.such a welcome change ! Worked in McClellanville and Mount Pleasant‚Ä¶ loved being out of the chaos in Mount Pleasant. Many thanks !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a great stay here. House is spacious and located on a quiet street. It was very clean, and there were thoughtful touches throughout. Bathroom shower also has fantastic water pressure. Having Alexa was fun. The kids had lots of song requests for her throughout the week. Rebecca was very attentive and made sure we knew to reach out with any questions. We don‚Äôt usually travel with our pets, but had to this time and this house is a pet owners dream. Great fenced in backyard, pet bed, and easy access to outside which was great for our dog who is blind. Over all it was a 10 out of 10 stay. We will definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Me and my Husband came down to celebrate my Grandmother's 90th birthday party in Charleston SC. Rebecca's place mainly stood out because we have a dog ! and didn't want to leave him at a boarding home and this air bnb is dog friendly. Also, it's only 20 minutes from my Grandmother's home in McClenaville SC which worked perfect. The home was very clean and spotless, looks like no one ever lived in it. The temperature in the house was very cool which I like!! and the neighborhood was very quiet, no one bothered us at all . I felt like I was at home! it was so cozy! this was our first time EVER staying in an Air bnb and was the best experience ever. my husband says ""he no longer wants to stay in hotels"" lol!!! I highly recommend this place. Thank you so much Rebecca for such a wonderful air bnb experience ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Use of the beach chairs and ice chest are convenient."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was perfect. We were about to bring our small dog, so the fenced in yard was wonderful. The house was in a nice neighborhood and we felt completely safe. My family and I had an enjoyable visit. We would stay here again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was an amazing host! Her communication was on point from submitting the request for the reservation to check out! She provided clear instructions and expectations from the very beginning. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood and filled with serenity of beautiful artwork. We were 100% comfortable and appreciated her hospitality as well as the proactive ""check-ins"" to ensure we were happy, comfortable, and didn't have any questions! We truly enjoyed our short stay and would definitely book again! Thank you Rebecca for you top tier hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay in Georgetown close to everything.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pretty place and extremely clean. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was absolutely perfect for our mini vacation with 2 puppy dogs. Wonderful little privacy fenced backyard for the pups. Great restaurants and boardwalks near by, Pawley's island beach was only about 20 minutes away from the house. The dogs had a blast running off leash on the beach. The house came nicely equipped with dog bowels, doggie poops bags, doggie wipes, all the kitchenware you need to cook a meal, Keurig for coffee, beach chairs, umbrella and a cooler you can take to the beach with you if needed. Check out the house manual they provide at the house, it is filled with wonderful information about the area beaches (some beaches allow dogs OFF leash with leash in hand and dog able to be recalled, some are ON leash ONLY during certain times of the year and some beaches do NOT allow dogs at all) and even has local restaurant menus. This was SO much better than staying in a hotel room with 2 dogs. We will definitely be returning to this AirBNB on our next visit to the area"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rebecca's home was AMAZING! 5 STARS

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have to visit Georgetown every year for work and always look forward to staying in Rebecca's house. It is by far the cleanest place that I have ever stayed and is stocked very well, with everything you could possibly need. I love that she's always stocked with coffee, so I can save the grocery run until the next day. We love her beds and even ordered a mattress like hers for our home. She gladly shared all of her bedding info with me and even sent me links. She is so easy to communicate with and check-in and check-out is so easy! She even checks on you during your stay to see if you need anything. We can't wait to go back next year!"

Rebecca reached out and was very easy to communicate with regarding our trip.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! My wife and I booked for an anniversary trip. We brought our boat so we could explore Winyah Bay and the Intercoastal Waterway. The house is extremely close to two boat ramps (9 min South Island and 6 min Carroll Ashmore). Would recommend to others with sub 20ft boat. Will book again if I come to Georgetown.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house is everything you could ever want when traveling down South with a (non-off leash trained) dog. The fenced in backyard within minutes of arriving became our dog‚Äòs favorite place to be - running around, undisturbed and off leash, she was in heaven. For the humans, my wife and I, it was the perfect location to start our beach vacation (Pawleys Island!) and day trips (Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Murrells Inlet) - the pictures describe the place to a t and the host was super accommodating and easy to deal with. We will be back for sure!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House was clean and matched the description. We were really ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù to Pawleys, Murrells inlet, and didn‚Äôt mind a drive to myrtle beach area. We really liked that the house was away from the busy areas so we could easily relax after a day out exploring. There‚Äôs a nice organized binder with suggestions of restaurants and things to do that Rebecca put together and we appreciated. Our dogs loved having a big backyard to run around in.
Everything is thought out in the home to really make you feel like you didn‚Äôt leave home. It‚Äôs cozy but spacious!
We highly recommend and hope to stay here again next time we are in the area!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was even better than the pictures portrayed! It was so clean and comfy and had literally anything we could have needed and more! Our stay was amazing and we had such a fun time, Georgetown is small but definitely has some hidden gems (especially on Front Street) and it‚Äôs pretty close to Pawleys Island and Myrtle Beach if you are looking for something a little busier :) and at the end of each day we got to come back to a wonderfully kept house! Rebecca also keeps an organized binder at the house filled with restaurants, attractions, tours, and fun activities to find in the area in case you don‚Äôt know where to start! Rebecca was such an amazing host and did a fantastic job of communicating with us throughout the whole process of booking, checking in, during our stay, and check out! 100% would recommend ‚ÄúAlmost There‚Äù"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was very clean and as pictured. The yard is great and fully fenced. We did not worry that our small dog would escape.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at ‚ÄúAlmost There‚Äù could not have been any better. Rebecca‚Äôs eye for style and detail are on point and the space was immaculate and spotless. It was the little details that made the difference, such as; the sound of the back yard wind chimes in the breeze, the quality of the beds, and the consideration for your pet (dog bed, furniture throws, etc). We will definitely stay again next time we are in the Pawleys Island area."

Our dogs especially loved the large, fenced-in backyard. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood, is a quick trip to the historic district, and a 20 minute drive to Pawley‚Äôs Island. Rebecca was communicative and kindly provided recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. We were sad to leave!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rebecca goes above and beyond of what one would expect from most AirBNBs. She truly cares about the comfort of her guest(s). My son and I had the pleasure of staying in ‚ÄúAlmost There‚Äù and it was absolutely dreamy. As soon as we walked in it was as if she was welcoming us with a big hug.
The photos doesn‚Äôt really do it justice. The decor alone was enough to weep at. It‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs close enough to everything that you don‚Äôt feel as if you‚Äôre making that long of a drive, but it‚Äôs also far enough away that you‚Äôre not in the hustle and bustle of the city. It was immaculate and so clean. It was the perfect house to call home for our stay.
We would definitely stay here again."

All in all, ""Almost There"" truly felt like a home away from home and we definitely plan on returning!"

We will definitely be back!"

They were always in contact with us before our trip. During our stay, they contacted us to make sure we didn‚Äôt need anything. So accommodating and pleasant to work with. Even Keith, their neighbor, introduced himself and asked if he could help us in any way! The backyard is completely fenced in and is like a little oasis. We were so pleased, as were our fur babies. The kitchen is well equipped and has some basic staples.. oil, salt, pepper, those kinds of things you forget about (like we did.) There are a few beach chairs, beach towels, and an umbrella also, but we just used our own since we brought them.
This property is about 15 minutes (depending on traffic) to Pawleys Island, which has a gorgeous beach with public parking. A few more minutes down the road is Murrells Inlet, which has some great seafood choices. There‚Äôs a binder with menus from many of the surrounding restaurants to help. Broadway at the Beach was about 45 minutes, but we were also there during July 4th weekend with lots of traffic in general, so it may not take that long on a normal day. It‚Äôs still not a bad drive.
We loved our stay and can‚Äôt wait to go back. It was the perfect house for our family getaway! ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüå¥"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Janna was accommodating and pleasant to communicate with.
The house was very clean and furnished well. Comfortable bed‚Ä¶

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay. Rained on friday which made our visit to Downtown not so good. But all and all a good get away. Very nice accommodations.

Our stay in this Georgetown Airbnb was an absolute delight. It exceeded our expectations in every way imaginable, and we left with hearts full of gratitude and a promise to return.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I thought the home was perfect. Janna had everything we needed for our stay and the house was very clean. Overall the actual home was definitely a 5/5. The only thing that I wish I knew before booking was how noisy and loud the street is. Even at 3AM, you can hear cars flying past the home. In the description it says you can sit on the front porch and hear birds but unfortunately the traffic makes that impossible. It did cause us to wake up and lose sleep which was unfortunate. If the home was on a quieter street it would definitely be one of the best in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,House was beautiful and worked out wonderful for our needs.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, the house is perfect for pups! Very close to Pawleys Island to visit family, Georgetown is definitely worth the visit within itself however!! The house is new and very quiet, very nice and extremely clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Once again, we had a fabulous stay! This is the cutest little cottage and the perfect place to stay with our pups‚Äîthe new fence is fantastic. Janna has thought of EVERYTHING. We really didn‚Äôt need to pack as much as we did the 2 times we have been there because she supplied everything we could need and even left a sweet welcome gift. We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was immaculate and Janna was very thoughtful of providing her guest with special touches of hospitality.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless. Janna has everything you need for a comfortable stay. We rested and slept like we were at home. The shower in the main bathroom has great water pressure and gets nice and hot. The trip to Pawleys beach was only about 10 minutes. We found some fresh shrimp at Stormy Seas, I highly recommend them for your fresh seafood needs.
We will be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here prior to buying our home! It was so great to have a fenced backyard for the dogs!! Beautiful place very comfortable!!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about Joanna‚Äôs place was a positive.
Cottage was spacious, clean and comfortable.
Sitting on the porch was lovely, but the only disappointment was the fact the cottage was located on a highway, and thus it was quite noisy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this Airbnb!! It was amazing ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You can tell Janna goes out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable and at home. Better than the pictures! Close to Downtown ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs perfect!

Janna was so thoughtful when getting ready for our arrival and stay. She reached out to make sure we had the code. It was for our wedding weekend at the Kaminski House Museum. She made us a charcuterie tray and had a bottle of champagne waiting for us! Janna wrote a hand-written thank you card, thanking us for staying and gave us her number if we needed to reach her along with sone Lindt chocolates!
Will definitely book again! Chelli, our dog loved looking out the window. Great place for your pup too!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of our favorite Airbnb experiences. Janna reached out to us prior to check in to see if anyone in our party had detergent sensitivities. As a mom to a child who has major skin issues (he wasn‚Äôt traveling this time), this really struck a chord with me. The house was gorgeous, toiletries provided were a wonderful touch, and the ease of check-in was amazing. We will be back! Thanks so much Janna!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time in Georgetown, Pawleys Island and Murrells Inlet. The house was very clean and welcoming. Janna was very helpful with many ideas of things to do. Location was great other than it is on a very busy street. We brought a gate for dogs to keep them from running to street but there is a great porch and easy to block off.
We would recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Janna was an amazing host! She suggested some great places to eat and responded quickly to any text I sent! We loved our stay and we will come back. One downside I found was the cottage is very close to the road and our dog likes to try to bolt out the door so definitely keep doggos back when going outside.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Janna's house was perfect for our stay. It was clean and communication with Janna was quick and easy. The busy road didn't bother us; the bedrooms are on the back of the house. The kitchen is very large and well equipped for a vacation rental. We ate at Buzz's Roost Restaurant and Sports Bar on Sunday and it was good, but many local restaurants are closed on Sunday. Would definitely stay again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Janna was very communicative and the house was amazing.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, lovely place from which to explore the local beaches.

It‚Äôs a new build and is very clean and comfortable. The house has a large kitchen with ample space for cooking or hanging out. It is located on a main road so if you are sensitive to street noise, it might not be for you. The owner was very gracious and communicative. Great place if you are traveling with a dog."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful airbnb! It is hard to find dog friendly airbnbs, especially clean ones. This was the best airbnb I have stayed it. Very clean, nice floor place, games to play, open living room/kitchen area, and big front porch. Janna communicate with us ahead of time asking about allergies and giving us the door code. She left the porch light on for us, as we arrived late. She also left us a few toiletries in the bathroom and a bottle of wine in the kitchen. Dog water bowl, bags and dog bed a plus too!

Being able to bring our dogs was a huge plus, and the deli tray and bottle of wine Janna left for us was very welcoming. Has an incredible kitchen for a cottage this size, granite counters and all very nice stainless appliances, and is the best stocked we've ever stayed in for cooking and eating. We will definitely stay here again next time we come to the G-town area."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! Place was clean and tidy!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculately clean home and an awesome host! Janna went above and beyond to make us feel at home! Being able to bring our dog, Lucy was the icing on the cake.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. It's spotlessly clean, bright and shiny new. Everything is very thoughtfully put together- a real full kitchen with plenty of appliances and dishes; we ate out less because it was so easy to cook there. High quality towels and sheets, comfortable furniture. It felt like a new home, and not a place where the hosts just did the requisite things. Thoughtful welcome fruit plate and basket of toiletries in both bathrooms. Just a great find on Air BnB."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would absolutely stay here again if we travel back this way!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful clean cottage with extra touches near Georgetown‚Äôs waterfront with plenty of space and attentive hosts! Will stay again if in the area.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic getaway spot that is easily accessible to all the grand strand has to offer. Historic Georgetown is minutes down the road, Pawleys Island, Myrtle Beach and Murrells Inlet are 20-30 minutes on 17 North. The house is immaculate with new finishes/furnishings and a huge kitchen! Good sized bedrooms and bathrooms and added benefit of a laundry room. We got in late and were so excited to see a kind note from the owner and a beautiful meat and cheese tray!!! Welcome to the true south y'all, these are lovely hosts ‚ù§"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will love this location close to everything very clean still smells new great host
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,house was great and had everything you could need ! and host was easy to get ahold of had no problems üòä
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, new and clean. The host added a number of personal touches to make our stay more comfortable and left us a fruit plate. The home is only a few minutes drive from historic Georgetown; however the home is located on a busy road. Definitely would stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"for the first time in a while, we actually got a place that was advertised as being clean that was actually clean! Not sure if we just have high standards or what, but this place was exactly as described, and everything was pretty much brand new. Owner was super easy to communicate with, and put a lot of attention into small details with her rental, and the southern hospitality truly shows when you arrive. You are easily situated within 10 minutes from historic Georgetown, and you‚Äôve got about 20 minutes if you want to do Pawleys Island for the beach. I did takeoff one star for location just because the house is on a busy road. Not a dealbreaker at all, and the perfectness of everything else more than made up for that. Only mentioning it in case you are traveling with skittish pets, or kids that are light sleepers and/or small children that can open doors and like to wander out ;)."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host! The place was very clean and well-furnished. We were so thankful we were able to bring our pup along as well!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, had all of the amenities needed, and was at a convenient location (on the edge of town). Great host & great communication. Having a place that was dog friendly is what brought us to this house. The home was so clean you would never know a pet was ever inside it. We will come back in the future the next time we venture to Georgetown."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was super clean host was really nice and accommodating
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and perfect equipped new house. All new furniture and appliances. Janna was a great host. She washed alle bedding and towels with a sensitive skin detergent and made sure there are no feathers in the bedding, after I asked her whether she could provide allergic bedding. She prepared three different chicken salads, lettuce and grapes to make wraps. Janna asked us whether we need anything to reach out to her any time. This was a wonderful stay! Would recommend to anyone."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, everything was as stated and owner was communicating throughout the entire process. This hostess goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is as expected."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great houseboat! Great location!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kevin and his family were great hosts. If you are looking for fancy-smancy 5 star place - this is not it. What it is: Very cool houseboat. Tastefully furnished. Unparalleled beauty that only comes with a waterfront view. Private. Comfortable. Quiet. Pristine. Lower birth comfortable beds with water gently lapping three inches away. Kids would absolutelyblove this place! 10 out of 10!!!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Kevin was very responsive and the view from. the boat is great.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's houseboat, ""Maggie Jo"", was the perfect place to spend the weekend! I was working for one of the days that we stayed, but my husband had a relaxing day hanging out on the boat, drinking a few beers on the dock and walking in the woods. The next morning, we took advantage of the kayaks and explored the creeks across the river from the boat, where we spotted a lot of birds and a couple of alligators. The proximity to Georgetown's downtown area was a happy surprise; there were shops, restaurants and a great coffee bar. We are already planning a trip back to ""Maggie Jo"" with our kids this fall!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So much fun. Everything was spotless. Responded quickly when we had a question. It was peaceful and the live oaks were beautiful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my wife had a wonderful stay. We didn't arrive until after 11PM but everything was walk in and ready for our stay. 30 minuets after arriving we were able to sit out on the dock and do some relaxing fishing. Will stay again just longer next time.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre up for glamping on a houseboat this is for you. Comfy, not luxurious but the setting can‚Äôt be beat. Worth getting up to watch the sunrise. Oh, the birds! And oh! the chorus of frogs last night! We would definitely stay again. Host was responsive to all questions and left the light on for us when we arrived after dark."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to find quiet and enjoy beautiful views! Kevin was very responsive to all questions and made everything perfect for a wonderful weekend getaway!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kevin's Maggie jo was awesome. we were here for work and stayed Teo weeks. it was worth every penny. we caught some catfish while staying as well as some sun. we saw some beautiful sunsets and kevin was there to answer any questions or concerns we had at the drop of a hat. you can tell Maggie Jo has been very well maintained and feels extremely homey. will definitely stay here again if ever in the area 10/10 recommend
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful adventure here! Very peaceful area surrounded by nature and of course right on the river (cranky teen approved and had a great time kayaking around looking for gators and birds). Kevin and family friendly and helpful, boat clean, compact and comfy, sunsets were breathtaking, location was convenient to Cape Romain - highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,had a great time caught 10 catfish and a couple eels and enjoyed watching the bald eagles
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time fishing on the boat. We caught 11 cat fish! It was a gorgeous day and the sunset was amazing. Definitely will be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a joy staying on Maggie Jo again. My husband and myself absolutely love it and love Georgetown. Kevin is a wonderful host and is very responsive with any question we have.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We wanted to do something different for our 37th wedding anniversary and this place was perfect for us....Spent a nice quiet 3 days out on the water and close enough to town to get to a nice restaurant or shopping.
This was one of the best stays for us to just relax and unwind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was such a pleasure staying on Maggie Jo. It was so beautiful, clean, and Kevin was easy to communicate with!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great one night stay. Very quiet and peaceful. Fantastic sunset and sunrise. The inside of the boat was spacious enough for two people. It had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Arrived intending to explore the Georgetown area, but as soon as we got on the houseboat it was so peaceful, relaxing and a beautiful we never left!! Except for a quick trip to a grocery store!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house boat in a lovely quiet place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maggie Jo was extremely peaceful, can't wait to return"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it here. Will definitely come back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay on Maggie Jo! Kevin was very responsive and even met us at the boat for check-in to show us around. Everything we needed was on the boat. We even got to see a little bit of wildlife during our one night stay! We had a calm night and the boat didn‚Äôt rock very much except when another boater passed by on the river. We would stay here again and definitely wanted to stay longer than one night!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This rental could be awesome, and by the other reviews, it has been for other people, but for us, it just wasn't great. As soon as we arrived and opened the door, there was a very notable smell. We walked around, and the bathroom smelled worse. I messaged Kevin and he told me that it happens sometimes and I should open the bathroom window and keep the door closed. Those two things had already been done when we arrived so there was nothing else for us to do but live with the smell. I also asked him about the big canopy that was pictured going over the upper deck since it was going to be in the 90's and sunny for the three days that we were there. He said it had gotten torn up in a previous storm and wasn't available. Then the night before we were to leave, we went downstairs to go to bed and there was water puddled on the floor and running from the front of the boat. I messaged Kevin again and he said that every few weeks he has to turn on the bilge pump to get the water out."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best !!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin is solution based‚Ä¶ we had a couple minor issues and he went up and beyond to take care of them. He‚Äôs a great host and I‚Äôll definitely recommend this experience for others.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Karen was so welcoming and personable. She did an outstanding job explaining the houseboat and making us feel welcome. This Airbnb is perfect for making memories with a unique experience. Our young family cannot wait to visit again. Thank you.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was fantastic!!! we absolutely loved our stay. we were only there overnight but it was the most relaxing and peaceful time we've had in a long time. Karen was so sweet and friendly we will definitely be back..
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time on Maggie Jo- a beautiful marina, and very comfortable boat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect location and nice experience
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay, and very responsive and pleasant hosts. Can‚Äôt miss the sunrise at this place, it was beautiful!! There was a small malfunction with the toilet that made it smell, but I was told they would be fixing it soon. Would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location! Very peaceful with lots of wildlife viewing right from the boat. I was worried about rocking but it really was not noticeable the majority of the time. Word of caution - interior steps are steep so might not work for someone with mobility issues. Wear nonslip shoes entering and exiting - walkway around boat is narrow but does have handrail. Overall a pleasant relaxing weekend with beautiful scenery! Kevin was immediately responsive with our questions and made sure everything was in good working order. We appreciate his hospitality!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, only had time for a quick weekend but will definitely be back soon! This place is a must stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay on Maggie Jo. The boat had everything we needed, towels and sheets, a coffee maker and fridge and other kitchen items, and different options for relaxing. It was perfect for a family with two young kids. The boat is on a peaceful marina, surrounded by nature. They have two tandem kayaks we took out for a wonderful outing up to Penny Royal Creek. We saw some dolphins in the distance and a few alligators who passed by. It was close to Georgetown by car, and just a lovely spot to get away from it all for a few days. Thanks to the hosts for a comfortable little adventure!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful on the water. Felt right at home and was comfortable. He was a great host and if I needed anything he was on it
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay. The marina is quiet and peaceful, and the area is beautiful! Kevin is indeed an outstanding host, and he was so good with any communication.
.
Our stay was very comfortable; we had not a single problem.
I'm glad we stayed here!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay here very much! The marina is beautiful, peaceful, and well maintained, and the Maggie Jo is very clean and well laid out. We were concerned it might rock a lot and cause motion sickness, but the rocking was gentle and usually brief, so there was no problem even through several rainstorms. The beds are in a half-height lower area that gets stuffy on hot nights, but the two fans helped. The air conditioning works well for the upper levels. The kitchen was clean and fully equipped. The electric toilet was a little frustrating, requiring persistent fiddling with the buttons. The shower was compact but comfortable and easy to use. We had fun fishing from the deck and piers, catching both fresh and saltwater fish. We enjoyed kayaking along both sides of the river and in some of the wider lanes and creeks. We saw small alligators near the shore, and a variety of birds and other wildlife."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for a father/son weekend. The boat was a unique stay, allowed for fishing right from the boat, and we loved it. It was clean and comfortable. Kevin was a great host and we would love to stay again."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Rustic and quiet, this place was fine for enjoying some kayaking or fishing but needed some sewage treatment or pump out to clear out the odor. The lower deck beds were comfortable enough. The main entrance had sofa bed that was too large to open up into the room with the big chair sharing the room. The galley was well equipped with plenty of dishes, pans, silverware, and basic condiments in fridge. Very helpful to provide soap, salt, pepper, sugar, coffee. Kevin was helpful if we needed anything. We would try again if the sewage was dealt with."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great relaxing place to stay on the water. we had a guys fishing weekend and this place was very convenient to get on the water. Kevin was a great host and answered any questions we had. thanks for making it a great vacation
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved staying here - we will definitely be back! Awesome location
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had never stayed on a houseboat and it was fantastic! Everything was just as Kevin described and the marina was Fabulous. We will be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a fun stay. We brought our two 10 year old grandsons to stay here. They loved the kayaks, the eagles, and the fishing. Kevin was so helpful in recommending a fishing spot. We recommend this for those who are looking for a quiet stay on the water."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time on Maggie Jo, I will definitely be back! Mr. Kevin and his wife gave us our complete privacy but they were always there to help for whatever we needed. We love this boat as well as the scenery, and all the wildlife around."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful unique stay. The sleeping quarters are best suited for smaller folk which suited us fine. Very responsive host. Nice quiet area. You can see the paper factory in the distance from the boat but it‚Äôs easy to ignore and the marsh and river are beautiful. Peaceful and relaxing.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time doing Airbnb and a great experience. It was accurately described and a good fit for what our family is interested in - wildlife, peaceful - camping vibe on the water with all the comforts of home."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Super peaceful. Quiet and relaxing atmosphere ‚òÄÔ∏èüê†
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The coffee maker broke and within the hour we had a new one!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and unique stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! We stumbled upon this jem and will definitely be back. It's super easy to get to. Located on a super clean and well maintained dock. You cant beat being softly lulled to sleep on the water. Kitchen has everything you need. We had a girls weekend and felt perfectly safe. All of us gals had an excellent time and Kevin gets 5 stars from all of us.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, quiet, and quaint. Bring only the necessities. We went on a week that was very cold, so we could not enjoy the outdoors.
The indoor steps to the lower level kitchen area are big. For my elderly friend and myself who are less than 5 ft tall, we barely managed. The bedrooms were very comfortable. Living area was comfortable. Boat is great for a couple, but would be crowded if any more. You need to be tiny fit in and out of boat. You need to walk sideways. Kevin and his wife were very helpful when needed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and I had a wonderful time on the houseboat. Caught several medium sized catfish and other pan fish during our stay. Houseboat was very clean and accommodating for the two of us.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet and peaceful stay on the water. Waking up to a beautiful sunrise was perfect!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's a boat, what more can you say!
What a great place to relax and enjoy the river."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The boat was great. Will stay again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying on the Maggie Jo! We were there in early January - we encourage others to visit this time of year. Each day was sunny with highs in the lower 60s - great weather for kayaking and cycling. The provided kayaks and equipment were super. Francis Marion National Forest is a wonderful place for cycling, with few cars and a combination of paved and gravel roads. Sunrises and sunsets on the boat are particularly beautiful. Kevin was quick to respond to inquiries and quite accommodating. Three points to note: Not surprisingly, there is a bit of a walk from the parking area out to the boat. If we had anticipated this, we would have packed differently and saved ourselves a trip back and forth. Second, as stated in the description there is no wifi, so make sure you have enough phone data for your needs. We are on T-Mobile, and had great 5g reception. Third, ceilings are low - perfectly fine for short people like us, but perhaps uncomfortable for those, say, 6'3"" or taller."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Worth the stay! Friendly host. Didn‚Äôt meet Kevin in person but we did his wife. She was very friendly and accommodating. The location of the boat is beautiful and the boat is very nice and well kept. Our stay was nice and peaceful
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay on Maggie Jo was absolutely great! The boat was gorgeous and clean and the view was amazing. Kevin was a great host and very responsive. I will definitely be booking with him again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevin‚Äôs boat was exactly what I was looking for- peace, very quiet, and amazing location. The boat itself was immaculate and had everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I will absolutely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place on the water! We enjoyed the last breath of the warm autumn weather on the Maggie Jo.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, bald eagles and other wildlife, peaceful and quiet. We loved our stay and will be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was great! My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary weekend and had a blast! Maggie jo is a very unique and special bost. There's a lot of little details that just makes the experience so nice! The boat neighbor next door Mike was also very nice and welcoming. We are already planning our 2nd trip back down.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cool spot, basically had the whole Marina to ourselves. Beautiful views and the boat has a good vibe."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very unique place, it was a great stay and location. I would definitely recommend, and visit again if in this area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed staying here while in Georgetown for a special occasion. Plenty of space for the two of us, very quiet and peaceful, and a quick, easy drive to the downtown area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,if you want a million dollar view with the peace and quiet of the river you'll love the Maggie Jo. She's a sweetheart of a boat.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay on the Maggie Jo was a total delight. The boat is exceptionally clean and well-appointed. As promised, we were treated to eagle and dolphin sightings and very comfortable beds. After a great night's sleep I woke to dazzling sunrises. And we had an extra-special treat, viewing the SpaceX Starlink launch from the deck - wow! Kevin is an excellent host and it was great to have Mike next door too. Hope we can make a return visit soon!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What an amazingly unique experience in the Maggie Jo! Even though we were only 60 miles away from our home it felt like the middle of no where on the Sampit and that in itself was awesome. I highly recommend spending some time here!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect weekend getaway!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,thanks for the amazing stay! It was the perfect location from the wedding!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time we stayed at Maggie Jo. We always have a lot of fun . My daughter always find lots of things to do . We watched the sunrise, have dinner at the upper deck while waiting to see the sunset. We also visited a near beach and strolled at historic Georgetown. The boat was very clean and cozy at our arrival. The variety of plants give life to Maggie Jo. We will miss it for now, but already planning our 4th time when my daughter returns on break from the Coast Guard training. See you soon Maggie . Thank you Kevin, it was a pleasure to meet you. You and your wife are great hosts!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little gem of a getaway for us! The houseboat was absolutely immaculate, I expected to smell fuel and marina smell inside, but there were no odors whatsoever. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets, I would highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay on the Maggie Jo. We are so glad to share this experience with our six year old. He thought it was so fun to sleep on a boat. I really enjoyed watching the sun set on the top deck and watching my husband fish off the dock. Our trip was really short so we spent most of our time at Brookgreen Gardens and dining on Front St in historic downtown Georgetown. We found a small beach at Morgan park and there was a nice playground nearby there as well. Maggie Jo has all the necessities to have a comfortable and peaceful stay away from home. Definitely would like to stay for a longer trip in the future and take advantage of the kayaks that were included. Thank you Kevin!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Leave the crowds behind. Get ready for the most beautiful views. Our family spent time unplugged and connected to each other. Kevin is a wonderful host. You will not regret your time with Maggie Jo.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simple, clean, and great houseboat! And love the location!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Maggie Jo was such a charming and cozy place to stay. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and definitely plan on coming back!
I was a little nervous about staying on a boat in the hot summer weather, but the AC plus the fans on board kept it super cool and comfortable even down underneath.
Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time my son and I had slept on a boat. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience!! Kevin and his wife were very gracious and helpful! The check in went smoothly. The communication was on point. The neighboring boosters were very friendly. The sunrise and sunset was gorgeous. We enjoyed fishing off the back of the boat and even caught a couple of catfish!! I will definitely be back!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful stay on the river. Beautiful interior, cozy haven even with the thunderstorms!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful relaxing place . We came for the second time and this time we stayed a little longer. We enjoyed the beautiful sunrises and sunsets . Nature and the nice cozy boat ‚Äú Maggie Jo‚Äù were a gift to my daughter and myself. Thank you again to Kevin and his wife for their hospitality.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had an excellent time here. Would definitely stay again. Fun and unique experience!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin is absolutely a ‚ÄúSuperhost‚Äù. He met us at his beautiful houseboat to assure we had everything we needed and showed us how to turn on/off propane for cooking. He had 2 kayaks waiting for us as well as ALL the necessities to make our stay comfortable. The houseboat was immaculately clean and felt like home. We enjoyed the top deck-having early morning coffee and a glass of wine for the sunsets. Peaceful, calming, relaxing and close to all activities. We highly recommend this Airbnb! We are already planning our next visit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Kevin's boat was fantastic and perfect for a night in Georgetown. We enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the views of the river. Kevin was extremely helpful. I keep this place in mind for future trips in this area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin is great host and the boat was a perfect place to stay. We really enjoyed kayaking too and were thrilled to see three dolphins en route. The marina is off the beaten path, not far from quaint Georgetown. Thanks so much!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kevin was Awesome! Had a great experience!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! The location is superb! Very quiet and relaxing. The kayaks were a great plus. This is not your usual vacation rental at the beach!!! If you are looking for something fun and different, this might be it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was an amazing host. The property/boat was well kept, clean, private and well taken care of. We have recommended it several times since arriving and expect our friends and family will no doubt make their own plans to enjoy the Maggie Jo. Great job all around from the amazing neighborhood on the water to the recommendations and delite with the local enjoyment. BEE sure to visit the Buzz's ROOST for live music like no other. On the boat itself prepare for a snug and quaint environment. And if u r long be prepared to make adjustments height wise for safety and overall enjoyment while enjoying the boat.
Thanks soo much!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying in this house boat was a wonderful gift my kids gave me for my birthday. I loved every minute of it , quiet scenery, relaxing, enjoying nature and breakfast on deck. My kids and I will be back in the near future. Thank you for your hospitality."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! We loved the location and loved the boat! Quiet and beautiful. We would highly recommend staying here!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"had never stayed on a house boat, it was a truly wonderful experience. we had a crazy thunderstorm that added to the experience. had a wonderful time. Iwould definitely stay here again and recommend to others."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what a amazing beautiful place! i absolutely recommend staying on Maggie Jo! let me just say the 2 nights we stayed were the most relaxing nights of my life! she was clean, you have everything you need. we can't wait to come back next year, but this time we will be staying longer! Kevin is great and the neighbor Mike is so helpful and right there if you need anything! thank you again Kevin for letting us stay on Maggie Jo. we had a amazing time."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The houseboat was exactly as advertised and was a great new experience for my husband and I. Being on the river‚Äîliterally *on* the river‚Äîwas unspeakably beautiful and the marina is very quiet. Mike (neighbor) is very helpful and great to talk with. My only caution is for those of us with aging knees (or other ailments): there are a lot of fairly steep steps to traverse inside the boat itself. Still: we would definitely recommend this place!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,everything was clean and AC was on before we arrived. host was super helpful and we had a great time with the kayak!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a phenomenal time staying on the Maggie Jo. Kevin is a fantastic host, and really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. That includes a great recommendation to paddle the kayaks that come with the rental down to Pennyroyal Creek and explore the estuary system. The boat is well taken care of and includes everything you might need, from a full kitchen set up, shower, flush toilet, AC, full size fridge, and lovely hangout spaces both below decks and above. It basically felt like staying in a really nice RV, except we were on a sweet waterfront instead of a campground.
The marina is quiet, private, and super chill, and they were literally fish jumping all over the place the whole time we were there. Neighbors are great and we really enjoyed the whole scene. Steady breezes kept us cool even when the sun was hot, and if you're an early riser, don't miss the chance to catch the sunrise, it's truly something special.
The one note for other guests is that while the boat does have potable water, fine for cooking and coffee, but we're a little spoiled with our tap water at home, and if we were staying a long time would probably bring some jugs with us, or just go grab some drinking water from a nearby store on the way in."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs not a hotel but it‚Äôs unique for a getaway. We had a great time fishing and living the house boat life
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Had fun fishing and thanks for all tips!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a different type of accomodations with lots of peace and quiet, chance to see dolphins, and eagles we would highly recommend Kevin's houseboat. Kevin goes above and beyond to make your experience one you will truly remember."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay on the boat! Had everything we needed. Bed is comfortable and great wildlife viewing.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We didn‚Äôt actually make it to our rental as we ended up purchasing home at our first stop on this trip; however, Kevin was very understanding and accommodating, and we look forward to visiting sometime in the near future!"
