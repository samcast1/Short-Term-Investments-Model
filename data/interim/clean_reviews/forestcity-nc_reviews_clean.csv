2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald's place was perfect for our needs. Super private and comfortable and close to Forest City where everything you need can be found. Check in and check out were a breeze and the unit was very clean with updated kitchen and bath. Great find, great price!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great host. Great location. Super peaceful and quiet. Always a pleasure to stay here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute airbnb, great location. Secluded and surrounded by nature, which I loved every minute of it. Very peaceful and quiet. I loved seeing the deer in the mornings. I also loved to walk through the woods down to the creek. I would stay here again and Don is a great host. Very attentive and responds in a timely manner"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our very first time booking an Airbnb. It was so much easier than I expected. And way better and more comfortable than getting a hotel. We will definitely rebook for future visits to our friends in Forest City!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway. Very peaceful and close to everything. Would stay again. There aren’t any sofas or comfy chairs to recline in but the bed has an electric frame that was very easy to get comfortable in reading a book or working on my laptop.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was great. It was a 5 minute drive to downtown Forest City. House was well stocked, clean, and comfortable. Donald was a great host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful sleeping quarters with a full kitchen nestled less than a mile from the shop’s & restaurants in downtown Forest City.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was really great, a little treasure surrounded by nature - but still everything for the daily need was in within a 10-15 minute car ride. I’d come back anytime!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a great place to stay for rest after working.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We travel to the area on occasion for work projects. We’ve stayed at Donald’s place previously and we will be back when we have future projects in the area.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place in the woods so close for us for a quick getaway. Comfy beds ,awesome shower , beautiful kitchen, lots of channels to choose from , cute town and so quiet !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful property full of wildlife and peaceful surroundings. close to main Street, the thermal belt trail for those who enjoy a nice walk or bike ride and all the mountains have to offer."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it! A place where we could relax and unwind. Being surrounded by nature gave us a peace that in the city is impossible to find. 100% recommended.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Don is a wonderful, responsive host. You can tell he really cares about your experience. We loved the place and hope to come back in the future!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside was beautiful. Immaculate and clean
Fully furnished. Met our needs very well.
The outside needs a little attention but it is winter."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and everything Donald said it was. He was very responsive when I had a question.
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place itself was nice as pictured in the photos, the walls of the duplex are very thin so you’d have to get lucky with the neighbors to have a quiet stay.
Donald is very responsive though I appreciated that."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place nestled in the woods right outside of town. Clean and comfortable for the price. Only thing to note is that it is a duplex so as long as you have quiet respectful neighbors all should be well. Sadly, that wasn’t the case for us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Private, beautiful surroundings, and extremely close to downtown Forest City with great restaurants (check out Pie Safe Bakery). It is a terrific value when compared to other Airbnbs or local hotels. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend to friends or family. The interior was well-kept, and clean, and wonderful walks through the beautiful property outside."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A comfy little hideaway in the woods .Our son decided to drive in from Va last minute to join us which was a bonus for my birthday . The home was very clean ! The beds we’re super comfortable and the new kitchen has everything you need to make a meal . We enjoyed our stay at the cabin .
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, secluded house in the woods. Thought the listing was for entire home. It was for 1/2 unit. Listing Title should reflect that. Too confusing to figure out when switching between listings Needed a local place close for a family funeral. Darkened shades were awesome for sleeping and getting used to the time change. The massaging bed was a nice surprise. Close to area attractions, small town feel. Unit was clean. A few minor issues, but Don came up with a great fix.
The greetings from the morning deer was very enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Donald's place was great! Exactly what I was looking for. Peaceful, quiet, clean and homey. Everything was neat and clean. Would definitely stay here again! Donald was quick to get in contact with and made sure everything was perfect for my stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this property . I absolutely love the privacy it’s secluded in the woods but a 5 minute drive to town . I can’t say it enough what a great host Don is . Anytime I text him for anything he responded right away he’s a great host that takes care of his guest .Since finding Dons place on Airbnb I won’t stay anywhere else. If your looking for a very nice place to stay I highly recommend Dons Place it’s a gem in the woods we love it and we will be back !!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice kitchen and bathroom amenities!! Very convenient parking, outdoor lights made it easy to unload when we got there.
This stay was exactly what we needed and even accommodated a last minute addition of our dog"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Donald’s place because it was within 1 mile from the Thermal Belt Rail (bicycling) trail and not too far from Chimney Rock. What I didn’t know was how quaint the town of Forest City is which was an added bonus! You are about 1/2 mile from this quaint town yet you feel like you are in the middle of a forest with all nature sounds and no traffic sounds. There was a grouping of 7 huge turkeys crossing through the property at dusk yesterday. Donald was a responsive and conscientious host. We would definitely book his place again.
I highly recommend the locally homemade ice cream at Smith’s Drugs. Lots of creamy delicious flavors to choose from and very reasonably priced."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt just at home! Such a beautiful stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The driveway is a bit challenging but I had a truck so not an issue. Place was immaculate with a great kitchen & shower & comfortable beds. No separate living area but I knew that from the photos. Donald was very accommodating & let us check in early which was greatly appreciated.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here. Highly recommend! Don is very responsive to inquiries and quite kind. Beautiful 28 acres to wander! Newly remodeled and very tasteful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely home! It’s 100 years old but recently updated to a high quality level. It’s a duplex but luckily had pretty quiet neighbors. 28 acres to explore. Don was proactive in communication. Highly recommended his home. I’ll be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was a little getaway. Donald was so helpful, and even though he was on his own vacation, he took the time to respond to any questions as soon as possible. the little place was spacious yet cozy. I'm not a fan of the bugs outside, but I was so comfortable there. it wasn't too far from the main st where we had good food and nice walks. bring good walking shoes or boots if you decide to walk through the trails. watch out for the sider webs! I'll definitely come back here if I visit this area again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Donald’s cottage was very clean and he was an accommodating host. We were aware it was a duplex when we booked, but there was slightly more noise than we were anticipating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Great price. I had trouble with the door late at night gave Donald a call and he answered happy to help. I'll be back
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, and homey! Kitchen was very nice and beds (especially one of them) were really comfortable. The space has everything you’d need. I’ve stayed in quite a few Airbnb’s and this one definitely stands out for the value you receive in Don’s price!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place if you are looking for a quiet getaway and yet close to Main street.
Donald is very responsive and helpful"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this quaint home away from home. Surrounded by beautiful landscape, the host is excellent and responds in a timely fashion."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Private and peaceful. Loved being able to stay so close to downtown and near Family at the same time. This is a duplex 2 bdrm, 1 bath, and a kitchen in each duplex. My next stay we will rent the whole house just to have extra space for a ""family room"" area. Thanks again Donald."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice stay to visit family. Don answered questions promptly. Nice place, very private, saw deer several times over the week, used grill and outdoor area. We will stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Donald was amazing! I came to the area and needed to stay for about a month. Don’s place was the perfect place for me and my dog. It is secluded but also very close to town. Know that there are technically two units at this properly, but I never had any issues with the guests staying on the other side. Don is a great host. He was always extremely quick to respond to messages / phone calls, very respectful and professional. This specific unit is 2 beds, 1 bath, and a large kitchen. There isn’t a a living room, but it was truly perfect for our stay. The appliances are completely up to date, and the place was very clean. There are some bugs, but that’s to be expected. I truly expected to see more in the house, but if you take care and keep the doors shut then no issues. You will see some critters such as deer or turkey, again, to be expected. I would absolutely stay here or any of Don’s units again"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was lovely. It’s so clean and quiet. I love that’s it’s relatively close to the Main streets but still far enough for it to be private and secluded.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay. The house is surrounded by woods and very peaceful.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great secluded stay, not too far from town. Would certainly stay again"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this airbnb. Very private, beautiful surroundings, and comfortable bed. Secluded yet close enough to downtown. Donaldis a great host We will definitely be back"

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Pretty decent stay .
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald was a great host, and was very accommodating and helpful."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald’s Airbnb was great! It was clean, private, and so close to Main Street in Forest City. The only downfall for me would be that laundry is not included in unit B. The picture of the laundry room in the detached basement in the listing gave me the impression that laundry was an offered amenity. Overall, my experience was great and I’d recommend it to my friends or family."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay, great value. Donald was a great host, very accommodating."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay and enjoy the area
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was mostly as advertised. there was a glass sliding door between the bedrooms that had it not just been the two of us would have caused privacy issues. The host responded warmly to my suggestion of a curtain over the door. The unit was clean and well stocked. The property is very peacefull. The magnolia tree did drop quite a bit on our car since you have to park under it, just be aware. With in walking distance of town but, far enough out to feel like you're not. Donald was very freindly and responsive to communications. Good stay for a long weekend away!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was very clean and well furnished. Have to be careful if you have a low profile car coming in on the driveway.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was incredible. He is very friendly and so helpful while we were visiting for the first time. The house was clean and had all the essentials. My favorite part was how close it was to the Main Street but still in the woods. Thank you for an amazing stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic host
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very kind and helpful! The property was very secluded, but not far from all of the sites that the surrounding areas had in store. It was exactly what we needed! Check in was easy, the rental was very clean, and everything was comfortable and accommodating. We would love to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place close to our newly purchased lot and this was perfect. Thank you.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for our short stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was great. Donald was very attentive and always available. YOU MUST FOLLOW HIS DIRECTIONS TO GET THERE! I didn’t read his check in instructions completely which detailed the directions for arrival and advised against using gps software and of course I got lost. Lol. But Donald was very responsive and helpful with the arrival. The place was clean and almost new if not new. I have no complaints and will prob be back when I’m in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only wish we had booked more time! Forest City needs to be explored and this Airbnb is wonderful! We were just passing through for the night, but next time we will book more time to explore the area. Don's place is extremely comfortable with everything you need for comfort and cooking. Loved the bed with ""magic fingers""! Got a chance to chat with Don, and learned so much about the property's history. Btw- immaculate!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a drag race and initially selected the house for its convenience and proximity to track, but were pleasantly surprised by the charm of the farmhouse and surroundings. The house was very comfortable, very clean and well equipped. Brenda was so thoughtful in providing many incidentals that made our stay comfortable and stress free! I hope to have a return stay to relax and further enjoy the farm atmosphere sitting on the porch watching the horses or take in the pond.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, private and so peaceful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh what a lovely place! So PEACEFUL! We had such a relaxing stay. Everything was just perfect… From everything you could possibly need in the kitchen, to the soft beds, to the spotlessly clean interior, to the lovely decor, and to the perfect back patio with beautiful views! I love that it was a short drive to town to enjoy restaurants, ice cream, and fun thrift stores, and antique shopping! But, at the end of the day, the best thing was the house itself. Perfect place to refresh your soul!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This is a great AirBnB. It's about an hours drive from the Charlotte Airport, too, so its convenient for anyone who is traveling out the day after your stay.
The pictures show you just what you will experience. It's a VERY PRIVATE place, and you get the whole house to yourself. It's quiet. The house has all you need if you want to make a meal or want to grill out, etc.
We spent our night there at the end of our trip, and it was such a great, relaxing evening. We relaxed outside under a shelter attached to the back patio, and we smoked cigars while the rain pelted the roof of the shelter. It was a perfect way to end our trip and relax after driving so much the other days.
We highly recommend this place, and if we're in the area in the future, we would recommend staying with Brenda at this great AirBnB."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful place. Better than the pictures show. We were only there for 1 night, but could have stayed much longer. Highly, highly request this stay to anytime looking for a peaceful place to relax and enjoy those around you."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brenda' Sugar Ranch sure exceeded our expectations with it's extreme cleanliness and thought out Southern charm decor. The personal touches make the stay cozy and comfortable. Peacefulness is at a premium allowing for great relaxation in the hammocks. However, if you care to be more adventurous you can explore trails or fish and kayak on the pond. Beyond gracious the host was available to answer any questions. In addition to this delightful place, the surrounding area is just as beautiful with lots of options from hiking in the mountains to dining in a charming town and much more. Our family of four had a time and wish to return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place deserves a 15 on a scale from 1 to 10! It is a rare gem, beyond beautiful AND very quiet. This host was a generous host and made sure I had a fantastic stay. This host has literally thought of everything a guest might need! The home is comfortable, clean, and very well appointed. Check-in and check-out were easy. My family will definitely visit again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was taken aback by the breathtaking views. Brenda was the perfect hostess. She made sure everything in order for our arrival. The house and the outdoor area is absolutely spotless and immaculate. This was the perfect family-friendly spot. The host thoughtfully provided games and books for our little ones, making the stay even more memorable! Loved the vintage charm of this place! The host has done an incredible job preserving its character while offering modern conveniences. The front porch is a serene oasis, perfect for morning coffee. I was blown away by the attention to detail! The host stocked the kitchen with essentials, and the coffee/tea area is incredible. They did not skimp on any details! I slept so well! Our host went above and beyond to make sure we felt at home. We cannot wait to return. Thank you again for having us!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most special places I’ve stayed! Beautiful land, beautiful pond, fire pit, this place has it all! Will definitely return if I’m ever in the area"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay at this truly cozy place. Incredibly clean and had everything that we needed for a quick getaway. Rutherfordton is close by and had so many stores and local restaurants to choose from. Hope to be back!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rhonda’s place was such a great place to land after a long day in the car. Stayed her on our way down from Michigan to Florida. The downtown was very charming and food from the Copper Penny was fantastic! I highly recommend this little haven for your next road trip.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the best stay!! Smelled so clean when we arrived!! And the house was adorable!! Due to an early cheer competition we were only there to sleep and we were so sad we didn’t have more time there because the house was so perfect!! Will 100% stay again!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rhonda was an amazing host as usual!!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of our best stays. From the flexible check-in, to the well appointed home, it is an ideal property.
Well equipped to include a washer/dryer. gas fire place, and one of the easiest to use smart TVs for mirroring a tablet or laptop.
Great communication, cozy environment and extremely comfortable bed!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable little cottage. We made a day trip up to Forest City and just needed a place to spend the night. Location was great, walking distance to Main Street. We had dinner at the Copper Penny. The cottage was clean and super cute with an updated kitchen and bath. There is a screened in porch that we would have loved to use, but it was just a little too cold to sit outside when we were there. If we make it back, we'd definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay! The house was perfect and within walking distance to downtown Forest City. The space was clean and perfect for our family of 5. We hope to be able to come back and stay again in the future!

I don't have a single bad thing to say. forest city is a super cute little town!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Rhonda’s place while visiting family in my hometown. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay close to downtown Forest City, this is it! Easily walkable to restaurants and shopping in the downtown area with easy access to the walking trail in the county (the rail trail). We had everything we needed!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was conveniently located and extremely clean. It was super cute and decorated for Christmas which was a really nice touch.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at Rhonda’s home and it was as charming and comfortable as our first visit!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is beautifully decorated and very clean. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was ample in size. We will definitely stay there again when we are passing through and visiting with family.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was so nice and cute! Perfect place for a little girls night. Rhonda sent me instructions ahead of time (we were able to check in at any time), and the house had everything we needed - washing machine, detergent, lots of towels, shampoo/soap, cooking oil, etc. The only thing was we couldn't get the heat working, but that might have been because it was the first cold weekend in the fall. Also would have loved curtains or blinds in the house for privacy, but we still loved the place and had such a lovely time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent location with extremely easy access to the Thermal Belt Bike Trail. House looks small on the outside but has three nicely appointed bedrooms with an huge king-sized bed in the master bedroom. Everything inside has been very well done with a rustic look. Floors are beautiful and one wall appears to have been done from reclaimed wood. We can’t say enough good things about the Thermal Belt Bike Trail. One of the best rail trails we have ever ridden, plus Forest City is a great little town."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful place to stay! Would highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the nicest Airbnb’s ever and we’ve stayed at many different ones all over the country. Ample kitchen supplies, towels, blankets and very clean. The cottage is cozy and the beds are very comfortable. Rhonda has a flair for decorating and you will feel like you’re staying at a friend’s home. As a former VRBO owner, I am very picky because I provided a very clean and hospitable rental and expect the same from others. Rhonda was responsive to all questions. Our only issue was with the gas fireplace which operated, but set off the smoke alarm. My husband loves the coziness of a fireplace so I mention it only because that may be important to someone else,too. The cottage is in a quiet neighborhood next to a church and felt safe and within easy walking distance to downtown. We visited the Cherry Mt. General Store, Lake Lure and many area restaurants, parks,etc. We would gladly stay again if we were ever in the area. A very pleasant experience."

The cottage was well decorated and clean. When walking in, it smelled fresh and like a cozy home. It had all the essentials; plenty of towels. The king bed was super comfortable.

The guest book was super helpful for recommendations!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was wonderful and Rhonda was super friendly to my parents and very responsive when needed. I rented the cottage for my family so we could spend Christmas together. They loved the decorations, and my mom was super grateful for the Christmas tree already decorated. (She was afraid we wouldn't have one). The cottage itself, looks small on the outside but everyone was comfortable with plenty of room to sleep, play card games, watch movies, and open Christmas presents. I'm local to the area, however my mom said she would love to spend another weekend in Forest City. The location of the cottage is within walking distance of most of the best food and shopping Forest City has to offer. If you ever find yourself in the area, I would highly recommend staying here. Thank you Rhonda for giving my family the best Christmas we've had in a while."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda did a great job communicating with us. The house is close enough to downtown to walk, but it is on the edge of being too far, and the walk is a little dark. We enjoyed the house and downtown during our business-oriented trip."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, beautifully decorated cottage. Has everything you need in a nice ""home away from home"". The owners have very good taste! They are easy to communicate with and very accomodating. An added bonus is the delicious welcome gift we found upon arrival from ""The Pie Safe"" in downtown Forest City. Reminded me of the pies my grandmother made when I was growing up. A great place to stay within close proximity to many good restaurants, places to shop and things to do in the area. A great place to stay!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"it really was a beautiful experience to rest in the nice cabin. And thank you very much for the rich pay of Nut. Beautiful detail. I look forward to returning on the next work dates. Thank you for your attention, Rhonda."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was only there for a few hours for my two friends, and I had a speaking engagement at a school in a nearby town, but it was a delightful few hours. The place was quaint, convenient, and very clean with extremely comfortable amenities, including a variety of coffees and teas and a sweet treat upon arrival. The only thing lacking was a luggage rack. That would have been nice to have to sit my suitcase on, but I used the chair in the room as a makeshift rack. So, all was good.
I would recommend this place to anyone. I wish I had a week to stay there, not leave, and just ENJOY the wonderful space. THANKS!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute house, beautifully decorated, warm and inviting. It’s a two block walk to the downtown / Main Street area, and only 6 minutes down the road from the data center if that is what brings you to Forest City. We chose this place in part so we could bring our puppy. The host communicated well and had the house in tip top shape when we arrived."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rhonda is a great host and her “cottage” is an A+ textbook example of a great AirBnb. From the outside, a clearly older home that has had some nice work done, but coming inside is like walking into a “big reveal” on one of those HGTV fixer-up shows. Entirely updated, modern styles, and so tastefully decorated. And those beds - like sleeping on clouds. We already booked another stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Brand new, firm memory foam mattresses in all the bedrooms. Really well laid out with a well-equipped kitchen. Decor is tasteful. Feels like a much bigger house. Exceptional."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for the weekend we were showing at Tryon, it was only 15 minutes from the show grounds and easy to find. The house was very clean and cozy.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and explored a lot of places
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came to Forest City this weekend for a friends baby shower with our two dogs!! It’s rare to find a nice dog friendly airbnb, but this place was the best I’ve stayed at. The home was spotless, the fenced yard was amazing, and we felt right at home. They even thought of having a dog crate so we didn’t have to bring ours!! Holly was such a terrific host, and was so accommodating of our arrival times and check in needs. We will be back!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Holly’s beautiful home is so much more than anyone traveling with a pet could hope for. She has thought of every detail to make her two and four-legged guests feel welcome and comfortable. I couldn’t have dreamed of a comfier place to land with my senior pup during our move to Forest City. Many thanks for making a difficult transition for my fur baby so much easier! ❤️
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was as pictured! We enjoyed a quiet stay.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a good place and both people and dog felt comfortable and relaxed!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"By far my favorite home to stay in. Very clean, spacious for my partner and I with our fur babies. Holly created a home that makes you feel at home. Fenced in yard for dogs to tuna and play. Completely stocked kitchen including seasonings. Comfortable bed. Toys for the dogs to play with and beds for them to sleep on although we brought own dogs their beds and kennel we only had to bring one kennel because they had one. It was so peaceful and the neighbors were nice as well. It’s also right by a park so we were able to take our dogs for walks in the morning. Overall great trip and we will return. Thank you"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the place as it was truly pet friendly. The decor and all the amenities of the home gave it a home away from home feel. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"All interior furnishings and appliances were brand new in this rental - Layout was perfect for travelers with dogs - loved the bright interior lighting - Crown jewel was the spacious, peaceful fenced -in backyard for the dogs - A definite must"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super clean & pet friendly Airbnb! Really enjoyed our stay in this quiet neighborhood! The dog toys and fenced in back yard really stood out when looking for an Airbnb! If you’re bringing your furry friend, RUN to book Holly’s place!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay here, everything was super clean and really peaceful. It is curated and decorated beautifully and provided a home-like feel. Holly was an excellent, responsive host. Instructions on check in and care of the property were very clear and easy to follow. Our elderly dog loved the toys and beds provided for her and the fenced in yard was a huge plus. It’s hard to find a truly pet-friendly spot but this 100% fits the bill. We are hoping to come back to stay here in the future as it’s close to relatives and also close to town, which is sort of rare in this area. Loved being here to relax during the holiday!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So thankful this Airbnb exists in this location. We come in town several times a year and this is the best option in the area that I have seen yet, and we have stayed in every local hotel. Thank you, see you again asap!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Holly's place was the perfect place for my wife and I and our dog. Many AirBnBs claim to be pet-friendly, but are not really (for example, no pets on furniture, no fenced in yard, etc.); however, Holly's place was perfect for our dog. It even had a crate if we wanted to run out for a bit. It was also nice letting our dog out into a fenced-in yard in the morning.
Holly's place was clean, tidy, and very comfortable for my pregnant wife. We will definitely pay another visit to her place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Holly was an AMAZING host! She was very nice and had a great response time. We brought our 2 fur babies and they loved it here.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a great find, being from Forest city originally and seeing how they transformed the property was refreshing. The house was a nice get away from the city, will definitely be returning."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My sister-in-law and I had a mutually terrible family loss last December. In April, after much grieving, we decided we needed to find a peaceful location for a getaway and found Holly's place. It fit our needs to a tee as we had decided to bring my beagle, Topper to enjoy the surrounding area as well as the fenced in yard. We were able to share stories of our loved one and managed to spend quality time together in this picturesque location. The accommodations far exceeded our expectations. This was my first AirBnB experience and I'm sure it won't be my last. I can only hope that future accommodations will mirror what Holly provided to make her house our temporary home for a week. We will recommend to others in the event they are travelling to this wonderful location in North Carolina. Thanks again! Barbara Wines, Pola Galie and Topper"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Holly's place was immaculate and beautiful. The furniture was comfortable and plenty of room for the 4 of us and our big boy Oakie. He loved sniffing all the dog toys that were there and plopping down on the dog bed. The fenced-in yard was a big bonus for us. It was really a beautiful area. We hope to go back again.

Annette's camper is a must stay!"

We will definitely be back when we need to visit this area of NC again 😀"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Annette is the perfect host. She has provided all the amenities and a lot of special touches.

A great value for a very comfortable space.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the best value on airbnb. the second time we've stayed and despite late booking they responded quickly and gave us everything we needed to have a wonderful stay. very sweet people who are very personable and easy to talk to, we can't wait to go back to this little corner of paradise."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is a perfect little corner of NC if your looking for something more relaxed and off the beaten path this is the best you'll get, hands down. very attentive and thoughtful, the hosts made sure everything was absolutely perfect without being helicopter hosts. We had an amazing time relaxing in probably the coolest and absolute nicest camper/RV I have ever seen, let alone been inside of. Much much better than a hotel room and probably bigger for a fraction of the price. If your in the area don't hesitate to book, an all around great experience and were already planning our trip back. Thanks again to the lovely hosts and hope to be back to the area soon!
*I only did 5 stars because 6 wasn't an option"

Great launching point to visit nearby attractions and Asheville with the added benefit of a hometown main street area of Forest City. 5 stars across the board."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place! Everything was as expected with a few yummy treats thrown in!
If you are in the Forest City area for a few days I would recommend staying here instead of some of the hotels in the area. (area hotels are not that good)
The only advice I will give is that it is a camper. A very nice, modern, clean, and comfortable camper, but If you have not or are not at least familiar with how to stay/live in a camper you may not enjoy it as much as I did! If you are looking to mix it up and try something new for a few days, totally go for it! Great camper and awesome hosts!"

The greeting was so nice friendly and very welcoming..Everything was set up so nice and clean all the special little touches everywhere down to having goodies for the kiddos..Any parent knows sometimes it’s hard to find great places that your kids enjoy with yourself included..When I say my babies enjoyed theirselves to the fullest they didn’t even want to leave..As a parent that speaks volumes..I can’t thank Mrs Annette and Mr Al enough for being so sweet to our kids they truly loved meeting you both and all your babies..I am so very glad we chose this place and would highly recommend any type of visit..There is so much to do so much to see for both adults and children you most definitely can’t fit it all in a week..We can’t wait to plan our next visit..

We would definitely consider staying here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a beautiful, peaceful and relaxing time in Forest City. Don’s home was just as described. We were so comfortable that at the end of a day, we said let’s go home. It truly felt like coming home. I spent many hours rocking on the beautiful front porch and was able to see the most incredible sunrise over the mountains. We would not have changed a thing and because the house was so full of amenities, we wanted for nothing. Would definitely stay there again."

We had to extend our stay, and Donald was very accommodating."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, just as pictured right next to darling downtown Forest City but feels a million miles away! Gorgeous view. Don is very engaged and quick to respond, though we didn’t need anything during our visit- he thought of everything. Great experience! Would stay again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful amenities, all the amenities from home, definitely didn’t skip a beat. For checkout we needed a little more time and very accommodating and we truly appreciated especially that we were traveling with a toddler. We were pleasantly surprised they even provide a crib.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive when I sent messages. House was very clean. FYI, if you use a GPS, it won’t take you to the driveway, rather it will take you to the back side of the property that doesn’t have a driveway to the home. Ask owner for directions ahead of your arrival."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald’s home was beautifully decorated and a great space to get away for some relaxation. Very clean, modern, and plenty of space to spread out.
We ate many meals on the covered front deck in the gliding chairs watching wildlife with the mountains in the distance.
There are many little extras that make it feel like home: cozy seating areas, gardening books, board games, rainfall shower and a fire pit.
The kitchen was well stocked and coffee was provided.
If you're looking for a place to escape but still be close to civilization, this would be a great choice. Deer were spotted nightly out back, yet the quaint downtown was only a mile away.
We’ve already shared our experience with friends and family who enjoy travel and I’m sure we’ll be back."

Don personally built this house and stated he built it to mirror what he would want in a vacation home. My favorite place was the front porch rocking while looking at the mountains while sipping local wine.
Don was a wonderful host and interesting person, we truly enjoyed visiting with him and his advice on things to do and see in the area were spot on. I plan to book this house for next year and cannot thank Don enough for making my first airbnb so special."

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything would have been 5 stars across the board because it’s a great location, value is awesome, and everything was well kept—I was overall impressed & it had tons of space! but there’s a couple things I would like to have known and considered before booking.
First, just an fyi but not a huge deal, the place was clean but had a unique smell inside the house. We didn’t know if it was the mushrooms growing on the farm or animals from someone from a previous stay. Regardless, pretty minor considering the huge upside the place has to offer. Lastly, the biggest thing, the description of the home is misleading. There’s no way to sugarcoat it. Unless you thoroughly comb through the listing & read everything (lesson learned), there is only one spot that mentions someone else lives below. It’s not “the whole house to yourself” etc. This may not be a big deal to some, but I really think it should be more explicitly stated. Again, it turned out to be fine in this instance, but I just didn’t like the deceptive marketing."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place. Not only was it clean and well equipped. It was decorated very nicely and was the perfect distance from the quaint little town, but far enough away from other neighbors and the road, so it's very peaceful. The hammock on the porch was a nice touch and my husband enjoyed an afternoon nap in it one day. The house sits on top of a pretty steep hill (great views) with a rocky drive, so be prepared for that, but our little hatchback had no problems. Donald was very accomodating and explained the house and the land to us. The beds were comfortable and the showers had good water pressure. Plenty of towels for the 3 of us. The washer and dryer worked great. The kitchen was very well equipped with everything we needed to make dinner. We'll definitely be back if we're ever in the area again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Donald’s home and hospitality was more than we could have asked for. Beautiful house, perfect location for visiting Forest City and surrounding areas, and awesome views! Felt like home away from home. Thank you Donald for letting us create such beautiful memories here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donald will meet you for check in. I did not realize this and was late and kept him waiting. He will show you where everything is and once you have had the tour you won’t see him again unless you call him. Great host.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Don’s place. His friendliness was much appreciated, as was his taking the time to show us the place and where things are located. The house itself was great and we enjoyed everything about it. There was a thunderstorm the night we were there and we sat on the balcony and just enjoyed the moment. I’m surprised the driveway wasn’t mentioned more in the reviews; it’s steep and rocky, which was fine for my 4x4 truck, but if I had a really low vehicle, I’d appreciate a heads up. We would stay here again because Don has clearly thought out everything guests could want or need and it’s so close to town."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Donald’s farm. The house was so well appointed that we didn’t want to leave!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a clean, spacious and beautiful home to stay in, I’d recommend this location. Beautiful area as well."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don't do this place justice. If you get the chance to stay here you will not regret it. We didn't want to go back home! Host was amazing and space we can't say enough about. Impeccably clean, spacious, great location, and quiet. Short driving distance to the main strip which is pretty at night. We will definitely be rebooking. The only slight drawback is the limited internet speed. But to be honest it was a good disconnect from all the craziness going on right now."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I felt really good about the cleanliness of this house during the pandemic. It’s a peaceful, quiet spot. Comfortable accommodations and the host was kind and accommodating."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great getaway to clear the mind. Beautiful home, great privacy and nice sunrises and sets."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place for some peace, quiet, and much needed RnR. Stay home and enjoy the views, take a nice walk around the property, enjoy the beautiful little town of Forest City, or take in some of the sightseeing opportunities.
Don is a wonderful host and very attentive to any needs you may have."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space and loved the hospitality
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful view, & wonderful space to stay! Forest City is charming and Donald’s home is close enough to everything, while feeling like a ‘secluded’ getaway. Host was accommodating & accessible for anything we may have needed. The home is on a large land so lots of room to roam, close to downtown, & a fireplace to enjoy at night. Highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is a really beautiful house, it has a lot of interior space decorated with great taste, it is modern and comfortable. Kitchen utensils, hygiene products, all very clean. Campfire area, barbecue with a nice view, surrounded by trees, is the environment we were looking for for our vacations outside of Florida. Mr. Donald was very helpful, we hope to return another time. From Forest City you have to make small trips to see other places, but it was worth it. Thank you!."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home, kept immaculately clean. Beautiful peaceful views. Owner was incredibly nice, provided helpful suggestions for the area, and made us feel very welcome."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s place is awesome! It is one of the best places I’ve stayed. Everything is immaculate, the house has everything you need, Extremely clean and well stocked. You are a short drive to different little towns. Don is very responsive and detailed."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time using Air BnB and the property and Don exceeded our expectations. The house is lovely, modern and comfortable and the views are breathtaking. My husband and I stayed with our two set of twins ( 12 and 3) and there were ample rooms and space for us to all use. The kitchen is a wonderful place to cook, with all the kitchenware you’d need, the living room had a fireplace place that was nice and the backyard had a fire pit we loved to sit around. The location was a mile from the Main Street and two miles away from the local grocery store. It was an excellent stay!
Don checked in on us to make sure we were good and he was super responsive and attentive when we reached out with any questions.
Thanks Don!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald was the best host, everything was super clean and organized. We really enjoyed the fire pit and chimney, Donald had wood for us to use which was very thoughtful. The house is beautiful and had an amazing view. We will definitely be staying here again and recommend this place very highly!"
2020-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and modern looking. I didn't have a good experience with Donald, the host. Although he tried to be accommodating at the end (thank you), he was unprofessional at the beginning."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying at Don’s was exactly what we needed for a week getaway. His place was cozy, comfortable, and convenient. If you are looking for somewhere with privacy, while also being accessible to other areas (Asheville, Charlotte, etc.) this is the place for you (right off Route 74). Don’s place has all the accommodations you would need and, outside of his personal orientation which was much appreciated, we were greeted by deer a few times in the early morning mountain mist. This place is a true gem and we would surely return again when the time calls. Don was very responsible and made sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible. Thanks for the great week in Western NC and we look forward to returning to sample the great beer, wine, and BBQ that the area has to offer."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This B and B is located in a quaint little town, which has a chiming clock (only heard downtown) and Smiths Drug (with an old fashion soda fountain counter and breakfast and lunch booth seating). Donald’s place is spacious in the main living areas and cozy at the same time. The beds are comfortable and there is every type of pillow available. The showers are clean as new and there is great water pressure. The kitchen is well stocked with flatware and utensils. It is convenient to have a washer and dryer in the house to use as needed.
We enjoyed the fire pit outback by roasting s’mores and staying warm while viewing the stars. There are many recreational activities within a two hour drive of Donald’s house, our favorite was DuPont State Park."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is immaculate!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don's place was new and spotless. The property was beautiful and was a perfect place to rest a few days. He was very informative and personable.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! The house is very clean and comfortable. It’s only 15 minutes to TIEC. Beautiful property!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald is a great host. The house is beautiful and clean. We enjoyed the view and saw lots of wildlife. This place gives the feeling of seclusion but is close to everything we needed. If our travels bring us to this area in the future, we will definitely seek lodging with Donald."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Don's place really is a beautiful place to unwind and get in touch with nature. The house itself is wonderful, with high ceilings and lots of light. The decor is top-notch, the kitchen and appliances are all excellent. So much thought has been put into all of the little details within the house. It was larger and more spacious than we expected and watching the deer feeding right outside the window really is an added bonus !
Don is very responsive, immediately providing anything we asked for. Although the house itself feels isolated on top of the hill, it's really only a few minutes to the main street and less than 10 minutes from major shopping areas. The local area of Forest City is very quaint, certainly worth a stroll down the main street and the weekly farmer's market was fun to stroll through and chat with the very friendly folks. In addition, it's only a short drive up to Lake Lure and a little over an hour to Asheville.
Highly recommend to anyone that wants a great tranquil location, relax and enjoy the nature or go around and explore a beautiful part of N. Carolina."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Donald’s house was perfect for us. Very comfortable, great view. Forest City is a lovely town. Be sure to visit the Pie Safe. Great hiking in South Mountain state park, 45 mins away. Donald was very welcoming and responsive. Highly recommend 😊"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,5 star! Donald was a great host and the Airbnb was such a beautiful place to stay.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place by far is one of the nicest we have stayed in for our trips to TIEC. The updated kitchen was amazing as we like to bring our own food. Would definitely come back!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed at this location just to get out of town for a little while. It was absolutely perfect. Minutes from downtown where there is great food and it was in the center of various fun outdoor activities. Donald was an amazing host and quick with responding. We will be back!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, clean, and well-kept home. We enjoyed getting away and relaxing with our family. Our stay was very comfortable and enjoyable."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is super stylish and has a lot of cool upgrades. It’s super comfortable and our favorite parts were the huge kitchen island and front porch. We wanted to use the fire pit but it rained on us. We grilled and cooked and the kitchen pretty much had all of the utensils we needed. Don was super helpful and quick to answer any questions we had. We will be back next time we visit Lake Lure.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and spacious! Great kitchen space!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy, elegant place to stay in Forest City. The best part is the view: You can see the mountains in the background and wild deer walking near the house. You can even watch the sunset on the porch! The house is spacious and kept very clean. Also, the downtown area is only minutes away with restaurants and shopping. Donald is an excellent host and worked tirelessly to help us when any issues arose. Other than the internet being too slow for us to work on some online projects, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With Donald, it was really nice, there is everything you need for a longer stay. We will be happy to come back next time."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald was a perfect host. His home is beautiful, comfortable, stylish, and clean. The view is gorgeous. Me and my family thoroughly enjoyed our peaceful weekend. Close to town but it didn't feel like it. Will definitely stay here again."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent value for the money. Extremely clean and gorgeous home. Very updated and modern. Easy check in and check out. Had everything we needed and more. Won’t stay anywhere else when visiting Forest City.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, host, and town. We have nothing but good memories from our stay. There was an issue with the faucet, but Don was there in 5 minutes or less. The home is impeccably decorated and clean. Small touches of thoughtful conveniences are all over. Mr. Don was great to speak with and get to know just a little bit. The town center is right out of a Hallmark movie (I’m guessing) 😉"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Would recommend! Great views, great value! Forest city is such a neat little community nestled between Asheville and Charlotte! Donald’s place was very accommodating to my family, and our 9 month old little girl. Very clean with all needed amenities. We will be back!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s house is Forest City was absolutely perfect for our needs. It had everything, and more, that we needed for a long weekend. It is was the most charming and beautiful AirBnB we have ever stayed in (and there have been many). Don was onsite to greet us and show us around, and was available if/when we ever needed him. I would rate his home as Excellent and would highly recommend to anyone."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice great secluded place to stay. Lots of open fields around so me & my son brought little rc airplanes & had a blast also.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This property was exactly as described or even better. It has 3 bedrooms on the first floor (nice for those with limited mobility) and 3 on the second floor. There are 3 baths, one in the separate primary suite, another on the first floor, and one upstairs. There is a large kitchen and living room. Everything was clean and neat. The bathrooms had an ample supply of linens and travel-size toiletries. The property is in an area that is convenient, yet peaceful, with other houses nearby but not too close. It was perfect for our group of equestrians showing at nearby Windridge Farm. Our host Bryant gave clear instructions and responded within minutes to my questions. The house rules were not onerous. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It’s a very good house!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our weekend at Bryant’s Forest City Retreat. Great and welcoming home where we were comfortable. The host was great and very responsive. We look forward to booking again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you Bryant for a wonderful stay! The house was as described and just what we needed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This Forest City home was in a perfect location for the local wineries and Tryon Equestrian Center! Most of the top wineries in the area were less than 30 minutes drive and one special place, My Sweet Love winery just 10 minutes away. I felt right at home with all the accommodations and thoroughly enjoyed sitting out by the fire pit sipping a glass of wine! Grab your friends and come stay together in this home while enjoying all the local attractions and dining within a short drive! I will return again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori’s place is always a treat to stay at. We will continue to stay with her. The location is exactly as described and pictured.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was one of the nicest places we have stayed at while competing at Tryon. My daughter and employees stayed here. House was great, location was great for being close to stores and restaurants. It was 20 minutes from the show, but that was manageable. We will definitely consider Lori's place in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was a fantastic host! I messaged her to see if she had an iron/board and told her it wasn’t a problem for me to go buy if she didn’t. She apologized and told me to buy and leave in the unit and promptly refunded what I had spent plus a little extra.
The place was exactly as described and very neat and comfortable. Highly recommend for a place to stay if visiting Forest City NC!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed with my husband and our two young boys. We were in the unfortunate circumstance of needing to find a place immediately to be with family when my father in law lost his life to cancer. Lori was super responsive and answered my messages within and hour and helped us get booked. Her cottage was beautiful, so clean, and immediately felt like home away from home. We were so grateful to have found it and will gladly book it again sometime. The hard wood floors are refinished and so charming. The kitchen is super updated with newer appliances. Very comfortable bedrooms and beds and the walk in shower is SO nice. It was the perfect space for the 4 of us."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,👍
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a unique space in a unique location, this wonderful place is it. It’s spacious and laid out in a linear pattern — you enter through the front and walk through the sitting area into the living area (watch your step), through the kitchen to the huge (to us anyway) bathroom and the bedrooms. The unit was neat and decorated in a style that I will call “contemporary quaint.” One feels right at home immediately. I would have stayed in the living room area if I could have. The kitchen is also nice, and while we didn’t have to use anything but the refrigerator (and the microwave for the popcorn that was so generously supplied), it was nice to be in a place where everything looked so new. The island in the kitchen was a great place to sit and use a laptop to catch up on some work. The main bedroom was spacious, with a king-size bed that was comfortable. (If you are light-sensitive, be mindful of the security lights for the parking area; they are a little bright.)
The unit sits right at an intersection on what is the the main thoroughfares in town. But people hardly notice you. It was great for a particular kind of people watching. We didn’t need to contact our host, but we felt that if we needed anything, she would be available at a moment’s notice. The parking area large and secure. We really enjoyed being here and found ourselves wishing we had one an extra day to spend there. Nice place, great host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying here! The place was clean, recently renovated, comfortable beds and the host was both accommodating and responsive."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful home in a great location. You can walk through town. Close local restaurants (within walking distance). Thermal Belt Rails to Trails is easy to access. Beautiful decor. Lori responded quickly to any questions.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely, clean, and inviting space! Check in was so easy, it was nice to cook and clean up there. Plenty of parking. And it is walking distance from pelican snowballs!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Book it! Just Book this place if it fits your needs. Great location. Updated. Feels like home. This is the place your looking for.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, spacious, nicely designed space."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was so relaxing and comfortable. A beautiful space. (I am sorry I was not able to listen to the music lessons being given there. )
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Olivewood Inn is a beautiful historic home and the whole property is immaculately kept. We rented both rooms for two couples while in town to attend a local wedding and cannot say enough about our experience! Eben was a fantastic host and his passion for the curatorship of this property shows everywhere you look.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my favorite stay of my week long trip. Gorgeous room in an impressive house with beautiful grounds. Everything was top notch, including Eben."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an absolutely lovely, well maintained, historical home and Eben is a wonderful host. This was more than just an overnight stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eben is very nice and so is his place. One can see all the work and money and love he’s put into it. The bed was extremely comfortable and so was the comforter. Eben didn’t mind taking the time to tell us about the place, which is beautifully done. The location is perfect if you want to take in an Owl’s game.
He put out some muffins and fruit for breakfast and the muffins were the best I’ve ever had. He also very generously puts water and a few other beverages in the fridge.
We had our bedroom and bathroom and could use the shared sitting room that has plenty of books and Netflix on TV.
The only inconveniences were that the bathroom door opens in the opposite way that would easy and the only outlet is on the floor by the door, so if you want to do your hair in the bathroom, bring an extension cord.
We had a great sleep and a lovely morning."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Eben was a very welcoming host. We felt right at home in his clean inn. The bathroom was beautiful and the room was spotless. Definitely will book here again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay at Eben's place. We came for the Cherry Bounce festival and discovered so much more! The house is in a great location that allowed us to walk everywhere we wanted to be - the Pavilion, downtown restaurants, the beautiful trail and the ballpark. It was nice to have a separate area for coffee and muffins in the morning. We even took advantage of the gazebo and had a picnic lunch. All in all, a very relaxing weekend with lovely accommodations."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Even was welcoming and his mansion was gorgeous. Clean and safe and just wonderful. I will stay there again and again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Olivewood Inn met every expectation. It was true to its advertised description, from the charming elegance and style of the Inn, to the comfort of the Oak Room with its wonderful bed. The Olivewood Inn met every expectation. Of utmost importance to me was the cleanliness of the Inn, the linens, etc. The lovely outdoor area contributed to the calm, peaceful and serene vibe. Eben, the host was very gracious and accommodating. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting the area and know I will return next time I’m here to see family."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eben is a fantastic host! I felt welcomed and safe. This was my first stay using Airbnb and he has set the bar high for any future experiences. Olivewood Inn is a charming historic home located roughly between Charlotte and Asheville. It was the perfect place to stop and rest after a long day of travel. I highly recommend it.

It is a place you will want to visit again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great find! If your trip takes you to the Forest City area, I highly recommend staying here if you can. The pictures do not do it justice. You will not be disappointed. I have stayed at many Airbnb for business and this lovely house is at the top of my list. I stayed here while on a business trip and Eben has everything a business traveler needs: quiet floor where my room was located, privacy, fast and reliable wifi, PLENTY of power outlets in the room (this was so appreciated), and a desk in my room with great light. Eben was a great host who was genuinely concerned with making sure I had a good stay. The bed was very comfortable. I definitely plan on staying here the next time I have business in the area. It's located about halfway between Charlotte and Asheville, so is a convenient drive to both areas. You won't be disappointed if you choose Eben's beautiful and luxurious villa to stay in!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible find! I have stayed at dozens of AirBnb's and Eben's home is a jewel. The house is just amazing.

I will definitely plan to stay here again!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you enjoy beautiful homes and gardens and wonderful antiques, this is the place of your dreams. Even better, this is not a museum and you may use the furniture. The fridge in the room was a necessity for me. The shower was the coolest thing ever. Also the refrigerator in the sitting room was well stocked as was the coffee maker. The place was immaculately clean and Eben was the perfect host asking regularly how he could fulfill my every need, which he managed to do very well. Even more the place was much closer to my destination than the big city."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eben was an incredible host and my husband and I had the best time staying in the oak room! I cannot wait to return to the Olivewood Inn anytime I am in or around Forest City and I cannot recommend it enough!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an outstanding value in a quaint little place very much decorated in an early 1900’s period style. It is elegant and truly charming. We were in Forest City for a bicycle on the Thermal Belt Rail Trail and one of the best parts of our stay was the fact that this little place is only a block off the trail so we have easy access without traveling by car. All of the little extras that the host provided demonstrated an extraordinary attention to detail. This was truly a wonderful stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eben was a great host and so accommodating! Absolutely “Super”.
The house is wonderful. Built in 1924, the home has a lot of character. (Bed was great which is always important to me.)
If I come back for the Cycle NC ride again in Forest City, I will definitely stay at Eben’s house.

My wife and I were stunned at how unique and beautiful the building is, and the amenities set out were excellent. Eben was very quick with communication, and the Hallmark Christmas Movie-esque downtown Forest City is just a short walk away. You will truly remember your stay at this hidden gem!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for our Wedding Anniversary weekend. We really enjoyed our stay. Mr. Eben was a great host. He personally greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed . He provided all the amenities he promised, in addition to recommendations for places we could go and visit near by.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one the most incredible places I have ever stayed. The attention to detail amazing and everything in this home is one of a kind. Each room had a story and the decor is so unique. The accommodations were endless and the way Eben made us feel at home was just another perk! From the beautiful courtyard to the cozy reading nook, this place took our breath away.
Cleanliness was definitely not an issue either! My only complaint was that we couldn't stay longer. Thank you so much for such an unforgettable stay!"

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had very high expectations for this place and not only did the Olivewood Inn meet those expectations, it surely exceeded them! We felt like we stepped back in time - from the Italian Marble, to the iron gates in the foyer, to the beautiful and intriguing paintings throughout the whole Inn. Eben is a great host and gave us a full tour, complete with a little run down of the place itself. We haven’t been able to stop talking about it since we left - we will certainly be back as well as directing our friends there."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely quiet and private room in quite a fascinating old house. Microwave and mini-fridge. An attentive host who checks in with guests but also leaves them privacy. Neighborhood is quiet.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A great place to stay! Eben has an incredibly grand house that is like nothing else in the area. Room is comfortable and well furnished. 15min drive to Tryon International Equestrian Center. Would highly recommend this place to stay!

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eben is a kind and generous host with an eye for detail that makes his place is a shiny jewel in Forest City. I didn’t have a reason to go to Forest City other than wanting to stay in his gorgeous home that caught my eye while looking for places to stay in Asheville. I was happy to find out about the equestrian center nearby that hosts free sporting events occasionally, and enjoyed window shopping in downtown FC. It’s a little off the beaten path to Asheville (about an hour away), but totally worth it!"

I typically choose to rent entire homes, but only needed a place to spend the night on this occasion. I was a little apprehensive to share a space, but found the experience at Olivewood Inn to be exceptional. The room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. I wish I had more time to enjoy the space. I would definitely return in the future and recommend to my friends and family."

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Olivewood Inn is a lovely 1920's mansion that Eben is restoring to it's original beauty and grandeur. We stayed in the Oak room which was nicely furnished and very comfortable. The shower was awesome, it was state of the art in the 20's and one of the most unique showers we've ever seen!
Restaurants and shopping are very close by which made it very convenient.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting again."

2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience in this unique place that offers seclusion, comfort, very fascinating interior architecture and above all a very hospitable person in Eben that runs the place. Eben went out of his way to ensure we were very comfortable and we had some great conversations with him. The small sitting room was a cozy place to hang out, have a drink/snack and catch up with reading. WiFi service was strong and consistent. About 15 minutes walk to downtown gets you to restaurants, bars and shops. Definitely worth the experience and we hope to be back soon."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A luxurious night's sleep in a quaint North Carolina town. This historic house provided all our needs from Basic Earth toiletries to coffee and muffins every morning. A unique and special experience in an historic district of Forest City.

2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eben was a great host, attentive but unobtrusive. My travel companion and I rented both rooms, and had the entire second floor to ourselves. The house is an interesting old building, which Eben is refurbishing, and has a lot of potential. The Master Suite, in particular, with its Restoration Hardware furnishings, is very attractive. The bathrooms appear to be original to the house, and could use some updating."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very charming home, convenient to a very quaint and historic downtown. Eben was an excellent host and was very receptive.

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you enjoy interesting architecture, beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds, a welcoming host, and exploring a small town ~ stay here.

He wasn't around much but checked in with us several times during our stay to see if we needed anything. The house is very interesting and unique. We were within a couple blocks of the downtown area which is a great place for a casual meal. We loved the proximity to the Forest City Owl's baseball stadium. If you are traveling to the Forest City area, I highly recommend staying here!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were looking for a relaxing place to stay and we definitely got it! Eben was very welcoming and helpful. He made sure we felt at home. The room was absolutely gorgeous! We would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to a typical hotel.

The bed was so comfortable and we got a great night's sleep. Nice quiet area, and we woke up to birdsong outside. There was coffee, tea, muffins, yogurt, juice, and fruit in the sitting room in the morning, and though we didn't take advantage, there was wine and beer the night before if we'd wanted it. The sitting room in and of itself was neat - TV, games, books, anything you could want to relax and amuse yourself. Eben made checking in and checking out easy, and we so appreciate his hospitality and kindness."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great tour of historical home. Nice Cafe in in the quaint town of Forest City.

2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Historic Olivewood Inn was the perfect stay. This beautiful old home is a unique option to stay in Forest City. My room had everything I needed and Eben was super accommodating. He made sure there was fresh fruit, coffee and refreshments every day.

Would definitely like to come back and stay again."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in many properties but none as unique as this historic home. Eben was a wonderful host and he's done a terrific job furnishing the space. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens and towels. The accommodations include a sitting room with continental breakfast, local TV channels and a period bathroom with a strong hot shower. Everything was impeccably clean. The home is close to downtown Forest City and not far from Spindale and the new Tryon equestrian center."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house was gorgeous and the ammenties are top notch. The room had everything we needed.
Forest City was charming, especially at Christmas. Eben owns an organic coffee shop thats a short walk you should stop by for breakfast. The coffee was wonderful and the service even better. It was the perfect Christmas gift for a friend and I could not ask for a better stay. I hope to return."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eben was incredibly accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. His home was unique and beautiful, with an ancient charm that was incredibly inviting. It was the perfect New Years get away for us!"
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved every minute of our stay. The house is exquisite. It is a historic southern mansion and has all of the beauty and charm of one. Eben was a great host. We felt at home immediately. We enjoyed the great location, right next to Forest City. An A+++++ on all accounts."
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The inn is a fantastic space and Eben was a great host. You can walk to downtown and a cafe in Forest City. I recommend this place if you are in town.
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time staying here and Eben was a wonderful host. The house is absolutely gorgeous! The room we stayed in was just as beautiful! We had the entire second floor to ourselves which consisted of our room/bathroom and a library room. The library room was great and the fridge was nicely stocked. In the morning he had fruit and muffins for us which was wonderful! I highly recommend staying here and it will be my first choice next time I am in town!
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great Place! Super clean, super cozy. Eben was fantastic and met us even though we showed up a little late. He also invited us to his organic cafe, Wild Roots, located in Forest City. The cafe is also a must visit."
2016-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Eben was very accommodating and helpful. The inn is within walking distance to downtown. The history and architectural beauty of the inn had us asking questions as soon as we walked through the door. Eben is committed to bringing a new culture to downtown Forest City through the fine arts and loves sharing his passion of music and organic cooking with locals and tourists alike.
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am usually pretty reluctant to put straight 5 stars on all fronts, but my wife and I really enjoyed staying at Eben's place.
It is a beautiful home that is being somewhat renovated. Right now, he has one room/bathroom (with soap/shampoo) he is renting out so it is you and Eben. The room is spacious and you have access to a sitting room with coffee/tea/popcorn/drinks if you like. (He left out some muffins and fruit for us in the morning which was great!) The entire space makes you feel like you just stepped into the 1920's, it is very unique!
Eben is an incredibly gracious host and was very respectful of our space. If anything, we held him up by talking to him for too long! He was very good at communicating and met us at the door and helped with our bags when we arrived late after dark. We couldn't have asked for more.
The location of Forrest City is perfectly situated close to Chimney Rock/Lure Lake, Mt. Mitchel, and other local landmarks. The city itself is also a bit of a gem. It has a nice downtown. They have a lot of Christmas lights starting after Thanksgiving, but unfortunately we were a little early for that."
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot fully express how thoroughly I enjoyed my stay at Olivewood! This was the nicest, most relaxing place I have ever stayed in! Eben is so kind and personable, he went out of his way to make me feel welcomed, catering to all my needs, and it felt like I was staying with a friend, not at a place of business. The property is truly gorgeous, I was completely overwhelmed by its beauty and with the authentic period decor, it felt like taking a trip back in time. This was more like an experience than merely a stay at a bed & breakfast. I was blissfully comfortable while relaxing around the house, and slept like a rock on my soft & cozy bed in my beautiful room. Eben himself is a total gem, the ultimate host (and extremely fascinating to talk to) but combine him with this amazing grandiose historic mansion and it is a dream come true. I kept thinking ""where's the catch to this unbelievable situation?"" but there really isn't one, it is sincerely awesome and just completely amazing! Eben is all about historical enrichment, healthy therapeutic living and making your stay something memorable. I got an unexpected pleasurable vacation when I only expected to get a place to stay! Eben also owns a wonderful cafe down the street, so he brought over some fabulous taste treats for me to try, which was the icing on the trip cake! I look forward to coming back for another visit to Olivewood again! I cannot recommend it highly enough. This is without a doubt the best place you could ever possibly stay, and it was a total bargain for such a place, especially for the experience! So very thankful I was able to stay here and be treated so wonderfully! This visit has completely spoiled me, and I know nowhere else will come close by comparison! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Eben! You are the BEST of the BEST!!!! :-)"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eben was delightful...very friendly...gracious and informative. The house is gorgeous and Eben's vision is excellent!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We went to NC on very short notice for a funeral. Eben was great, very accommodating and made us feel right at home. His home and grounds as well as neighborhood was exactly as described. The home is beautiful and quaint. If we go back, this home will be at the top of the list of places to stay"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house and rooms were better than advertised. The bedroom, bath and sitting area were spacious and comfortable. The house is on a main street in this small town but the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Eblen made arrangements for a friend to be at the house when we arrived and she did a terrific job showing us around and providing a key. Later in the evening, we met Eblen and he is a gracious host. We would definitely stay here again when we're in the area."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eben's place was great! I loved the restored historic elegance of it. The house was super easy to find, had an incredibly comfortable bed, and a super awesome shower from the 1920's. I've been a host on Airbnb for 6 months but this was my first time staying as a guest and I absolutely loved it. Highly recommend!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! The building is an old-style mansion, but has been well-maintained and upgraded. I was thoroughly impressed. It makes you feel like you're living in a castle. My girlfriend and I brought along some wine and cheese, completing the bourgeoisie experience. Speaking of which, we forgot to bring a cork-puller. Eben graciously lent us his and had some wine glasses for us to use as well. We enjoyed every bit of the place.

The location is a nice location, depending upon what you're looking for. If you like a small-town feel, then this is the right place for you. It's between Asheville, Charlottle, and Spartanburg, so it is pretty close to a lot of places.

Seriously, if you want a value experience, this is it."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eben was a wonderful host! The room was clean and quiet and he offered us muffins and refreshments. Would stay with him again and recommend to friends.

2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! This place is so classy. We would definitely recommend that people check this place out. Eben was super helpful and flexible. We stayed here on our way to visit the Biltmore Estates and it was the perfect introduction to historic and grand. We have never stayed at a place quite like this one... Eben has done a wonderful job with decor and maintenance. Please take the time to check this place out - you won't regret it.
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our visit to the Historic Olivewood Inn. It was like having a private room in an old castle. The place is being restored, So there are some quirks, but nothing that affected our comfort."

We had a great time at Chimney Rock and Lake Lure and also visited the Apple Festival. Marios in town had some great Italian! We would definitely recommend visiting this BNB and enjoying the surrounding areas.

It is exceptionally clean and supplied with all the creature comforts. Alex & Kimberly were attentive hosts & were quick to respond to any questions we had. We perused local shops such as Pie Safe Bakery & America's Fudge Shop (wow 😋), and ate a yummy old fashioned diner lunch at Smith's Drug Store. Watching the squirrels outside the kitchen window as they chowed down on a corn cob was a fun treat. We needed some down time and found the perfect solitude in the Cozy Italian Cabin. We love Forest City and will now have a favorite place to lay our heads. Thank you to Alex & Kimberly for a lovely stay.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, amazing hosts. Definitely recommended!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had an excellent five week stay. I can't tolerate a complete Chicago winter anymore, so I holed up here and set up my workstation in the office (comfortable and strong enough wi-fi for what I do), hiked on weekends and enjoyed the quiet. I've gotten into a bit of birding and loved the feeder outside the kitchen window - dark-eyed juncos, tufted titmouses, chickadees and even a red-breasted nuthatch all dropped by, and one morning I caught a glimpse of a turkey vulture strutting through the trees behind the house. There are several houses on the property but everything has been sited and built so it's very private and quiet. The house has been thoughtfully laid out and is well-equipped with everything I needed to be very comfortable for a long stay. I had access to groceries and other necessities in town, just a few minutes away (COVID note: if you are used to living somewhere where everyone is good with masks, that's not something you'll find everyone is on board with when you're in town). Alex and Kimberly were very responsive when I had questions or needed help, left helpful instructions and recommendations at the house, and the house was spotless when I checked in. If you are looking for some peace and quiet and a little bit of bird drama with your morning coffee, highly recommend."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage! I loved that they had items for the pups (in case owners like myself forget things 🤭). Very clean and quite spacious. LOVED the gas stove in the kitchen (the cook in me was super excited to use it). The bed felt like a cloud that I drifted on while I slept! Will definitely plan to come back when the trees in the woods bloom green again. The location was beautiful. Thank you Alex and Kimberly!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was all we needed for a quick getaway. We appreciated the attention to detail, such as the diffuser being on when we arrived and other small surprises. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was quite luxurious, quite the duo after a day of hiking nearby. We fully enjoyed both the indoor and outdoor fireplaces. The only qualm that we had was some of the cookery and utensils had to be cleaned before we used them as they were stored still with food remnants on them. Probably the result of being ran through the dishwasher without pre-rinsing from the previous tenants. Besides this, everything else at this Airbnb was stellar.
More specific to Forest City, there isn’t much to do other than hiking. My partner and I are both POCs and at times felt uncomfortable visiting local shops."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb fulfilled all expectations. Cozy and comfortable accommodations. Location is scenic with lots of wildlife.
A peaceful retreat for anyone that wants to escape the city. The fire pit makes for a relaxing evening under the stars.
I would highly recommend this Airbnb."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed here for a week hiking in the blue ridge mountains. Nice location, 30-40 minutes from lots of great hiking. Quiet area and the cottage itself was very nice. Comfortable bed and nice kitchen if you like to cook."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here for a week-long writer’s retreat, and this space was just perfect for what I needed: a small office where I could spread out my notes, a cozy bedroom for sleeping, a grill for cooking in the evenings, and a fireplace for relaxing with my coffee in the morning and my tea in the evenings. I also enjoyed the wooded area in the back. I highly recommend this spot for anyone wanting to get away for a while."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was ultra-clean. We enjoyed our stay, the comfortable bed and an amazing fire pit. Hosts were wonderful, cottage was stocked with everything you would need, they even left a treat for our pup. Would definitely recommend!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at the cottage! We worked remotely from the cabin for a week and used it to do a bit of sightseeing in the mountains. The place was clean, cozy, and beautifully decorated. It was private, yet our hosts were easily reachable if needed, and it was easy to get to the store and restaurants in the area. It felt like Alex and Kimberly had thought of everything we could need."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures of this cottage really don’t do it justice. It’s super cozy & cute! The accommodations were great! We loved that the place was super clean. Unfortunately when we went it was raining a lot. So, we didn’t get to make use of the fire pit or the trail they have mapped out.
We did go into Hendersonville which is a really cute town about 40 minutes away. We hiked the falls there and It was beautiful. Asheville and Charlotte we’re about an hour away as well and worth making the trip. In town where the cottage is there’s a restaurant The Copper Penny & it’s great for lunch or dinner. We had a nice time and thank you again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking at this place stop looking and book today! We loved everything abt it! All the beautiful wildlife we saw (birds at the bird feeders outside the window, wild turkeys, blue birds, red robins, woodpecker, friendly squirrels) and made great use of the awesome fireplace which had everything you need to have a chillaxing evening! The place is immaculately clean, and beautifully decorated with all the amineties including Netflix, coffee, cozy fireplace, awesome stove and oven and huge fridge. And the shower was to die for (thats important to me). Hot water for days and great pressure, its designed so cool like your showering in a cave! All in all this place was a perfect stay for our family! And did I mention how great the hosts are?!? We hope to DEFINETLY stay again if we can find available dates. Thanks Alex and Kimberly for everything!!!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alex and Kimberly have SUCH an amazing place! I would recommend them a thousand times to anyone visiting the Asheville/Forest City area. My wife and I stayed for the weekend to do some hiking and sight seeing and this was the perfect place to come back to and unwind after a long day out. The place was incredibly clean and fully stocked with everything we needed for the weekend. The amenities were all perfect, down to the soft bed linens and bath towels! Although we didn’t get a chance to use the outside fire pit, it looked absolutely beautiful and peaceful, and we definitely plan to use it next time! They were also so quick to respond to us and even allowed a late check out (3 pm!!). Wish I could rate them 10 stars!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is such a dream! Everything was clean and organized when we arrived! We loved all the sweet surprises like canned cinnamon rolls in the fridge and popsicles in the freezer! My husband and I got to take advantage of the fire pit which was really romantic with the hanging lights. Not only was the cabin absolutely lovely, the hosts were amazing as well! They provided easy instructions on how to get there and how to access the cabin. They were always available and very helpful! Our family didn’t want to leave! I would highly recommend this cabin if you are wanting to stay in Forest City!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here several times!!! The comfort, coziness, and beauty of this cottage is amazing. The hosts are super quick to respond. The area is safe and just an experience if u are in the area to try! The price is super reasonable. I HIGHLY recommend this Italian Cottage!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little gem! Close to TIEC.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great property located in a fantastic quite location yet close enough to downtown Forest City and other venues. Super clean and modern, great value, well thought out cabin. Very impressive. Thanks Kimberly and Alex for a great stay. Tony"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All around excellent experience, and great host made us feel at home. Thank you Alex and Kimberly!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great place. The cabin is wonderful, everything is there- just enjoy. Great trail to take our little dog for walks. Quick response to any request. Sparkling clean and very pretty. Actually a very good getaway for a romantic trip! The special touches were very much appreciated. Highly, highly recommended."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is absolutely lovely. It’s tucked away and offers a sweet escape in nature without being in the middle of nowhere. My husband and I stayed for the weekend while in town for a wedding and I couldn’t think of a more perfect getaway between all the wedding festivities. I also highly recommend drinking your morning coffee out on the front porch. We would definitely book a stay here again!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful clean cottage, we enjoyed our stay everything was perfectly organized and well thought. We will be back! The area is great with good restaurants close to everything you need. We went on few hikes and waterfall viewing such a great time!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being in the middle of a pandemic, during an extremely hot spell, on the weekend of the July 4th, left us somewhat limited in things to do-like fly to Europe...thank the higher powers that we found our little Italian cottage and it was so incredibly perfect! Every detail was on point.
Imagine entering into a cool candlelit wonderland where the decor is so soft and inviting--the lighting, the paint job, the tiling, the furnishing--complete with a little loaf of baked 'goodness' ...everything in its place and [they allow dogs but is so immaculately clean you would never know it]. The bathroom is bright and full of wonderful smelling lotions and soaps, and plenty of fluffy towels. The bedroom has a huge bed, covered in pillows and extra blankets in every closet, with plenty of space to put your things. The living area is small but more than adequate. Besides, the kitchen is place to be when you're not on the front porch or around the area.
Then there's the firepit with the adjustable mood light surrounded with the mini roses and gardenias and peonies! Stunning!
And the service! We received an answer to any questions we had within minutes, complete with a list of restaurants and the distance to them. In fact, the day prior to arrival we inquired as to whether or not there was a grill--there definitely was one when we got there-brand new with all the utensils you would need...that's going the extra step, which is why they are truly super hosts.
I strongly recommend this property. It was the perfect spot for a nice, quiet, delightful getaway.
By the way, there are plenty of trails for hiking, waterfalls, and things to do in the area[check out the equestrian center!]--and even though a lot of the restaurants weren't open due to the aforementioned reasons, we ate very well!!
I think Italy would be proud. Well done and Thank you! We truly enjoyed it!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using an Airbnb and I’m so happy that I chose this one! This place was very comfortable and very relaxing environment. Everything that I needed was supplied by Alex and Kimberly for ex, washer/dryer w laundry detergent, coffee, Netflix/satellite tv/internet are just a few to name; they were very thoughtful and gave me complimentary baked bread & drinks. If you are looking for a place to get away/relax and enjoy nature then don’t look any further and book your stay here...you will love it! I enjoyed my 3 day stay and look forward to returning. Thanks again, Alex and Kimberly for everything."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Alex and Kimberly were fantastic hosts. The cabin was beyond my expectations, plus very, very clean. Great place to relax and feel pampered by your surroundings. Wish we could have stayed longer. This cabin was well appointed and very cozy."

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Alex and Kimberly’s place was amazing. It was clean and quiet which is perfect if you’re a traveling professional working a night shift! Having a trail in the back was also a huge plus if you are traveling with a dog, which I was. Everything I could ever need and want was already on site and the location was great. All in all I highly recommend, you can’t go wrong staying at Alex and Kimberly’s cottage."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a wonderfully decorated place with all the amenities. It is a great location if you are going to Tryon Equestrian Center, Fence, or Windridge. We will stay here again and again. I highly recommend it!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely my favorite Airbnb experience! Charming little cottage that is cozy, extremely clean, high quality craftsmanship, tasteful decor, lots of special touches, and had everything we needed. Although I read a ton of the great reviews and loved the pictures, it was still better than I expected. The hosts are friendly and quick to respond. We live in nearby Asheville, but were spending a kid free weekend celebrating our anniversary. So many fun things to explore in the area, not only Forest City (which indeed has a charming downtown...and fried pickles at the Copper Penny YUM!), there is also a wonderful winery nearby in Tryon, Mountain Brook Vineyards, a great place to hangout with great views and delightful atmosphere and enjoyed relaxing live music. Also, cute town of Rutherfordton ( bought great priced pottery at shop community art shop downtown, coffee at Small Town Coffee Roasters and ate lunch at the Garden Cafe in Rutherfordton hosts recommended and loved it, my husband said it was best clam chowder he ever had) and so many other great towns to explore and not far from Asheville. I don't usually write epic reviews, but so many good things to say about the experience :)"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for 1-2 travelers. It was perfectly appointed with nice touches, such as fresh cut flowers, amenities and thoughtfulness into what a guest may need. Even our two Boston Terriers enjoyed this lovely airbnb. I highly recommend Alex and Kimberly's accommodations. We'd definitely stay here again."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Kimberly’s Airbnb was absolutely perfect. The space was quiet, clean, and quite peaceful. They were very quick to respond when we had questions. They left sweet little touches such as fresh cut flowers that put a smile on our faces. We were visiting their area for a 31 mile Spartan race and needed some extra rest. They accommodated us with a later check out time that was extremely helpful (we were moving slowly). Overall, our stay was wonderful. We will definitely stay with them next time we are in the area."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed twice at Alex and Kimberlys place. Both times were great with super clean cottages and thoughtful touches throughout the home. We travel with our dogs and I love that they have a dog bed for our old girl. They also leave out dog bowls which is something we ALWAYS forget to pack. Wonderful place all the way around.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the cutest and most comfortable space to spend the weekend in. Alex & Kimberly were amazing host. The place felt just like home. Definitely would recommend for a couple get away.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alex and Kimberly’s cottage was the perfect home base for my family when we spent a weekend visiting friends in Forest City! The furnishings are stylish and comfortable, and the space was clean and inviting. We will definitely stay again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second Visit to Alex and Kimberly’s and it was as amazing as the first. The place is so clean you could eat from the floor. Beautifully decorated, back off of the road a little but just enough to seem like heaven. They fire pit is wonderful! Comfy beds and FULLY LOADED with whatever u may need, even a luscious snack or two or three! This is my place when I visit Gaffney! If you like serene country but eateries etc within driving distance this is your place! Fantastic communication and their property makes me feel like I am home! Great value, superb property and safe as safe can be!!! Thank you Kimberly and Alex!!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Quiet lovely spot.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect weekend at the cottage!! The thoughtful touches greeting us from fresh flowers, a delicious cinnamon bun, fresh coffee beans, and even a treat for our pup made this spot feel like a home away from home. The cottage was spotless, the king bed was comfy, and the kitchen was well stocked for any cooking utensils you may need. The fire pit was a huge plus!! Don’t hesitate to book this place - we look forward to returning for future smores around the fire and mornings spent on the porch drinking coffee. A++!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful little cottage tucked into a quiet neighborhood. Kimberly will have the place pristine for you along with a special tasty muffin from the local bakery. Fresh flowers adorn the table to make it feel like home. Motorcyclists be aware that the driveways are all gravel as well as the parking areas. Other than that, book your stay!! Hurry now before it’s all booked up!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If anyone is wondering whether or not they should book Alex and Kimberly's cottage, the answer is a definite yes! This was my first stay at an Airbnb, and I have to say that they really set the bar as hosts. I had no idea that a small cottage could be so luxurious. The best way to describe it would be ""well appointed."" Their taste in design and quality of craftsmanship is impeccable! Everything from the floor to the ceiling was beautiful, comfortable, welcoming, and remarkably clean. The hosts really went above and beyond to provide a home away from home - when we arrived, we were greeted with a fresh pastry, local coffee beans and ground coffee, a stocked Keurig machine, farm fresh eggs, bottled water, and even dairy free creamer and condiments in the refrigerator. The bathroom and shower was an absolutely gorgeous mini-sanctuary, with the necessary toiletries provided in case you forgot something. The king sized bed was clean and comfortable, with ample pillows and blankets to adjust to your liking, and even some books to clear your mind and relax with. We enjoyed browsing the channels on Direct TV and the WiFi worked like a charm. Communication with Kimberly was a breeze, as was the check-in and check-out procedures. I plan on returning to this cottage many times in the future. It was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend to any Airbnb guest."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, they only give me 5 stars and I need MORE! This cottage is absolutely PERFECT! As a traveling nurse I stay alone much of the time. The area is so safe and quiet. Don’t let the beautiful woods scare you off if u are going to stay alone!!!! This area and location is VERY SAFE!!!! I arrived to fresh flowers in vases and the sunflowers 🌻 are my absolute favorite flower and it made me smile. They left a wonderful pastry, coffee, water and some other items. It felt just like home!!! Wi-Fi was strong as I use it to work after I leave work. The couch and bed were superbly comfortable. The linens on the bed, blankets, towels and wash clothes were top notch!!! The bathroom and shower had some serious thought. It was fully stocked and I loved it!!! I loved the desk to work on and there was even a printer I could connect to as well! Full service TV, Netflix etc. The couch pulls out as a bed if needed and high class sheets and blankets are available if u need to use it. The kitchen was LOADED with anything and everything you could imagine to cook! The spice rack was phenomenal. The setting of this cabin back off the road had tons of privacy. I enjoyed turning the lights on and sitting outside in the gorgeous Adirondack seats! There is firewood etc to have a fire and all of this is provided at a cost I felt too good to be true. So if u r traveling or just want to get away, I HIGHLY recommend Alex and Kimberly’s property. I certainly intend on staying again when work sends me to Gaffney!
It’s gonna take something super special to top this rental!!!!! I was so excited when I left work to get back to the cottage as quick as I could and was sad to have to say good bye this morning.
Thank you so much for accepting my request for reservations!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage provides a wonderful surprise when you walk in the door. The host has taken a lot of time setting the place up for their guests. The cottage is welcoming and so comfy! No reason to leave the cottage except to enjoy the open fire pit outdoors. Will definitely stay here again when in the area.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, would go back!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is gorgeous. The location is great. It’s literally like vacationing in a smaller version of our own home.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow this place was excellent. It was clean, beautiful love all of the decor.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Driving 10 plus hours your final place to rest your head is key. I cannot say enough how much we loved our stay. Great place, would 1,000% recommend the stay here. We would definitely stay here again without any hesitation"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I almost don’t want to say how great this place was since I will be coming back often. Great space and beautiful amenities. Just awesome!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay! Great location and fabulous host. We loved the small details that Alex and Kimberly added to the cottage to make it feel warm and cozy and welcoming.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful cabin! I travel to the area for work frequently and decided to skip the hotel this time and try something new. I am so glad I did!
The cabin is very warm and cozy, and it was immaculately clean when I arrived. There were even fresh flowers when I arrived. The bed was very comfortable too. I hope to be back soon!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was beautiful and immaculate, and the hosts seem to have thought of everything. So many thoughtful details, from the labeled light switches to the ample closet storage to the best slice of pie I’ve ever tasted. It was an absolutely lovely retreat, and they accommodated me very last minute as well. Stay here if you are in the area. Best Airbnb experience ever."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ll keep this simple...if you’re staying in Forest City, Shelby, or the nearby area, STAY HERE.
Best amenities. Cleanest Air B&B I have ever stayed at. These folks run a professional and luxurious operation.
Seriously, this place is unreal."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is darling. Very well designed space, in fact I might steal it and build one! I had a fairly short notice booking and the hosts were not just responsive, but had fresh bread, honey and local coffee for us. AND fresh flowers. Those things made even a more welcoming space. You will not be disappointed!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed!
What an interesting cottage Alex and Kimberly have created. The cottage is tastefully decorated and thanks to all the personal touches has a feeling of “home” when you first open the door.
Attention to the small details can make or break a getaway. The hosts have thought of it all. This cottage has everything you will need to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing.
There are only two things you need to bring with you; clothes and if you plan on cooking, food. Honestly the hosts have thought of it all. We thought we would need to take a trip to the local store to grab a few essentials but never had to set foot into a store.
If you love the outdoors, the area has so much to offer all within a hour or less drive. If you’re coming to relax, the outdoors fire pit is impressive.
You will not be disappointed in your decision to book this place."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our best airbnb experience yet! This beautiful cabin was absolutely spotless and filled with great amenities and every little thing you could possibly need! They left us cute little touches like dog treats and baked goods. We had such a relaxing stay and definitely would like to come back. Alex and Kimberly responded quickly and were available for anything we might need.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly an amazing place! It looks great in pictures, and even better in person. Impeccable quality, easy comfort, and a full set of amenities (perfect kitchen set up and appliances) made this an extremely great place to stay! Very impressive that you can find this kind of living space in the quietness of the trees and mountains.
Pretty easy to get to and a grocery store close by, it’s a great relaxing getaway. When I arrived there was a sweet bread from a local bakery, fresh coffee beans (along with a coffee grinder and French press), and even a treat for my dog! Extremely clean and well taken care of. Would definitely stay here again."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is sparkling clean & decorated with great taste! I highly recommend it.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this as a gift to my sister and her husband for their anniversary and this is what they said: ""This place is absolutely perfect in every way! I love the ambiance, so relaxing! And it's sparkling clean! And all the little personal touches that they add like fresh flowers and local honey .....it really makes you feel welcomed and at home. The host is an adorable couple that are super helpful and friendly and were easy to communicate with, but they also gave us our privacy. They went out of their way to make our stay special, and it truly was. We loved everything about it! Can't wait to stay here again! """
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite places to stay. My wife and I love all the little touches in the house and the true cottage feel you get in this very quiet and beautiful area. They even make sure your puppy is provided with all they need to be happy. The hosts go above and beyond to make sure your accommodated in every way you will need. If your ever in this part of the world make sure you stay in the Italian cottage.... you will not regret it!!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely one of our favorite Airbnb stays ever! This was a 4-day recharge getaway for my husband and I and our 2 little dogs. Kimberly and Alex have created such a special little cabin and really know how to roll out the red carpet.
They thought of everything from an easy check-in, to a bed and dishes for the dogs, to all the dish ware you could possibly need! There were little magical touches here and there including a loaf of sweet potato bread that was to die for!
Alex and Kimberly are very responsive and check-in was a breeze.
It was such a pleasure to meet Kimberly, and also her father in-law! For sure ask him what he does for a living. Impressive.
Our dogs loved the walking trail in the woods! We loved the holiday festivities in Forest City! Mostly, though, we loved hanging out in the darling cottage, reading, napping and being together unplugged. (There is WiFi, we just chose not to use it, and an impressive selection of TV channels.)
None of us wanted to leave, and we will surely be back! Thank you Alex and Kimberly for your warm hospitality."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place was great!!!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place! Super clean! Love, Love the place!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Kimberly were simply amazing hosts. This house was more than we expected. Kimberly and Alex left us some amazing sweet potato pecan bread, wine, and a sweet note because we were celebrating our anniversary. The home was spacious for my husband and I and our stay. The fire pit was such a nice touch and we throughly enjoyed all the amenities."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Best place we’ve stayed in so far. Beautiful space and lovely extra touches. Appreciated the key pad as we came into town really late. It felt like a 5 star hotel with the linens, toiletries, little treats (delicious sweet potato loaf), and the helpful little guide to the area. Really wish we had the time to use the outdoor fire pit as it looked amazing. We were really worried about our 20 month old ruining the beautiful space but he had fun running around the outside and we put his travel crib in the little office so he could sleep without distractions. We will definitely recommend to others and come back the next time we are in the area."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this place for our weekend trip to Asheville and were more than pleased with the home. Everything was sparkling clean and the hosts even added extra touches such as keurig cups, extra towels, and small hygiene items. They were very communicative and answered any questions we had as well as made sure we had a comfortable stay. The best part of all was the hospitality. We exchanged stories beside the fire pit and enjoyed their company as well as their stories. They are probably some of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met in my life to be honest. This place is definitely super clean, very comfortable, and has amazing hosts. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! If you’ve read the review this far down just save yourself some time and go ahead and book this place. You will not be disappointed I promise."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb have a gem with Kimberly and Alex as hosts with the program. My daughter and I spent the weekend in this beautiful 1 bedroom cottage and we are already trying to figure out when we can go back for another visit. The location could not have been better for our needs; so quiet. It is very well appointed with everything you could possibly need.
Kimberly and Alex go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and memorable. Do yourself a favor and make a trip to the Foothills of NC and stay at this adorable cottage. You can get anywhere you need to go in minutes."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place in a quiet neighborhood. Supermarket right at the entrance to the neighborhood and lots of food options really close. We were in town for the IEA National Championships at the Tryon Equestrian Center, and it was only 15 minutes away. The place had plenty of space and was perfect for us. Cristy gave us instructions ahead of time that included the door code. All went well and would recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was exactly as advertised. House was just like a house with everything available. Only upgrade would be some softer mattresses. But they were still fine to sleep on. Host was very good at getting back to us quickly. Highly recommend this host and house.
2024-04-01,3.0,Group trip,"I want to start off with that this Airbnb was a good value and a decent stay but some things could definitely improved upon.
Our major issues were it wasn't terribly clean and the bathroom was pretty rough. I could see this being a problem with people who are particular about their bathrooms.
Some minor issues were all of the dead(but properly labeled) light switches, somewhat shoddy fixtures, and the unkempt outdoor area. The kitchen faucet also has an issue with the cold water and the coffee maker didn't work.
We liked the large kitchen, all of the space, the nice appliances, and overall atmosphere of the place. The sign-up/check in was quick and easy even on pretty short notice.
If the bathroom was nicer and the place was a little cleaner this could have been easily a 4+ star rating."

The air conditioning was not cooling the back rooms properly and the hosts worked till 9pm installing window units in both rooms so we would be comfortable. We had 5 grown men and the only thing we could have used was another full bath. It would be fine for a family of 5. The area is nice and the neighbors were friendly.

,,,"This is a cabin in the woods, so you are very secluded. For groups of people I am sure this is fine (this is a two bed property). It is worth noting there is no microwave, clothes washing faculties or kettle (if you're a tea drinker like me). And the only seating ears, apart from outside is the kitchen table. I originally booked in for 23 nights but left after the first night because the bedroom you enter the house into has no really blinds. They are more like see-through mosquito nets, and this means, when it gets dark, people can see straight through the house, including into the second bedroom, so there is zero privacy except for in the small shower room. Knowing you can be watched as you lie in bed is very unsettling, and I'm amazed that no one has complained about this before."
