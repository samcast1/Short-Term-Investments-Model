And there was a small back area where we could let our dogs out quickly, and plenty of places nearby to walk the dogs.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Neat and clean place with a fun vintage vibe downtown Mitchell.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is exactly what I expected and looks just as good in person as the pics. It’s very spacious and each bedroom is quite private. The building is older and seems to be transitioning as not all of it appeared as updated as the apartment. But it was quiet and peaceful. Great price for the size and layout of the space.
We were only there for a quick overnight so can’t say much about the town."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Anthony's. The space was very cute and the location was great. There is currently some construction on the road near the overnight parking. We hadn't read back to the reviews about the coffee shop music. The music will wake you up around 6:30 am. The coffee shop is very nice and has great breakfast options.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed our stay! Just a couple of blocks from the Corn Palace in downtown Mitchell. The apartment was much bigger than I had anticipated. Downtown Mitchell is quiet in the evenings. The place was very clean. There is a nice coffee shop one floor below.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the Corn Palace , the Ptedistoric Native American excavations and the historic Depit. Also went to the Dakota Discovery Meseum."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying here. The apartment is very cute and has lots of character, and it was comfortable. Check-in was easy, and Anthony graciously offered to give us a late check-out, which was incredibly helpful. The location is the best part--it's in downtown Mitchell and close to everything. Being right on top of a coffee shop was very fun too (even though it was closed when we were there). The only thing I'd caution is that there are some steep stairs to get to the apartment; they were a little hard for my 77-year-old mother, but she managed. I would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anthony was very responsive and helpful (especially when I encountered a parking issue). The place is huge, comfy, cozy, well-appointed and charming. And two blocks away from the Corn Palace. Loved it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Place! Ideal location for walking to restaurants and Bars. Solid Vibes and Comfortable Place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time here. Even with the blizzard we had to outrun to get to Mitchell. Anthony was very accommodating and responsive. We didn’t have a contingency plan when the snow hit so arrived a few hours early. The place is rustically decorated in the perfect way. The trickiest part was figuring out what to do with the car when the plows came through, but that was minor and short lived. We would 100% rent here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Had everything we needed. The coffee shop below was an added bonus! Thanks Anthony!

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The location of the property was GREAT! Lots of items in the apartment that were interesting to look at. The chess board and pick up stick games were perfect for my kiddos. There was a blow up mattress that worked out good for my 2 year old. Overall I was quite impressed with the apartment and was a much more affordable option for my family.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! The apartment was clean and peaceful. I loved waking up to the sound of the coffee shop below. I also enjoyed how they kept the old charm. Very comfy beds and furniture.
The only downside was that it was around 60° in the apartment even with the heat on. I know it's because this is an older place and it was -40° outside, but I still froze! Regardless, I travel to Mitchell off often and will stay here again. Next time I'll just bring my heated blanket :-)"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went up for pheasant hunt and Mitchell and wanted to stay somewhere besides hotel room. Found Anthony's place and was perfect for two hunters, clean comfortable well appointed with amenities as well as lots of extra stuff placed in the kitchen made it feel very much at home. Located in historic building on Main Street Mitchell it was conveniently located to corn palace, restaurants, sports bars, and other shopping in the downtown area and of course coffee shop directly below apartment. Even though on main street, it was not noisy at all. Will definitely book again next year and highly recommend anyone traveling to Mitchell to give it a try"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anthony's. It is very quaint and nicely decorated in fun antiques. It is a bit of a climb to get to, so I would recommend for younger people or very fit older people. It does have a bit of a musty smell, but it is an older building. He gave very good checkout instructions. and we truly enjoyed our stay."

Understand there is bit of a musty smell from some of the original flooring/building but they were thoughtful in providing a room spray that smells AMAZING (this did not diminish the experience of our stay- but is something to consider for those with smell sensitivities). The coffee shop below the apartment was an added bonus with delicious breakfast and coffee. Overall amazing stay, would definitely book again if we're in the area."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have been coming to Deadwood for 16 years…always stayed on a hotel. This year, a girls trip, we booked this cabin and couldn’t be more happier. Our cabin is clean, so roomy and we love the private deck with a gas fire pit. We are booking already for next year."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anthony's place is a mix of modern convenience and historic charm. The wood floors and the antiques add interest, while the updated bathroom avoids the quirks of some older properties. The location couldn't be better. It's just steps away from the Corn Palace and close to restaurants."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a neat apartment. Loved being able to walk down to the coffee shop below. The apartment has so much character and is right on Main Street. Clean, comfortable and perfect for a stop on our road trip!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Very large staircase. Not for people who are elderly with mobility issues or disabled. Very strong odor in the unit (musty) due to the age of the building. People with allergies like me may not do well with the smell. Clean and nicely decorated. Amenities are sufficient. I would say the price is high for what you get. Host never sent a personal message during our stay. All directions came from the site. They do ask you to get a load of laundry ready if you use towels which is unusual for Airbnbs as a whole as you pay a cleaning fee.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable spot full of character. Nicely decorated and great location in downtown Mitchell."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorite Air B/Bs! Just a fabulous place - comfortable, roomy, quiet, great location. Such a unique place! I can't imagine why anyone would spend the same amount of money to stay at some hotel room on the interstate when they could have a place like this - two private bedrooms, great bathroom, fantastic living and dining room, full kitchen. Decoration was adorable and charming - whole place was charming! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean, beautiful decor. Anthony was very helpful with late checkout. Definitely recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cool place to stay! It was 2 blocks from the Corn Palace. We stayed there en route from Kansas City to the Black Hills. It was clean and very convenient. Would stay again .
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute place right down the street from the corn palace!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was beautiful. It was very clean, beds were squeaky but very comfy, and lovely sheets! I did pick this particular place bc of a washer and dryer, we are on a cross country trip, and the washer was not working.
The hallway to the apt was quite sketchy.
This is our first AirBNB stay, very happy with the experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. Walkable to shops and restaurants. Clean and just what I was looking for.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place and GREAT location! Space was clean and had everything we needed! Beds were very comfortable, plenty of extra bedding and towels. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gem in Mitchell, SD! The apartment offers more than the pictures and description suggest - cozy, comfy beds in nice-sized bedrooms, fully stocked kitchen, great living room and dining spaces - spacious bathroom... remote working spots galore (office, dining table, couch...) easy to access and in walking distance to many attractions/restaurants/cafes! Off street parking was easy. Driving to El Columpio on the edge of town for dinner was a breeze -- and seriously delicious burritos (I live in Chicago, where there are hundreds of Mexican restaurants... and am now dreaming of El Columpio, wishing it had an outpost in my town...!). Would DEFINITELY stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of our favorite places we’ve stayed so far. The building is older but the decor made us feel right at home. Kitchen was well stocked as well as plenty of extra linens & towels provided. The coffee shop below was perfect for breakfast the next morning before checkout. We would definitely stay there again
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Decent place for an overnight stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoy our stay here. Nice, clean, and decorated very well. Thanks for the great stay, definitely would recommend for anyone wanting to checkout downtown Mitchell."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I loved staying at Anthony’s Airbnb. It was very easy to find, Anthony carefully explained check in details and the apt was super walkable. The beds were very comfortable— I slept 9 hours—no joke!
We walked to the Corn Palace, The Back 40 Taphouse Grill (delic burgers), and the cinema. We had a great breakfast at the coffee shop/cafe downstairs.
I highly recommend. Thanks, Anthony.
-Leah from Minneapolis"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Clean and comfortable. Cozy furnishings. Nice place.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a small misunderstanding about getting into the rental, the stay went very well. Cleaners weren't done when we arrived and 3:00 p.m. and could not get into unit. Got in touch with Anthony but before he could reply the cleaners opened the door as they were almost done and we were able to get into the unit. The only other thing was the washer was broken so we were unable to start sheets and towels as instructed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot, super cute and clean! Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anthony was very communicative. Loved the housekeeper, too! Very kind and helpful! Nice place."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here so much. Everything was exactly as described and very comfortable. Host has thought of all of the details and I didn’t lack anything while there.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anthony’s place was very nice. Comfortable to stay in and walkable to corn palace and eating places.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our stop in Mitchell for the night. The beds were comfy, the place was was really nicely decorated, and the location was great - right off Main Street so we could walk to supper and explore a little. I’m glad we didn’t need to use the washer because the door was broken and unable to start. Luckily it only impacted our ability to start the bedding in the wash before we left. Overall, we’d stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and very clean.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at this lovely apartment. I was surprised at how spacious it was.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awsome apartment. Very spacious and full of character. Perfect location in town. Great restaurants within walking distance. Very clean and comfortable. Awsome host. Very easy to check in and out. Highly recommend.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The location was convenient for a quick stopover, close to the corn palace, with clear instructions where to move the car overnight. We were a bit startled by a guy who came in and said he was checking on the AC right when we got there one hour after the check in time, but in all fairness the host had tried to contact me half an hour before check in, missed due to being on the road at that time. The dishwasher was still running, so I unloaded the dishes when they finished and reran what was visibly missed by the machine. I was awoken at 4am by what sounded like a critter scampering above or around the apartment and again by the coffee shop music below around 7. Floors weren’t the cleanest but they did match the rustic decor. All in all, a sufficient stopover with the basics."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! It was clean, comfortable, and so cutely decorated!! The location being above an amazing coffee shop and walkable to many other things was great as well. I know another review said they could hear the coffee shop music but I don’t know if they have changed the volume since but we could not hear it! My only problem is I wish we could have stayed longer as we were just quickly passing through!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very convenient and accessible
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fun time in Mitchell. Had a good dinner, got tattoos, visited the Corn Palace, and walked around and popped in to some of the shops. Einstein’s across the street is a fun and interesting place to visit. Anthony’s place is in a good location and has a good amount of space with all you need."

We loved the location, especially being able to wake up and walk down the stairs to the coffee shop below (which serves an amazing breakfast). Will definitely stay here again when we visit family."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The coffee shop below the apartment opens early and you are awakened by church music starting about 6:30. We are early risers so not a problem for us but if you like sleeping in, could be irritating."

The place was clean and seemed to have everything needed (we didn't cook so not entirely sure). We'd stay there again!

The apartment is SO cute, super homey, and has everything you can think of needing. I would highly recommend staying here!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This Airbnb was fantastic for me and my friends. We needed a place to stay for wedding and this was much cheaper than a hotel. It is absolutely beautiful and well kept! Lots of extra blankets, pillows, towels, etc. My only complaint is that it was ready by 3 like it said, so we showed up at 3:20 and it was still being cleaned. I didn’t mind this at all, just a heads up would have been nice! Great experience overall and would stay again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here in Mitchell! Perfect location, centrally located on the main street in downtown! Right above a wonderful Christian owned and run coffee shop! Easy check in process! Super clean and the CUTEST decor ever!! Anthony was very responsive to our questions and made our stay very comfortable! Parking in the evening was a little tricky bc we had to circle the block a few times until we found an empty spot, but the nice thing is you can park in front of the bnb during the day which makes it very convenient! The walk from parking at night is nice and short! If I’m ever back in Mitchell, this is definitely where I will stay again! :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Anthony’s place is a great gem for an overnight in Mitchell! The decorations are great and the beds are very comfortable.

This place has all the amenities! Plus it’s doggo friendly!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to Anthony’s check in instructions, the spot was very easy to find.
The apartment itself is well equipped and very comfortable (even when it hit 106 degrees outside, the apartment stayed ice cold).
If you have to stop in Mitchell for any reason, you really can’t do much better than this. Just down the stairs there is a solid little coffee shop with good breakfast and coffee, and there are several bar/restaurant options within a couple blocks if you don’t feel like cooking any meals.
10/10 would stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in Mitchell.
*** one word of advice to airbnb’ers, be sure to park where the listing says and/or check your street signs carefully! I got a $30 parking ticket parking on the wrong part of 3rd street, and the sign that indicated no parking was on the other side of the street and facing the opposite direction."

Very cool space to stay! :) Thanks again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful apartment- felt spacious and so beautifully decorated. Lots of great lamps, nice sitting space, dining table . Really the whole place is a cozy welcoming apartment. Stairs up to the apartment itself are a little scary, not unsafe, just old and the building is old. But I had no trouble. Anthony was a good host."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the apartment! The location was fantastic for a quick jaunt over to the Corn Palace. Very quiet spot at night so the kids easily fell asleep. And the couch was super comfy for relaxing. Thanks Anthony!

We appreciated all the small touches and convenience in town. Very clean, with laundry and dishwasher. The only downsides are the staircase up to the second floor, and the parking down the street and around the corner, for those traveling with extra baggage."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super charming place, and it was also really quiet. We slept really well after a long day of driving! It's above a cute coffee shop which was unfortunately closed on Sunday, maybe we'll get to try it next time"

Selena's home was the perfect location. My family of five and two small dogs thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were able to barbeque and enjoy being together. It was a delightful weekend in a delightful home. Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Selena made it very easy very clear instructions. communicated well and had a comfortable space. we got in late and left early Selena. my communication stunk because of travel. Senena did not miss a step and made sure we had everything we needed!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home was very cozy inside. The location worked well for us driving across the state of South Dakota.

She also gave us a great recommendation to a restaurant in town - The Depot - which was delicious."

The layout of the house was perfect for all of us. It provided quietness for those going to bed early and allowed others to stay up & visit. The house was not only clean but had all the accommodations that we needed! It is a very charming, cozy and warm home! I felt safe and had no worries! Highly recommend Selena/the host!! Will stay again if available!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place besides small bathroom:)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here for a month while in town helping a family member. Selena was super responsive. My only compliant is the bathroom is very small which you can’t really tell from the pictures.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A small old home with fresh paint. The location is great for access to downtown Mitchell. Easy access from the ally allows loading and unloading cars very easy.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a great place to stay! The home was very easy to find, easy check-in with access code. The home is older (has charm), but you can see how much it is cared for and she takes pride in it. The beds were very comfortable. I was able to do some laundry, machines worked great. We did some light cooking and everything we needed was available. The back yard looked really cute, but we did not need to utilize it. Great water pressure and temperature in bathroom. I felt safe in the neighborhood. I had to park my truck and 16 foot trailer out front with very expensive motorcycles on it, they were not messed with at all. I would definitely stay here again! She (host) was very responsive to questions, and took great care in making sure everything was perfect for our stay. Definitely a superhost."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed having a place to stay over our long road trip. Exactly as described. Nice cozy feel. Selena was a great communicator and we had no problem finding her place.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena’s place was comfortable and charming. Reminded me of grandma’s house. My only note is that because the house is older and the bathroom door did not close all the way flush, it might be uncomfortable for some people. I was traveling with my daughter so it was fine."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent spot! Very spacious!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Selena’s home was perfect for our stay- again! The kitchen had what we needed, the living room space was cozy and the bedroom and bathroom met our needs.
Selena is easy to communicate with, and very responsive. I love the recipe box in the kitchen.
The homes location was an easy walk to downtown Mitchell and we enjoyed dining at the Scoreboard and Back 40.
We will definitely be planning to stay here next summer!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This charming home was perfect for our one night in Mitchell as we travelled across the state. It was clean and had what you need for the night. It was nice to have a little yard with swing and slide for our small kids to play on after being cooped up in the car. We would highly recommend staying here! Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just stayed one night as we were passing through, and checked in very late. However, the keypad was perfect so we could come anytime we wanted. The pull out bed in the third bedroom with the pullout is nice, lots of space to spread out. Nice big kitchen, nice neighborhood, very quiet. Would recommend and would stay here again for sure!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our brief stay. We were traveling through Mitchell on our way back from vacation. The beds were comfortable. We especially loved the water dispenser. There were lots of fun things that we didn't have time to enjoy. (There were inside games, a swing set, table and chairs on the deck and a recipe box to try a new recipe.) We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place with a comfortable bed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay here!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Selena’s home was wonderfully private as a stand alone house and also it’s layout. Each traveler had their own private space. It was very practical to have the washer and dryer so accessible! It was fun to be within a walking distance from the Corn palace - we saw it in daylight, in dusk and in dawn. This home met all of our needs!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay on our road trip from Colorado to Minnesota! We truly appreciated the a/c :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You can tell the host has put a lot of love and care into the home. Everything was very clean. Still plenty of space for our 5 person family in this cozy spot. Host is very responsive and kind to accommodate us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just what we needed! Bonus was that it was walkable distance from downtown!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent location! Very easy to find and close to downtown. The home feels very cozy and has everything needed for a great stay. We would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Selena describes her place as “cozy” but with 2 full size bedrooms, full kitchen and dining room and 2 living areas I'd say it was just right. The wife and I used Selena's place as a bridge between when we moved out of our home and when we left Mitchell and it was perfect. I work from home and the internet was super fast, kitchen was fully equipped and the TV had a RoKu that we were able to use our Direct TV subscription easily. The home was very clean and well equipped for long stays and very convenient and walkable to many bars and restaurants downtown. If we make our way back to Mitchell, we will be sure and book this fabulous place again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Selena was an awesome host! Everything in her home was as pictured and as described. The home is an older home and is very warm and cozy. We had a peaceful night with no issues. It was a prefect stop on our way to Yellowstone. Thanks again for letting our family stay in your home.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Looks like the pictures. The bathroom is very small and cramped so keep that in mind if you are a taller person. Only stayed for one night, it provided enough space for my family."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place, served our needs well!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to lay your head. Our family of 5 was very comfortable and had a great stop over on our vacation.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, quaint, comfortable place. Everything we needed and more."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, Selena was a great host.."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Decent place located near the Corn Palace. Furniture is pretty rough and some were dirty/stained. Looks like it all came from a second hand store. Host was very worried about having shoes taken off as soon as you get in the door so the old white rugs in the house don't get stained.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay - did have to clean the coffee pot prior to use but not a huge deal. Beds were super comfy and all our needs were met!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my third stay at Selena's home. Excellent stay each time.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and close to Main Street, where we spent most of our week at ""Your Shop"". I'm awful at reviews, but here are the important bits.
The kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. The house was clean and had plenty of linens. The beds were comfortable, and the two real beds were a different firmness. So, you can pick what you want. There was a swingset in the backyard that I don't remember seeing in the photos. The kids loved it.
It is perfect for your average family vacation.
(I mention this only because I know it is nice information to know as we frequently travel with handicap family members. The home is not handicap accessible. It didn't matter to us, but if you have a wheelchair or a family member who needs assistance with hygiene routines, it will be a struggle.)"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Appreciated the coffee maker in the morning. The bathroom door needs some work to not wake everyone when opening and closing during the night. Overall a good stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,cozy house that was great for our family of 7. beds were comfortable. definitely a nice house.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly as represented. Great stay.
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is tight for 4 guests. If you don't sleep together you will need to use 2 pull out couches. The kitchen is small and the one bathroom tiny.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was conveniently located and had everything we needed for our stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have been to Mitchell many times over the last 4 years and stayed pretty much everywhere. Selena’s place was a nice change from some of the others. Close by and walking distance to Main Street of Mitchell. On a quiet street and location. It was great for a short weekend visit.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Worked perfect for our family, good value, great communication, relaxing place for us and our kiddos to stay! Thanks again Selena!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Selena had great communication and addressed the one issue with the refrigerator in a timely matter. Clean place and very comfortable.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The visit was to go pheasant hunting with local friends so the location for meeting with all of them made things so convenient.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy and good communication. Easy entry and very clean. King bed was great and full was good but better for 1 person than 2.
All went well."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent experience, house well stocked with everything you might need."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,excellent communication and little touches made for a welcome stay
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The home was perfect for our weeklong stay. Selena was very easy to communicate with, the house was very cute. The accommodations were clean and had everything we needed for our stay. We would definitely book again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed in Selena's cozy bungalow as we were passing through Mitchell on a road trip through South Dakota. Close to downtown, we found it the perfect spot for a comfortable and restful night afters hours in the car. Selena was a communicative host, and provided us with every thing we needed during our short visit."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, my very first time trying ABnB and what an amazing experience compared to my typical work week. I travel for work so I spend more time in a hotel than at home. I have always considered using ABnB but was worried that it could be a hassle and would destract me from my very busy schedule. Boy was I wrong thanks to Selena, she was very helpful and even accommodated me reserving the place last minute. I couldn't appreciate it more and I don't think I will be booking hotels from now on. Amazing experience for half the price, can't wait to book my next adventure!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very quaint little home! My family of five was able to take a break from the road, and get a good nights sleep here! The home has a very well-stocked kitchen, bathroom, and living area. There are books and games, and a large dining table. The king bed was a BIG plus, and all of the bedding was very comfortable. There was construction outside, but Selena was very communicative and gave us perfect directions to avoid the obstruction. The home is older construction, and the bathroom is very narrow. This wasn’t an issue for the majority of us, but my husband is a very broad man, and found it a bit difficult to maneuver in there. Not necessarily a bad thing, but something to be aware of, especially for people with limited mobility. Great stay, and would stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to stay in Mitchell. Close to downtown, easy to find."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very charming and cute. The road was under construction and we were pulling a car trailer so the parking in the back alley wasn’t feasible for us, but we were able to park on a side street and it was a very short walk."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay! We would definitely go back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena’s house is lovely and cozy, we really enjoyed and appreciated our overnight there. It was perfectly located for us. Communication was great too. Would stay there again on our next visit to/through Mitchell."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet neighborhood! Cozy house and the king size bed was a bonus!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication. Cute house. Exactly what we needed for our pit stop. Recommend :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena’s place was clean and organized—all according to her listing. Parking and finding the location was a bit confusing due to construction nearby, but the host clearly explained the situation ahead of time. Would recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena is a great host and responds to questions quickly. The house is older but very well maintained and has modern conveniences. The bathroom space is small but had all the necessities. It’s within walking distance to the Corn Palace and shops.
The neighborhood was quiet which made for a peaceful stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice affordable stay. Perfect stop for our road trip. Plenty of space to sleep everyone and we enjoyed the board games.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed one night on our way to the Badlands - the house is clean and accurately described. It is very close to the corn palace which made a nice road side stop for the kids. Only small comment is that there are a lot of Christian messages posted in the house - this didn't bother us but might be uncomfortable for some guests.
2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Clean house big enough for eight, but sleeping eight or six adults was a stretch. tow great beds for adults and two fold out couches with somewhat decent mattresses. would be great for young adults or children. very clean and nicely appointed and close enough to walk to the corn palace and downtown. very safe and homey town and the people we meet were very down home and friendly."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was super easy! Selena was very responsive - very awesome. It's an older home - several things have been updated but still somewhat outdated. But home functions just fine and is cute and clean. Very small bathroom but there are at least additional mirrors throughout the home to facilitate getting ready. This home is walking distance to downtown events - all the hotels are too far away so that makes this location super handy in that regard. There is only 1 bed large enough to comfortably sleep 2 people - something to keep in mind if you are planning for it to house several adult couples, bigger bodies may not be comfortable doubling up. Nice place though and would stay here again for sure!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena's place was a great place to stay when our car broke down outside of Mitchell! It was nice to be much closer to the town center and Corn Palace (rather than in strip mall I-90 land) and to have plenty of space for our party of 3 to stretch out. Check-in and check-out were simple, and the beds comfy and linens well-stocked. I really appreciated it!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay right near the corn palace. Cute home! Definitely on our list to stay again if ever out this way!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Passing through on cross-country trek and rolled into town tired and looking for relaxing place to stay. Selena's home was perfect. Clean, quiet, good climate control, and laundry. Good value and excellent, responsive communication. Alas, we missed the Corn Palace.. .next visit?"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena’s house is clean, comfortable and in a very quiet neighborhood close to downtown, a very walkable distance to the Corn Palace, shops, restaurants and easy access to the interstate. Comfortable beds, hot shower, and well set up kitchen. Perfect for what we were looking for! Highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very convenient location. We enjoyed our stay. Owner is excellent with communication. We felt like she went The extra mile to make our stay pleasant.
The kids enjoyed the swing set in the backyard. The privacy fence on both sides of the backyard made it very relaxing to be outside."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location by the Corn Palace, we loved being walk to restaurants!
Kitchen was well stocked with everything you need for a successful family dinner.
Great backyard and quiet neighborhood."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If I could give Selena 10 stars, I would! She was the BEST host! The house was as advertised. It was an older home and was smallish, as you would expect. The location was quiet and convenient to many places in Mitchell. Check out the Indian Archeleogical Site! It's only a 5-minute drive away and and am active site. So fascinating!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice little house near the Corn Palace. Very Clean!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Was fine for our 1 night stay.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Selena’s house was just what we needed on the last night of our trip! Room to spread out and relax and do some laundry before heading home! Thank you!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, easy entry and not far from the freeway. Cute, well decorated and real AC. Stocked with games and all the essentials we needed for a quick overnight.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable and secure."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was close to everything we needed-Corn Palace and grocery store so we could make dinner. The TV is at an awkward angle if you have more than three people watching. Plenty of space to stretch out and though we didn't use it, I liked the option of a fire pit."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Stopped in on a long road trip and it was much better than stopping in a bigger city at a hotel.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great little house. Centrally located. Very clean. Would stay again with 4 or fewer people.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice old house with great character in a central location, easy to find from the freeway. We liked it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home had enough beds to accommodate our family of 7 and was an affordable price. It would have been nice to have another chair in the dining room since there were only 6 and one of us had to stand (it is supposed to sleep 8).
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for a great stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot to stay. 10 min walk to the Corn Palace and the restaurants. Quiet, clean and everything you need. Good spot to stop and recharge after a day of driving."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is a really good stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very old home. Selena has done a great job on trying to refresh it. There are not many plug ins available due to the age of the home. Great communication the entire trip. Very close to the corn palace. Thanks for the quick stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Selena is an amazing host! We had some trouble getting to the location due to weather delays and she was more than accommodating and willing to help us through. She even contacted airbnb for us when we were having technical issues. I would definitely stay with her again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Selena's place was great for our weekend in Mitchell. The proximity to the downtown area was great - we walked there every morning for coffee. The house is quaint with thoughtful touches. The parking in back was very convenient and we enjoyed spending time outside on the front porch and back patio. Would definitely recommend Selena's home for anyone heading to Mitchell!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, would definitely come back!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selena provided a great spot for us to get rejuvenated from our 3 weeks on the road. The house is well located - and the parking behind the house was wonderful for unloading and loading. The house was comfortable with a comfortable bed, smart tv and kitchen necessities.
Be aware that the bathroom is tight, but has everything you need - including information about trouble shooting any switch problems. Unlike much larger bathrooms where we have stayed, the exhaust fan was terrific and it wasn't steamy at the end of my shower - although there was plenty of hot water which I took full advantage of.
Selena was great about communicating at the beginning and end of our stay and was available via text for any questions/problems (we had none).
Thank you again Selena."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Good value. Enjoyed the stay.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I stayed here for one night while making our way to Rapid City to spend the holidays with family. The home was easy to find, and Selena was very communicative. Checking in and out was super easy. Lots of extra blankets around, plentiful towels and washcloths in the bathroom. The King Bed was very comfy!
Very close to Main Street restaurants and the Corn Palace, and a great value for the amount of space & having a whole place to yourself! There were standard condiments in the fridge and seasonings in the cabinets. Overall a very well stocked kitchen! There was also a little recipe box of some of Selena's favorite recipes, and recipes that other guests have left, which was such a sweet and personal feature! We didn't have time to try any of the recipes, but maybe on another trip. :)"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy and comfy, good amount of space, nice outdoor space as well. Very clean, all the necessities. My only complaint/suggestion is to bring your own toilet paper."

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Decent sized single floor home in quiet area. Older house, remodeled and well maintained. Short drive or walk to Main Street area. 3rd bedroom is actually the sitting room off the living room, with pullout sofa and french doors. Good WiFi and internet TV. Parking on the lawn out back by the door makes easy work unloading your car. Prime rib at the Cattleman's is superb."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for just a night and unfortunately got in just in time to go to bed and had to leave in the morning for our event. We definitely missed out on enjoying some of the offers of this house such as the backyard fire pit. The beds were crazy comfortable, probably the best I’ve ever slept in away from home. Selena was great at communicating quickly and answering any questions. I would stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is conveniently located in a quiet street just a few blocks from Main Street/Corn Palace. Check-in/Check-out was very smooth and Selena quickly responded whenever there were any questions. Everything was just as shown in the pictures. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side, but that was not a problem with only two of us staying there. We would certainly consider staying there again."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house was nice, but it was warm. there were 2 window air conditioners, however both had a note that stated to not set them below 75 degrees. the twin bed is very loud and squeaks every time you move."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spent one night to break up a long travel from Omaha to Mt. Rushmore. Charming, very clean, well-stocked cottage very close to both the Corn Palace and I-90. Had the pots and pans that I needed to make the family a scrumptious pot roast at the end of a long day...and so much more satisfying than fast food. Be aware there are a few stairs at both front and rear entrances. But, that was OK for this 70s couple because we had our 18 year old grandson with us to give us a helping hand. Fast, prompt communication with owner. Would definitely recommend this rental."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Selena's house was a perfect stop on our journey from Michigan to see several National Parks. She was helpful and answered all of the questions I had before our arrival.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Celina has a very clean and well stocked home. We had a comfortable stay and appreciated her many thoughtful touches. Our GPS took us to an address one block away from her actual address, so watch out for that. It made a difference to us because we arrived very late and it was hard to see house numbers."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks, Selena! Super comfortable house and bed and everything. Lots of fun to be had on Main Street one measly block away. Elixir Roasterie was *the* spot for coffee."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing for anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle. Just a short drive off I-90, it was easy to get to and plenty quick to get back on the highway.
We enjoyed the beauty of the farm in the background and occasional animal noises. We gazed at the moon and then watched the sun rise the next morning.
The space was more than adequate for our family of six. Our 4 kids slept in the loft while my wife and I shared the main floor bedroom. My kids are already asking when we can go back.
I’d highly recommend Theodore’s place to anyone seeking solitude and serenity of country living."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Theodore was a very gracious host! I’m so sorry we didn’t get to meet him and his family. I wish I could just stay there longer. I’d like to walk down the country road. It’s the perfect place to snuggle in and read a book. So peaceful and quiet!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was everything it was described as. Very peaceful and a great place to disconnect and enjoy the peace of nature. The kitchen was stocked full of goodies as well as needed staples. It was very obvious they want their guests to feel welcome and like family. Highly recommend if you are looking for a cozy, quiet getaway to unwind and relax."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful and far exceeded expectations! The entire place was very clean and organized. What stood out most was extra mile this family went to provide food in kitchen! Bacon, yogurts orange juice, and well stocked pantry. Our kids enjoyed the upstairs area including the books and toys that were nicely arranged. The upstairs was a little hot by the evening but we cracked a window and slept just fine. Beds were very comfortable. The host is very responsive and helpful.
We will definitely be staying here again if it works out with our schedule as we pass through South Dakota. What nice, peaceful place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of kind unique cottage. Once you walk in you are pleasantly surprised. Theodore wife left us fresh farm eggs and freshly cooked scones. Would recommend to anyone what a peaceful return on small farm. Lots of animals to watch as well.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Theodore & Kara were wonderful hosts. They both went above and beyond, which I myself, appreciated immensely. The house was built with love and craftsmanship. It is absolutely beautiful. We are in Mitchell at least once a year and plan to stay if it is available. Thank you to you both for a fantastic stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home with everything my family could have needed. We stayed at Theodore’s for a night while driving cross country and we will definitely stay again if the opportunity presents itself. Theodore was very responsive and proactive with messaging. The kitchen was well stocked, including milk, coffee, eggs, frozen pizza, and fresh cookies (thank you, Theodore!!), which was a really wonderful and unexpected surprise.
The bed (downstairs queen) was very comfortable. It’s not the most giant space, but it was very comfortable, had everything we needed (and more!), and we felt right at home.
We arrived after dark, but the sunrise was spectacular."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Charming, freshly designed, cottage in rural South Dakota provided a convenient stop over while traveling across the state.

It was much better than the photos could capture. The place was huge, yet still cozy and comfortable. It was wonderfully open and welcoming. We were beyond pleased with everything! Our questions were very quickly and thoroughly answered when we had a few questions. Very quick response and helpful! This place is phenomenal and just perfect! It exceeded our expectations and made our reception very memorable."

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We, a work team of 7, stayed here during a farm show in Mitchell. It’s a large, open, clean space as pictured. The downtown location doesn’t have on location parking but about half a block away there’s a parking lot available. We loved the well-stocked kitchen, ample areas of hang out spaces and overall feel of the loft. We highly preferred this over staying in hotels in Mitchell and definitely will return."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay with a great host! Very kind.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came from Omaha for a show choir event. The location was easy to find off the interstate but only 3 miles to the school. George & Mrs. Schultz were amazing. It was so peaceful and the neighbor to the south and their dog were so welcoming.
I am a clean freak and this place was spotless, as was the hot tub! We really loved the space and can’t wait to come back again when it is warmer and picnic out back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"this home was amazing. Of all Airbnbs I have stayed in, this is by far the most upscale home I have had the pleasure staying in. totally understand the rules. personally if this was my home, it is to beautiful to be an Airbnb!
thanks George for hosting our family!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Home ! Very spacious . Lots of amenities including extra towels, blankets , shampoo and body wash in every bathroom , extra toilet paper, coffee , laundry soap . Spotlessly clean .

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay. The house was absolutely gorgeous and there were games and puzzles and workout equipment and a hot tub.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful. Had tons of space.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,George has an awesome place. We were able to relax and enjoy every moment there. He checked on us constantly and responded like a best friends text. We have already decided to book for next year. Why haven’t we found this place first is the question that goes through my mind. We’ve been coming to Mitchell for 20+ years and staying in a hotel. No more. We would love to make it our home away from home if it comes up for sale. If you are thinking of spending some time in this area than it doesn’t get any better then this place in this little piece of heaven. We will be back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No issues, clean place, pretty views. TV did not work upon arrival, but i was able to reconnect everything. Wifi was good, house is large and spacious. George reached out to check on us. Will definitely return if he will have us again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Another great stay at this home. This time a group of old classmates for a reunion. We all commented on how well we slept in the comfy beds and just such a comfortable place to hang out to visit. And so close to everything!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Easy entry access. Lots of parking. Gorgeous and peaceful surroundings. House had great beds that were comfortable. Bathrooms were fully furnished with soap, shampoo and toiletries. Kitchen was complete with pots, pans, silverware, cooking utensils, coffee cups and coffee maker. The only thing missing in the kitchen was a spatula to flip eggs. The sauna room was fully equipped with towels and water bottles. There was a bbq that we thought was a Blackstone but it wasn’t a Blackstone and it was locked which was a bummer. All in all it was a fantastic comfortable lovely home!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"George’s property is beautiful. The home is gorgeous, and it is a comfortable location from Mitchell. Our stay was a little different - the air conditioner didn’t work during high heat outdoor temperatures. George and his team were on-site almost immediately to diagnose the issue. Since it was a holiday weekend, there was not much that could be done (local repairmen were understandably unavailable). Our group had to relocate to a hotel, but George made sure Airbnb made us whole. I would absolutely stay at George’s house again, and I would recommend it to anyone."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for a family or large group. George was very accommodating. We loved the screened in deck and the great view of the James River.
George checked to make sure we had everything we needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful house set in beautiful surroundings, and the view overlooking the extended lush lawn and the James River, very relaxing. The location just outside of town was perfect! The house is spacious and so accommodating. We grilled every evening meal outside and enjoyed the views. We were there on a work trip, so after working out in the elements all day this was a wonderful place to 'come home to' each evening. George, is an exceptional host! George checked in with me at check-in and during the stay to make sure all was good. He went over and beyond with service. We will be returning to this area next year and hoping that we will be able to stay here again! Expectational place to stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is in a beautiful setting , surrounded by large green yards and overlooking the river. The house is very large, 4 floors, and has a lot of ways to enjoy the setting from the bottom level open patio with fire pit, to the upper level screened porch. George was very communicative and flexible."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,George was so wonderful to work with. The property is beautiful! I will 100 % use this place again. My kids LOVED it also. very peaceful area just outside of town. Thanks again George it was perfect for us.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wedding we were going to nearby. It was a great home, great location. Fit all 8 of us easily with room to spare. The hot tub was excellent. I would love to go again. Next time, even stay longer. We did not get a chance to explore or relax too much in the home, with the wedding, so hopefully soon we will get to do that. George had minimal requirements at checkout. sometimes, it feels like you have to clean the place yourself. all we needed to do was empty trashes, gather towels, and clean out the fridge. Our host was very responsive and quick to get back with any questions or concerns."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"George was very responsive even checking to insure everything was fine. Home was beautifully decorated, lots of touches like Bibles in each bedroom dresser. Enjoyed our stay. Our one suggestion is rails are needed especially for front door. Again we enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Went to Mitchell SD to attend a wedding in Alexandria. So location was perfect! There were 6 of us so plenty of space and LOTS of amenities. We used as many as we could.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is set up as a pheasant hunting lodge and has about any combination of bedding you could want or need. We 4 silver-haired old ladies in our late 70s and early 80s just don't want to have to sleep with anyone, so the 2 bedrooms with 2 twin beds each were perfect for us and no one slept in the 3rd bedroom that had, I think, a queen bed. It was nice, as well, 2 have 2 bathrooms on the main floor (one of which was 2 steps down from the kitchen into the back laundry area. All was perfect for us, and the kitchen was VERY WELL FURNISHED with about every appliance, spice, dishes you could ever want. About 1/4 mile from the owner's parents who came to check on us when we had a little difficulty connecting to the internet.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There are no words to describe this setting as they have all been used before.
Such a peaceful place - it just feels like home the second you step into it. It had everything we needed, the house is so soundproof that we didn’t even hear all the thunder from the storm. We haven’t seen one for years - it was like a bonus. We will be booking another stay here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful stay for our family. It was a perfect stopover for us on our way from eastern WI to the Badlands.
A ton of room, incredibly quiet rural setting where we played frisbee and moo’d at the local cows.
Our son loved the map guestbook and old barn."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It did not take long for us to make ourselves right at home at Jennifer's! It was the perfect place for what we needed. We met up with my sister & her family here for an overnight rest before heading off for a trip through the Badlands. The location was convenient & easy to find. Easy check in, tons of space! 7 beds in the basement we didn't even need to touch... between the the 3 bedrooms, pull out couch & chair, all 8 of us enjoyed a good night's rest upstairs. The pool table was a hit. The place is well suited for groups and caters to hunters. We felt welcome and had no questions or concerns about anything. I appreciated Jennifer's proactive communication. Comfortable place to stay and a really great place for us to meet up to kick off a fun vacation. Very grateful for the many wonderful memories that started at Jennifer's place!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an awesome place! Lots of open land, big skies, tons of room inside the house, plenty of parking with wrap around driveway and even fun stuff like a foos ball and pool table. Wish we could’ve stayed longer and did some hunting, but it was perfect for what we needed! And to be able to have our dog’s crates in the garage was a total bonus! All around very pleased!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this lovely home as part of our journey across country. Jen’s place was perfect. SO big, it was just my hubby and I plus our two dogs and we could have fit 10 more people very easily! The home itself is off the main street driving into town which was nice. The yard is huge, not fenced, but we honestly we only saw a couple of cars pass by the house they entire time we there so it didn’t matter with the dogs. There is also a little cafe close by, 281 cafe, that’s wonderful: great fried chicken and shakes!!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You will not be disappointed.
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jennifer is wonderful!:) Nothing to be disappointed by, beautiful nature view, wonderful communication, friendly and kind hearted people and cozy and relaxing."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,is just perfect
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here after a full day of driving cross-country for a move. The location was quiet and secluded despite being just a short drive from the interstate. There were plenty of beds in addition to large rooms and spacious backyard to get together and hang out. I’ll be sure to keep this place in mind if we are ever in the area again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy and comfortable house. Peaceful setting, well equipped home, highly recommend!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We made a brief stop at Matt’s place on our way through the area. It was clean, comfortable and just what we needed for the night. Although we were not on a hunting trip, I think this would be a perfect stay for a pheasant trip, with plenty of room for hunters! Everything was well stocked and we had everything we needed. Thanks Matt!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You won’t be disappointed while staying here.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s enough capacity for even big family. We were so relaxed during staying here.
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot! Its very much a farm house but conveniently located.
There were just two of us and our dogs, but there would have been room for 10 more! Great value for all of that space! The grounds were kept nice and our dogs loved running in the yard and down the road to see the cows.
Unfortunately we were too tired from our long drive to enjoy the game room downstairs, but looks like fun!
Incase you didn’t notice in the listing, dogs have to stay downstairs. And there isn’t a fenced yard, but the house sits back on a road that is pretty far from the highway, so there’s plenty of room for them to roam.
Would recommend this place to anyone! It’s not fancy, but comfy. Would be a perfect spot for a hunting group or a small family reunion."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matt’s place is great! I would recommend this place to anyone. Lots of nice touches and plenty of room.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was amazing for our group lots of beds lots of pots and pans lots of privacy we were able to have a walk-through for a football team in the field I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a group gathering and have some alone time
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great pit stop for our family vacation. Absolutely love the place. Will definitely stay again if we come back through this way. The place was clean as can be. They are in the process of installing central air but they had portable ACs that kept the house more than cool on 95 + degree day
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Plenty of space and very clean! Beautiful property, and the bed was super comfy. Highly recommend!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful farm setting.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and great people to rent from!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stop while traveling through South Dakota!!
Matt provides a wonderful home for both short-term and long-term stays. The house is fully stocked with essential amenities plus more!!
The WiFi did not work, but that was OK with us because we were finally able to get a good night’s rest and have a relaxing morning over a delicious pot of coffee.
The property is huge (dogs will love it). Be careful if you are arriving at night as the street sign where you turn right is not that visible in the dark.
This was true county living. :)"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matt’s place is a great stopover if you are traveling through South Dakota, as I was. The place is remote, which means I didn’t have a cell signal, and that was fine with me. The check-in was a snap, and the kitchen had everything needed to make the stay easy. The place was convenient from the I-90 and was easy to find. Recommend for a quick stop!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stopover on our cross country trip. Very quiet and peaceful.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Definitely a hunting lodge during the pheasant season, and worked great for us out-of-season. We had a retreat here because our conference went virtual due to COVID. Great space, convenient location, kitchen with everything we needed, comfy sleeping spaces, and more than we could have asked for! TV and internet worked great. Hostess stopped by just to check in and dropped off cookies which was so nice! Gave us recommendations on a pizza place nearby that was delicious (Outback in Plankinton). We played games, had a fire, and just enjoyed country living for a week! Highly recommend and we plan to be back if we ever need a place to host another small group gathering!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved everything about the house and surrounding area. Huge yard, the house is bigger than it looks in pictures, the downstairs is such a fun area to play foosball and pool or just hang out and visit, the kitchen has anything you need to make a homemade dinner, the rooms are nice and everything is just placed so well throughout the house! It gave us that feeling of home! We are a Midwest family and when I think Midwest lifestyle this home fits it to a T! The only pain point we had experienced was it did get pretty warm in there in the later afternoon/evening, but it was in the high 90's outside. However, they do supply you with plenty of fans and there were 3 AC units upstairs to try and keep it cool. It was bearable for all the adults, but we had an infant and the heat really got to him and it took a long time for him to fall asleep comfortably. But again it was very hot outside and we did have quite a few people in the house! Such a great experience though and we will totally be coming back! If you are looking for that country lifestyle experience this is definitely the place for you! Thanks again Matt!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location for a stay on the way to the Badlands. Matt is a great host and made check in easy.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,A
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to settle down for the night or many nights! Good for a small to medium size group with pool table, foosball table, poker table. The air con is floor units so if it's 70 or above at night, it might get a little warm. It's a great place though and the rest of the year air con isn't needed here."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A safe and secluded place right where we needed it! There are no other homes around and that privacy was welcome. There aren’t any other Airbnb’s around this location either. Glad to have found it. We played a lot of foosball and even got to watch a thunderstorm roll on. Matt was a wonderful host. Thank you.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed at Matt's place for one night during our Trip to Badlands/Rushmore. It is located only 10 minutes off the I-90 highway in a quiet area surrounded by greenery. The place was very clean and had great amenities like Poker Table, Pool Table, Foosball Table if you are visiting with friends. There was a large living room, and the kitchen had all the needed things. We had a very comfortable stay. I would totally recommend it."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a place that allowed safe travel during the coronavirus pandemic while traveling with our dog. This place was perfect - we especially enjoyed the beautiful sunrise in the morning. Thanks to Matt, who answered all questions quickly!"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked Matt's a few hours before showing up after deciding we wanted to push a little further into our cross country trip.

2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was clean and quiet. There were several things to do including a poker table, a pool table and foosball. The house was very roomy and had 2 large screen TV’s. All the amenities were furnished which was great."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Place was easy to find but run down and not worth the price in my opinion. Old scratchy linens, brown water from faucets and unpainted scratched walls. Just not on par with other places."

The home is small, but extremely clean and comfortable. We had my husband, myself, our two young adult children, a teenager and two small dogs. The kitchen amenities allowed me to cook a home cooked meal or two while we were there. We like to stay here when visiting our son who is attending school in Mitchell. It is a perfect location to be able to go back and forth to Mitchell or Sioux Falls. This time we headed north to DeSmet and visited the home of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Thank you Rebecca for providing a nice little getaway location so this momma could check on her boy. We are incredibly appreciative."

It was warm and inviting and our dogs loved it too. It’s in a really great part of the town, close to the ball fields and walkable to anywhere one would want to go.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was a pleasant surprise. It’s a smaller older home, but you can tell they bathroom has been completely updated, and the kitchen floor was updated. The rest of the home was original wood floors that have their noise but again older home. It was so worth the money though compare to the prices in Mitchell. It fit all of our needs for a quick over night stay on our way to the black hills. We will definitely consider staying again."

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rebecca was an excellent host- very responsive and helpful. She left clear instructions on how to get into the house and was very friendly in all of her communications. The property was a bit further off of the highway than anticipated and a bit more dated than was reflected in the pictures. All in all, the place felt fairly clean, other than the ant issue (which was probably due to the time of season) and we saw a pretty large spider. The neighborhood was quiet and felt pretty safe, however, the back door had a trash bag strung across the window. All in all, the house was sufficient for a one night stay as we crossed South Dakota."

Kitchen seemed to be well-stocked, but we didn’t use it much, except to make coffee and quick breakfasts on our way out. Living room was cozy, and we were able to relax and watch a show together in the evenings, since we were able to log into our streaming apps easily on the TV’s Roku. Laundry room is a nice touch for longer stays, or just to wash anything that may have piled up from your travels.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great home base for a crazy wedding weekend in Mitchell. It has all the amenities and necessities in a cozy space. The only downside was sharing the building with other apartment residents. Our one year old son still has trouble sleeping through the night, and it was stressful to think about his crying bothering our neighbors (although we would have had the same issue at a hotel). Overall, we were so grateful for a safe, private home away from home."

I will go as far to say that this home will remind you that you are important and loved:-)

It had everything I needed to feel at home and the laundry in the building was a plus after being on the road for a week. Mitchell is a nice enough town, small but enough to do and food and stores are conveniently close by. I felt safe. The road is a bit noisy which I didn't mind too much because I'm from a city but if that's not your jam, bring ear plugs! Would stay again if I found myself back in Mitchell."

We were in town visiting old friends and just needed a place to lay our heads. This place was very clean and the air conditioner worked GREAT! We had some hot days in early July in South Dakota and the AC was a huge plus! If you're interested in the Corn Palace, you are super close. You can see the back of the Corn Palace from the front porch. I highly recommend taking a short walk to a coffee place/bakery called Michelle's Mad Batter. I got a great cup of joe and some breakfast sandwiches there. If I wasn't watching my caloric intake all the time, I would have definitely tried the macaroons and the chocolate-dipped peanut butter cookies. Very friendly staff. Loved Stacey's little touches-- the granola bars especially. Cute little place!"

We just needed a place to sleep for the night so we didn’t explore our surroundings that much. But I would highly recommend this cottage. I think there would be plenty of room for 4 maybe 5 people comfortably. Every comfortable sleeping arrangements even the pullout cough, my daughter had no complaints. They had way more to offer then what I would need while traveling. And A1 spotless clean, everything in the place was very nice. Super nice host, responded very quickly to my questions. I would definitely stay here again when I’m in Mitchell, I’m glad I found it.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable and clean! Great spot near downtown, right behind the Corn Palace. Homey extras like coffee, bottled water and granola bars. Only concern is that the air flows pretty quickly through the ductwork, and is a little noisy in the bedroom. Otherwise, Stacey's place worked out great for us!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was clean, comfortable and a convenient location."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You won’t find a better place to stay than the Corn Palace Cottage - it’s the type of place that encourages me to continue booking AirBnbs rather than a more traditional hotel. Everything was perfectly arranged, with so many thoughtful touches. When we experienced a little issue, Stacey went out of her way to help us figure it out. She is literally the perfect host.
As a bonus: the location is absolutely perfect! We could walk to the Corn Palace (in fact, you can even see it from the front door!) and there are so many other local options for meals/coffee."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was so comfortable and serene. Close to all the fun downtown. My mom can't walk up stairs well, and she needs to take oxygen when she exerts herself so being right downtown meant she was able to sightsee in small doses and she loved it. I will definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay with thoughtful touches.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was really pretty with a rustic feel. Everything was super squared away & Stacy also provided recommendations for eating and entertainment. She even had radio stations for the radio she had in the kitchen. 10/10 recommend phenomenal experience

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for couple nights on the way to black hills from Milwaukee. place is just next to the corn palace which is one of kind and must to do if in or passing by through Mitchell. Place was clean and welcoming. Kitchen and bathroom had everything that we needed.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this home! So clean and lovely furnishings. The bedroom was wonderful and even the pullout was reasonably comfortable. Great selection of keurig coffee. Thanks. Right across the street from the Corn Palace. It was good to read the book about the Corn Palace as I have to admit I’d never heard of it. We did go and have a look around and I’m glad we did. So impressive.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Were the corn palace jelly and popcorn complimentary?
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, clean, well-cared for, and updated accommodations in a safe neighborhood right across the street from The Corn Palace. Conveniently located within minutes of the Interstate, tourist attractions and restaurants are within in easy walking distance of the apartment."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stacey's place was so clean and roomy that I wished I wasn't just passing through and could have stayed longer. I loved the kitchen, it was so cute! I am allergic to many foods so I travel with a lot of food, and I loved having a good sized refrigerator. The house had everything I needed including an iron and ironing mat. Stacey responded promptly to messages I sent. I would definitely stay here again!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This cottage had an awesome location to be able to see the corn palace. The lights at night were very pretty. It was nice to be able to walk there and walk home. It was a very cozy and comfortable place to spend a night. Anything you needed was provided. I appreciate Stacey allowing us to book last minute!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spent a night there on our way across South Dakota. The place was very clean and well decorated. The beds and furniture were comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked. It was in what appeared to be a good neighborhood. And, it was right behind the Corn Palace. Stacey suggested taking a look at the Corn Palace at night when it is lit up, and it was really amazing. We enjoyed our stay there."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We liked the location next to the Corn Palace, fun stop on a road trip. It was quiet even though it was near it and by a restaurant/bar. The bed was smaller than expected, not a true queen bed and it was difficult to sleep with two normal sized adults. The shower stall is narrow and has slow water pressure, which made it difficult to get cleaned up. Kitchen was good and well stocked with what we needed."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, Great Staff and Great Atmosphere. We highly recommend. Did not disappoint."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, easy to find. Would stay there again."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, everything was perfect!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you are visiting Mitchell, this is an outstanding value. You can walk to the Corn Palace (its right outside your front door, across the street), downtown a few blocks away. And yet, its a very peaceful location at night."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Walking distance to the palace and restaurants. The house was clean and equipped as listed.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stacey was an amazing host and responded quickly to questions. Check in was clear and easy. She was very accommodating which made my stay that much better.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exceeded all our expectations. Amazingly clean; lots of nice little touches (even robes!), nicely decorated, etc. Lovely place.
My one piece of advice for renters is to make a note of the door code when you get your check in instructions. We didn’t, as we didn’t realize that those instructions only show up once on the app. So we couldn’t lock the door when we went to dinner. Minor issue, though. We would stay at Stacy’s place again. So much nicer than a hotel at around the same price…"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a nice stay in mid South Dakota.
The Corn Palace is right across the street and well worth the stay.
The house is nicely furnished and the central air conditioning was greatly appreciated. Very nice kitchen.
There are two large TV sets and excellent programming.
The house’s décor is all things Corn Palace related and we had great fun looking at the various mementos.
A very relaxing stay on our travels."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Convenient location right by the corn palace. We enjoyed walking over to view the building at night. Handy to have a kitchen with a full fridge where we could re-freeze our ice packs and store all our food.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a perfect stay at this adorable home. Fully stocked and well decorated. Just across the parking lot from the Corn Palace and downtown shopping. Simply an A+ Airbnb.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a good stay at Stacey’s house. We arrived late, and the check in was easy and smooth. The place was very clean and comfortable: it looked like it had previously been an office space, but it has been furnished as a home. We only stayed for one night, but had a comfortable stay nonetheless."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place. Being a historical building, it was very nice. We walked over to Back 40 for a dinner and a beer. 2 thumbs up to both places"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute place to stay and I was sad that we were there only for a night. Right behind the corn palace and Stacey suggested we see the lights at night, which we did and thoroughly enjoyed. Bed and bedding are super comfortable and the kitchen was adequate for our needs. Would love to stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice house that is in a great location. The description of the house in the listing was very accurate.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay, it was very clean and the location was great! The Corn Palace is just across the street, as well as Main Street where there are some restaurants. We highly recommend it!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and very comfy home! Corn Palace night lights were great and visible from the front porch. We were just passing through but I would love to stay a bit longer next time. If it’s open, you must stop at Einstein’s, or worth making an appointment to see all of the retro treasures housed there."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great one bedroom house with comfortable living room and kitchen. Clean, well kept, and nice location. Sleeper sofa accommodates 2 more people and a blow up mattress could accommodate an additional 2 more people (6 total) if you don't mind being a bit crowded. The washer/dryer is an added bonus. I grew up in Mitchell and thought this was a more interesting option than being in one of the motels out near the interstate, and I was right. When I go back to Mitchell, the Corn Palace Cottage will be my first choice."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property is exactly as described and couldn't have been more local or convenient to all of the Mitchell area. Binging right behind the Corn Palace meant all I had to do was step outside the door to see it all lit up at night. Stacey left nice touches like robes and wonderful aromatherapy lotions in the shower room. Hand soaps and sanitizers were nice too! It was just the right size and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in at an airbnb location. So grateful for this cozy little cottage.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As advertised. Sweet little stop
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing place to stay! The house is clean, the beds are comfy, and it’s right behind the corn palace!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay at Stacey's. It was clean and oh so close to the Corn Palace. At Stacey's recommendation we took the walk across the parking lot after darkness had fallen to view and photograph the lights. Stacey was excellent in her communication. Thanks again.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for the price compared to hotels in the area. House was clean and as described. Bed was comfortable and check in was a breeze.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Made a pit stop at Mitchell on our way to Chicago. Stacey’s place was right across the street from the Corn Palace and we got to see the palace lit up for the night. Place was very spacious and comfortable.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stop on your road trip.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute place and literally right behind the Corn Palace. The location would have made it easy to walk to restaurants but we were there on a Sunday and the closer places were closed which meant we had to drive but it was no big deal. We were easily able to walk over to the Corn Palace after dinner so we could see it lit up at night. Definitely a must see if you are there after dark. It is beautiful!! The place had everything we needed and she provides nice shampoo, shower gel and lotions that most places don't. There was a Keurig and Belvitas for a quick breakfast on the go. We would definitely stay here again!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place in a great little town. Stacey was very helpful when I was trying to book on short notice and her place was just what I needed for an overnight stay on my trip out West! Highly recommend!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place. The Corn Palace was a big plus too.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome space near the corn palace! It was quiet and gave us room to spread out after being in the car all day. Would stay again!
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very pleasantly surprised. This location is perfect, although from the outside you don't know quite what to expect. There are some neon signs on the front of the house to advertise two other businesses, so we thought we might be mistaken. Once we opened the door, we realized we weren't.
Beautiful kitchen with full size refrigerator, eating space, really perfect if you want to have meals in. Nice sitting room and bedroom and everything sparkling clean. My only comment was that the mattress was a bit soft. I like a firmer bed in general, so this may not be an issue for others. I would still stay here again. Thank you, Stacey!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Needing a place to spend a night on our way further west, my wife and I spent a lovely night at this house in Mitchell. Diagonally across the street from the Corn Palace, it has the perfect location. And, the house was clean and comfortable. Stacey made everything easy with very clear directions for check-in and -out and was incredibly responsive."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spotless! Great location!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place across the street from the Corn Palace

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey’s place is well maintained, nicely decorated and very clean. Stacey responds quickly to inquiries and the pull out couch in the living room was surprisingly comfortable. A huge plus is it is across the street from the Corn Palace!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey’s place is a comfortable, super clean, and convenient spot off 90. It does feel a bit like an office (as it is), but Stacey has done a good job of making it homey (using the floor or table lamps help). We didn’t have time to see the inside of the corn palace but it was quite lit up when we arrived in the evening. We would return for sure!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and comfortable location close to I-90 for long car trips. Also a hoot to see the Corn Palace.

We love it when we can walk places from where we stay."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great location to all the highlights that Mitchell has to offer. We had a great time!! Thank You Stacey!!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything you need and more! So comfortable and had everything can think of needing alone with things you usually forget. Washer/dryer were a huge plus since our original travel plans were taking longer than what we packed for. We only stayed one night passing through but we wished we had time to stay a few days just to enjoy the house longer. Get this instead of any hotel if you plan to come for a concert or event at the Corn Palace. Stacey is very considerate and fast to respond. Great hostess!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice and clean place
2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will LOVE how close this place is to the world-famous corn palace! It’s a very warm and welcoming house, right off Main Street and all the eatery/shops. We were there during the installment of the 2020 corn palace art and the artist/workers were super interesting to watch. The house from the outside looks like a business establishment, but it’s super comfortable and warm inside. Four thumbs up!!!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,She’s amazing! I would definitely stay with her again!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We checked in late as we were driving from Michigan to Wyoming and weren't 100% where wed end up stopping for the night. Stacey's place was the perfect stop. So cute and clean. Right downtown , we were able to walk down to the restaurant and eat. I loved that she had a hot plate and a Keurig, and as luck would have it she also had my favorite brand of k cups. Doesnt get much better than that. If we ever make travel back that way I would definitely stay again"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, super modern, perfectly located and everything was in order for a pleasant stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband, our dogs, and I loved staying at Stacey's place in downtown Mitchell, South Dakota. It was a one-night stop on our way to Rapid City and Hot Springs from southeastern Wisconsin, and this was the perfect location; also easy to find across from the Corn Palace! Neat and cozy vintage home, decorated very charmingly with some great amenities: robes, keurig coffee, Belvita snacks, and more. The bedroom was very spacious to put the dog crates and our stuff. No yard for dogs, however, there is a cute teeny grassy dog park next to the Corn Palace with bags and trash cans. There may be other parks to walk to, but at night the palace and area is lit up so seems safer. Stacey was easily available to communicate with before and during the visit. The whole experience was great! Actually wish we had more time to explore the area on our journey."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Not too much city noise while sleeping.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stacey's place is great in every way. She has thought of everything. Her towels are top notch and her decor is modern with Corn Palace themed knickknacks. She is readily available by email and her check in was a breeze. The Corn Palace lit up at night was a highlight. She is centrally located. I love hosts like Stacey who care about their guests beyond the price of the room. I highly recommend her place.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stay! The location was excellent. We were right downtown and walked to dinner and the Corn Palace.
Stacey’s place was clean with wonderful amenities, she thought of everything. We enjoyed fresh eggs and the kitchen was well equipped for cooking.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect Airbnb! Great location, great hostess , thoughtful touches, great communication , close to sights"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic! Why pay more at a hotel South of the interstate when you can stay down town and walk to ""Crazy about Cupcakes"". Which is what my 14 year old daughter and I did and then walked main Street stopping at the Memorial Park and Ed's Pet World. Of course we went to the Corn Palace. We had family in town and it was nice not to have check into a Hotel etc. Prompt responses and very reasonable. We were able to modify the checkout time to coincide with our church plans so that was very kind of her. We'll stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The townhouse was just what we needed for our gathering, and the space was wonderful! Destiny responded to our heat problem quickly, and it was taken care of by a friendly HVAC tech, even late into the evening!
In that a few things ( accents etc) are dated and not in good repair, the furnishings were good. The cookware was NOT good - very old and rusty, but we left a note for them to be replaced. I would check the cooking utensils for replacement as well. The neighborhood was so very quiet, and the place very soundproof!!
Thank you for the opportunity to use this facility - we will look into it again, as we have family in the area!!"

Upon checkin we noticed one of the bed frames was broken and notified Destiny right away. She responded quickly and offered to have it repaired right away. Since we didn’t need that particular bed- it was a non- issue but just wanted it noted upon our arrival.
The area is very dark at night which was great for sleeping but if you need to walk pets or are outside you may want to bring flashlights etc.
It was a great stay and would definitely stay there again."

,,,Owners have done a ton of work on the interior… it looks fantastic!
,,,"DO NOT STAY HERE! BEWARE! I am not sure if I was misled, but the house and neighbourhood were not as expected. We did not feel safe in the house nor the neighbourhood as the back door was unlocked when we arrived, and there was yelling in the streets around the corner. Also, the pictures do not depict the condition of the house, specifically how old and dirty the kitchen is. It was one of the dingiest places we have been. I did not feel safe cooking let alone eating in there. On top of that, the house smelled of cigarettes. So, we left immediately and did not stay the night. We were not refunded for the stay, and Selena accused us as trying to scam her."
