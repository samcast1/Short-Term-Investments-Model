So you truly felt very private all while being close to so many great downtown features. The inside was very cozy, but spacious all at the same time. We really didn‚Äôt have to reach out to the owner because everything we needed was readily available. They really took care of all the details beforehand. We loved staying here so much that before we left we were already looking at future dates to bring our children back. It was absolutely perfection!

Very close to town.
Laurel does pretty much close down on Sunday's. Some stores were closed on Monday as well. You can pretty much shop the local area in two days. The restaurants have small town hours.
I suggest the pink lemo tour of the homes from the show Home Town during
the summer. You can also rent golf carts in town.
There is a Casino nearby.
Lots to do in Laurel. Perfect trip."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Laurel, MS. was marvelous, in no small part, due to the wonderful AirBnB home that we stayed in while there. Our host was so attentive to our every need. He ensured that the home was perfect. It looked and felt like a brand new upscale home, and like we were the only people who hard ever stayed there. We will always cherish our stay there. The sun room was perfect, with the late afternoon soft sun rays coming thru those beautiful windows. We enjoyed the location, so near downtown attractions. The street location was storybook with the gaslights and the southern oak trees lining the street. So much great architecture in our AirBNB home and the surrounding neighborhood . We loved the stay and the experience."

Our location was perfect for walking to town to shops and restaurants. Staying in a charming bungalow that had recently been completely redone was icing on the cake.
Our host, Stephen, was very communicative before we arrived. Once we were in Laurel we actually met him and he couldn‚Äôt have been more welcoming. The next day he came over and replaced batteries in the door locks after we had texted him and said we were having a little trouble.
Overall our visit to Laurel surpassed expectations!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay. Its proximity to downtown is great. It is truly walking distance to the areas you see on Home Town. A lot of the homes seen on the program and almost every business are just blocks away. There are parks nearby. We loved being within earshot of the trains passing through town, without being so close as to be inconvenienced by them. It was just the little extra icing on the cake that added more of that warm, hometown feel to our visiting experience. Laurel isn't as flat as television would lead you to believe but it is definitely a walkable city center area. Also interesting, traffic circles are all over the downtown area. Only a few traffic signals and most are four-way flashing signals. The traffic, while we were there, was very light and well maintained. We had a wonderful time visiting Laurel and staying in this home definitely added to the experience.
Note: There is an App for everything these days. Download the Visit Laurel Jones County App to your phone."

And other chairs for lounging. Oh did I mention a fenced backyard, & inside were dog beds & food bowls ..made me wish I'd brought my dog!
My friends & I would definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Meg's Air BnB is the best Air BnB we have stayed at in Laurel. This was our 4th trip to this wonderful city. We had our two oldest granddaughters with us and it was the perfect home for all of us. After each day's adventures we came back to the home which offered so many amenities and so much room. We loved this home! Meg and Daniel are the best!!!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As advertised and worth every penny. We had two kids (2&8) who ran around the huge backyard exploring for hours. Several patios/outdoor sitting areas to choose from which was nice. We like to get more space than is really needed when we travel, but this place could easily accommodate another couple/family. Literally a 5-10 minute drive from everything in Laurel. Would highly recommend both house and host, Meg was very responsive and accommodating."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's over the years and Meg's place was among the best of the best. Beautiful home with all the amenities you would expect and then some. The photos in the listing, while nice, do not adequately capture how nice the place really is. On top of all that, her helpful suggestions of things to do and places to go made for the perfect weekend trip to Laurel!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My colleague and I spent a few nights here during our last business trip and absolutely loved it. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in town!

We visit Laurel frequently to visit family and if Megs place is not available we wait until it is rather than stay anywhere else."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Truly beautiful place to stay. Nice fenced in area for the pups! Home was so warm and cozy. Truly did not need to bring anything but clothes and a toothbrush! She thought of everything! Truly wonderful & close to downtown!

Just as described and more. Meg is a Super host. Every little thing was well thought out to last little detail, I mean Everything!

The house feels like home, so well appointed, & beautifully decorated . I could go on & on, but you get the point! Location couldn‚Äôt be better.

We didn't cook meals there, but you certainly could - it was stocked with everything you might need. Beds and pillows are all good quality. Linens and bedding are also all very nice quality. There was also some bottled water and snacks there for us which was a very homey touch!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"A place of beauty... pretty much a perfect arboretum with lots of shade and privacy. The screened in porch, fire pit, and pool are all very accessible and beckoning. Then there is the carefully built and decorated interior with wood and trim detail that unexpectedly catches and pleases the eye at every turn. Very finely renovated bathrooms and thoughtful and immaculate kitchen amenities. Lastly, three comfortable bedrooms set up for good dreams and deep sleep. Restful is probably the best word to describe this place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful communication, great hosts and very cute place"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. We especially loved the screened in porch. It was like being in the treetops with all the birds and squirrels. Very walkable location. Jennifer was a great host. Very responsive and left snacks for us on check-in. I can‚Äôt imagine a better place to stay in Laurel.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect. It was very clean, well equipped and when we asked about an air fryer she provided one. Jennifer was very prompt responding to any questions or needs. The cottage is very comfortable with plenty of space but all the privacy you need and in a wonderfully peaceful neighborhood. It is walkable to downtown Laurel. You could not ask for anything better all around."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This is our second time to stay in this beautiful home. Jennifer is an amazing host and thinks of everything. We would not want to stay anywhere else!

The bed upstairs was so comfortable and the house smelled amazing! I loved how convenient it was to my job and to downtown restaurants! I‚Äôll definitely recommend this to my family when they come to visit me in Laurel!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A+, Five Star, Excellent Host and Location!
The guest house was very comfortable, clean and well stocked . We were only a party of 2 but the layout is great for couples traveling together or a small extended family as it has a separate living area with a kitchenette, sitting area, bedroom and full bath but all within the same house! Great location just a couple blocks from town so you can walk anywhere in town in just a few minutes.
I was dragged on this trip by my wife who‚Äôs a big Home Town fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Being a history fan, there was a lot more to this sleepy little town than I knew and it was great to learn how Laurel came to be what it was in its hay day.
If you‚Äôre a fan of a comfortable, quiet and relaxing vacation and want to do nothing, it‚Äôs a great place for you too!
I would highly recommend Jennifer‚Äôs place whether you‚Äôre a Home Town fan or not!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The host, Jennifer, was very responsive to our inquiry/questions. We met her husband, John, when we arrived and had a nice conversation w/ him and got some local recommendations.
There were many things we liked about this cottage, especially the ‚Äòsplit‚Äô layout of the home, since we were traveling with another couple, and the close proximity to town. We enjoyed the screened-in porch and large deck above the carport - it was quiet and peaceful with lots of pretty birds. We also appreciated the basket of snacks, bottled waters and coffee. It was evident that the host put a lot of thought into making sure we had what we needed. Due to the cooler temps, we unfortunately weren't able to enjoy the pool or bicycles, but they are a nice amenity. Overall, we would recommend staying here."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful time and great place and host.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer‚Äôs Cottage is so cozy and in the perfect location! It‚Äôs very well decorated, comfortable beds, clean bathrooms. The screened in patio is such a nice touch. Highly recommend that you stay her for your next trip to Laurel."

Plenty of space, wonderful decorating style, some snacks in the kitchen - Jenny's Cottage had it all."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have found the hidden gem of AirBnB's in historic downtown Laurel! This cottage exceeded all of our expectations: it was immaculately clean and very well appointed, it provided everything we could possibly need during our stay (including umbrellas!), and was a private and quiet oasis. It is decorated like the nicest interior design magainze and the outdoor porch space was very comfortable and inviting. Within walking distance to many points of interest and restaurants, this location also has ample private parking close to the cottage. Our host, Jennifer, was very responsive and communicative, and went out of her way to be friendly and make us feel welcome. We hope to stay here again the next time we are visiting Laurel and I have recommended this location to friends and family without hesitation."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My BFF and I made a girls trip to Laurel for a few days. The house was perfect for this. She had her own space downstairs and I had my own upstairs. The location felt private and safe. It was so close to everything downtown. Jennifer gave lots of ideas on what to do and where to eat while in town. There was an issue with the upstairs toilet that took a couple of tries to resolve, but Jennifer was quick to respond and get it taken care of. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place!! It was a perfect girl‚Äôs weekend getaway and so close to downtown

I would recommend Jennifer‚Äôs cottage to anyone!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booked originally for a girls trip, plans changed due to a medical emergency within the group. Host was unwilling to move stay to another weekend as it was short notice (the day before booking) , so one of the ladies who lived local chose to keep the weekend and take her kids instead. Was clean and well kept. The pool is shared with their home and they are doing construction to covert to a BNB so there was obvious construction activity during the stay. Their daughter did ask to swim with her kids, which was no biggie for the one staying and her kids but may be awkward for those who do not want to ‚Äúshare‚Äù with folks who aren‚Äôt guests. There were no real complaints just ‚Äúheads up‚Äù type things.
Hostess was polite and and easy to communicate with."

Everything we might need had been thought about. The air was cool when we came in which was very thoughtful during the summer. There were snacks but also popsicles in the freezer! Every room has an umbrella in the closet and throws for curling up on the couch. The screened porch is great for mornings and early evenings. There were pool towels in every closet and we enjoyed getting in the pool. We had a fabulous time at Jenny‚Äôs Cottage.

The home was spotless and filled with small touches to make the stay memorable. We were fortunate enough to stay in the new Jenny‚Äôs Downtown Hideaway located in front of Jenny‚Äôs Cottage. The home is full of antiques, soothing colors, fresh crisp linens, and comfortable beds. The bathrooms were tiled, tubs were sculptured free standing, and each of us had our own bed and bath. The suite had an attached 4 season type porch where we spent lots of our time in the swinging bed and comfortable chairs.

She‚Äôs an excellent host and quick to respond. The place was spotless and well decorated. It is a walk to town which was great also. Wish we could have stayed longer !"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a little mixup finding Jenny"" Cottage due to us thinking we knew where we were going instead of reading the directions. Thanks for coming to our rescue and getting us on the right track. We rented this place for two couples in town for our daughter's wedding. They loved the house and the neighborhood. If you like neat little cottages you will love her place. Jennifer offered many helpful trips. Unfortunately, our friends had a full weekend of wedding activities and did not get to enjoy all that was offered. They have been before and they will be back."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenny‚Äôs Cottage was a wonderful experience!!! Charming and larger than it appears. Very clean and well-stocked with pots, dishes and everything else you may need.
The fire pit was perfect and the pool is beautiful (too late in the season to use, but we spent a fun evening sitting poolside).
If there were a daybed on the screen porch, I would‚Äôve slept out there all three nights. The wood deck is huge. And bikes are provided for riding around the beautiful neighborhood.
One of the best things is that it‚Äôs set back from the road to a tree line that makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a cabin in the woods. That was totally unexpected, and we loved it!
My sister and I can‚Äôt wait to be back! She and my brother-in-law met and spoke with one of the owners, and he‚Äôs super nice and friendly.
Thanks so much for sharing such a special place!"

The home is located on the back of the lot. The larger home in the front is under renovation. When we were there, the driveway was very muddy. Once you passed the home in the front the driveway is concrete. Nothing that can't be washed off your vehicle--just heads up."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jennys cottage is a beautifully decorated and well stocked property in Laurel MS. Jennifer and John have been the absolute best to help anytime something is requested. The porches (both screened porch and open-covered porch) has been so enjoyable to relax and work from!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience than we did at Jennifer‚Äôs Cottage. It was sparking clean and beautifully decorated. So many extra touches such as a basket full of yummy snacks with a welcome note on the counter and drinks in the refrigerator. The beds were very comfortable, and although we didn‚Äôt have time for the pool, it would have been great for such two such hot days. The cottage is behind a beautiful home which John and Jennifer are turning into a B and B. A bonus was to spend time with them and hear their story. They were just as welcoming and friendly as could be‚Äî Southern hospitality at it‚Äôs best.
Would absolutely stay there again."

We were there with a total of six people and had no problem maneuvering around. The beds are very comfy. Easy to share Jack and Jill bath. The only problem was no handrails on steps for kitchen entry from outside. Hopefully we'll be back to enjoy it!! Rex, Janie, Dick, De and Trace, Linda"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in ‚ÄúThe Adams‚Äù home while visiting Laurel and exploring many attractions as shown on Home Town! The house was just as described.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! I can't believe we found this place for a couple of nights. Loved our stay here! It was a fun two nights and a long day of touring around Laurel in between. The evenings found us back at the Adam's House sitting out back with fire going and watching the fireflies sparkle in the trees! And to end the day the bed was very comfortable making it hard to get moving each morning.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Jennifer‚Äôs place was just what we expected from the pictures and reviews. Great communication. Everything was smooth and easy. The fact the home was featured on HGTV‚Äôs Hometown is a plus! Definitely a nice place and close to all the places you‚Äôd want to see!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were celebrating our 50th anniversary and enjoyed every minute! One of our granddaughters and her family joined us and just added to the fun. The house is adorable and very well equipped. Jennifer was a great hostess and very communicative. Thanks so much for a great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Jennifer‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt have been better. Aside from the house being lovely, clean and well-equipped, she put out some Christmas decorations giving it a real touch of home. The location was private yet just a short drive to downtown, grocery stores, etc. Laurel was a special place to spend the holiday and I would highly recommend Jennifer‚Äôs home to anyone visiting the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful kitchen and gorgeous outdoor setting
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Laurel and come every year for my momma‚Äôs birthday weekend. We always tried to find a house that was featured on Home Town. This was our favorite so far. Beautiful, clean, comfy beds, great amenities‚Ä¶ We were more than pleased! Two days just wasn‚Äôt enough‚Ä¶"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location close to the historic district. For a fan of ""Home Town"" it was exciting to stay in a house that was actually on the show. It was fun to see which pieces of furniture and art work shown on the reveal is still in the home.
The kitchen is well stocked including some basic pantry items. Thoughtful touches were the snacks and coffee and tea station.
Very comfortable living room to relax in after a day of shopping.
We would stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for our group! We loved sitting outside by the outdoor fireplace. Kitchen was gorgeous! Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great in every way .
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the Adams‚Äô House. It was perfect for our mother/daughter weekend trip. The house was very clean and had extras to ease our stay. The location is a quick drive to downtown Laurel and also to other convenient locations (groceries stores, fast food, etc). We highly recommend and would definitely stay here again if we return to Laurel."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Sister & I had an awesome time at Jennifer‚Äôs home & in Laurel! Kitchen had everything we needed, beds were super comfy, plenty of room, overall & we loved sitting by the fire in the fireplace in back yard! The fact that there was already wood there for our use was awesome! I Definitely recommend The Adams House!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time here. Very comfortable home with lovely park in walking distance for dogs. Nice fenced in yard was great to have with dogs as well. Enjoyed our time in Laurel, cute town with incredibly sweet people."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was beautiful and felt like home. They had everything you could possibly need. Very peaceful and quiet every night we were there. Will definitely be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer's place was just as described... clean, beautifully decorated and great location close to downtown. Our only complaint, which we related to Jennifer, was that since both bathrooms have bathtubs that you have to step over to use the shower there needed to be a tub mat or grab bar. The bottom of both tubs were very slippery with nothing nearby to hold onto while getting in and out which is pretty scary for us older people. We would definitely stay here again when in the Laurel area."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer absolutely made it easy to reserve the air bnb. She was very welcoming and inviting in the messages back and forth. She gave very clear information to access the home. We all enjoyed the place. Plenty of room in the house, the kitchen was definitely a major focal point for us. We spent plenty of time hanging out and laughing in the kitchen. Loved the layout of the place. Only critique we would have is maybe adding a nonslip mat or some shower floor adhesive to the bottom of the tubs. We all almost fell the first time we each got into our showers. But after we realized how slick the tubs were we were very careful. Other than that the place was magnificent and a wonderful get away and place to stay while we were in Mississippi for our friends wedding."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Two couples: had plenty of room. Large bedrooms, gorgeous kitchen, comfortable living room and beautifully decorated. We felt we were in a typical old southern home. The location is perfect for visiting the town and seeing all the sites. Everything that we needed was in the house. We would book again!"
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"We were excited to stay in a home that was renovated on the show Home Town. It was just like the pictures and not to far from downtown Laurel. The only cons of this property was the state of the drive way & the back yard. The weather was nice enough to sit outside but it was a mess leaves everywhere, something a blower could have corrected. More towels could have been left in the bathrooms so you wouldn‚Äôt have to wash every night and the bath tubs will have to be reglazed soon. There is only one tv at this property, which was disappointing to my sister who wanted to relax in the bedroom and watch her tv shows. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would book again on another short trip to Laurel."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Jennifer‚Äôs house! The house was clean, quiet, and in the perfect location to visit Laurel. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Needs a very good cleaning inside, in cabinets also.
Outside is over grown and can hardly get suv in drive without damaging it. We had to clean outside setting area before we could use it leaves very thick everywhere
Not enough towels wash clothes paper towels toilet paper.
Not stock well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As an HGTV ""Home Town"" fan this is the perfect home to stay in. It looks just like the pictures from the TV Episode. Although the bedrooms weren't shown on the TV show-the beds are comfortable and the rooms nicely decorated. This is the place to stay for a Girls trip to Laurel-you won't be disappointed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We met great friends from college who are considering relocation to Laurel. We also enjoy Hometown and wanted first hand experiences around that! The Adams house gave us all that and more! We had a very delightful stay in Laurel! Thank you for making this sweet home available.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came in for a Rural America conference and decided to stay at this house, and it was the perfect location to retreat at the end of the day and start our mornings with coffee outside. Would highly recommend. Jennifer was very responsive and friendly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here. The place was cute & clean. Our host was great, very responsive & helpful."

Near local restaurants and the highway.
Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Where do I start with a glowing review? For us the house was in a perfect location to downtown Laurel and Walmart. The house sits back from the road so no traffic noise and perfect backyard. Our dog loved the fenced in yard that was big enough to run around. The house was bigger than it looks. Three large bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I would highly recommend The Adams House and Jennifer answered all my questions. I would stay again if we come back!!
Karen, Max and our dog Madden"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had the best time. The house was perfect! Everything was so clean. Jennifer was a great host, and I would highly recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,felt like being at home !!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying at the Adam's home. The kitchen was well equipped and we loved making pancakes on the griddle. The living room was perfect for movie nights - we especially loved the basket of blankets. The bathrooms need updating, but they were clean and well stocked with essentials."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Adams house was very comfortable and inviting!! We loved being able to stay in a ""Hometown"" house. We snapped our pictures next to Erin's house painting hung nicely on the wall. The living room and dining area gave us great space to visit and relax. We had soft blankets to snuggle on the couch. There were board games for the kids to play. The bedrooms were extremely comfortable with extra pillows if needed. The kitchen is fantastic! We loved seeing the details as is on the Hometown show. The large island was critical for our last night of lots of leftovers!! ü§£ We loved the location, just a short (less than 5 minutes) drive into downtown. We enjoyed all the shops & local places to eat. Pearls was our favorite lunch spot.
Our host, Jennifer, was attentive and helpful for any questions or concerns we had. We really appreciated her! Check-in and check-out instructions were clear. House procedures were easy to follow.
We had a great stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Adams house was a great stay for our anniversary! It is kinda tucked away enough to feel private but also close enough to town that you can get to whatever you need in Laurel!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a gracious, responsive and friendly host. I will definitely stay at the Adam's House when i'm in Laurel again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time staying in a home from Hometown HGTV! It was so cool to see all of the little details still intact, like the wood floors and beautiful kitchen. We also enjoyed sitting out on the back patio watching the lightning bugs! This was our 3rd visit to Laurel and it has definitely been the best place we‚Äôve stayed in."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Loved how they allowed dogs! Very cute kitchen and living room. Only complaint is that the water pressure was very low and it took a long time for the water to heat up. Also please note that there are steps to get into the house for those of you that have a hard time with accessibility.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay. LOVED the gorgeous, shaded, huge back yard‚Ä¶it‚Äôs where we spent most of our time. Very nice remodel and it was very convenient to downtown."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Casey answered your requests in a timely manner. Their home was just like the photos, clean and beautiful. Easy check in and out.
They gave suggestions for your visit, a map of historical sites. Walking park close by. There is a beautiful sunrise and waking up to cardinals and hummingbirds you can see and hear in the yard. Open the door and sit on the stoop, it‚Äôs Heaven. We can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thank you for opening your home for all of us to enjoy. The Anderson Family"

I would stay there again.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The Adams house was relaxing and felt comfortable to stay in. The outdoor fireplace and large backyard were nice. We would have used the fireplace but it rained while we where in Laurel.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So fun to stay in a ‚Äúhometown‚Äù house! Perfect size for 5 adults and one child. Plenty of space to spread out, all the linens and extra pillows you need. It reminded us all so much of our grandmothers houses with the squeaky wood floor, air vent in the floor, and crystal door knobs-fun reminiscing together! Jennifer responded quickly when I requested to book and sent me check in info morning of check in. We had a great stay and will hopefully rent again when we return to Laurel."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"April 11-13, 2023 - enjoyed our stay at the ""The Adam's House"" Great place to see Ben and Erin's craftmanship! The yard is amazing!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay! Awesome to stay at a house featured on the show!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The house is adorable inside. Outside needs a little attention but overall it was exactly what we were looking for. Extra bonus-just a short walk down the road was a park for kiddos and dogs to run around. Quick drive to downtown and all the adorable things Laurel has to offer.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay really felt like I was at home!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit and felt right at home!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful weekend. Jennifer was very helpful and informative. The house was exactly as described. Would highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great visit to Laurel and enjoyed our stay at The Adams House. We were there with another couple and enjoyed the quiet area and an evening outside sitting by the outside fireplace. Beds were comfortable, kitchen well appointed and even watched the episode the house was featured in on Home Town while we were there. Jennifer was a great host and easy to communicate with."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was so fun for us to be in Laurel and extra special to stay in a Hometown home. It was the perfect family adventure and we were sorry to leave!
Jennifer was great with communication and the house had everything we needed, including firewood for the standout outdoor fireplace!"
2023-03-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Nice property with some pros and cons. Jennifer was easy to communicate with and the house is in a pleasant, quiet location that is close to a large park and walkable to downtown. House was very clean for the most part. Kitchen seemed well appointed. Mattresses are newer memory foam and the interior spaces were comfortable, but we had issues with the water temperature in both showers during our visit and there were a few things that needed attention, like a broken door knob and coffee maker. The first impression of exterior was poor. Driveway needs some significant repairs, windows were very dirty and the back patio needed to be cleaned. Jennifer was quick to respond, but it's not something I anticipated dealing with while on vacation. If you are traveling with anyone with mobility concerns, be aware the back entrance has no handrail and is missing part of a paver on the top step. Enjoyed our stay for the most part and hope they take suggestions to heart."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay in the Adam's house. The fenced yard was beautiful and safe for our dog. The kitchen is beautiful and well equipped. Every part of the house is cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,House was very nice inside.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great house! I‚Äôve been a fan of Hometown since the beginning, so to stay in one of the homes that the Napier‚Äôs helped design was so exciting! It was all I expected! Jennifer was so helpful and accommodating. Her communication was great and I felt she would be helpful if we needed anything, which we didn‚Äôt, everything was there! About the house‚Ä¶the yard!! My teenagers ran around playing ball out there and our little dog sniffed and stretched his legs forever. It was so nice after a long drive. My husband started a fire in the fire pit and we ate by the fire while the kids were watching a movie inside. The beds were super comfy. A king sized bed in the master might have been a little better, but other than that, the bed was great‚Ä¶soft blankets and super soft mattresses. My kids said their beds were good, too. The house‚Äôs proximity to downtown was nice, too. You only have a mile or so drive to everything. I would definitely recommend this house and would love to stay in it again!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! great place to stay. Close to everything but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The interior of the house was very clean. The outside needed a little upkeep. The beds were comfortable, but bring your own pillows if you don‚Äôt like flat ones. Towels were nice and plentiful. Shampoo and body wash were provided in case you forgot yours. Coffee (Folgers made by the pot) and breakfast bars were available; which was good. Would stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer stated there was an American flag at the mailbox, which was helpful while looking for the driveway. The place is beautiful. The lot is fully fenced in, so we felt safe having our dogs outside. The kitchen is so well supplied. I was amazed with all the spices and other things you would need to cook but didn't want to bring with you.
The house is so clean and welcoming. We will be back, hopefully the weather will be more cooperative. Tornado warnings all day and rain on our last day, so we didn't get out to stroll the area of downtown. We were only in town for two days :(
Jennifer was so fast in responding to any questions we had.
Thank you Jennifer!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really loved our stay. The kitchen was equipped with everything you need to cook your meals. We enjoyed sitting outside by the outdoor fireplace . It was very relaxing.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay and relax. The kitchen was well stocked. The beds were so comfortable. The accommodations were amazing. The location was perfect. We had a wonderful time!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at the Adams house!! We loved that the home was true to what we saw in the photos and on Home Town. Very good distance to town and in the heart of many homes featured on the show. Comfy beds, responsive host, and relaxing living space. One slight drawback, that was not Jennifer's fault, but something to be mindful of is that the MS moisture is real. Many places around Laurel have a mildew smell due to the humidity, and the older homes and buidings dont accomodate that well. So be mindful if you have health concerns or a higher sensitivity to those scents."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a perfect family or friends retreat. The kitchen is a great area to cook and visit together. There are games in a hallway nook that we used for family game night around the table. The weather was not conducive during our visit, but the backyard fireplace and the screened side porch would be additional spaces to hang out together or have some quiet time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures say it all- fabulous kitchen, nice sized bedrooms, small bathrooms, neat outdoor fireplace. Nice place to stay with conveniences close by. The host was super responsive to any questions we had."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing home, wonderful hosts who go above and beyond! highly recommend this home!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful trip to Laurel, MS. This home was perfect for our family of 5. We enjoyed the outdoor fireplace, fabulous kitchen and board games! We would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house is very comfortable and spacious. We really enjoyed our stay our pups enjoyed the big fence in backyard.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home that was renovated on Season 5 of Home Town is perfect for a family or girlfriends getaway to Laurel. It was a short drive to all the downtown places. The home (especially the kitchen) was exactly as described and so comfortable. We enjoyed a fire on the back patio, restful nights in the 3 large bedrooms, and coffee/jigsaw puzzle time in the big, bright kitchen."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is just perfect. Jennifer is an outstanding host. Excellent communication! Will definitely try & stay there again if we return to Laurel!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is in a great location and Jennifer is a very responsive host. The living room is very comfortable and so are the beds! We had a wonderful stay!
2022-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I went to visit Laurel with two of my friends that love HomeTown. They were very excited to stay in a house that had been renovated by Ben and Erin. We were certainly not disappointed by the areas they renovated, beautiful kitchen, living room, dining room and great fireplace out back! Unfortunately our stay was not as seamless as we had hoped. Of the 3 bdrm/2 bath house we were only able to utilize 2 bedrooms and one bath due to a sewage smell in that area. The owners knew about the issue prior to our arrival but the remedy was more extensive than they had hoped. We totally understood that issues arise so we offered to double up in one of the rooms and all three of us to share one bathroom, that evidently was my mistake. At the end of our stay (we were there 3 nights) I asked how we would be compensated for the lack of use and was told that because I didn‚Äôt ask to leave or throw a fit during our stay, the only refund would be the $75.00 cleaning fee.
Some of the response I received was, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt mentioned that a compensation was necessary and (you) stayed the full reservation following‚Äù
‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd known the issue was significantly problematic or that you were expecting compensation I would have changed my plan of action but that wasn‚Äôt the case‚Äù.
Evidently, because I tried to make the best of a less than desirable situation and didn‚Äôt throw a fit, I was not due any fair compensation. I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúchanging the plan of action meant‚Äù?
Also, never communicate with any owner through text, I should have known better! She initiated the conversation on my personal phone (to which I should not have replied!) so the problems were not documented through the AirBnb site so they would not help at all. You only have 72 hours from check in to complain and I was 6 hours past the limit when I finally called‚Ä¶..If our communication had been through their site they would have offered compensation.
I have stayed in more than a dozen homes and have never been disappointed, any problems that happened to arise were dealt with fairly. I will continue to utilize airbnb and consider this to be an anomaly! Jennifer's house could also be very good as long as you don't run into any problems."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and comfy house very close to downtown!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best places we have stayed in regarding an Air BnB. The house was very clean, beds were super comfortable, location was perfect and Jennifer was an amazing host. The house truly feels like a home away from home. We will definitely stay there again next time we are in town."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darling bungalow with that ‚Äò40‚Äôs character still intact along with the best features of an updated kitchen! Communication with Jennifer was fantastic and immediate. She gave us helpful hints to make our bucket list trip to Laurel a huge success.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience. I know many people will be drawn here because of it being a home from Hometown, but this Airbnb stands on its own without that claim to fame. Very close to town, every amenity you could want, and a lovely fenced in backyard for your four legged friend. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely recommend this home to others. The house was so clean and comfortable.. great, quiet location. Our family of 5 had the best little time just enjoying each other at the house, as well as when attending all the local activities. We were so close to downtown and all of the hometown favorites. None of us were ready to get back to our everyday hustle and bustle. It truly made my husband and I want to purchase a Laurel home of our own! Loved it!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for a stay while my husband had some business in town. The kitchen is absolutely beautiful, and they had everything you need and more! While searching for a pot, I saw a crockpot, ziploc baggies, all the silverware you could ever need, pans, tupperware, they had it all! I brought my three month old with us, and with it being our first trip with him I was a bit nervous, but it truly could not have been more perfect. All of the bedrooms had enough room for a pack and play, and there were two dressers in the room we stayed in which was so nice not to live out of a suitcase. They also had a rocking recliner in the living room which was a God send for my little one and I! The backyard is just incredible if you have any furbabies with you. Our dogs had so much fun running around and exploring. We would definitely stay here again. It was a short drive to town, and ubereats will deliver!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very well kept and clean home. Has everything you need. Great yard for a dog. Jennifer was very responsive and organized.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Adams House was not just a place to sleep. It felt like visiting the home of friends! It is clean, tidy, and well-appointed with all the essentials one could need. The location is super-convenient, and you can drive downtown within a couple of minutes. It was great to see touches from Ben and Erin left just as they were at the conclusion of the renovation -- like the decor in the kitchen's mudroom nook. The living room furniture and the beds were all comfortable for resting at the end of a long day exploring Laurel. We had a great time and are grateful for the chance to have stayed here. Jennifer communicated quickly and kindly when I had a question and went above and beyond in keeping us informed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. A short drive up 7th Ave and you are downtown. I had originally thought about staying downtown and I'm so glad we didnt. The house was cozy and had plenty of room. Definately would recommend.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home is perfectly positioned for Home Town fans to explore the Laurel area -- in the country for a quiet surrounding but only 6 minutes from town. It is beautifully appointed and offers three bedrooms and two full bathrooms.
For fans of the show, you will want to watch the ""Country House/City House"" episode to see the before and after of the renovation.
We had a great time in Laurel -- we met Miss Pearle, saw Ben filming in front of a home, met Michael and his giant dog Zeus and learned a lot about the show as we visited the Scotsman general store and talked to the people there.
We now understand why Ben and Erin say they love their Home Town."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home with loads of extras. Coffee or tea was provided. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, dishwasher soap, washer soap and dryer sheets. Family Games were in the hall storage, great TV reception and Wi-Fi.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place !!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location for our visit to Laurel. Close proximity to the museum and downtown. We brought our two dogs and there is a nice parkway across the street from the house and a fenced dog park at Mason Park near 5th ave and 20th st ( about a mile away).
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We really loved this property! Perfect location and felt truly like ‚Äúhome.‚Äù We are two couples who were traveling to Mardi Gras from Cincinnati.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great place. Felt right at home. Super cozy. The 2 car carport around the back of the house is a great extra!! The house had everything you want and was just a very short walk downtown. Monique is very responsive and helpful. Will stay again for sure when back in Laurel.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Monique‚Äôs beautiful bungalow was exactly as described but even better in person. My mom and I stayed for my birthday weekend and it was cozy and a perfect getaway for us. The beds were comfy, linens crisp and clean as was the entire house. We loved having the coffee & creamers each morning she provided along with the Alexa to play music while we were just chilling or getting ready to go out and explore. We fell in love with the bungalow as well as the city and people of beautiful Laurel. Monique was very hospitable and helpful and it‚Äôs nice she lives so close by too, if you should need anything. She communicated very well and that was greatly appreciated! We can‚Äôt wait to come back for another stay and visit."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was Great! Home was better than the pictures and closer to town than anticipated. Walked to downtown Laurel in 15-17 minutes. Monique was a great host, shared information, offered additional help if needed, but also gave us a private relaxing stay. Will stay again for sure."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here on my way from Tennessee to Texas and it was an ideal location. It rained so the carport was ideal to get into the house. The house is perfect and while I was by myself, it is ideal for a family and extended stay. It is very beautiful, extremely clean and smells wonderful. I will definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Monique‚Äôs place is quaint, cozy, and decorated to make you feel at home. Plenty of room for our party of three people. Beautiful neighborhood atmosphere, with live oaks lining the streets. A nice walkable park directly across the street. The charming downtown area is only about a five minute drive from her place. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Mosque was super to work with and very flexible with check in. The house is so cute and looks just like the pictures. The neighborhood was very quiet and nice for walking my dogs. The best part of our stay was sleeping in the king sized bed. The mattress is wonderful and I had the best night sleep.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a charming cozy house this was! We really enjoyed our stay here. The street was quiet and peaceful but still very close to downtown. Check-in was super easy and clear instructions were provided beforehand. There was ample space for my husband, toddler, dog, and myself. Loved having the playground in the back too! Not to mention the house itself was super charming and we felt right at home. We can‚Äôt wait to go back for a longer stay!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have tried 3 times to get to Laurel and finally made it - Laurel is our new Happy Place and we would definitely want to stay at this beautiful home again. We felt at home immediately - we sure appreciated the water in the fridge the coffees and teas with cream available - there was nothing you could ask to make the stay better - the home had privacy - the park was a bonus for our puppies and the park was clean and trash cans in park available for puppy nuggets - the home is located in a beautiful area and we enjoyed walking thru all the neighborhoods - we will highly recommend this home and we are looking to a 2024 visit. Laurel is a very friendly town and Monique is a gem extremely friendly - maybe next time we could meet her in person - thank you so much for your over the top hospitality.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A true gem in Laurel! A cute home, very well appointed, in a great neighborhood, from which you can easily walk to downtown Laurel.

If your plans take you to Laurel, I'd highly recommend this home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Monique's place was awesome. My mother in law accidentally left her pacemaker monitor and Monique called us within 2 hours of our departure to let us know. Monique mailed it to our home at our request! What a thoughtful lady! Her house is beautiful, close to everything in Laurel and yet quiet. Will definitely go back. Thank you Monique for the southern hospitality!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best stay at Monique‚Äôs lovely home. It was comfortable and cosy, a home away from home. We will be coming back. Thank you Monique for ensuring our stay was everything we dreamed of and more."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Monique‚Äôs house on Euclid was fabulous! We walked a LOT and felt so peaceful - inside and outside the house. My two year loved the trundle bed, backyard play set, and the park across the street (throwing rocks in the creek). Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt arrive in time to do any local shopping like we hoped, but we would definitely stay at the house again if we return. Thanks, Monique!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, cozy stay in a great town to visit! We especially appreciated not having to do housekeeping chores upon checkout.."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, two dogs and I truly enjoyed our stay in this charming, extremely clean, well maintained home. It is situated on a beautiful street across from a nice park. The location allowed us to walk to the downtown (15-20 minutes), which was perfect for us. This would be a great home for a family to stay in, as well as a girls trip, or two couples. We hope to stay here again when we drive from the Kansas City area to Panama City Beach."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to spend a few days on our visit to Lauel. Not only did Laurel feel like ‚Äúour‚Äù hometown - Monique made us feel like we were staying in our own home. Great location, fully stocked with all the amenities we needed (and some snacks)!!
Monique is truly a SUPER host and gave great restaurant suggestions. Very responsive - we would definitely stay here afain!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the house. It felt like home away from home! The house was very clean and well stocked with amenities. We loved the wide selection of teas and coffees. Owners definitely went above and beyond making you feel at home!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home is beautiful, as well as the area in town it's located. It's a short distance from several sites my wife and I enjoyed visiting in the limited time we had.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This beautiful house had great southern charm and elegance. Super convenient to all the great fun of downtown Laurel! Super clean and has everything you need!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is just perfect!
It is super clean and beautifully decorated. Everything worked and was well maintained. We felt completely at home here. Monique sent info beforehand and answered my questions within moments.
Very comfortable beds, pillows, couches and chairs. Good hot water and pressure. Nice washer and dryer. There is a coffee bar in the dining room with a great selection of Keurig cups (hot cocoa too). The street is tree-lined and quiet. We were here in Aug and the bugs were crazy noisy in the evening , but we didn‚Äôt hear a thing inside the house.
This town has the friendliest people we have every encountered on our many travels. The restaurant where we had dinner (Blue Crab Diner) was recommended by the local dentist, and had amazing food.
Monique has great little thoughtful touches like USB plugs next to the bed, nightlights everywhere you need them, snacks, and flyers for local stuff. All the switches were labeled for lights and fans. She really considers her guests."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were only at the home for one night but it was the perfect stay on our way through town. Had everything we needed! The neighborhood and area was so cute. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Monique was awesome!! We loved it, we plan to come back again!! Would highly recommend!! Laurel is a wonderful place!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I wish we lived closer to Laurel so we could come back to this adorable house every year! Loved everything about it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our first Airbnb experience and was exactly as described. The house was a charmer in a quiet neighborhood.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent house in a great location. Only a few minutes from downtown. Quiet street with a park across from the house to walk your dog. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 74-year old mother and I loved Monique‚Äôs cottage during our four night stay. It was super clean and tidy with thoughtful touches - lots of coffee and tea, snacks and toiletries - a perfect home away from home!
The cottage was spotlessly clean and well maintained with everything we needed to prepare meals, launder clothing and relax. While we did not use the outdoor space (it was crazy hot and humid when we visited mid-July with daily afternoon rains - we really appreciated the covered parking at the back door!), the deck and grounds were well maintained and inviting.
The cottage is ideally situated to downtown, shopping and other local amenities. I highly recommend Monique‚Äôs cottage."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect! Adorable and comfortable. Peaceful, quiet neighborhood. Easy, beautiful walk to downtown shops and restaurants. Host was responsive and delightful. Highly recommend. We plan to return."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming house in a beautiful neighborhood close to downtown Laurel.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect in every way. The only downside was we didn‚Äôt book for long enough!!! If we get to come back, we will request this place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monique‚Äôs place was all we hoped for! It is a beautiful cottage home that is decorated on point for Laurel - up to date colors and furniture. Comfortable beds and the tv was easy to work - we watched movies at night.
Just a short mile or so from downtown on a gorgeous oak lined street.
Can‚Äôt recommend it enough!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We met family here for a couple of days, and it was perfect for a relaxed, comfortable visit. It's on a street a little bit like a cul-de-sac because it's so short and protected by the park across the street. You could easily walk downtown from here as it's a little less than a mile. The enormous, beautiful oak trees shade the street (and many other nearby streets.) We really enjoyed walking our dog here and visiting with the friendly neighbors.
We had excellent dining experiences at Pearl's Diner, Grits & Such, and Mimmo's. The staff of every store downtown was kind, particularly at The Laurel Mercantile and The Scotsman.
Monique is a thoughtful Airbnb host, and the house is adorable. The beds and sofas are comfortable, and it was easy to wash dishes and laundry and generally feel at home. If you want to imagine yourself living in Laurel like other the people you see on Home Town, this is the perfect place to do it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our too-short two-night stay at Monique's comfortable house on Euclid Avenue, surely one of the prettiest streets in Laurel. The bed was very comfortable and we especially appreciated the convenient coffee station, well-working A/C, and cozy sunroom. The house, which is a short walk to the historic district that has become so familiar to HGTV aficionados, is highly recommended to anyone visiting this quaint little city in Mississippi."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre a Home Town fan, this lovely little house is on Erin‚Äôs favorite street, and near several of the homes featured on the show. The street is quiet and lovely and an easy five minute drive to downtown Laurel. The home had two great rooms with baths. It was clean, well equipped with everything we needed, and had good furniture. It has the added feature of covered parking behind the home so we felt the car and all our belongings was safe there. We really took advantage of the great resource book that was left for us. Being able to peruse restaurant menus and activity ideas helped us plan our time. We loved our stay here and definitely recommend to anyone coming to Laurel."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful 1930's home and very well decorated. The home was very clean and accommodated us perfectly. Only stayed one night while passing through on our way home from a weeks long family vacation. To say the least, we will be booking a trip back to further enjoy this home and explore the town. Thank you for letting us enjoy your home! Definitely a place you can kick back to find peace and quite."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great Host/House...loved the area & Laurel in general (1st visit).
House was exactly as promised & we lived it. Overall favorite of the stay was ""great beds""...but it was more than that for me, everything taken together made the stay worth it, glad we chose this spot & would do so again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home in a great neighborhood. Perfect for kids- even had a big playset in the backyard. King bed was super comfy (didn't use the others)! Clean, cute and cozy! We loved our stay!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"First, Monique was a wonderful host! She responded quickly to any questions we had. We happened to get into town a bit early and she was very nice in letting us check into the house early! Her home is located in the historic district of Laurel. The neighborhood is very walkable and we felt safe here. Her home is lovely and very comfortable! She has everything you will need for your stay here. In fact we have not stayed at a short term rental that has had everything we needed, and we stay at a lot of rentals on our travels! Should we return to Laurel for another visit we will definitely stay here again! I highly recommend Monique's home for your stay in Laurel!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monique‚Äôs place is absolutely everything you‚Äôd want in a small town visit. She had helpful recommendations and thoughtful touches throughout. We arrived in a thunderstorm, and we were so happy to have covered parking and access to the door! It was one of the cleanest AirBNB‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed in, and it was so spacious and beautifully homey!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We so enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home in Laurel. It was so close to everything and the host has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable!!!

Monique is just a call away if needed and responds quickly, however, this trip went so smooth we did not have to contact her!! Five star experience!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was the perfect place to relax after a long road trip! It was especially enjoyable for fans of Home Town‚Ä¶.great decor, helpful recommendations, and wonderful nods to the hgtv show throughout! The home is cute, clean, and so organized! The street is lined with beautiful homes, streetlights, and trees! Its 4min from all of the fun things to do in Laurel! (Running into the stars and crew of the show at the Italian place in town was an added bonus!!) I can‚Äôt wait to return! Thank you, Monique, for a great stay!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place. Convenient to downtown - close enough for a long walk. The neighborhood is very cute and if you are Home Town fans, a few of the houses nearby were on the show - including one two doors down. The bed was very comfortable and the entire place was very nice and quiet. We really enjoyed it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and large home to stay in! Dog friendly but we ended up leaving ours behind with a relative. Felt safe and was very quiet.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful home. I highly recommend this home. I will definitely be back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second time we have stayed at Monique‚Äôs home, another wonderful stay. Her home is just as pictured, so charming, and clean, location is perfect for a Hometown experience, in historic district! Monique is very quick to respond, even contacted us of something left behind, and went out of their way to help us get it. Highly recommend staying here, so quiet, beautiful spacious home, in historic district where you can step out the door and be among the beautiful white oak treesüòç
Thank you again Monique! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the location of this charming house. The neighborhood was pretty and very quiet. Great location close to downtown. Nice amenities provide. Easy check in and out. Tastefully decorated and comfortable. Our doggie enjoyed it too. I thought the backyard was fenced so we could let Levi out by himself; however, it was not which wasn‚Äôt a big deal as my husband enjoyed sitting out on the patio keeping an eye on him. We will come again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Staying at Monique‚Äôs cottage was enjoyable. It was very comfortable and clean! The location was perfect. We were able to walk to restaurants and shops. Monique even let us know if an activity was going on in Laurel that we may enjoy. She is so kind and helpful! We would love to return sometime.
Linda and Greg"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped here for two nights on our way south. Loved the look and feel of the bungalow. Rooms were spacious and airy, furniture and beds were comfortable, and decor was pleasing. I loved that enough upgrades had been done to make the place very comfortable, without changing the true character of the property. The immediate area is great for walking; our dog loved it, as did we. Had three meals in the nearby downtown, all delicious. Great experience all around."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I rented this house over Christmas for ourselves and our 2 dogs. My sister just moved to Laurel early 2022 and Monique's place was less than 5 minutes away- so convenient. We loved having the entrance in the back of the house through the mudroom as we checked in at almost 3am and came back to the airbnb quite late both nights. Everything about the rental itself was as described in the listing and then some! We absolutely loved everything- the sun room, coffee/tea/hot chocolate bar, the sitting room where we read most days, and the beds were so comfortable!
Monique was a wonderful host! We had check-in instructions a week before our arrival date so we could plan ahead, she responded to every message sent within a more than reasonable amount of time, and her and her husband even came on by on Christmas Eve to help us with an issue! I normally would never ask someone to inconvenience themselves like that on a holiday, but it was so very appreciated. Would love to come back"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second visit to Laurel and stay at Monique's beautiful home. The home was picture perfect and centrally located to all the best places in Laurel.

I highly recommend this well appointed home!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monique‚Äôs Airbnb was so cute, homey, much bigger than pictures captured, was very surprised. So much room and areas for reading or just quiet time, and very comfortable mattresses. The street the house is on, so quiet, it is not as busy as the other streets, and the trees are just beautiful.
We hope Monique‚Äôs AirBNB is available when we can come back, definitely recommend. üòç"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even better than pictured! This place was exceptionally clean, and the beds were the most comfortable I‚Äôve slept on staying away from home. I felt right at home and hated to leave. It reminded me of summers spent at my Granny‚Äôs house. Loved my stay!!"

Their cottages (there are 2, one up one down) are in their backyard so you need to be comfortable sharing space with their dogs and kiddo's which was not a problem for us. Mallory generously shares her outdoor space and the ground rules were communicated clearly.

Mallorie and her family were just precious giving us local favorites to eat and updates in the town. If you are afraid of dogs, like I am, you won‚Äôt need to be. Her puppies are big and come to greet you with the sweetest temperament. We stayed downstairs and had 3 different couples stay above of during our stay.

She provided delightful extras that were perfect for the cool weather we experienced. Her emails provided all the instructions needed to find the location, ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù, what local attractions were available, and much more. Because of the comprehensive notebook she provided we were able to find a tour of some of the homes that Ben and Erin Napier had renovated on Home Town. We were very pleased to discover this ‚Äúfind‚Äù. Mallorie was friendly, warm, and welcoming, as well as helpful in finding specific help in locating a church and restaurant on Sunday since most restaurants in Laurel are closed on Sundays. We would definitely make reservations again if we return to Laurel. We enjoyed the area and the accommodations that were less than a five minute drive from Mallorie‚Äôs cottage."

We are both always on the go and needed to slow down. Mallorie's cottage was exactly what we needed! Everything was perfect! When we arrived, the Christmas tree was lit, the space heater was on in the bathroom, and the cottage smelled wonderful. We initially had plans to go out to dinner but opted to stay in because we wanted to enjoy the peace and quiet. There were bikes available to use as well as the pool but it was too cold! We will absolutely come back and take full advantage of those in the springtime. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous-right in the heart of historic Laurel.

A big fluffy bed with plenty of pillows from which to choose. Comfy chairs for reading and visiting. A big bonus was the washer/dryer so we could clean our clothes before we left making unpacking so much easier when we got home. They invited us to use their pool and make ourselves at home.

A beautiful place on a beautiful street in the City Beautiful!"

I appreciated that there wasn't a long list of rules, but very clear expectations for departure. We truly felt like we were visiting friends or family!
The bed was super comfy and the temperature was just right. We loved everything about our stay except that we couldn't stay longer!

Their cottage is a short walk to town if you do not want to drive. A beautiful street as well, great for general walking and the neighbors are very friendly. This town has charm and staying at this cottage was consistent with that atmosphere.
Late-night TV was fun with the popcorn and although we had to leave early we wished we could have stayed more days. We did not have grandkids with us but there were many fun games and activities offered at this cottage."

Laurel's reputation for friendly, kind, and hospitable folk is certainly well-earned. Mallorie represents all these traits in spades and is an amazing ambassador for ""The City Beautiful""."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Laurel cottage was such a joy! The home itself is more than well equipped with all necessary items; but, more than that, it's all the beautiful touches that make it a truly special place. There are so many lovely details . And, if you have time to explore, there are some really thoughtful and sweet surprises. Sitting in front of the cottage on a Friday night with the wind carrying the sound of the high school band added a special nostalgic charm. Rudy the dog and a sweet little kitty were welcome company outside. Our visit was too brief and too cool to enjoy the pool but we will be sure to enjoy all the amenities next visit because there will definite be one.
The Loblolly festival was going on during our visit and was an extra fun bonus. Coffee at the Bird Dog Cafe, dinner at the Blue Crab and shopping at the Laurel Mercantile was wonderful! I brought back lots of treasure.
Thank you so much for giving us the Home Town experience. I can see why Laurel is so loved. We fell in love, too."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs easy to see why Mallorie is a super host‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing she hasn‚Äôt thought of for making your stay comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable. She is quick to answer your questions and concerns. We hope we can visit and stay again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mallorie, is a super host, very friendly and pleasant. Southern hospitality at its finest. Great communication with everything we needed to know about our stay, from checking with us daily to see if there was anything we needed, to recommendations on sights and shops to visit and popular places to eat.

The cottage was comfortable and cozy, stocked with everything we needed for a three night stay. Nice attention to detail with amenities to make our stay comfortable. The Laurel cottages are in a very quiet neighborhood, so you can be sure of a quiet night's sleep.
We had great weather so it was nice to spend a little time during the day and relax at night by the pool which is just steps from the front door.
If you choose, it's an easy walk to the downtown area, which has all the boutiques, shops and restaurants you'll need. Along the way you can see beautiful maintained and restored historic homes. In my opinion, the nicest in Laurel. The majority of the downtown has been restored. For a small city, Laurel's downtown is one of the nicest I've seen.
My wife and I live in the historic district of our home town and staying at the Laurel Cottages made feel so much like at home. There is also a very cool history to the property of the Laurel Cottages.
If we ever return to Laurel to visit, the Laurel Cottages will be our first choice.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute accommodations in a private neighborhood, right across from the Bird Dog Cafe and very short walking distance to downtown. Convenient parking right outside the door to the unit. Quiet unit. Looks like it was recently refinished bottom to top and very clean. All appliances look new and bathroom was very nice. Beds were comfy too. Very comfortable unit and had everything you need. I wish there was a full size ironing board and hanging rods in bedroom, but that was just a very minor inconvenience. Had to hunt for ironing board and realized closet in living room behind the chair had what we needed - just needed to move the chair to access it. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone wanting to visit Laurel."

Rose was very friendly and accommodating. She also told us about an event happening on the street so that we could check it out and allayed any worries regarding how it would affect parking. All in all, it was an ideal airbnb."

Bed was comfortable, shower is very nice, kitchen well appointed.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Reunion House for our Kick-off to Christmas girls' trip to Laurel! The space was exactly as pictured, and exceedingly comfortable for our party of two. Check-in/out was smooth, loved having the washer/dryer as well as the pot-of-coffee option. Highly recommend trivia at 320, a visit to Landrum's as well as stops at all the local boutique shops and restaurants. The Airbnb was conveniently located--walkable to everything. We enjoyed searching out all the murals, and even stopped in the local library to checkout the mission-style chair Ben Napier constructed with astronaut Scott Kelly. The Plant Parlor (located in the front of Reunion House) also makes for a fun visit (wish we could have brought some of the plants back to Phoenix!). The people of Laurel were both kind and welcoming--we experienced the town Christmas Tree lighting, the Christmas Parade, and Pancake Day--and loved checking out all the antique shops (including Southern Pickin's, just outside town!)."

Thank you, Rose!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for a walk to town. Home exactly as shown in photos. All very comfy. I appreciate owners who allow a dog. I travel with my clean, non destructive girl and know how difficult it is to find a place to stay."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location was key...it was within walking distance to downtown. Very clean and cutely decorated. We were disappointed, however, that we were expected to strip the beds and wash the sheets and towels given the cleaning fee and high service fee. There were no pillows provided for the trundle bed and we had to ask for additional coffee."

Would definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so beautiful, spacious, and just overall lovely! I have a phobia of loose hair and I WAS so glad that there wasn't any loose hair in the linens or on the floors. That's an absolute first in any Airbnb that I've stayed. The space was very clean, quiet, and I could tell that so much thought was put in to amenities. Rose had a sound machine; I definitely listen to white noise to sleep! I wish her space was available for when I return on the 16th-17th. I will definitely be staying again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Delightful quaint space within walking distance to downtown. Clean space and easy access.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Reunion House. We were able to walk to everything and only used the car when we were walked out. We were there M-W nights and a lot of the eateries are closed in the evening until Thursday. So something to know in advance. Rose was lovely and left clear instructions for us. We would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rose's place is lovely! My friend and I adored the decorating with the splashes of coral pink. Everything was clean. We had all that we needed. And the location is within view of downtown Laurel!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The space is perfect for a stay, close to everything downtown, comfort with all the amenities."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had planned to arrive on a Thursday for a short weekend in Laurel on my way to visit family in OK, but instead Hurricane Idalia had other ideas. Evacuated from my Florida home, I had to leave quickly and checked with Rose to see if I could arrive early. The way she worked with me on helping that happen was more than I could have expected, quick responses and kind words to help me make decisions as I was frantically packing up to leave.
Then when I arrived after a long stormy day of driving, I was thrilled to see my ‚Äúhome‚Äù for the week. It simply could not have been more lovely! The location was perfect, in a home that houses Laurel Plant Parlor in the front (will be featured on Hometown this season!), next to a famous local artist‚Äôs gallery, and on a lovely street. It would be easily walkable to the downtown Laurel area if it hadn‚Äôt been in the high 90s when I was there, but perfect location! Loved all the amenities, smart TV, Alexa, A+ kitchen, & a place to work. Highly recommend!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, close to downtown. Only issue and it was a small one was the adjoining unit had a small dog and it liked to bark allot. Other than that small issue, the place was fantastic and I would recommend for sure!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. The location was very walkable to everything we wanted to see in Laurel.

Thank you so much!! We will recommend to our friends.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Southern Charm is the best way to describe The Reunion House. The colors were wonderful and each decorative item was chosen with care and good taste. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the unit.
I rated ‚Äúvalue‚Äù a 4 because we paid a fair price but were also asked ( which we did) to strip the beds; launder the sheets and towels; wash the dishes and take out the trash. These are chores I have not been asked to do at other Air BNB rentals."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the walkable location and the fun colors and decor of the whole place. There is also a great little neighbor shoo feel with sidewalks good for morning walks. The restaurant across the street had delicious seafood.

The brochures and booklets provided interesting historical references, delicious recipes, and wonderful suggestions for experiencing all this lovely small southern town has to offer. We will certainly recommend the Reunion House for anyone visiting Laurel."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Decor was very neat and great for the area. Location was very close to shops, food and historical building. Host provided current list of places to check out for eating, shopping, etc. and even details for days and hours open for business."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place. The location was perfect. Close enough to downtown but felt like in a private setting. Very short walk to downtown, under 5 minutes taking the back way.
The place was better than described. Made us feel at home the minute we walked in.
So glad we stayed here instead of right downtown. Pick this place."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was awesome and we would definitely recommend coming here!!
A couple of things that you might want to know ‚Ä¶we were here on a Sunday and found that nearly everything was shut down. We arrived around 4:30 and could not find a restaurant that we wanted to eat at.
We also wish the kitchen sink sprayer was working. Unfortunately, it was not connected.
Having pointed out these two things, we truly loved the place. It was beautiful. Enjoy your stay, you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a 5 star location. We were very impressed with the unit. Rose seemed to have thought of everything. It was spot-less and appeared to be recently renovated. Very comfortable beds. Would definitely stay there again. (The only issue was the occasional train noise/whistle, but the sound machine provided took care of that!)"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable house, comfy beds, beautifully kept! Everything you could ask for and more! So convenient to everything, we parked our car and did not use it again during our stay. Laurel has much to see, great restaurants, we ate at Le Fleur and Grits and Some (YUM!) We walked the entire historic district and downtown. Also walked to McAlisters and Palace Donuts the other direction. The Cotton Boll store is beautiful and Leslie who works there is a town treasure! Many cute shops and of course Erin and Ben stores to visit. We will always want to stay at Rose's fantastic home when we are in town!!!!"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Accommodations we perfect. Unit was very clean and was close to everything Laurel has to offer.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice place! The shower was fantastic! We did not use the kitchen, as we ate at all the fun spots in Laurel, but it was well stocked and super clean. As older folks, we weren't used to not meeting someone in person, but all was well! First time ever staying at an airbnb, instead of a bed and breakfast. After the fees, it was our most expensive night in Laurel."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rose was responsive and accommodating and had her place was lovely. Right in the heart of town and perfect for a weekend getaway (or weekday for that matter).

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Rose‚Äôs Reunion House was a treat. It was perfect for my sister and me during our visit to Laurel.

First time I have been asked as a guest to start our own laundry but kinda admire the efficiency for the host!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our stay at Rose‚Äôs place in Laurel. We were in Laurel to visit a relative. Her unit was spacious enough for two of us and a small dog. It was spotlessly clean, and fairly newly renovated, with many amenities and conveniences. Just some: Keurig duo machine with coffee pods; hair dryer; Alexa device; washer/dryer; keypad lock; lovely dishes and flatware; plenty of knives, pans, etc. for cooking, although we only stayed two nights, so we ate out or visited our relative; olive oil; modern kitchen; comfortable bed; dishwasher; modern bathroom with a beautiful walk in shower. I cannot recommend this place enough! If you find yourself visiting Laurel, consider staying at Rose‚Äôs place on Short 7th Ave. Just beautiful!"

We absolutely loved the location, as it was walkable to all of the downtown stores and restaurants, and the Bird Dog cafe was just right across the street for coffee and breakfast each morning. We also loved the house itself! It was so cute and cozy inside, and it truly had everything you could need. The beds were super comfy, the bathroom was great (very clean, and good water pressure!), and there was plenty of space. We loved that there was a smart tv as well, as we were able to log into our streaming services and watch TV. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Laurel!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The style and comfort were spot on. Love the colors incorporated into the design.
Can‚Äôt comment about the kitchen as we did not cook, other than a pizza in the oven.
The one negative comment I have is and this may sound weird but sitting on the toilet, I noticed black hairs on the wall. So my assumption is the cleaning people cleaned the floor first and then wiped down the walls. I notice little things like that. I thought I was seeing things but the little black hairs were there.
Also, may want to relate to city council of Laurel the week between Christmas and New Year, the council needs to tell businessess to keep their websites updated for that holiday week. We observed several stores closed. The ones that were open were more than welcoming.
Also this was our second visit to Laurel and ate at Pearl‚Äôs both times.
This time was very disappointing. Big piece of chicken was not done. We commented about it and they offered to give us a free piece but we declined."

Easy walk to attractions, restaurants, & shopping."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed this bright and cheerful bungalow after driving 500 miles on our way to Houston. I loved the way it was designed. It came with everything we needed. I have an autoimmune disease that makes all my joints constantly hurt so finding a comfortable bed is usually nearly impossible. The mattresses and bedding were wonderful and I got a lovely nights rest. The Bird Dog Cafe is across the street so you can grab a great breakfast and a good cup of coffee before hitting the road. I look forward to staying there again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,You could not ask for a better location in Laurel or a more comfortable and homey accommodation! I loved it!

The decor on sight is very much to my taste and I appreciated the blend of styles. I felt like a lot of thought went into everything in the cottage.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay for Home Town fans looking for a place to stay in Laurel. Kathy and Isao were so welcoming and friendly. Their cozy little cottage, ‚ÄúRedbud‚Äù, felt like a home away from home on my cross country road trip. Words can‚Äôt express my gratitude enough for what they provided before and during my stay. Prior to my stay Kathy was quick to respond and made several recommendations that I sought out during my stay. Isao provided a personal touch of Hawaiian hospitality as well. ‚ÄúRedbud‚Äù provided a peaceful getaway with every homey amenity you could possibly want, including the rocking chairs on the porch. I would highly recommend this to anyone, whether they‚Äôre a Home Town fan or not."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although our stay at the 'Redbud' cottage was brief, fond memories were made just the same. The cottage is exceptionally clean, beautifully decorated and cozy. Kathy and Isao are delightful hosts. They were most welcoming and their attention to detail did not go unnoticed. Not only do they have snacks, bottles of water and, a personalized written welcome note upon arrival, there are two handcrafted mementoes for guests to depart with. Keepsakes that will remind you of Kathy, Isao, 'Redbud' and Laurel. Such thoughtfulness. Great stay, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Isao met us upon arrival and made us feel welcome immediately. They even helped us unload and reload our belongings from the vehicle providing a golf cart for us. They had lots of amenities and extras including a pot holder and ornament that was wooden. Kathy even sent lots of recommendations on restaurants and activities before hand.
The Rosebud Cottage was beautiful and super clean!
I know now why you are rated the number one Airbnb host in MS!
Thank you so very much. We hope to come visit again with you soon!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply outstanding. Superb hosts. Pristine accommodations. Great location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely cottage! We felt as though we had landed in Paradise. Kathy & Isao were so welcoming & had seemingly thought of our every need or want; even car-to-cottage delivery of our luggage with a golf cart.
The cottage was cozy, spotless, and lacking nothing.
Their neighborhood has historical homes of varying architecture & is worth a stroll or meandering drive to appreciate.
We greatly appreciated their lead on Reyes restaurant where we enjoyed the Mexican menu & strolling musicians.
At a evening‚Äôs end, I made use of the porch rocker, listening to the gentle rain & watching the ‚Äúfirefly‚Äù lights dance in the huge
tree that umbrella-ed the cottage roof. It was the most relaxing way to end the day."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Isao were the best. The Cottage we stayed in was the cleanest one we have ever experienced . (Not exaggerating) They were very helpful with suggesting Great Restaurants and Places to Shop and More than anything, they made us feel right at home."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the Woodland Cottages was excellent from beginning to end.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Isao and Kathy were wonderful hosts. She communicated with me extremely well before our visit (I had lots of questions lol) during on where to go, and always made us feel welcome. They helped us get settled in (even carried our luggage to the cottage). You don‚Äôt find that hospitality much anymore. I can‚Äôt say no good things about them. They were absolutely wonderful!!
Redbud cottage was so very cute. The pictures are accurate but don‚Äôt give it enough justice it was so much more. We loved going out for the day and coming back early to relax, and play games. They even had snacks and coffee waiting. Which was a delight since we had driven a ways to get there. I was ready for a snack break. Haha
The bed and pillows were great. This is a big deal to us when traveling. The water was always hot and smelt clean. It was a perfect 60th birthday getaway surprise for my hubby.
We will definitely be back again. Thank you both for a great weekend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy & Isao‚Äôs cottage is beautifully sweet, incredibly comfortable & cozy. It‚Äôs a great place to stay 1 night or several but

Thank you for a great visit to Laurel and your sweet cottage!!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Isao could not be more friendly and welcoming for our stay in Laurel! This was the ultimate Airbnb experience; we were greeted upon arriving and they had a golf cart to help carry all our stuff to the door which we really appreciated! The studio that we stayed in was meticulously decorated, quiet and comfortable. I thought the location was also wonderful. If you want to get some exercise and do some walking, you really can walk into the town of Laurel and see all the ‚ÄúHome Town‚Äù stores and sights and restaurants which was the purpose of our visit. It is a 1 to 1.5-mile walk all the way into laurel and you can pass by the Lauren Rogers Art Museum which we visited and highly recommend. We ended up taking the car out because it was a little cool. I can‚Äôt wait to return and see more of this charming town. The food and quality of all the merchandise at Ben and Erin‚Äôs stores does not disappoint. Bring your credit cards!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying with Kathy and Isao! They were incredible hosts that made us feel so welcomed! We will definitely be staying with them again if we are in the area!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy and Isao were wonderful hosts. The cottage is in a great location near the historic district. Cottage itself was very cozy. Loved the Gandalf and woodland critters that were carved by a chainsaw artist in the yard. So much nicer than staying in a hotel.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can't even begin to explain how wonderful Kathy and Isao were to us. My husband had an emergency ER visit on the way to their cottage and they checked on us from the time they found out and were waiting us outside at 9pm when we arrived with hugs and open arms. We had to leave the following day to go back home so we could go to the hospital there and they continued to check on us until they knew my husband was ok and we were home. I can't wait to go back in February so that we can re-do our stay to have more chats and Hawaiian hugs!!!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely everything I could want. All was very very upscale, luxury linens, wonderful pillows, a gorgeous bathroom. Yet it felt very homey and comfortable, not like a furniture showroom thats nice, but impersonal. There was a flashlight by the bed, a couple of dark bath clothes and makeup remover, much appreciated. The lighting was perfect and I could not have felt more safe. I also learned they have a storm shelter! That is just so neat. I was also just blown away by the loveliness of Laurel itself. Absolutely worth a visit. Lees coffee was perfect and Vics diner has tomato gravy! True Mississippi experience!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is magical! Our host, Kathy, greeted us as we drove up, and was so welcoming! She led us down a beautiful, gravel garden path, surrounded by mythical creatures, to our private suite in the guest house, right behind the main house from the Home Town episode. We loved the decor, lots of thoughtful details like snacks, guidebooks, makeup-removal cloths, a small fridge with a nice freezer section, really soft towels, comfortable bedding, etc. We arrived on a Sunday, so Kathy helped us find open restaurant choices. And after check-out, when she discovered we‚Äôd forgotten one of our grocery bags, she went out of her way to meet our golf- cart tour as it passed her house & met us with it! That is personalized service, and she delivered it with a smile! Stay here! You‚Äôll love it!"
