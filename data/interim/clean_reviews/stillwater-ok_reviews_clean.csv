2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was exactly what I needed for my over night trip go Stillwater for Special Olympics training. It was a great location. It had all the amenities needed and more! I always appreciate locations that provide some little touches and Tammy's spot offered this. Highly recommend and will seek out this spot for future stays in Stillwater.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in town for a wedding. Tammy allowed us to check in early and everything was clean and ready to go. We would stay again if ever in Stillwater.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Barefoot Creek for 2 nights while moving our daughter out of her dorm at OSU, which was .8 miles away. Tammy has done an amazing job transforming this downtown office buidling into an Airbnb oasis. She provided coffee, water, dishes, silverware, toiletries, a sound machine, a stand alone fan, an extension cord, streaming TV and very clear instructions on parking and staying there. I'm listing these items to make others aware, but I want to be clear that I don't consider any of these negatively. The bathroom was tiny and it has the only mirror, but for 2 of us it was fine. The rooms without an ensuite had use of a bigger bathroom. It was very bright in our room in the morning, but we both sleep with a mask on so this didn't bother us either. The beds and bedding were extremely soft, so we both slept great. We loved staying at barefoot creek, so we're going to book again in November."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed in the Corner Haven Cottage for 7 nights. It was perfect! I would recommend for a party of 1, it was a little tight with my husband for 2 nights, but doable. It is super close to OSU, convenient and safe. The shower has fantastic water pressure, better than home! Tammy provided a fully stocked kitchenette and bathroom, I did not need a thing. William was there everyday cleaning and turning over the rooms. He was super friendly and made me feel at home. I highly recommend this airbnb, it is like a small hotel, and I found all of the other guests to be respectful, every guest kept to themselves and there were no disturbances or loud noises. Excellent experience. Thank you, Tammy & William!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tammy and her husband William made the whole experience extremely pleasant. The creativity of the entire layout was phenomenal from the interior design to the layout of the entire place. I was beyond amazed with how they renovated the building to provide each room with every accessory and utility you could have. Bathrooms were fully stocked with everything you needed and the room was spotless. With that being said Tammy’s husband William was there nearly everyday cleaning and maintaining the building. William was friendly and respectful. The location is right in the center of the downtown area making it easy to get to all the main attractions of Stillwater. All around I would give this place 10 stars if I could and I will be staying here the next time I visit. Thank you both so much for the experience!

It is very homey and a perfect place to rest your head after a busy day in Stillwater! we will most definitely be using this place again in the future next time we are in Stillwater."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I really loved the super easy check in. The room was a little smaller than I expected but was very cute just like the pictures. The bed was a little uncomfortable when my partner and I were sleeping in it together. The sink is a little smaller than I expected but we made it worked. For the price and location definitely worth it. Would probably stay again! I love how she had places she recommended! We really enjoyed a lot of her recommendations.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in 3 different rooms now at Tammy’s place and had family stay in another, so in total we’ve seen 4 rooms. Every visit the experience was exceptional. The corner haven room was smaller than we had anticipated but we were able to reserve another room and easily switch. Tammy and William are friendly, very responsive, the rooms are well kept and extremely clean. When we stayed in November my boyfriend forgot his laptop charger in the room. Knowing we’d be back in February he asked if they could just hold it for him which they did! Awesome place, great location and great people. Highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! Tammy and William were very accommodating. We were able to check in early so we could drop off our bag so we did not have to try and do that after dark. The room was small but it was exactly as the pictures looked and perfect for what we needed. They utilized the space very well. The price is awesome. We will definitely stay with them again. We have tried to book many times but they fill up very quickly. I think that shows that they are very good.
The only suggestion I would make is to possibly add a small foldable chair to the room. It would be a nice addition so you do not have to only sit on the bed. Other than that is was great."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. It’s such a cute little room and bathroom.
I had a little trouble finding the room through the hallway but once I found it everything was great!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My sister and I enjoyed our stay. It was very cute and felt safe. The only drawbacks for us were the very small and oddly highly situated sink (we are 5' 6"" and it was at our chest level) and the lack of storage space due to all the decor. The existing shelves are all full, so finding room for all the pillows on the bed and our things was a little challenging. The bed was also creaky, so every time one of us moved, you could hear it. It was comfortable though."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what I needed. The sink was comically small and didn’t drain well but that wasn’t a big deal

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great host!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"A friend and I stayed at Tammy’s for a wedding in Stillwater. It was the perfect size, location, and price for what we needed. While somewhat out of her control, there was a party on the back patio where there were people peeing and throwing up. In addition, we found a pair of dirty panties under the bed while stripping the bed before checkout. I wish the place was a better fit, but I would probably not stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing Diamond in the rough! This place was incredible. It’s all you need for a weekend spot. The bed is an indescribable treasure. Quiet, within walking distance to the campus, and incredibly decorated. This place felt like a cozy home away from home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place looked exactly like it was listed. Finding the entrance might be a bit difficult but for the price, it's worth it. Loved staying here. P. S. haven't got to tasting the coffee that's available right in my room, but I recommend you do."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A hidden gem! My husband and I needed a place last minute while we were working on remodeling our daughters house in Stillwater. We booked about 6pm and the directions were easy to follow! It kind of reminded me of a tiny house… everything was small but sufficient and very well decorated! The bed was very comfortable and the room had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again if we needed to!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the third stay I've had at Tammy's. all different rooms. This room was my favorite. I don't need a lot of room so this was perfect and I loved that this room felt tucked aware from the other rooms. I can't wait to stay again.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tammy always goes above and beyond. Place smells good and she does her absolute best to make sure you have a warm stay with her.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room in a quiet location. Excellent communication from Tammy. Thank you for a great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as advertised. Easy walk to OSU campus.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great spot, if I need somewhere to stay in Stillwater again I’ll be back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay at Tammy's almost every week and it is the perfect Airbnb. Tammy is always helpful and responsive and she decorates the rooms so cute.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic deal! Clean, close to everything I needed, will definitely stay here again once in the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay especially if you’re only in town for a night!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tammy's place is always one of my favorite Airbnb's. She is so helpful and responsive. If there are ever any issues they are addressed immediately. I stayed in the new corner room. I love it because it has its own bathroom. It's tiny, but I don't have to share with anyone :) Great place to stay. Only issues are other guests who are loud and inconsiderate, but that has nothing to do with the place."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed in two rooms at this location now. This one has its own bathroom which is a nice perk. However I prefer the Cozy Cottage over Corner Haven. I was able to hear a woman having a phone conversation in the next room and it sounded like she was in the room with me. The coffee pot in this room has a short cord and doesn’t reach the plug. The sink in the bathroom is tiny which makes it very difficult to brush one’s teeth. During my first stay in this room the shower never got hot but it appears that problem has been fixed. I had plenty of hot water this time. Would stay again but I prefer the other room!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Tammy was very helpful throughout the stay. She answered questions and was very flexible. There were a few concerns regarding cleanliness, but I don't see this as a norm at all. I would recommend staying with Tammy any time."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"In spite of the difficulty I had finding the location - which is likely my misgivings in following directions - the overall stay was good. It did not allow much room for anything other than sleeping based on it's size. It might be meaning to mention that a cottage is very tight or perhaps give some dimensions. regardless, I would rent it again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great title space. perfect for myself for a couple days.

There are a few notable features that make it unique compared to other listings. With two king size beds and one queen size bed, we had plenty of room to stretch out. The mattresses, pillows, and linen added to the comfort of the large beds. What is really great is the large private yard. It is perfectly set up for family gatherings. We will check to see if it is available the next time we need to stay in Stillwater."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very nice and spacious. The bedrooms were nice sized. The beds were very comfortable and had clean sheets. The bathrooms were very clean and stocked with anything you could need. More than enough towels for several days. Instructions for checking in and out were very easy and clear to understand. Host was very good at responding to any messages in a nice timely manner. The price is well worth the stay.

Another plus is the garage that you can use with a door opener. Stayed at quite a few in town ,this one is far the best so far. Would diffently stay here again when in town."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Averi’s place was absolutely beautiful! It was clean and homey when we arrived and overall was an amazing experience.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's facility definitely met our initial expectations based on the content and on the photos presented on its online listing page. The house appeared to be very clean and spacious enough, and we didn't encounter any difficulties with finding or using there the necessary kitchenware, bathrooms, air conditioner, etc. It was also pretty quiet while we were staying there. There were some difficulties with parking, as our car has a low bumper and as the main parking slot there is not very well-adopted to such cars. During our stay in that facility, we were also notified by the neighbors that parking the car in the street near the facility was not possible as well. So we still had to use the main parking option, in any case. At the same time, it was also nice to see that the house has all the necessary furniture, lamps, kitchenware, laundry, etc. and that the furniture and the necessary equipment are in a good state there at present. We liked our stay in that facility much, merci!"

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We don’t like to give a bad review, but the place was not as clean as it should have been.

Two large, comfortable bedrooms and two full baths both with bathtubs. One bedroom had its own private bathroom with a bidet! This was such a welcome surprise as it’s something we miss from home when traveling.
All the kitchen accessories you may need for your stay. Comfortable linens and furniture… very clean and tidy! We will stay here anytime we travel to Stilly! In addition to an amazing stay- Gretchen was prompt, kind and very helpful! Thanks again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cottage with open layout. If weather takes a turn for the worse, it is a wonderful place to relax and listen to the storm! Hosts are great with communication. House rules are simple, and this is a wonderful alternative to booking a hotel in Stillwater."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great spot in stilly. Very comfortable stay with a lot of space
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We got in really late because we worked later and left later than expected. The homeowner called me to check in on us and made sure we were okay and everything was okay the following day. To me that was very caring and thoughtful for them to check on us. Being 8 hours from home with a toddler isn’t always easy. They were very polite about us getting checking in at 3am and checking out after 11. Not to mention the place was SPOTLESS! So clean! Made me feel at home and relaxed. If i come back to Stillwater i definitely would want to stay there again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little spot for quick visits to Stillwater with a pet. Will be back for future events.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janelle is the best host ever! I loved the tiny home and she always responded quickly to my questions. If I ever need to stay in Stillwater again, I know where to go! Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janelle and Jeff's place was perfect. We could not have asked for better accommodations when we came for OSU Graduation. The property and neighborhood is very relaxing and stress free. Great location, just far enough away from OSU activity and just close enough that we can shop, eat or take in OSU quickly. Janelle and Jeff have been more than accommodating and we highly recommend them."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"quite location just about 15 minutes from everything, clean space, and was always quick to answer any questions. Nice yard space with games corn hole ect.. and card table with cards inside. Overall a great experience!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are so many good things about Janelle's property which is why I gave it 5 stars. We will definitely stay there again when we are in Stillwater. It is perfect for OSU parents visiting their kids. It's about 10-15 minutes from campus.
Janelle and her family are very considerate of their guests, for instance, during our stay the weather was really bad, (severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and tornados) for the area. Janelle's husband called to offer access to their panic room in their home if we felt uncomfortable with the weather. We really appreciated the offer, it was really kind of them to think of us.
Finally, this is not a negative on the property by any means but don't use Waze and Google maps when trying to find the address. We found this out the hard way but on the bright side we saw some beautiful countryside. Apple maps worked perfectly.
I highly recommend this property. I promise, you won't be disappointed.
Thank you!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely adorable! Loved sitting on the front porch in the morning. Bed was very comfortable, place had everything I needed! If I am back in the area I will definitely look up Janelle’s property. It is a peace of heaven on earth!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A most excellent space well worth being outside of town and close to downtown in minutes!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing experience with great hosts
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back when visiting our son 🧡
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were looking for a place to stay with an unplanned change of events. This was exactly what we were looking for and the owner’s quick responses and help with our questions really helped us. We loved it!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and clean! Will definitely be back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This space was beautiful, small house with everything someone would need. Newly renovated and very clean. Well furnished with a comfortable bed and not too far out or town. Janelle and Jeff were very helpful with check-in and some local recommendations!
Only heads up I would provide is that the water heater is small (28 gallons) so the shower only has 5-10 minutes of hot water (with great water pressure). However, there is a heater build into the bathroom vent you can turn on. So for someone who takes longer showers, it still stays comfortably warm if you need to turn the water off here and there to make it last longer!
All considered, it is a great value for the price and I will absolutely stay again if my work brings me back to the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,super easy to work with and very responsive. any questions we had where answered within 5 to 10 minutes.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Stillwater. Close to campus if you are there for an event. Everything was as listed and clean.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute little spot! As an alumni of OSU, returning to Stillwater is one of my favorite things. Andreas' spot was the perfect location and we felt right at home! Had a smoke alarm battery run low and she was extremely responsive when we reached out for a solution!! Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay, always a great time when we come to Stillwater
Centrally Located between downtown and OSU Campus"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by taller apartment buildings that seemingly protect you from the elements is a place where you can relax and unwind. Andrea's place is filled with character and history - a history that may date back to the married housing provided to soldiers returning from WWII who sought to use their G.I. Bill at OSU. The interior makes one feel at home as if visiting a sibling or cousin with really good taste for decoration. The kitchen provides ample space for those who prefer cooking their own meals. The bedroom is spacious, comfortable, and will put you at ease when you need it the most. The bathroom is clean and bright.
Andrea has provided a cozy spot that makes you feel as though you have always belonged to the Stillwater and OSU community. Her Oklahoman hospitality rings true and is a testament to the care Andrea has taken to make your stay comfortable, safe, and quiet for the ""sleepy"" traveler."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a nice place to stay. It is close to campus, clean and decently sized."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Beautiful house! Awesome host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, great location! I was a little worried about parking, but it wasn't an issue at all. I felt very safe and comfortable during my stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at The Nest! Our favorite in Stillwater so far. It’s close to things but seems very remote. I loved sitting on the porch with my coffee in the mornings. Will definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place will book again!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at The Nest. It’s comfortable, clean, laid out well, in (what I like to call) manicured nature, private and filled with natural light (while also having blackout shades). The front porch was a very nice place to sit, chat, eat, read and was almost always shaded from the sun. We loved making s’mores in the fire pit under the string lights. The fire starter log also made the evening incredibly simple. The property is nice to walk around and there is a pond but I’d say it’s on the very very small side. Stillwater itself I cannot recommend as much but if the goal is time away in a nice space to rest The Nest is a home run. A couple spots we found worth mentioning in Stillwater were Devoted (a ramen restaurant tucked away in the back of an Asian market) and Balanced Coffee. Highly recommend this spot."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shelby was quick to respond when I needed to add day to my stay at the last minute.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We chose this location because it was near The Range wedding venue.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning AirBnB. All the details make this one of the best AirBnBs we’ve ever experienced. Hiking trails were a really cool surprise as well! Incredible property in Stillwater OK.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully decorated, charming cottage in a quiet area south of town. Great alternative to a hotel stay during football season when 2 night stays are required. The bed was very comfortable and I enjoyed hearing the rain on the metal roof at night. I would love to visit in the fall or winter months to sit outside by the fire pit and enjoy the fall foliage of the surrounding woods. Great Air BnB experience!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, I love everything about the place."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sometimes we do Airbnbs and we wonder why. The places aren't as nice as they used to be, they don't provide necessities etc.
And then you go to a place like this that is everything they say it is and more.
New, fresh, clean. Amazing location. Modern and on trend. Walking trails, etc.
I loved this place and would go back a million times."

The cottage is wonderful, but we also really enjoy the grounds.
The communication with our hosts was awesome. We have stayed twice this last year….and both times the response to any question was almost immediate. The second visit I struggled to get the fire lit, and our host was there in 5 minutes to get it going.
I’m inspired to have my own Air B&B like these someday. So important to have a place to escape and getaway."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nest is SUCH a beautiful place to stay! The decor and aesthetic were all very well thought out and just gorgeous. The amenities were all I needed to cook a light meal and settle in by the fire. The bed and linens were excellent and the bathtub with bath salts provided were a great touch! It's a little tucked away, but that made it quiet and peaceful. I loved everything about this rental and highly recommend it!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing!!! Good luxury feel and secluded enough you most likely won’t see anybody and can relax. Unfortunately we spent most of our time at the venue which is absolutely beautiful too and sleeping. We will definitely be back with the kids on a warmer day to enjoy the private lake. Canoes and fishing gear being provided is a great touch.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nest is lovely. I stayed for a solo getaway as a gift for Mother’s Day, and it was perfect—beautiful decor, comfortable furnishing, quiet surroundings, nice kitchen appliances & cookware, wonderful soaker tub—I could go on and on. I’ll definitely be back!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect lightning quick responses, a beautifully curated space, and a location that is everything it is advertised to be. Katie spared no detail."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One word: wow. This place is absolutely beautiful. It's close to town, but outside of town so you feel secluded and not crowded. It's a wonderful place to stay since it's so clean, great bathroom with a soaking tub, stocked fridge, fireplace and fire pit with wood provided, and an incredibly squishy bed. Definitely one of the best air bnbs we have stayed in and if we drove through again, this will be where we stay."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can not say enough good things! Close to the city but you feel like you are by yourself. The house is beautiful, so cozy, and has everything you need for a comfortable get away plus more. The extra touches like the pond, the fireplace, the firepit, the extra comfy bed, even the lighted drive way make this a top choice. We will definitely be returning! Book and enjoy! the"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an amazing stay! Great romantic getaway. Extremely clean and beautiful!!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this (the nest) as an Anniversary surprise. And... Oh man, were we both surprised!!!
Turned out much better than I could imagine. Everything about this place was amazing! After settling in, we drove a whopping 4 miles to enjoy dinner. After dinner, I started a nice fire outside in the shared chill space. Wife beat me to the tub while I was watching the fire. The tub was awesome!!! I soaked in it for Atleast 30 minutes. Just what this tired body needed! Then, to close the the evening, we played card games by the fireplace. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Who says I’m not Romantic? I will definitely book this place again in the near future.
Thanks Katie!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best place in Stillwater to stay! Really awesome place with tons of space! Katie was very kind and helpful. Can’t wait to come back :)

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could rate The Nest ten stars, I absolutely would! From the location to the small touch of hand sanitizer and gloves, Katie thought of all the things you would need for the weekend. It was the perfect place to stay as I celebrated friends getting married at Sparrow Beginnings. Thank you for be such a hospitable and fantastic host, Katie!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our family’s favorite little place to stay when we visit my brothers. My 3 year old continuously asks to visit his “uncles town, so we can fish and make marshmallows”. Such a beautifully done home, such kind accommodating hosts, great fun and adventure around every corner.
We love staying here so much, and I can’t speak highly enough."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay in this beautiful cottage. Used the fire pit both evenings! It was very quiet and the Maximum drive to anywhere in Stillwater was 10 minutes
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was just so cute. I wish I could bring the kitchen and bathroom home with me. Very clean. Great location. I would for sure consider returning for another longer stay.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great place to stay! It’s really cute with a nice fire pit and pond behind the cottage. The pond is small but my husband caught plenty of bass. Highly recommend!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place! Definitely recommend!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"ALL TIME FAVORITE!
This was one of the best Airbnb homes we’ve ever stayed in. My wife, two sons and I had an amazing time here! The cabin is cozy, and a perfect size for our family. The home is about a seven minute drive to town, and only about ten minutes from Walmart if you need anything. The bed and couch bed are comfy, the AC works great, and the bathroom is huge. The kitchen has all amenities you’d need to cook meals too. We spent a lot of time on the front porch while it rained and stayed dry. Plus there’s a nice fire pit if you want that one evening.
But the cool part is you’re far enough out and secluded (minus the other cabin next door) that you feel isolated and away from it all. You’re surrounded by lush trees, grasses and flowers that allow you to relax and slow down. Plus plenty of birds chirping and frogs croaking to make you feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. Bonus: tons of fireflies at night!
Plus, there’s a private pond right behind your cabin! We fished on and off for four days and caught tons of bluegill and a few bass. My son caught his first fish on this trip too!
As for the hosts, you couldn’t ask for better. They were super fast at responding, and were extremely helpful. This was hands down one of our favorite Airbnb stays to date! Our son might have thrown a little fit when we told him we had to go home today! Can’t wait to go back. If you’re considering this place, do it! You’ll be as happy as we were."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Katie’s place was very nice and we had a wonderful stay. Check in was a breeze and it had all the amenities for a wonderful stay. My only regret was booking just one night because multiple days/nights here would have been refreshing. I highly recommend.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little place was absolutely adorable. My husband is a builder and I design. We loved this cottage! The finishes and quality craftsmanship were so nice. They had a pond and a dock. They also had a fire pit outside. We loved the gas fireplace inside. It was so cozy. We will definitely be booking again!

I was so sad to leave this morning and was already planning home improvements myself! Cozy, warm, and inviting, this place cannot be overrated enough. Thank you Susan for the amazing privilege of staying in your cottage! Excellent communication throughout the whole process!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"all around, we were pleased with our stay. It's in an old home with cute, up to date decor very well done. Was clean. Not so much under the bed in the middle bedroom. Granddaughter dropped something that rolled under the bed I had sweep it out from under. Old socks and much dust! The showers had intermitted hot and cold water even though we spread out our showers. The beds were comfortable. Outside of the main bedroom, a light kept coming on and going off throughout the night keeping me awake. Might have been the house behind us with the dogs. Which by the way just happened to be the house my deceased brother lived in! We were in Stillwater for his funeral. The back yard was awful and empty aluminum cans were lying around. The home can benefit from a visit from an exterminator because we killed lots of spiders! In all, I'd like to thank the hosts for all their quick responses and for making an older home comfortable and ecstatically comfortable. Toni"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot, very quiet neighborhood. The town is small, so everything is convenient. It’s only a two minutes from a local park and 5 minutes from the town pool. The sleeping arrangements were not super clear so my recommendation would be to check to make sure it works to have the sofa sleeper in the primary room
That said, the primary room bed was SO comfortable. We slept great and the fan kept the room cool. I have a kid that sleeps HOT and their room (with the loft) got a little toasty but the AC cooled down the house quickly.
Owners responded within minutes when I had a technical issue with the front door."

The place is immaculate and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. The host did inform me prior to my stay about the properties on either side. They are a little run down but theu are actively working to clean them up and make the area better.
The ONLY negative I have is there is a recycling place behind the house and they start early. But this is not something controlled by the host and doesn't affect my rating for the location.
I would 1000% stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located. There is a recycling collection center immediately behind this house, and it gets busy early Saturday mornings. Keep that in mind if you intend to sleep in. Luckily, we had things we needed to do - including taking recycling to that very center - so that wasn't an issue for us."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place itself was the absolute cutest place I’ve stayed. The best decorated and well thought out. Very welcoming hosts.
All that said, while it was pretty, the mattress is rock hard and I could not sleep. I’m not asking for a temperpedic or anything, but I would like to not feel like I’m sleeping on a wood floor. Renting an Airbnb has one purpose, and that is to have a place to rest. I had to be up there for one evening, and since I had to get up at 3:45 AM to drive back for work the next day, I wanted a place to sleep to avoid falling asleep on the road back. I maybe got 2 hours of sleep because of the mattress.
There are no curtains, so I also felt like people could look though the windows. There are blinds, just not that added security of curtains.
Being by myself, I didn’t feel safe in that neighborhood.
Again, super duper cute— just didn’t serve the purpose of rest that I desperately needed and missed out on for the rest of the work week."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great , well-designed nestled spot close to OSU and downtown Stillwater. As a seasoned ""AirBnBer"" , if Amy and Team are not yet super hosts, they are on the fast track to becoming so. They provided all the ""little things"" that add up to a great experience. The bed & bedding was very comfortable and we really enjoyed the pillow mists (an example of a little thing)."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to stay! Every detail taken care of, beautifully decorated, close to campus! We loved our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was just as described! Enjoyed our stay! Will definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was so pleasant from the minute we walked in. Extremely clear and easy directions to enter the home. Walked in and it was so fresh smelling and clean. The decor was so beautiful. The quality was really nice with the bed, bedding, and small details down to the hand soap which was very pleasant to see in an Airbnb. If we visit Stillwater again in the future we would definitely love to stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here! Made it so I had a nice relaxing place to stay that was quiet and peaceful! Lots of places close by to go eat at and a lot to explore all around. Perfect location and beautiful house!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simply a phenomenal value! You are unlikely to find a cleaner or better appointed property at this price point anywhere on Airbnb.
Everything is top notch and no corners cut anywhere. Would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated and such a cute, comfortable place. Great place to stay for a weekend in Stilly!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this by far was the cleanest one I have stayed in. It’s beautifully decorated and Amy was very accommodating. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place!! Well worth the price! We will definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, whole house was nice. Best Airbnb experience I’ve had."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is perfect - modern conveniences, pristine, comfortable, with local restaurants and cafes nearby. Amy was an excellent host and quick to respond. There is a business in the back which can be noisy during the week, but quiet on the weekends. Good price for such a nice place."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Boho 405 was perfect. We were super close to the downtown area, which was great for the event we were in town for. The house is thoughtfully decorated with a guest’s needs in mind, and Amy was great about communicating with us before we arrived. Thank you for the great stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful clean stay in Stillwater and great communication of the property!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house was spotless!! So clean, smelled so nice!! Decor was wonderful, brand new consturction! One of the best air b&bs we have stayed as far as the actual home was concerned. It was located in an older part of town and the owners have purchased the two lots on each side of the super cute house. The lots have vacant houses on them at this time. The host did message me the day before our arrival to let me know what to expect when we arrived. I probably would have felt at ease if my husband would have been with me, but this trip was just for my daughter and I. I would definitely stay here again if my husband were along for the trip. It will be super nice when the homes next to this house are finished :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute, new clean house! Well appointed and friendly host. Close to campus!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! I loved the little touches that was throughout the house. House is close to many restaurants and downtown. At first the area looks sketchy, but the neighbors were very nice. If Amy is not a super host, she will be soon!!! I will stay here again and planning to in July!!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place is so beautiful and cozy! It as very clean and smelled amazing. The home was decorated perfectly. It was also well stocked with just about everything. Anytime we’re in Stillwater, this is where we’ll be staying."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy and Camaron were great hosts! They made it easy for guests to check in and out with very minimal steps. The location is minutes away from campus and great restaurants/shopping areas. The house itself is very clean, updated, and very aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend anyone coming to stillwater to check this place out. Will definitely be returning here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute house!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute and so perfect for me to visit my kid at OSU. Way better than a hotel and just the perfect size. It was a great place to hang out. I loved the bathroom and laundry facilities. They have thought of everything and leave you wanting for nothing. Do note that there is some facility that in the mornings has trucks backing up or something with beeping. So if you like to sleep in, consider some ear plugs."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was clean, comfortable and homey. It was the perfect place for a little getaway."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely little house with anything you would need to have an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend and stay again if in the area.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful trendy home, we loved the look of the whole home! Plenty of towels and everything you could need for a stay! The location looks iffy but the house has been completely redone. I lived in the outskirts of Stillwater for many years before moving away, and its a safe and lovely college town! Amy was wonderful to work with and helped us out when winter storm Elliott changed up our Christmas travel plans. Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s, but this one is the best. It has all the perfect touches. The layout is perfect. This place will stay booked out. Quiet location, easy access to everything, comfy furniture, overall Top Notch.
Special shout-out to the cool end table Bluetooth speaker. I’m trying to stay at this spot every time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great! The pictures shown in the listing are accurate! Unlike the old outdated pictures on the internet, the home is new, clean, and in a safe location! It was pristine and comfortable. Real close to coffee shops and restaurants, and easy to get in and out of. Would definitely stay here again!"

Will stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place 👌
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place to stay and do activities
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is amazing but the rooms are not so much. I was staying right next to the back door, for which the lock wasn’t working and every time people checked in the made unnecessary noises and I didn’t get any sleep over the week.
The arrangement is weird because the bedroom didn’t had any bathroom so I had to walk across the hall just to use the toilet.
I wouldn’t recommend this room to anyone because you won’t have any peaceful sleep."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So cute, so clean, so cozy! Room smelled amazing, looked just like the pictures, and beds were extremely comfy. The private bathroom was directly across from the room, and you have to cross the shared hallway, but, you have the only key and it locks behind you, so I never felt unsafe or that I didn’t have enough privacy! I have a son at OSU for the next 3 years and I will definitely be booking this one for every weekend I come to visit! Hosts were proactive, responsive and friendly and I would highly recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, Tammy was very quick to respond."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely a great patio for friend get-togethers during the wintertime ! Warm and many amenities.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Tammy was responsive and it was very clean. Only downside was we could not get warm shower water. This could have been from the cold weather though. The room itself was warm however which was my main concern.
Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space and very affordable. Clean, comfortable and cozy! Just perfect for what we needed!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved -already rebooked for next year
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was great, instructions on how to get into building were easy. Only downside is other guests when they come in can get noisy at times from the door opening and closing. We had the end room though. Not the hosts fault by any means."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is an easy walk to the stadium. Great price.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We will always stay here when we visit Stillwater. The place is perfect for our family of 4, and very clean, great setup and great price. I believe this was our 4th stay and it always gets better."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay and host!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Host was super responsive and friendly. The only complaint I have was the location of the restroom and all the rooms are connected to the same HVAC system. Me and my fiance were freezing and had to take the comforter off the other bed and contemplated leaving because of the cold. Mind you it was 35 degrees outside and when I reached out to the host, they said I could turn the heat up to 65 degrees and then during the middle of the night another guest turned the air conditioner back on to 62 degrees.
Great value for the price but being a heated blanket for the winter time."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute place, very affordable and just about perfect! The showerhead is really horrible though, water sprays everywhere and that part of the experience was rather unpleasant. Hoping for a relaxing hot shower after a long day (finally getting in around 9pm) and I wanted to get out almost immediately. I asked the host directly if she was planning on changing the showerhead and she ignored my question completely after reading it. So I assume that to mean, no. :) Other than that minor irritation, the stay was excellent."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay with Tammy and it was great! It was very clean and inviting. It was such a great price too. We will always search for Tammy’s rentals when we come to town.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"White cottage is a perfect place to stay in Stillwater! The linens, mattress, furnishing and decor is new, clean and welcoming. The bathroom was immaculate and very updated. Tammy is a wonderful host and makes the whole check in process very easy. Location is excellent for staying close to the university and Main Street. This will be my go to place for future visits to Stillwater!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Property was exactly what we were looking for. Tammy was a lovely host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is my second stay at Tammy's in a different room. Great stay yet again. thank you Tammy!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This room was a very nice room and a pretty good space. It was slightly hard to find where to park because maps will take you past the front of the building and you have to go down an alley to get to the parking area. 100% will stay again if in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A few months ago, we stayed at an airbnb in Stillwater that was actually a hotel. lt did not meeting our expectations and I hoped this airbnb was better.
Man, this airbnb was 100% better. We stayed in the Rustic Cottage and it was perfect for our stay. It was clean and cozy. The neighborhood is fine and its so convenient. The complimentary water, coffee, and eating utensils all came in handy. We will definitely be staying back. The bed, it was so soft and comfortable. We actually slept painfree and wish we could've slept longer, therefore, my only recommendation is if you stay to bring a sleeping mask, which we will do next time. Otherwise, as soon as the sun comes up, you're up too.
Book this airbnb if in Stillwater."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd stay at Tammy's place. The white cottage was cozy and the beds were so comfy! So thankful she let us do some much needed laundry and she was very responsive to needs we had. Her husband is so kind and super helpful. We will stay again when we are back in town.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Location near downtown and Oklahoma State Univ. Many restaurants and activities nearby. Entrance in rear of building has about 4 uneven steps down to entey door. It's fine if you’re youngish.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tammy was quick to respond and help us with all of our needs. Perfect place to stay when visiting kids at OSU. We will definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tammy’s place is my go-to when visiting Stillwater. The accommodations are exactly as shown in her pictures and description. My only complaint has nothing to do with the accommodations but with inconsiderate guests sharing the space who slam doors or talk loudly in the hallway and bathroom. Please be respectful of other guests trying to sleep!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot just as advertised. Responsive host and comfortable spot. Great value for the price
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay for 1 or 2 people.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here. Rented because we were in from out of town for a soccer camp. It was close to restaurants and campus so made everything easy. Very cozy! Definitely check out the gourmet popsicles across the street❤️Would definitely stay here again.
Depending on the room you rent you may have a private bath. We didn’t and knew that, had zero issues even though there were others sharing the bathroom too. But if you don’t want to I would say look at the rooms and get one that has its own."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tammy responded very quickly to my communications. She even helped me navigate the air bnb website when we wanted to extend our stay. We had a great time at her place and would definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,amazingly great value! such a fun place to stay. I wish we had had twice as long to be able to enjoy it.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Will stay again! Can’t beat the price.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place stay
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was a clean and nice little place to stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am in Stillwater weekly and I often stay at Tammy's place. She is my absolute favorite host here. She is very responsive and goes above and beyond to make the stay easy. Her extra touches and cute decorations are just an added bonus. I highly recommend a stay with Tammy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Previous review of this room still stands. One suggestion would be to bring your own power strips as plug -ins aren’t easily accessible. Overall great stay and inexpensive!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage room was just as described. The bathroom is a shared bath but located right across the hall. I never found myself waiting for the shower or toilet. The room is located by the exit also. There were a couple of times other guests were coming or going late in the evening and the doors were a little noisy. Sound machines have been placed to attempt to drown out noise. This room has a separate kitchen space with a Keurig coffee pot and small fridge. Bed was comfortable. Plug-ins aren’t very accessible. Overall, great place to stay for the value!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable bed and central location.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was more than wonderful! Tammy was an excellent host and humble about her place, to say the least. It was beyond expectations and she has truly done a Beautiful job decorating each room. I would absolutely love to stay again sometime and I will be recommending it to anyone who needs an affordable, clean and all around comfortable place to get away."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tried to book on of her other properties, but one of the days wasn’t available. Gave me links to her other properties and made it extremely easy and was very flexible. Room as described, bathrooms are tiny, but for a quick affordable stay it isn’t a deterrent. Will definitely stay there again for any trips I have to Stillwater."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable bed & well prepared small kitchen – I appreciated the morning coffee choices. Tammy was friendly & super responsive. I’ll stay again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tammy was a great host! The accommodations were above my expectations.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place, not to private. It snowed the night we stayed so the shower took forever to get hot. But all in all it was nice"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Good value for the price.
It was a room with two beds as advertised. There are 2 shared restrooms (one with a shower) for all the rooms. The room we had was close to the front door and across from bathroom. The room door did little to filter the hallway noise. Not a huge issue as we use white noise on our phones at night to sleep. Even with white noise, we were easily able to hear activity in the hallway.
Everything was clean and it worked for a 1 night stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just like described. Very secure. Perfect for our one night quick stay!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great as usual! Always a great place to stay!
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The description was inaccurate. It says 1.5 bath. The bath was across the hallway and a community bath. You have to just peak out of your room to see if the bathroom is available. Front door was unlocked, so anyone could have come in during the night. Also, it was very warm in the bedroom during the night. The bed was comfy and room was pretty clean. It worked for a short night stay."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,great location. Cottage cozy and clean. If people are staying in other cottages it can be noisy as they come and go and talk loud in hallway. a good value for the price.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! It was clean, just what we needed in space. We loved the layout of the Airbnb. This location is great for friends or couples traveling together.

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Tammy was a helpful hostess during our stay! Our only complaint/concern was one of the other guests staying there would leave the main door unlocked and he was very loud when entering and exiting the building.

2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Great location and Great Host
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. Comfy and Cozy. Not easy to find especially in the dark. Only complaint was hearing the other guests that came in much later than us. The entry door was closest to our room. The shared bath directly across the hall was also noisy. Doors are old wooden creaky doors difficult to open close so not very quiet as other guests went in and out.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a short stay. Very clean and comfortable beds great location. Had some noisy neighbors which wasn't ideal but made the best of that situation. Would stay again
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute little place to stay! My husband and I stayed here for about four days and didn’t have a rental car so we were so grateful it was in the middle of town and we could walk pretty much everywhere!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was truly surprised to find this hidden gem!!!
It was just my husband and I for the stay!
Before our arrival I was skeptical because I had never stayed in a setting like this before but our stay was wonderful and really opened me up to looking for rooms instead of houses from now on.
The communication with Tammy was very timely. The privacy was remarkable, everyone stayed to themselves and wasn't loud! We stayed in the White Country Cottage.
When looking for a place to stay we will certainly look for this Tammy's openings first. Thank you for being a wonderful host we look forward to staying again!!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The Airbnb was nice, it was in a good location and the hosts are absolutely wonderful. There was an issue that they were quick to handle, which we are grateful for.
The rooms are a bit smaller than what we anticipated and there was no where to store our clothes, and building it’s self was hard to find at first (hence the 4/5). Other than that, I would stay here again and absolutely love Tammy and her husband!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Super comfy bed. Keyless entry.
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a room with a shared bathroom (1 1/2 bathrooms) with 2 more rooms available to rent. The pictures and description of our room were accurate. The room could have been cleaner especially the floor, which needed to be vacuumed. Two large fluorescent lights were on the ceiling in the bedroom. I thought this was a poor choice for lighting. The rooms and bathrooms were located in a long dark hallway. It is located in a business area.
On the night we stayed, there were people banging on the main door at 11:30 p.m. Then, later in the night there were several people standing at the main door entrance , talking loudly and laughing. A little after that I heard someone trying to open the door to our room. I opened the door and they said that the room that we were in was the same room that they booked and that the owner must have double booked it. It was a terrible night."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tammy's house is very comfortable and cozy. The location is super good, my husband needs to go to training school so I don't have a car to use. But because of the location, I can walk 10-15 minutes to the art museum, and the history museum. It's on main Street in less than five minutes. It's amazing. It said is half bathroom, in fact you can use the whole bathroom and toilet if you tell Tammy.It's very private. I highly recommend this house if you go to Stillwater！！"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed 5 nights total.
Kiersten was over-the-top on customer service. She worked with me on my indefinite booking dates due to the uncertainty of my grandson's birth. She even quickly readied the place for just one night when the birth time was later in the day than I thought.
Then, I returned 2 weeks later to help out with new baby and finish the remaining 4 nights. She even let me see the place a month or two before since I was staying many nights.
My multiple questions she answered quickly and when there was a need while I was there, she was johnny on the spot, going the extra mile.
The only item those who stay may want to know is there is no garbage disposal, in case you plan to cook alot. That did not affect me as I ate at my daughter's or had take out.
Another plus was the new washer/dryer, which was handy as I washed many loads for my daughter's machine which was on the blink.
A house-infused subtle, calming scent each day was welcomed.
Thank you. I will stay again."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Kiersten’s place! It was perfect for my husband and I and our two dogs. It is not a huge place, but it was just the right size for 2 adults. It was stocked with everything we needed and was well accommodated for dogs with the fully fenced-in back yard. The entire house was also nicely updated and modern. We would definitely recommend this rental to others and will stay again ourselves if we get the chance!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It is a neat, relatively new little home (think tiny house-concept) in a great location. Most suitable for 1-2 persons. The kitchen is well-equipped, which makes it good for both short or longer term stays in Stillwater. The WiFi works well, and there is streaming (Netflix etc) available on the TV’s. Highly recommended!"

The house itself is a gem in the neighborhood, brand new inside and out, all updated and very cute. It's perfect for two people and accommodating for pets, our dogs had room to do their business outside in the small yard. If we visit again we will definitely check here first!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Entering the property, my boyfriend was instantly impressed (that says a lot)!! Lol. We are both really picky about where we lay our heads. Even more so, since COVID…We never felt like we couldn’t be comfortable in the home. The house has nice relaxing energy, with kind of a rustic feel, clean, and well kept. Toiletries, pots, pans, cleaning, and washing supplies are all provided. This cute little house has everything your heart could desire!! The neighbors in the area, on the other hand, were kinda sketch.. they watched us a lot, whenever loading our vehicle or retrieving our food deliveries.. but, that has absolutely nothing to do with the host!! She was great!! She personalized our experience and we had such a relaxing time. Thanks so much!! This will be our pick above hotels when we just want to experience quiet time, alone in the city. We will definitely return. This staycation was exactly what we needed!! 5 stars for the host, the house, and the amenities!! 3 stars for the area and neighbors… either way, we enjoyed ourselves and so can you and your loved one.. book asap and please respect the property! This is truly a HIDDEN GEM in Stillwater, Oklahoma!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great experience with Kiersten and her property. We would for sure stay there again if we’re ever needing a place to stay in that area in the future. Super nice house with everything you’d need to feel like you’re at home.
