2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay here. The pictures don’t do it justice. Such a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere in the house and garden. There is even a swing chair in the kitchen! I especially loved the master bedroom. Super comfy bed and linens, and the room was just so relaxing.
We felt treated with all the cereals, snacks and cooking supplies provided.
Hosts were quick to respond and kind. I could really go on about everything. The block it’s on is lovely and walkable. A few blocks away is a little rough looking but we only found that out by walking around the town. If we ever come by this was again, I would stay here."

A great escape for the weekend or a week - very close to the Allegheny River Trails as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Historic, well maintained home. Like staying in a museum. Can’t wait to research more of the history.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay. The house is even bigger than I expected, and was truly perfect for our family gathering! Absolutely everything we needed was there and easy to find. Extra chairs and high chair in the cabinet. Every pot, pan, and utensil needed to cook a big meal. We were 2 adults and 4 kids ranging in age from 2-15 and we could all spread out and find something to do, whether relaxing in the very comfortable living room, coloring in the office, or throwing a football in the *huge* backyard. There were 6 of us, but if you were a larger group you could also be very comfortable! The setup is excellent and very spacious for meals, sleeping, etc.
Ryan was a great host- easy to find the place, easy to get in, very communicative. Thanks so much for a great stay!"

It wasn't clear in the description, but there's a nice breezeway as you enter the house, which made a nice staging area for coats, bags, etc.
The house was nicely decorated, but without much that we needed to worry about the kids breaking. One of the bedrooms with a large bed had a convenient closet where we set up the provided pack & play and left the door cracked for a little one to sleep.
Ryan was communicative and obliging as well. Overall, it was one of the best places for us to stay as a family while spending time with other relatives in the region (both at their houses and at Ryan's place)."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at Nellie and Thomas’ house - it was the perfect place for my wife, mother and our dog to have a home away from home where we could also socialize with my wife parents, as we were in town for Easter. The apartment had everything we needed and my mother enjoyed the peaceful view of the river from her bedroom and the kitchen. We will definitely stay again when visiting Franklin!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great stay for the few weeks we were here. Host was very communicative. The river view is great!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Not only was this place beautiful, but the hosts are wonderful people. I needed a long term place to stay while working a contract, and Nellie and Thomas’s place felt like an actual home to come “home” to after work week after week.
They put a lot of love into making their place comfortable for anyone who stays.
Also, communication was amazing, checking in with me if I needed anything, answered any question I had almost immediately.
Nellie and Thomas set the bar pretty high for how to run a beautiful Airbnb.
Thank you for everything.
Absolutely will stay here again if I’m ever back in the area."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nellie and Thomas’s house on the Allegheny river has beautiful nature views spanning the whole backside of the first floor. It’s located right beside a boat launch that offered lots of grassy spots to walk our poodles. Every little added amenities from a charging station on the nightstand to onsite washer and dryer. A mirror in all 3 bedrooms, large closets with hangers, a shoe holder, and a luggage stand. Everything to make you comfortable while you are away from home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. House is big and perfectly decorated. River view is great. House is the last in the block Neighboring a boat launch which extends the view.
There is some traffic sound from the highway across the river but mostly quiet. Good to know that there is a lower apartment which could be rented. We look forward to coming again. Thanks Nellie and Thomas."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My dog Lincoln and I had a peaceful stay at Nellie and Thomas’s home. We really enjoyed the wrap around porch deck, and watching the mallard ducks fly down to the river. The first evening we arrived in was sunny and warm, and the last day we were there, it was snowing! We got to witness Springtime at its finest! Thank you so much for this memorable getaway. We were escaping from East Palestine, Ohio and the Norfolk Southern train derailment clean up-which is very close to our home.
We hope we can stay here again in the future, under much better circumstances!
Thank you again for everything.
Lonnie and her best friend, Lincoln ❤️"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Immediately fell in love with the view of the river! From the kitchen to the dining room to two of the three upstairs bedrooms, the view is amazing! My wife and I talked about taking another trip over warmer months and working remote so we could enjoy the river during downtime.
Convenient to everywhere. Very clean and cozy. Left wanting to buy the place. 😂❤️
We’ll definitely be repeat guests.
Only downside (and this is probably my fault for not researching a little better) is that I thought we truly had the whole home to ourselves (per the description).
Discovered the home was split into two separate rental units upon arrival. We rented the larger upper unit (3 bed, 1 bath), but there’s another unit on the ground/basement level of the house.
We have a daughter who has some pretty intense ‘stranger danger’ at times and she was uncomfortable the last night when a new group checked into the lower unit. She (we) were so worn out from hiking all day that we crashed pretty quickly."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This upper unit is basically a 3 bedroom house. Bed was comfy, bathroom is good size with tub/shower, cozy tv room on the first floor, large kitchen with everything you could want. It is right on the river, I enjoyed watching the water and hearing the birds. Peaceful neighborhood. Hosts are very helpful and accommodating. Everything very clean. The stairway to the second floor might be a little steep for older people, but stairs are carpeted. The house is right next to the boat launch, and place where you can rent kayaks. Great location!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful and relaxing stay with great views

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nellie and Tom were helpful, responsive immediately, and very thoughtful. Household furnishings were functional but also lovely, edited, peaceful, pleasurable. They even decorated for Christmas, that's the spirit!
Great Internet connections and access to Prime.
Riverfront is beautiful in any season, we so enjoyed walking along river front. We loved the private parking and walking area immediately beyond the house. Summer time would afford great campfire activity.
Kitchen dining bistro table easily seated five for meals and games, with another three seats available at end of the kitchen bar. We cooked meals in the well stocked kitchen that included every cookware piece you will need.
Excellent time at this Airbnb. Well done!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest AIRBNB we have ever stayed in around the Franklin/Oil City area.

So many extra touches in the home and additional amenities provided a wonderful experience. Conveniently located to adventure and activities. House immaculate, furnishings beautiful and very comfortable. Communication with hosts very prompt. Large kitchen table was great for playing cards and games on a rainy day. Kitchen well stocked. Chairs and campfire site along the creek provided such a relaxing time. Porch rocking chairs were so nice for morning coffee. If you are in the area, I would not recommend any other place but this. Absolutely the best AirBNB we have every stayed at."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved staying in Nellie and Thomas' place! The view from the kitchen and dining area is of the river. This is the main reason we chose this place. The main floor is spacious; all the cabinets and drawers in the large open kitchen are labeled so it's easy to find what you're looking for. The beds are extremely comfortable and the house was immaculate when we arrived. Nellie and Thomas responded very quickly when we contacted them about a couple of things we needed and immediately took care of us.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We went away for a weekend to go hiking. Everything was clean and had cozy vibes. The view of the river was pretty to look out at in the mornings. No issues with anything, and Nellie and Thomas replied within the hour if we had questions about the place."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed and Nellie and Thomas's Allegheny River Retreat from 5 to 9 September and very much enjoyed our stay. The house is spacious and nicely furnished with 3 bedrooms and a bath upstairs, and living, dining and kitchen on ground level, washer/dryer in the basement. Attention to detail in quality of furnishings, coffee and tea provided, dishes and silverware, and appliances were at a level above what we've experienced thus far in our Airbnb experiences. During our stay, Nellie and Thomas were quick to answer questions about various things like trash pick-up and checkout checklists, when I messaged them. Before arriving, we were worried about parking on the street, but after arrival we found that parking was not an issue as the house is situated on a quiet end of the street. We came to ride our bikes on the many trails in the area - - it was well worth the trip. This area has one of the best networks of bicyling trails in the country. We look forward to making this same trip in the autumn of next year and hope Allegheny River Retreat will be available for our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is absolutely beautiful! It is right next to the Franklin Boat Launch so it’s super easy to access the Allegheny River. It is also close to a cute town with lots of good restaurant options. Nellie and Thomas are super responsive and accommodating. The house has everything you would need and the location is amazing, views of the Allegheny River and Mountains. If you plan to kayak use the recommendation to plan OARS to pick you up down stream, the current can be tough to paddle back upstream to the house. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax in nature and still have WIFI and a SMART TV!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a very nice time at Nellie and Thomas’s home. Besides the beautiful view of the river from the kitchen and dining area, we were very impressed by the coziness and cleanliness of the place. The kitchen was complete with everything you may need, from the basics to a cabinet full of spices, teas, coffee and more. Little things that make you feel at home. The beds and couch are super comfy, perfect for a relaxing weekend. Nellie and Thomas responsiveness to our needs was great, full of suggestions of places to visit and restaurants to try. Great hosts!
N&T, the peach pie was delicious!!!! Thanks!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Your place was absolutely beautiful. The kids loved the large couch and the fact that the TV is a smart TV with Netflix, Disney, and other channels they always watch. The windows in the kitchen are amazing looking out to the river. The beds and the sheeting are excellent! The place is stocked with everything you need for a great stay. We're looking forward to visiting Oil City more knowing that we have a great place to stay in the future. Thanks again for a great stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place to stay, not only can you walk to everything, Nellie and Thomas have thought of everything for you! Great location, very clean, amazing porch and back yard as well.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay and Ryan was very quick to respond to questions. Perfect place to stay if you are looking for a quiet, private place for a weekend and don't need wifi/a TV. Kitchen was outfitted with everything you could need and bathroom was nice too. Also one of the cleanest AirBnBs we've stayed at! We really enjoyed our time here and it is nicer than the pictures, which must have been taken on a cloudy day :-)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay Ryan! This place if fabulous. I needed to get out of the city and booked the morning of my stay. Ryan was quickly responsive to confirm my reservation. This is such a great place for a quiet get away.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful clean and peaceful

2024-01-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"no refrigerator, no wifi. bugs on the bed, floor and wall"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rented this cabin for the weekend as a quiet getaway for New Year’s. It was incredibly quiet and serene and just what I needed to relax and unwind. Even got to visit the adorable church right across from it! The place was also very clean. If there was one thing I’d change, it would be that there needs to be a fridge/freezer. Other than that, it was perfect and very fairly priced! I definitely want to come back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Host was absolutely great at communicating and I couldn’t ask for a better place to stay. Everything was super clean and peaceful
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is a bit back in, but other vehicles in and out on the main drive to the prayer chapel. No one in main house while we were there. Everything was great, and as described, except no fridge. Since we were expecting a fridge, we brought stuff to cook that needed to be cold. Since it was winter, we could keep it in the vehicle. Nice peaceful, fairly private spot. Close to Cranberry and Oil City with nice varied shopping and restaurants."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful and serene surroundings, and a really cozy place to stay the night!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can't say enough good things about our stay. It was quiet & peaceful. Wish it hadn't rained so we could've got a walk in. If you're looking to get away & detach from distractions this is the place. Ryan is very responsive & considerate. We would highly recommend Ryan's place & this will be our go to when coming back to visit family.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place for a great price with some beautiful scenery!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot was a perfect cozy room for a night off the road on a long road trip. it was absolutely perfect for what we wanted in price, size, comfortability, etc!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The best way I can describe this is that it's like a very pleasant clean, simple, basic, furnished studio apartment, with bed, desk, chairs, and kitchen in one open-plan space, with a separate bath consisting of toilet, sink and shower. Pros: Directions and check-in were a breeze, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the kitchen had everything I needed and more-- including full size refrigerator, stove and sink--and the bath was clean, neat and fully functional. It felt like a stay in a tree house, located above another dwelling on the beautiful grounds of a Catholic retreat center conveniently located very near the Van terminus of the Sandy Creek Trail--one of the premier rails-to-trails in Western Pennsylvania. Cons: water processing system is noisy after flushing, as is the frig. The skylight above the bed leaked a bit of cold air. The thermostat was hard to program. Otherwise, a great stay in a great place at a great price! I'd happily book again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. As advertised, clean and peaceful. Ryan gave very clear and detailed check-in and location directions. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our check-in was at 3 PM but so was our first event in the area. We requested and were granted an early check-in. Upon arrival, the code hadn’t been changed and it had not been cleaned. Ryan quickly helped us get inside, we changed and went off to our event and everything was fresh and clean when we got back. This place was exactly what we needed for a couple of days and was very relaxing. We would return for another visit anytime!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here with a friend as a pitstop along the way to my destination. It was really easy to get to, clean, peaceful, and felt safe! The pictures in this listing don’t do the place justice. Definitely worth the stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Detailed directions made it easy to find. Got in late and had no problem checking in. Quiet place just as described in the listing.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The area is only 3 miles from the Cranberry area. It’s not far from Franklin, Oil City or Titusville for things to do or see. There is also stores for anything you might need. The place is quiet and enjoyable. Ryan also is quick to answer questions or give advice. I will recommend it to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We were very pleased all around with the accomodations

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was nice to have both coffee and tea available. They even had a small bottle of honey! Thanks, Ryan, for a peaceful retreat!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"Overall it was an okay stay, the location is fairly peaceful and the house is nice. However I did not sleep well due to random noises starting and going during the night. I believe it was the air conditioning from downstsairs, but it startled me a couple of times. I wouldn't repeat because of that, but if you are not a light sleeper, then it's recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Quite and quaint! Just what we needed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's efficiency apartment was pristine, peaceful, and simple. There are well over 120 miles of rail to trails within a 60-minute drive."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. It felt like home. We were attending a wedding about 12 minutes away. It was nice to have a quite place to stay. It is a very nice place, clean and comfortable. The bed had a comfortable mattress. It is secluded and beautiful. Check in was automatic. He gave us the code and we could come and go as we pleased. The room is at the top of the drive. We saw a man walking down the road who pointed it out to us so we had no trouble finding it. you will recognize it when you get up there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, beautiful surroundings, and the apartment was very clean. Would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for the price. Larger than your average hotel with added bonus of kitchen, full fridge and a patio for sipping coffee.
Grocery store is not too far away and tons of paved bike trails and more rugged hiking for lovely views 20-30 minutes away."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,If looking for a place to sleep and shower your basic needs are met. The setting is very private and peaceful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Initially I just needed a place to sleep half way between my road-trip. I was pleasantly surprised to find this hidden gem. It was extremely peaceful and serene. Everything was beyond my expectations. The place was clean, tidy and kept cool during the hot summer day I arrived. Next time I drive back to New York I will definitely book here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic retreat and cabin.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super Cozy, Quiet and Comfy! loved the Pigs! Will def be back! A+ Host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Ryan's place! We only stayed one night but would definitely like to stay again! It was easy to get in and was very private and well-furnished. As an extra surprise there were cute piglets in a pen not too far from where you park.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This studio apartment was a great place to stay while in the area for an archery tournament —spacious and logically laid out. The only thing I would ""caution"" is that the bed would not be comfortable for someone on the taller side, especially if two people are sleeping side by side. I am 5'5"" and was touching the bedframe at the foot of the bed while laying comfortably. But regardless, I would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay and great communication! Thank you Ryan!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cute, clean and comfortable place to stay in western Pennsylvania. Beautiful surroundings."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,adorable little apartment with everything you need. located in a gorgeous wooded area very peaceful lovely.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here for work purposes and it was a lovely retreat to come back to after a long work day. I would come back to stay again 100%
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and great kitchen set up!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is definitely the place to go if you’re looking for a peaceful and quiet stay that isn’t too far from town. We enjoyed our stay and were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and saw that there were adorable piglets outside!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay here was great. My wife and I were looking for something easy and simple while we visit family. The room was clean and looked exactly like the pictures.
The host (Ryan) was great to communicate with. He was clear with instructions and even made sure I could plug my car into the 120v outlet.
Would stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had an excellent stay. Host was friendly and helpful, the setting was peaceful, and the room was comfortable and clean. I highly recommend it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Ryan, for your hospitality. The place was cozy, quiet and as advertised. Take care!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay at!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The value of this AirBnb is great. The location is beautiful, the surrounding towns are pleasant, and the apartment itself has everything you need. I highly recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heron's Landing is a beautiful little apartment that the owner has decorated to make your stay so very relaxing and was remarkably clean. And if you are an old vinyl fan, she even has a good collection of older albums you can play on the turntable. It's easy walking to downtown and the southside of town. Lots of mom-and-pop restaurants and little shops nearby. This is a 2nd floor walkup one flight of stairs. Not a problem for me, but something to keep in mind is you find it hard to walk up steps. Erin also owns the Woods & River Coffee shop you will be staying above. Being that I don't drink coffee, I've never been in a coffee shop, not even a Starbucks. I did have a Cappaccino and told her it was the best one I've had since living in Italy years ago. Make sure you try the Beartown Breakfast Sandwich and homemade muffins. They are out of this world good. Great place to stay being that I haven't been back to Oil City since 1996 and would stay here again. I love my old hometown."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Right in the center of everything. The host was helpful friendly and ready to answer questions. Would highly recommend it everyone
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place met our needs; just the one night for sleeping. It's not plush, but we'd rather have saved the money and stayed cheap. She was helpful with the few questions we had by email back and forth. I'd stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you’re seeing this review. Book now. Best place to stay “.” in the entire area.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute place! Waking up to the birds, sound of the river and smell of fresh coffee is the perfect alarm clock!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Went to the coffee shop and had the pleasure of meeting Erin in person, warm and friendly, great place to stay, host and great coffee!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin was a wonderful host, very responsive and helpful. The place smelled delicious as soon as you open the door (if you like coffee). Super comfy couch in the office. The shower head is a force to be reckoned with, water was hot, but we found the tub drained slower than it filled, so it was a quick shower.
There are designated parking spots, a beautiful library across the street, and the coffee shop downstairs has really yummy breakfast. Their bagels and cream cheese were a fav. and the Blackberry Mocha is the best I've ever had.
If we find ourselves back in Oil City, we'll be booking Erin's place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cozy place! We were looking for something different than a hotel and somewhere that wasn’t far from where we needed to be, and this was it! We loved the easy check in/out and the fact that we were able to cook our own dinner instead of having to find somewhere to go. We also enjoyed relaxing and watching tv on the loveseat instead of a hotel bed. Having our own beds was also nice because we are both bed hogs. Will highly recommend to everyone that travels this way!
Also, LOVED the tea we got in the morning. We will be stopping there again for our drinks!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apt was just what my daughter and I needed. A clean and affordable home base from which to visit a few local colleges. The coffee shop below is cute and has yummy breakfast. We had a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Erin is a super host. She was constantly trying to make guests comfortable and reassured.
It's like a home though you're away from your home.
I'll stay at her place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment with a full kitchen and great views of the river, which was very high and gorgeous in the Spring. Very quiet overnight and we appreciated all the amenities, like the toaster."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay in this apartment, and we enjoyed it very much both times. It’s quite large, and the bird-themed decor and nature books are fun and interesting. The space included everything we needed. We definitely plan to return."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Erin's place and it was just as great as the first time. The apartment is bigger than it looks & is decorated so cute! The view of the river is beautiful & you absolutely cannot beat the price. Our favorite part is listening to vinyl while we get ready in the morning and then heading downstairs for an amazing breakfast sandwich & delicious coffee to start the day. We'll always see if this spot is available when visiting PA from KY. Thanks for another great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Cozy
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is cute & quirky. It's in the center of town, and it was less than a 10 minute walk to my family. Fresh ground coffee was provided, and there were some other beverages in the fridge, that was nice! If you are a light sleeper, this might not be the place for you, as I was woken up every morning around 6:30 am by the sounds of the coffeehouse below. We had some of their lattes, and they were definitely delicious! I shopped around for Airbnb's in the area, and this one was the best value. Also, nice to use washer, and dryer if you are staying a while."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin is such a kind and considerate host. The instructions were clear, and the amenities were awesome. It’s such a treat to wake-up and smell the cozy scent of coffee. I will definitely book again the next time I visit the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Comfy, clean, and cute! We hope to spend more time enjoying this spot and its surroundings next time we are in the area. The coffee shop was a great plus!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I had a wonderful stay and the place was even bigger than the photos which was a nice surprise. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook a nice dinner for my family and honestly the sharpest knives I’ve come across in any Airbnb (thank you!) My favorite part was going downstairs for coffee in the morning. It’s a beautiful coffee shop with really great options for food. I would stay here again in an instant.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin’s place was great! Some of my favorite things were the river views from the windows, the coffee bar with fresh ground coffee from Woods & River, record player with a nice selection of vinyl & the mix of modern & vintage furniture & decor. Being able to walk downstairs for AMAZING coffee & bagels in the morning was a huge bonus. The price was extremely reasonable. Would love to stay there again next time I’m in the area!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying here! We love it!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Huge space with great views of the river on one side and the town on the other. The library is right across the street and the coffee shop in the building was bustling the whole time I was there, the food and drinks were fantastic. The place was great for working with an office in addition to the two bedrooms. All amenities were provided, it was definitely like staying at a friend's house! Would love to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"very cute apartment above the Woods and River coffee shop. very nice view of the river, peaceful atmosphere. Nice record player in the main bedroom with a nice selection of records. Overall a very nice experience!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I never thought I'd find such comfortable, well equipped and lovingly curated accomodations in Oil City. The location above the fabulous Woods and River Cafe and on the river was absolutely perfect. I could always count on wonderful barrista beverages and delicious food in a welcoming and attractive environment right downstairs. Erin is a great host. I'll definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin is a great host and very quick to respond to any questions you may have. The space is as pictured, and was well stocked and very clean. Erin's coffee shop below not only has excellent coffee, but the food is very good as well. We had soup upon arrival and breakfast sandwiches on both of the mornings of our stay...all delicious.
Also, there is a dedicated parking space just steps away from the apartment door. Erin's place worked out perfectly for us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"highly recommended! central, big, clean, quaint, reserved parking spot"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Huge space, felt like a cozy piece of home rather than a stay away in a new place. Hosts are friendly and responsive and care about your stay. Coffee shop below gives great smells in the morning as well as a welcoming breakfast spot in the morning where you can start your work day or gather with family and enjoy great food and even better atmosphere!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb is incredible don't delay in booking as it's absolutely wonderful, clean cute, and cozy. It's also above an absolutely phenomenal coffee shop!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it! I was a little worried at first with the train tracks being right next to the building thinking one could go by on the middle of the night, but we never heard one the whole start. Very cute and convenient with a great coffee shop right before!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very comfortable and well maintained! Enjoyed our stay! Definitely recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What can I say. Great location, very roomy, washer,dryer etc. Pretty much a furnished apartment with a great coffee shop/cafe downstairs. The place is big! 5 rooms plus the bathroom! We can’t wait to come back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I actually booked this for my daughter, as she’d have had a pleasure of staying there before and just LOVED IT!
When I explained to Erin this, she not only remembered her but, she was so responsive and kind!
My daughter and I highly appreciated Erin for her kindness and friendly words. And the apartment is absolutely adorable with all of the necessary amenities! We highly recommend!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a reasonable price. Will stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was such a nice surprise. The pictures don't do it justice- the space was much bigger and nice than expected! And I was impressed at how well stocked everything was. The location was perfect and the place really met our needs!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like we were part of what's good in oil city, right alongside the host 😀"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place was perfect for my stay! I loved her decorations and it was a very welcoming clean comfortable space. If I need to come back to Oil City for work, I will absolutely be seeing if her space is available first 🙂"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was wonderful. The apartment delivered on what it advertised. I was surprised at how beautiful the view of the river was from the bathroom. It was just as gorgeous as the photo. I had some family over to play Scrabble after our get together & was happy to find a nice little selection of LPs on the shelf to spin on the turntable. The bedroom was clean, quiet, as dark as I wanted it to be, with a space heater in the closet if I needed. There were extra blankets & pillows w/2 options of fill sizes. In the morning I could just barely hear the coffee shop starting to open but I was getting up anyway. I don't think it would have awoken me if I hadn't already set my alarm. Even though there was a bag of ground coffee in the kitchen I went into the shop where I met Erin & rec'd my complimentary latte. I must rave about Woods & River! I had them grind & fill a bag to take home, it is that good. The egg Sammy on buttermilk English muffin was divine. Highly recommend! Thanks Erin!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location - a hidden gem. Coffee ready every morning just downstairs. Lots of thought went into the decor and comforts of the apartment. I even found books and records I liked on the shelves. View outside the windows was beautiful and there were lots of places in walking distance. I don’t think you could ask for a better place to stay in the area. Met the host outside of the apartment and she was very friendly and helpful. We had a great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect place to stay. Very comfortable & I think Erin thought of everything! We were able to go to Applefest & School of Rock in Franklin…but stay away from the business! Perfect!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space and great host. Enjoyed the coffee shop below the apartment as well. Perfect for us!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay, and will probably book again. My primary interests are visiting family and genealogy sleuthing, but this location would work for outdoor enthusiasts as well. I found delicious coffee at the Woods & River Coffee shop downstairs (they are really quiet in the morning). Th Oil City Library is just across the street. The South Side of Oil City boasts magnificent Oil Boom mansions. I found the confluence of Oil Creek and the Allegheny River to be fascinating. So, yeah, I will return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spacious second floor apartment is full of wonderful north light, has peaceful views of the Allegheny River below, and is conveniently located in the same building as Woods & River coffee shop -- it's a gem of a place! Highly recommended if you're visiting Oil City or need a place to stay near the bike trail."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had aa great time biking well maintained paths and learning the local history. The ABNB was exactly as listed. Perfect essentials not fluff. The coffee shop below offered great coffee, breakfast sandwiches and pastries including GF items."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and organized. Nicely decorated. Lots of space.
Coffee shop downstairs is a bonus."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay. The unit was so bright and cheery. Loved having the windows open at night to get the river air in. Will definitely stay again when I’m in town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! My best friend and I met at Erin’s place for a thrifting adventure. Little did we know that Erin is an amazing decorator and obviously a great thrifter as well. The apartment is insanely cute, comfortable, well decorated with vintage pieces and it’s above the most amazing coffee shop!! We were so happy with every aspect of this trip! There are so many fun things to do in this area! Highly recommend staying here, we hope to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin was a great host. Had a little problem with my lock box, but she quickly had me inside. One of my best stays ever."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy check in. Convenient location. Coffee shop located below on first floor was a real treat.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Second saty here for us and we loved it again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This very much felt like I was in a comfortable and welcoming home. . . a beautiful location with great city and river views, a spectacular coffee shop on the first floor, welcoming hosts and a friendly and very walkable community. Oil City - and specifically Heron's Landing right above Woods and River Coffee, are really spectacular. I'm definitely going to book again every time I'm in Oil City, PA!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super spacious, clean and nice. The host is very hospitable. Especially great if you are a hiker."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay in Oil City. Lodging was not fancy but an eclectic, fun vibe, clean and with needed amenities. I did not note that there is no AC in the listing (may be there) so that was a surprise but not a problem as it was not hot. Nice view looking out at the river. I wanted something different at a price point below most hotels and this fit the bill! Enjoyed coffee and breakfast at the coffee shop underneath the lodging. Nice to wake up to the smell of bacon and coffee making."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin’s place had everything we needed, and she was so welcoming and hospitable. Great location. Woods & River Coffee is delicious. We loved being able to walk right down to the street and into the shop. Will be staying again next time we visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin was very responsive and always very kind. The apartment was very spacious and clean; I would absolutely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is much larger than we expected! We enjoyed the decor and midcentury modern furniture. It’s a comfortable place we would definitely choose again when travelling to Oil City.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We booked this spot to have a home base to work remotely while camping at night nearby and it was exactly what we were hoping for. The wifi was quick and the coffee shop downstairs was a great place to sit in the mornings. The space was clean and had everything we needed, would definitely stay again next time we visit Oil City."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was very spacious and had every amenity that we needed. There were beautiful views overlooking the Allegheny River and a wonderful coffee shop very close with a variety of baked goods. A specified parking place was also a plus. Erin’s response when communicating was within 15 minutes. This unit is walking distance to most attractions in oil city. It’s a great place to stay and I highly recommend it.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, convenient and with a beautiful view."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place was perfect. We came to the area to explore kayaking on the Allegheny in Franklin and hiking and birding at Oil Creek State Park and this was a great central location for exploring the area.
The apartment is spacious, comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. We had everything we needed and the coffee shop, Woods and River, was excellent!
Erin was friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about the area. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even better than I had hoped! Super clean, bright, pretty views, coffee shop is awesome. I was worried about the noise from the street but it didn’t bother me at all. Great hosts as well - I’ll definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The place was immaculate and charming. And having a coffee shop right below us was an added bonus. We'll definitely come back and have recommended it already to others who go to Oil City periodically.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here during one of my travel nursing assignments and it exceeded my expectations! I have one regret. I wish I could’ve been there more in the daylight hours since the view and overall aesthetic of Erin’s place was amazing! I can only hope that it’s available next time I am in town for work. What a gem!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,a beautiful place to stay. loved the smell of coffee
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great, clean, convenient spot for our stay. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Erin was a great host! We felt right at home and loved the coffee from downstairs. 😊
I wasn’t completely sure what the kitchen would be like, but (although not pictured) there is a microwave, fridge and full stove.
Unfortunately, the bed was not the most comfortable, which is the only reason for my less than 5 star review."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Peaceful setting. Beautifully decorated. Amenities went above and beyond.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Nice in a small town, if you like the smell of coffee and country, this is your place"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and cozy! The coffee shop downstairs is fantastic!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I chose Erin's listing because I was visiting family, doing genealogy work, and I was familiar with the area. I was very pleased with the overall appearance of the unit. It's on the 2nd floor of what appears to be a 100 year old building. The ""front"" faces the Oil City Library and an attractive boulevard; the rear of the apartment faces the Allegheny River. The apartment is attractively furnished in a combo of mid-century modern and thrift store treasures. Lots of books! And a big + is the coffee shop on the 1st floor!
I liked it so much that I've booked a return in October!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very cozy appartment. Interior has lovely accesoires (vintage!). Very calm with a beautiful view at the river. Super friendly and helpful host! Perfect for people who want to enjoy the countryside or simply need a place to sleep during a longer roadtrip/travel.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Such a cute place above a great coffee shop! I travel for work and felt right at home. If I had any issues, Erin is quick to respond. I will absolutely book this place again for my work home. Just wonderful!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The only word is perfect ! simple as that , the airbnb run by the two most amazing people in the world . You can walk right downstairs to enjoy coffee and bagel for their shop. There plenty of room and even had office for me to work from ."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at the apartment. It was very spacious and comfortable. It had beautiful natural lighting and cute views of the river, city, and the library. It had all the amenities and then some that we could have wanted during our stay. We were sad we didn't book it for longer. The location was very convenient and we enjoyed smelling the below coffee shop in the morning and stopping in to grab some coffee and bagels to go. Erin was a great and welcoming host. We will definitely look to stay again the next time we are in the area."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Just a great place to stay. Erin is a great host.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I really liked it. We could cook which saved us a lot of $. The rooms were spotless and very large. There was wifi and a smart TV. Erin and Marcy were the best, very helpful and met all our needs. We definitely would stay there again."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough about Erin and the team and their offering! First off great communication and incredibly friendly! The accommodations were roomy and cozy! While I didn't spend much time inside, the bed was very comfortable and the amenities were great. The ladies were very nice and the coffee shop was great. ... even had almond milk for my coffee! They shared their location was near a trail and I am looking forward to visiting again in warmer weather and taking advantage of it.
If you need to stay in or around Oil City, you won't go wrong staying here. Tremendous value and experience!"

We loved being able to look out the windows and watch for wildlife on the beautiful wooded property. I highly recommend The Rock cabin for a relaxing, peaceful getaway!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stephanie was helpful and responsive. The cabin location was convenient to Franklin. My children enjoyed the forest and nature. Overall it was a great experience!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a lovely stay. It was above and beyond what we had expected just glancing through the photos listed! It is clean, comfortable, and well maintained. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get away. It’s easily accessible, but still private. A perfect cabin get away"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,It has wonderful view especially when the place is start snowing! However I personally don't recommend to drive a sport car or any low car here because the parking lot has a really sharp hump so it might cause a damage of your car. Overall very nice trip!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Came back for the second time! Great cabin, great host, great location. I plan to come back next year as well. Franklin is only a few miles away for needing anything but the location of the cabin is very relaxed and the neighbors aren't close, very relaxing!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful spot. The cabin is a great getaway but it is still near town with numerous outdoor activities nearby such as hiking, biking and paddling. The hosts are helpful with anything you need.
A small but important note: the kitchen has absolutely everything you could need. Just bring any food ingredients and you can cook it here!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,The Rock Cabin was so lovely! The kitchen was well stocked & everything we needed was available. We will definitely be back for our girls trip.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's cabin is beautiful. The local is gorgeous and it is beautifully appointed. Please note there is NO bathroom in the basement where the extra bedrooms are. It is a very slim winding staircase to get up to the first floor. This is mentioned in the description, but is worth noting again. We would absolutely stay there again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The sweetest place to stay. Felt at home!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the cabin! It was the perfect place to spend a girls birthday weekend. The birthday girl enjoyed the amazing upstairs suite! The cabin looked just like the pictures and was just as cozy and beautiful as we had hoped. The location felt very safe, and we really enjoyed seeing the wildlife.
Some of our favorite things were drinking coffee and eating meals out on the deck, reading on the swing, relaxing by the fireplace, walking the trails, shopping at the Grove City Outlets, cooking meals together in the well stocked kitchen, doing puzzles, and playing games.
If we ever need a place to stay in the Franklin area, we would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pioneer Rock Cabin was lovely and set in a private, peaceful location. We enjoyed our two night stay. It had all the amenities anyone could want. Especially appreciated was the well stocked kitchen items, spices (fresh), coffee, sugar and many other staple and food items, either provided by owner or left by other guests. Everything was fresh and recent; not always what we've found at other rentals we've stayed at. Well supplied kitchen utensils, cookware, dishes, etc. Everything was spotless. Great instructions everywhere on how to use ac/heat, tv, etc. The many decks and seating areas outside were nice; unfortunately the weather wasn't great but we were able to enjoy one day mostly rain free and sunny outside on the decks. Saw deer and other small wildlife. The business area of Franklin was interesting with some nice businesses, candy store, antique stores, restaurants and more. A great retreat to relax and unwind."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here a couple times now and it is a perfect little getaway place. Highly recommend staying here.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a quiet cabin for our family getaway and this place was great. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms (although no bathroom in the lower level) and a full kitchen. We appreciated how beautiful the location was. We saw deer multiple times. Would recommend to travelers.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Stayed here with friends of mine and the scenery is beautiful. The place is remote and quiet. Area was clean and Stephanie replied quickly to any questions I had.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie's cabin was gorgeous and peaceful. We felt lucky to be able to stay at her home and really enjoyed the beauty of the area and the craftsmanship of the cabin. This is by far the best house I've ever seen and stay at in Franklin, PA!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Second time staying here and it was just as awesome as the year before! Everything you need to cook with. Super clean . Comfy beds. Beautiful peaceful location
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"The place was great!! Stephanie was a very responsive host. The location was beautiful and the cabin itself was cozy, spacious, and clean! The grill and fire pit were a nice perk as well.
The only negative was the beds. They were extremely firm. One of my friends likes a firm bed and they were even a bit hard for her.
Overall, it was a great place and we had a lovely stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Franklin is a great little town with some nice restaurants. We were in town for a wedding but might return again for a visit.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's cabin was exactly what we needed for a weekend away from the craziness of life. The cabin was beautiful inside, tastefully decorated and very clean. It was a nice cozy place to unwind. The cabin is also surrounded by a wooded area and very private, with a nice big fire pit outback. We took advantage of some of her recommendations of places to eat and trails to hike and we were not disappointed.
Stephanie was very prompt with her communication. We would highly recommend this cabin to anyone looking for a place to visit."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Gorgeous deck in beautiful part of country. Great home base for climbing and paddling the area.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Comfortable and clean.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely incredible and a hidden treasure in the Franklin area. It was like something out of a magazine, both the cabin and its surroundings! The light snowfall was an added bonus! Great value! There was absolutely everything you could need or want, especially in the kitchen! This was the perfect place for us to just get away and have some peace and quiet, but also to host two family dinners while in town. Stephanie was ultra responsive and friendly when contacted! We will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It Was a very nice place to stay and looked even better than the photos! We will be back again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the cabin. The cabin was cozy and had everything we needed. The property was fun to explore with the kids and there was lots of hiking trails to visit within 30 minutes. Downtown was only 10 min away which was convenient for grabbing food and making grocery store runs. We had a great time and will hopefully be back again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time at this cabin. It was spotless, cozy, roomy, and had all the amenities we could have ever wanted. My family loved the board games, hiking in the woods, the town of Franklin, and the roomy kitchen and comfy beds. Stephanie was kind enough to recommend we attend the Local Ice Festival and we were not disappointed! What a great trip1"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was so cute and perfect location to be close to my grandparents! Easy to get to! The inside spiral stair case was a bit challenging at first holding a baby but it all worked out!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place and beautiful scenery
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place in a private area. If we return to the area we will definitely revisit!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really want to keep this a secret so we can have it to ourselves but ... Pioneer Rock cabin is a total dream! The property is exactly what the pictures show, but better - it was way more spacious than we anticipated, both inside and out. The cabin was so cozy, immaculately clean, and clutter free, yet had all the necessary items to make cooking and relaxing a breeze (lots of puzzles and games and tons of blankets). The kids had fun exploring the woods around the house, which is at the top of a very long driveway. The area is very quiet and secluded, yet just 10 minutes from the very quaint town of Franklin. We enjoyed checking out the local bookstore and coffee shop, and had lunch one day at Linda Lou's which was delicious and affordable."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great week at Pioneer Rock Cabin. The location was excellent, private with easy access to town. Stephanie checked in midweek to make sure everything was going well. Excellent host."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay, the cabin is beautiful, clean and our hosts were very accommodating!
We would love to come back and visit again!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is very cute and we appreciated that it was filled with antiques. It's clear a lot of love went into curating the space. The kitchen was well appointed and the grill was great! Know that there is no bathroom in the basement where 2/3 bedrooms are located and there is very little sound privacy. If you are staying in the upper bedroom overlooking the living room, make sure you are not a light sleeper.
The little town of Franklin is very cute and if you go you must try Bella Cucina! There is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and the ambiance is great. We also did the OARs kayaking experience which was a lot of fun. We did feel that the price was a bit high given the area, but still really enjoyed our stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stephanie is a great host, with a large yet cozy cabin with good amenities. We enjoyed our week long stay and would highly recommend her listing."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the cabin. It is as pretty as it looks on the photos. The location is magical, plenty of wild life all around.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very well appointed and everything was really comfortable, easy to find and great quality. A very quiet area for privacy but still only a short drive to town. The kitchen was fully stocked with equipment to cook to your heart’s content. Multiple entries and exits to the home made getting to the fire pit, deck and driveway all convenient. We look forward to staying here again in the near future!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I were looking for a weekend getaway. This stay was exactly what we were looking for. I would highly recommend it.

2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a great place to relax over the long weekend! It was stocked with everything you’d need to cook a few meals at home. Checking in and checking out was east, and Stephanie was quick to respond with any questions I had. Would def recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE SOMEONE MAKING ME FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SHE DID I DEFINITELY GOT MY MONEYS WORTH I DID NOT WANNA GO HOME Stephanie IS GREAT AND SO IS HER HOME
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"""Wow, I may never leave"" were the first words my wife said when she walked into the kitchen. Don't worry, we did in fact leave so now you can rent the cabin and enjoy it as much as we did. The cabin has a really cool layout and the style inside is beautiful. We had a 6 and 2 year old and we felt perfectly comfortable with them playing around the house (our two year old managed the spiral stair case really well). We found supplies we forgot and all of the amenities were easy to find or clearly labeled. It sits on top of a hill and during the winter we could barely see the neighbors houses between the bare trees. There are plenty of games and puzzles. We've stayed at a lot of places and this is an absolute stand out. We really hope to make it back."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"could not have had a better weekend in the woods! the cabin is breathtaking. beautiful decorated, so cozy. It is stocked with everything you will need for a nice little retreat. truly cannot recommend Stephanie and her cabin enough!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is both beautiful and peaceful! The owner was very responsive, and the house has everything you could need! They really did think of everything! We will be renting here again... looking forward to being able to enjoy the outdoor space as well!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is truly a home away from home. It’s well stocked, clean and inviting. We enjoyed the outdoors during the day and cozy electric fireplace inside and living area at night. Our boys loved the little ping pong table! Also, we stayed during a very heavy snow storm and we’re a little worried, but the driveway was plowed for us to leave on time. Great peace of mind during winter travels."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,BEAUTIFUL!!! It was an amazing place to host my self-care retreat! Lots of space and anything that you would ever need was available! Surrounding was very quiet. Host was efficient with communication. Will stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful home tucked away in
the trees! We had an amazing stay, house was super clean, and had everything we needed. Owners are amazing and kept in constant contact if we need anything. I highly recommend!! Thanks."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was clean, cozy and like she said a home away from home would definitely go back really nice"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start? The home is absolutely beautiful! It consists of a modern and farmhouse blended decor. Our host Stephanie was so polite and understanding of our requests. Initially we had a hard time finding the lockbox key because the house has two levels, however, we found it after 3 minutes of searching. The moment Stephanie found out we hit a “bump in the road” she apologized and made sure our stay was even more “top tier”. I’m not sure who decorated her house but it is BEAUTIFUL guys! We felt so cozy and the house was so CLEAN! Honestly, everyone on my social media is asking for the house information but it’s so beautiful that I don’t want to share it!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% satisfied with the stay and hope to return someday. Private, safe, and quiet location, ideal for a weekend getaway."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful stay all round, will be booking in the future! Very well done cabin from decor and comfort. We found many creature comforting items like heated blankets a million great pillows spa towels fully stocked dishes bakeware and even a pizza stone! Scenic historical downtown Franklin boasted informational signs and statues as well as beautiful residential and commercial architecture. Great antique shops and a welcoming community (everyone polite as we strolled). Check out the Debence Antique Music World museum! Small cost for a trip back in time. Call ahead and they will happily schedule a tour guide for you as soon as possible. My 12 and six year olds were very entertained while our informative guide taught us all about the collection. We even had privilege of playing some of the instruments and listening to many more! Great trip and we only covered 1/2 the agenda. Well, it is a very cozy cabin 😄"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely home on a beautiful wooded property equipped with everything I needed and more. Very glad I got the opportunity to spend some quality relaxation time there. Host was very friendly and communicative and will definitely recommend staying here to others.

This place exceeded our expectations! The apartment was clean, and had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. The host Liz was incredibly friendly, helpful, and responsive.
The location was perfect, within short distances to grocery, restaurants, shops, attractions and for us, the Oil Creek for some awesome fly fishing. The neighborhood was safe and quiet.

2023-05-01,3,Stayed one night,"It was clean and about what I expected. Wish there would have been a bigger bed but it was as described. The furniture could have used an upgrade. It pretty much looked like it came from Goodwill but it was functional. We only slept there so didn't get time to hang out on the seating, etc."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the PERFECT location for the activities we had planned. Lodging was very clean and it had everything we needed for the time we spent there.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place to stay, has everything you need!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Kaneville Lodge is amazing - a hidden gem in a safe, beautiful area of PA. The lodge itself is deceptively large, with all of the amenities you will need. When you walk out the back door, you see nothing but nature, including a creek, the mountains, and the changing colors at the finest. But with these refreshing feeling of nature, there are enough stores close by that it is by no means isolated or difficult to resupply. Beyond this, the host is extremely kind, amiable and quick to help if you so need. I strongly recommend staying at the Kaneville Lodge anytime of the year."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Really spacious and Liz was very communicative
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location to explore the beautiful trails in the area. Pretty much smack dab in the middle of downtown Titusville and oil city. The house is very clean and well stocked. The hosts are super accommodating. Perfect for a weekend hiking trip!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Liz is an excellent host, kind and helpful. The home/apt was perfect for me. It was very clean and well stocked and it has a great layout. It was a comfortable and easy atmosphere for my work related stay. I was planning on booking for two weeks longer but my work schedule unexpectedly changed and I only needed to stay the one week. If I work in the area again this will be my first choice for a place to stay.
The price is very fair. The quality is high. Liz very generously and unexpectedly refunded my short-notice cancellation for my second week I'd already booked just before my work schedule changed."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a home-base for a wedding, between the Friday rehearsal and Saturday wedding. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Liz was a perfect host who responded to our needs quickly and kindly. I’d recommend staying here!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! It has decent kitchen knives which I have found that a lot of places do not. It was clean except for dust bunnies under the bed which is the only reason that I didn’t give cleanliness 5 stars. I would definitely stay there again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Liz was very helpful during our last minute stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was the perfect getaway from the city. my sister and I thoroughly enjoyed taking it slow here. Morning tea by the creek was a delight and the stars were incredible at night.

Thank you, Liz!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and secluded, perfect for a short or long term stay if you’re getting into activities in the area! Close parking to your building, and very comfortable and clean accommodations. Really enjoyed the kitchen being stocked up and condiments in the fridge too!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Liz was a great host. She reached out to me about an issue we didn’t even know about yet and offered a solution. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The brook nearby offers a gentle white noise when outside and the view is mostly green grass and trees. It was wonderful.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Liz’s! The place was bigger than we expected and had everything we needed to cook in. The creek behind the house is nice and there’s plenty of grass for the pups to run. The fans are nice and powerful and kept us cool at night. Would stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Liz’s space is exactly as pictured & described. It was bigger than expected though. The full size kitchen was great! Everything worked perfectly. Loved the Roku tv. We have already recommended this place to family. We have many family members from out of state that come back to visit often. We will definitely stay here again on our return trips to Franklin, PA. Liz is a great host & even left a light on for us when I told her we would be checking in after 9:00pm."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is very cute and much more spacious than I expected based on the pictures. Felt cool inside even though we arrived at the end of a HOT day. Plenty of space to let the dog sniff around. Overall wish we could have stayed longer :)
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Well situated to many parks and trails.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a charming little country cabin style retreat. nicely decorated and furnished with every thing you will need. huge area with a ""babbling brook"" near by. close to oil city. titusville and franklin. liz made up a thoughtful book of local attractions, and even though i was born in the ares, makes me want to go back and visit as a tourist, and be sure i will be staying at the kaneville lodge with liz"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is clean and private and the host was very thoughtful and communicative.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay at ! Very quiet and peaceful place.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a nice, quiet spot outside of town. It was just the place I needed for a weekend stay while visiting family.
It's adorable and has all the amenities you need! Would recommend to other guests!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect and cozy spot off the beaten path. My girlfriend and I had a last minute change of plans and ended up contacting Liz for a place to stay. She responded in less than 10 mins and graciously welcomed us. We instantly felt much more at home than the place we originally booked! Plenty of room to park with the boat still hooked up and the space provided everything we needed for a night away from home. Not one complaint from us. Couldn't be more grateful for genuine hosts and an awesome location to stay on our fishing trip. We will be staying again when in the area!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The family and dog enjoyed this great quiet clean place conveniently located for our state parks visits. Grateful for the well equipped kitchen so we could eat family meals in peace.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place would be perfectly fine if you’re just traveling through and need a place to crash. But I was there for a weekend to getaway from home and I found myself with not much to do in the surrounding towns or much of choices to eat for someone looking healthier especially since most things were closed on Sunday which was my full day there. Since it happened to heavily rain and even hail that day too I didn’t get to check out the oil creek state park with my dog like I’d wanted so I found a park (McConnell’s mill) right on the way home that I went to the day I left instead and it was beautiful there at least to make up for it. I didn’t quite find the place cozy enough to enjoy having to spend my whole day there due to the garage/cement flooring that goes across all the rooms and the noticeable signs of things that hadn’t been cleaned completely since the last person was there - yellow spots on back of toilet seat, tiny facial hairs from shaving on the counter and shower, crumbs/food residue on the utensil holder in the kitchen and coffee table spaces as well as the edges of the floors. However I was able to cook a full meal in the kitchen for dinner which was relaxing and very nice that they had a full oven/stove and cookware."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful. The place is very comfortable. You can park just outside the door so bringing groceries in and bags is easy. we really enjoyed the front yard and the internet. Liz was very attentive attentive even brought us lawn chairs to enjoy the sunny day. Fast internet too. We'll be back in the summer to enjoy the nearby state park, but next time we will bring our bikes because they have great biking trails."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfortable bed, full kitchen with K cup coffee and creamers, perfect for a single traveler or a couple to spend the night. Strong wifi and lots of electrical outlets. Nice little creek in the back yard."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Liz's apartment was the perfect spot to rest with my pup on a multi-day road trip. The apartment is very clean, comfortable, and homey."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my fiancé stayed a few more night at this place so we could have a nice setting for our marriage license interview and it was just perfect i love this home I would definitely love here. So if your looking to get away please check this place out it’s quiet and there’s a lot of local things to do great and awesome trip we had we are so going back as soon as we can !!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,If your looking for a place to get away for a special night and just to relax & get away from the city this is the place to come... the place is next to the road but like the host said once your inside you will forget that your even by the road there’s a creek in the the back but it’s cold now so idk if you want to check it out unless u like the cold .. overall we will be returning to the place only thing I will suggest is if maybe a larger tv or bring it down either then that you will definitely love the place !!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute, clean and cozy place to stay. Liz was on point and let me book another day at late notice. Very convenient as well for anyone who is taking care of a loved one at local hospitals.
Very quiet and great view out of the large picture window. Highly recommended."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. Everything was so clean and accessible and you cannot beat the backyard creek view! The space is perfect for two people and all of the necessities are already provided, including all the fixings for a perfect cup of coffee or tea! Liz is a fantastic host and extremely responsive. She was accommodating to our late check in and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and plan to book here again the next time we visit PA."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was one of the cleanest places I’ve ever stayed at. Was a perfect size for our family with a variety of beds/rooms.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was as advertised, clean, well equipped and convenient to the downtown historic district. If you enjoy stepping back in the past this home is for you, only wish the walls could talk.
."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house was beautiful, wonderful amenities and very clean!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah was so accommodating since we only needed a 1 night stay. The place is beautiful. So inviting and so comfortable. We wished we could have stayed longer to cook, eat and just enjoy being in such a lovely place but it was a very short trip. We hope to stay again in the future."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah's house was great! Everything was as described, the house has been updated and everything is in excellent condition. We could have brought more people on our trip with all the beds and bathrooms. Franklin is a great town with historic buildings throughout the town. Everyone we met or talked to was friendly. I would stay at Sarah's house again and will plan to the next time we are in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and relaxing. Sarah has the best guide I’ve ever seen. Every question you’d have was answered and directions were easily understandable. Sarah was welcoming and responsive. We had a wonderful stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place and had good time.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect!! The beds were firm and lines bleached and blankets soft and warm. The farmhouse double sink is a perfect example of the meticulous design and care that went into this property. The 3rd floor living room had a perfect window bench to find your zen. The third floor also had a second kitchen and is a great space for mixed groups. Ton of things to do within walking distance of the adorable downtown. We will rent again next time I'm back for work or get a long weekend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was so nice to stay in Sarah’s place! We have just spent one night in her house but everything makes us wanna come again. For food, McDonald’s is really close. Sarah has even listed some of the great restaurants in town. The rooms are fabulous, well prepared and extremely clean. Sarah is the perfect host ever. She was so nice that we would need some accommodations for checkout time. We had a really great time!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"The Downtown Franklin Retreat was wonderful. The place was so beautifully decorated. This is the perfect house for friends and family to gather. We loved that it was within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in downtown Franklin. Sarah was so easy to communicate with and was always very responsive. The kitchen was so well stocked with anything you could need. We especially liked to gather in the large living room up on the 3rd floor, with so many spaces to sit and a big table to play games or do a puzzle. The small kitchenette on the 3rd floor was perfect too. We liked the little den on the 2nd floor too, with the 2 big chairs, the comfy bean bag chair -the record player and record selection, was a cool addition. We loved all the art work on the walls. I will say this is one of the most nicely decorated AirB&B's I have stayed in. We hope to come back again. (Prior to your arrival you will receive a link to a guide book about the house which was so helpful)."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice house in great location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We made an impromptu trip north to catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis. The host accommodated our last minute booking and the place was clean and fully stocked with everything we needed for our stay. Easy and clear instructions for our stay and the inside was really comfortable.
I think it's worth mentioning that the staircase to the 2nd floor is pretty steep and narrow. This was not an issue for us at all but it might be helpful to know if you're traveling with kids or anyone with any mobility issues. There is a nice bedroom on the 1st floor that makes for a good accommodation to that.
We loved our quick trip. The sky was cloudy but bright to the north and the location was perfect for viewing :) We'll definitely be back at the next big solar storm. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"highly recommend! Great communication, peaceful & cute place to stay!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was perfect! We were visiting family and we had a wonderful stay. Thank you Ryan and Julie we will be back again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect. Cozy, clean and relaxing."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Cozy, clean, great view, all the amenities."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place and I loved that we were in the country. The house was so nice and worked out great for our getaway.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, super clean, warm and cozy house! Was a great spot for our family to stay, close to our family we visited in Titusville pa. Will definitely stay again, thanks Ryan!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,the place was great and comfy it was a cold and rainy day and the host had all the bedroom and bathroom heaters on and the living room fireplace on and pre heating it was clutch
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Second time we stayed and again another great experience! From booking to check in and check out such a simple and wonderful experience. Very comfortable and clean. Ryan is a great host and no doubt we will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a beautiful place with a country setting, this is the place! Very clean, easy to walk through, and all-around perfect. I had no issues with communication with Ryan, and having all the details I needed was great. I highly recommend it and the price point was very fair. I felt right at home and even my son and sister-in-lawfell in love with it.
It's close to restaurants, but far enough away that you have privacy. The location and surroundings really appealed to me and honesty the reason I chose to stay here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Very clean and neat place with all the things you’ll need.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here. A very beautiful setting and plenty of space to relax. We plan to return year after year.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My third stay. That should speak for itself. My go to place when I'm in this region.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a clean, peaceful place to stay - I highly recommend staying here. Ryan was a very responsive host and we couldn’t have asked for anything to be different. Will absolutely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always awesome. Ryans place is perfect and my preferred place to stay. Read my previous reviews and you'll see that Ryan and his place is just absolutely perfect.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ryan's cottage. We felt right at home and enjoyed walking around the pond, looking at all the wildlife, and strolling down the corn field. Ryan was very communicative and an overall super hosts!! We had everything we needed for our stay at the property. He worked with me on a few items for my toddler son and it was hugely appreciated. The road outside the property is busy and the stairs are steep (as stated) but this would not deter us from staying here again. I'd highly recommend booking any property hosted by Ryan. Thanks again!!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We were in town for a wedding. Ryan was very responsive and flexible with our needed check-in time. The cottage was super easy to check-in to and all the rooms were very cozy and well-decorated. I absolutely loved waking up in the morning and drinking my coffee out on the front porch.
One thing to note is the stairs going upstairs are steep and narrow. Someone with bad knees or older in age could have a difficult time going up/down."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We've stayed at Ryan's place twice now. This beautiful place always has hidden historical suprises. The locals told me that the house was built in the 1800's and that it was saved and renovated because it was a stop on the underground railroad....it's pretty amazing to stay in a place of great significance!.....the foundation is made from huge cut stones that have much historical value. Also always the kitchen is stocked with good coffee, great spices, quality snacks, and the best selection of oatmeal that I've seen anywhere that I've stayed. If you like scenic nature type views this place is perfect. The sunset over the pond, cornfields, and trees is amazing and the stars and moon reflect on the pond and look stunning. Anyhow, Ryan's place is awesome to say the least and it is my first choice to stay when I am in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan’s place was great- place was comfortable and clean. I love that Ryan offered a variety of herbal teas and oatmeal for the kids. The porch is lovely.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful trip in Franklin and loved Ryan’s property. Very peaceful and great place to recharge. We hope to return!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryans place is soooooo much better than the pictures. The best qualities about this property are the lake and front porch. If you take time to walk down to the lake you will see hundreds of bullfrogs. If you take time to sit there and just hang out you will see a wonderful sunset. The porch is great because it's brand new and there's plenty of seating and also a brand new grill. Which leads me to the kitchen, Ryan's place has a gas stove. It is loaded with multiple spices and tons of snacks that you will definitely forget to bring. Ryan makes sure that the snacks are there and you need not worry about that part of your trip. Ryan is extremely easy to deal with and always replies within minutes. In closing, I would like to say that this place is one of my top five places I've ever stayed in. Farm Life and pond life are awesome."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful old farm house and beautiful location. Beautiful remodel of this old farm house and super clean. Pond and surrounding farm fields were beautiful. Also, the thoughtful inclusion of a playpen and baby gate were super helpful for our 18 month old. The only thing I might recommend is adding an AC unit in the downstairs bedroom. Beautiful rural location but only minutes from ample shopping (came in handy since I forgot my running shoes). Really a great place to stay and would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage and property were lovely. Exactly as described and nicely stocked!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ryan's place is located in a beautiful spot. Lots of room to stretch out and enjoy yourself in a peaceful rural setting yet close enough to everything you need.
The house was extremely clean and welcoming and had everything you needed for a great stay.
We will definitely be back"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time at the Cottage and we loved it. Beautifully restored, very clean and modern where you appreciate it (appliances, great bathroom, lighting, etc), with lots of space inside and outside and your own pond. We hope to be back soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! If you appreciate farm charm, this has it. Situated on a beautiful property with a pond, the home is just as beautiful inside. We loved the decor from the shutters to the shelves and beyond! The included amenities, from an abundance of towels, etc to morning oatmeal and snack bars, were greatly appreciated. Although it only has one bathroom, it's generously sized and nicely updated. We appreciated the night lights in rooms and the fans. The baby gate is a nice touch as well, considering this is a typical old farmhouse with really steep and narrow stairs. The bedrooms upstairs have shorter ceilings and a slanted floor, but that wouldn't stop us from staying here again as it was priced right, private and overall really cozy! Thank you for a great stay as we were passing through!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. A charming cottage and very clean. We would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was absolutely PERFECT! The cottage was absolutely stunning! It was exactly what was explained and MORE! We were coming from out of town to visit family and the communication and flexibility was flawless! We had everything we needed, the decor was simple and beautiful, and was very CLEAN! We will stay here moving forward when coming to visit family in the future!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite, cozy retreat in the country with great views. Everything one needs enjoy the stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house. Clean and well stocked. We will be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Quiet and lovely! And so clean!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house, lots of wildlife to watch while sitting on the covered porch. Good local eats and an overall great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful modern and clean cottage. Responsive and flexible host.
Peaceful and beautiful views
Perfect for anyone from 1 person to a small family!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Super cute space!
Ryan was wonderful to work with. We had to move dates around due to a power outage in the area and he kept me informed and worked with us. We stayed here for a couple of weeks, the weather went from 30° to 80°, Ryan came over and put the grill out and offered to get the AC installed to make sure we were comfortable.
The amenities met what is shown on the listing.
We feel like there were different bed options, which is nice.
-the 2 big beds are memory foam
-the 2 twin beds are conventional mattresses, one firm and one more soft. There were also many pillow options, also.
We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Truly an oasis. It was simple yet they thought of all the comforts. The seating in the living room was very comfortable and the little fireplace made it extra cozy. I would love to come during the summer to take advantage of the beautiful outdoor space. We ended up eating in Cranberry at the Log Cabin Restaurant and while in the area make sure to grab some Clark’s Doughnuts.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I fell in love with this house, absolutely beautiful"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Ryan communicated everything clearly and was easy to get in contact with.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best air bnb I’ve stayed at! Clean, cute and beautiful property. Had everything we needed!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"I hosted a small dinner party here and it was wonderful. Very quaint with a lot of room for people to hang out, with an open concept which was nice for conversation. Hope to come back soon!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is perhaps the nicest AirBnB I've ever stayed at. It had a brand new feel to it. With updated amenities, nicely decorated, comfortable, and every item needed was available. Peaceful and situated on a few acres of land with a beautiful pond. Even during the winter it had a serene feel to it, with the Canadian Snow Geese floating on the pond. Most of all, Ryan was kind, responsive, and quite accommodating. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we have stayed at a location hosted by Ryan. His places are spotless and cozy. Ryan is very helpful and quick to respond if you need anything. We will definitely be staying again soon and would recommend this cozy cottage to anyone looking for a place to get away and relax in.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved our stay! The weather was freezing 🥶 but the house was amazing ! Pictures don’t do it justice ! Very accommodating and had everything we needed right there ready for us !
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, everything we wanted well done !"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location & enjoyed our stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The photos do not do this place justice. It's so beautiful, peaceful, clean, with plenty of supplies if you want to cook. Super communicative and kind host. We hope to return and stay longer next time!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Super cute place, incredibly clean and just what my bridesmaids and I needed for a night. Clear instructions that were easy to following and Ryan was super accommodating! If I need a place to stay near by, I’ll be checking in to see if it’s available in the future!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place, Windy Hills Cottage, is PERFECT! The house and location were exactly right for me. Even better than described, it's beautifully done with all the amenities required. The setting is quiet and relaxing with beautiful views. When I had a question, Ryan responded immediately and made me feel welcome and that he was there if I needed him at anytime during my stay. I can think of nothing that could have made my stay any better. Thank you."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cottage is a hidden gem, but easily accessible and convenient to town. It was by far the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in loaded with little amenities that made our stay extra comfortable and pleasant. These amenities included comfortable beds, extra hooks for hanging clothes and towels, special shower gel, extra towels, granola bars and coffee. Ryan has thought of everything that a visitor would want and was extremely helpful and easy to communicate with!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of our favorite Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed in! So clean, well stocked and a gorgeous view outside! The house had so much character & the owner’s attention to detail made it so easy to find & use everything we needed!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful property and very comfortable home! We loved our stay here and would definitely stay again. It was very quiet, but also close enough to stores or anything you might need. We loved eating dinner on the deck and watching the sunset over the corn fields and pond. Bedrooms were very comfortable and the home had everything we needed. It was a very relaxing place to stay during a long road trip, we couldn't have asked for a better spot."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,WONDERFUL and better than described in the listing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Windy Hill is perfect in every way! Charming, overly accommodating and pristine! There was nothing Ryan did not think of to accommodate their guests! We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Windy Hill Cottage is exceptionally well appointed, like no other AirB&B that we have rented. The cottage was very pleasant and comfortable. The country setting was wonderfully peaceful. We highly recommend Windy Hill to anyone considering lodging in the greater Franklin PA area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a cozy and quaint little place to stay without losing the amenities of a full house. Located a mile or so off the main road with rolling hills and a small pond in the back! Beautiful area! I highly recommend staying here. Don't settle for the local hotels/motels. This is where you want to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very gorgeous and comforting home inside and out. The views from the porch is beyond relaxing. During my stay, we got a perfect view of the fireworks that were being displayed a couple of miles away."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I honestly wish I could give this listing a 20 star review. I cannot possibly recommend this location, or these hosts enough.
It was the most darling, beautiful cottage, with a breathtaking view. No light pollution, so you can see every star in the night sky, and a huge porch that overlooks the field and the pond. Furthermore, we stayed in June when the frogs were singing, and the fireflies were dancing, which was absolutely magical.
The inside is completely updated, yet they preserved the historic details of the house to keep the original charm. It also had every amenity one could need for their stay; air conditioning, comfortable beds, a full bathroom, and a full kitchen with new appliances. They covered every detail.
Communication with the host was very prompt, and accommodating. Every request we made was met with kindness and understanding. They really made our stay special!
Thank you so much!!
-Jamie, Gracie, Lillian, Sequoia, Bridget, & Kat"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a return stay, so that in itself speaks to my satisfaction.
As a newly established listing on airBnB, there were some minor overlooked amenities. After mentioning to Ryan, they were addressed, most on the same day.
I’m staying here for business, so my needs are different from weekend visitors. Looking from a recreational perspective, this place is quiet, has a fire ring and plenty space for relaxing and enjoying the environment. I can’t say enough about the birds singing in the morning and the frogs singing from the pond in the evening.
There is always a breeze, so even on hot days, opening windows on both sides cools the place enough that AC isn’t necessary, though I use it when rainy.
It is a few miles from the Allegheny River in one direction and Oil Creek in another and state game lands in a third. While not immediate access to any of these locations, none are far.
Having identified how pleased I am with Ryan, I am going to make a brief reference to AirBnB’s support for abortion, noting my displeasure with the company’s policy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's cottage was spectacular. It has a well-stocked kitchen that we have not had at other places. He provided coffee, tea, breakfast items, and ingredients our daughter used to bake delicious chocolate chip cookies. The entire cottage was spotless from top to bottom and newly remodeled.
Ryan was a fantastic host and communicated thoroughly throughout the stay.
The only negative aspect of the cottage is its proximity to a two-lane road that fast-moving vehicles travel on. If you have little ones, you will have to monitor them closely, and the road noise is distracting if you decide to sit on the porch and converse.
Despite those issues, we will reserve this cottage in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Accurate description and lovely style. Very clean and well taken care of.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I’m not the usual guest for this area, but I’m also not the only one using air BnB for extended and recurrent stays in the same location.
I have a recurring job at the local UPMC that necessitates a two week stay every month for a while. This is ideal location for that job site, only about 3 miles away. The area is quiet - well, except for the serenading birds in the morning and frogs in the evening - couldn’t ask for a better musical chorus.
I’ll be staying here more, so plenty of opportunities for more detailed review.
If you also have similar situation with UPMC and the dates I’ve reserved don’t quite jive with yours, perhaps we can work something out. Let medical affairs know and maybe we can make an arrangement for any overlap."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Windy Hill Cottage is truly lovely. It is decorated with clever and talented care to make it truly appealing to guests but is, at the same time comfortable and homey. The kitchen is designed brilliantly to fit all that we needed and the bedrooms were roomy enough to allow easy moving around and plenty of space for belongings. Online and tv reception and options were excellent and Ryan quickly and completely answered all inquiries while we were there. His recommendation for Bella Cucina in Franklin was spot on and we had delicious meals there.
And the view from the front porch is spectacular. The cottage sits up on a rise and provides beautiful views from all angles. On advice from Ryan we made sure to catch the sunset and it was amazing. We will be back and will be recommending Windy Hill to others for sure."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place that has so many amenities. Ryan and his wife literally thought of everything, and they are outstanding hosts! The home is near some of the best hiking and biking trails in PA. We saw 2 bald eagles in their nest that made our hiking trip! This is a historic house with so much character, it has beautiful hardwood floors, and this special place was immaculate. For dinners we suggest traveling over to trendy Franklin for some Italian cuisine and be sure to check out their local brewery. Also, you can pick up some great food to go at Stiller Meats and Smoke House. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host thought of everything. The home was absolutely stunning!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was very comfortable and was a home away from home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here for annual fishing trip, thanks Katrina"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were so pleased with the house! The house was so clean! We especially loved watching the wildlife in the river from the deck. All her instructions were so easy to follow. We would definitely want to come back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The space was super cute and comfy. Equipped with everything we could need. The host responded quickly when there was an issue and solved it almost immediately. Would highly recommend this and will probably stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Katrina’s place was very clean and comfortable. It was a great place to call home for 5 days. The kitchen is stocked with all the items you may need during your stay. Katrina was very responsive and easy to communicate with leading up to our trip and she even went above and beyond to make sure she had a crib and a high chair available for us since we were flying from California to Pennsylvania. Thank you Katrina!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent well stocked and very clean. Walkable to main street and easilly rideable to the bike trail. Highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We visited Franklin, PA for a fly fishing trip. Katrina's place was the perfect location for us and SO homey. The back deck and fenced in yard was my absolute favorite. We were able to sip some wine, enjoy the stone fireplace, and the views of French creek, while having my fur baby next to me :) Downtown area is walkable from the house. The home was clean and had everything you needed. Definitely recommend
Edit: I had to immediately come back and make an edit on my review. My boyfriend and I accidentally forgot our wading boots at Katrina's place. Katrina was extremely responsive and sweet enough to verify we did in fact leave our boots and offered to ship them to us. We cannot express how much we appreciated that, Katrina is truly an amazing host!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem! I like having space and this place didn’t disappoint with that. My 4 year old son LOVED the bunk beds, the games and using the binoculars on the back deck over looking the water. Plus plenty of room for him to play and run around. The master bedroom had so much room and storage, plus the bed was very comfortable! Furthermore, I really enjoyed private driveway and the proximity to downtown Franklin (you could easily walk if you wanted). To me this place truly didn’t disappoint! My son and I truly felt right at home and hope to stay here again next time I come visit him. I highly recommend staying here, you won’t be disappointed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little house in a great location. Host was responsive and helpful. Would stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a cute house. We were staying here during our trip out to see the eclipse. It was the perfect spot to hang out and rest after a long day in the car. It was so cozy, and because of the house's location, we saw all kinds of cool wildlife - including a beaver! Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just what we needed! Great space!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katrina's home is Beautiful and very comfortable. This is how we felt walking through the door. The house is very spacious and set up in a perfect way. There were 3 of us and it was more than enough space. The views from the family room is very soothing. We felt so comfortable ,we had to make ourselves go out for a little bit each day.
Franklin is a very Beautiful place to visit and the people are very friendly. Downtown area is a good place to start. We did window shopping the first night . Pizza & Stromboli the Fox Den is a must ! We went to see the Youth Theater ( it was great) right Downtown for both.
If you like wings, you will absolutely Love the Purple Goose !!
This home is Loved beyond words by Katrina ,it shows in Every corner just how Special it truly is!
My 16 yr. old granddaughter planned to come back after just the 2nd day( We know how kids can be 😊).
You will Not be disappointed staying here. Katrina is a Wonderful host !!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks so much! The home was very well equipped, lots of little extras! Super cute and clean! Can’t wait to come back in the summer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this place, Katrina was fantastic! Everything about this place was five star, and every five star rating is well-deserved at this location."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My son and I had a relaxing weekend at Katrina’s place. Beautiful inside and out. We would definitely recommend her home to anyone coming to the area for a visit.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We visited for the weekend only. Wish that we could have stayed longer. Katrina’s home is exactly as pictured, you can tell that she put love into her house.
She anticipates anything that a guest might need and has it readily available."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Katrina’s home is lovely. There is plenty of space to relax, including the deck and family room which overlook French Creek. Beds are all comfortable and bathrooms were clean and stocked with everything on could need. Kitchen also has everything one could need. This is our second stay at Katrina’s and we look forward to many more. It is a relaxing and cozy space."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with a beautiful view
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This place was adorable and so peaceful. The beds and pillows were so comfortable and smelled amazing! Awesome time spent here and would highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katrina is an incredible host. Not only did she create a beautiful, cozy, cottage, it was well-appointed with drinks in the fridge, toiletries in the bath, and all the cooking gear you need to feel right at home. She gave us fabulous restaurant recommendations and was kind enough to buy us a drink and an app at both spots! I really appreciated the great communication, charming home, and making our stay in Franklin absolutely perfect!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After a super hectic trip to Orlando, we were looking for somewhere comfortable to sleep in between driving. We were blown away at how cute and comfy Katrinas home was! The story of how it came to be is super touching and I definitely reccomend reading it <3 You can feel the good vibes as soon as you walk in. The decor is phenomenal and everything is so comfortable and warm. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It is a beautiful spot next to an awesome downtown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful family home, Katrina was a wonderful host who thought of everything and was extremely responsive on all communications, we hope when we visit again the house is free!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place in Franklin to stay, and walking distance to a bunch of local restaurants and store . Nice view of French creek !"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Katrina’s personal touches on her house made our night super relaxing and comfortable! Great selection of k cups and very walkable to the Main Street. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a night away in the area!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Katrinas place is a gem. The house is immaculate and very tastefully decorated. The house is walking distance to main street Franklin with many restaurants to choose from. We ate at Bella Cucina, possibly the best place in town.
The house offers 3 bedrooms upstairs and an additional sleeper sofa downstairs, this provided all 5 of us their own bed.
We totally overpacked because Katrina provided everything needed for a great stay, hairdryer, high quality shampoo, Kerrig coffee maker and capsules, snacks and water. Think 4*Hotel with lovely amenities.
Communication was excellent and Katrina even offered early check-in, which we didn’t need, but appreciated.
The house is located on a quiet residential street, safe neighborhood and right overlooking the river.
We all slept extremely well and can’t wait to return in warmer weather to make use of the outdoor space."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay at Katrina‘s house on the river! Everything was so beautiful, communication was amazing… We will definitely be back"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was lovely and just as pictured. Kitchen was so well appointed - we did a lot of cooking and it had everything we needed. Stayed during a really cold snap and were warm and cozy. Walk to cute shops and good restaurants. Perfect table space for dining as well as playing family games and everyone had their own space. Unfortunately it was too cold to make use of the lovely back deck overlooking the river. We will have to return in warmer weather! Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have lost count of how many times we've stayed here. We are very picky about where we book, and I have to say that Katrina's beautiful home ALWAYS is above and beyond what I am hoping for. Wonderful and beautiful location right on the creek, exceptionally clean, decorated beautifully, walking distance to pretty much everything in town. The hosts are truly lovely people who I feel like I've known for many many many years. Don't hesitate--book this absolute gem!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Franklin, PA. Easy walking access to both nature and town. Beuatiful views and very quiet. Bedding was very comfortable. Was there for a few days with my wife on a business trip and will stay there again. Katrina is a great host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, well stocked home.
Katrina is very helpful."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt at home the minute we got there and hated to leave. Katrina has made this a beautiful home with everything you need to be comfortable and content.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"1st time using AIRBNB and was EXCELLENT!! Katrina is the PERFECT hostess! I had SO many questions after renting and before we got there and she was SO quick to respond and extremely friendly, I could just tell it was going to be a GREAT experience. She checked in with us once we got there to make sure we got in house fine and to make sure we had everything we needed. Franklin was an Adorable town. She provided booklets of things to see and stay in area. Her home is SPOTLESS, comfortable, modernized and decorated so nice. I must say as far as the town of FRANKLIN my friends and I enjoyed the food and GREAT friendly service at Trails to Ales restaurant. Great food, service and Beer. Our other favorite little stop was at the GRUMPY GOAT Distillery. Great home made batches of liquor. Loved the Peanut Butter Licker, Peach Shinewine and the Lemoncello. Great service and samples. Of course a couple bottles came back to Ohio with us. It was a WONDERFUL girls getaway!!! Thanks Katrina!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment you pull into the driveway, it’s obvious that Katrina has put a lot of love into this place. It is beautifully furnished & decorated & SUPER clean! I loved the combination of modern updates & old architecture. It is extremely well-stocked with anything you could possibly need & then some. She truly has thought of everything! Board games, Wi-Fi, smart TVs & streaming services are a great bonus! The beds & pillows are very comfy. Our favorite part was the deck overlooking French Creek. Even though the house is situated between 2 other houses, fencing on the deck makes it feel very cozy & private. Check-in was seamless with the electronic lock. Communication was great. I felt the price was very reasonable, compared to other homes in the area that offered way less for the money. I could go on & on. I just can’t say enough good things about this home & host. We have definitely found our spot when visiting family in Franklin again. Thank you for hosting us Katrina!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at Katrina’s place. Very comfortable and homey.
Will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Katrina’s home is an absolute gem 💎 in Franklin. We traveled from St John in the Virgin Islands to visit friends and family in Venango County and felt right at home at her rental. Very clean and spacious, it offered more than enough space for our family of three and still plenty of room for two other family members that came for two of our six night stay. The house provided stylish decor, awesome porches for happy hour, a big family room for movie watching and a well equipped kitchen for doing meals at home (although I recommend the delicious, walkable restaurants in downtown Franklin). We truly relaxed and enjoyed our vacation thanks to the wonderful accommodations. Highly recommend! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Katrina has put a lot of thought into making her guest feel right at home. All the rooms were clean and cozy, very welcoming. Everything is super nice but not too nice that you feel uncomfortable if you know what I mean. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re going to be in the area. Oh and I found the cleanest quietest Walmart ever about 10min away 😁"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a beautiful stay at Katrina’s “She Home”. It looks exactly like the pictures. We wish we could have stayed longer to have used all that was available to us.

My husband appreciated the desk in one of the bedrooms since he had some work to do while we were traveling. As always, we appreciate pet friendly accommodation since our pups travel with us frequently."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second time, staying at Katrina‘s place, and there will definitely be a third!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Katrina's. It was just as described and more. We absolutely loved the back deck overlooking French Creek. We primarily stayed out there during our time at the house. We watched a doe and her two fawns running along the other side of the creek, herons, an eagle, and so many lightning bugs! It was lovely. We enjoyed walking around Franklin...such a sweet and walkable town and neighborhood. Loved seeing the parade and hope to go to play at the quaint community theater some day. If staying in the area, we couldn't recommend highly enough. Wildcat Mansion and Event is 2 miles away where we went to a wedding. We very much enjoyed our stay here and welcome a return."

The house was close to everywhere we wanted to go and I loved that I could bike right into town- there was a great Farmers Market Saturday morning.

Katrina was so responsive, gave great recommendations for restaurants, and checked in to make sure we were comfortable. Her place was so beautiful- from the interior to the exterior. The river in the back combined with the firepit made for a wonderful night. We can't wait to come back!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Just a perfect little spot in Franklin. Close to everything.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We felt very much at home in this house. It has a lovely setting, with the river right outside, and a great view of it from the back deck. The house has been decorated with a lot of attention to detail and it is very spacious and comfortable, with the added luxury of a ground floor powder room. Everything was clean and we found all we needed to prepare meals. The bed we slept in was comfortable and it was very quiet at night. The stairs to the bedrooms are quite steep. This is an old house, so to be expected, but might be a bit of a challenge for those with any mobility concerns. Also, the host/cleaners use a lot of air freshener. If strong scents bother, you this home won’t work for you. This is a really nice home in the historic city of Franklin. We wish we’d had more time to explore the town which had some terrific architecture. Thanks, Katrina, for being a responsive and welcoming host."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was such a lovely place. So cozy and right on the river. Recommend.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was absolutely perfect. I spent an amazing weekend bonding with my family as we prepare for my first grandchild and the space met all our needs. It was comfortable, clean and very pleasant to the eyes. My favorite features was the kitchen utensils, the candles and the private puppy area. The beds were comfortable and cozy. The aesthetic color scheme of the entire home was very pleasant.
Katrina, the host, was very responsive to all my questions; little or big.
I intend on returning this summer to enjoy the patio and grill!
Thank you Katrina for an amazing experience!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the minute you stepped into this 100yr old historical house, it just wrapped its arms around you like a warm blanket.
We were in town visiting our family over Christmas and Katrina went out of her way to put up a Christmas tree and very beautiful holiday decorations that it really made us feel like we were home. I unexpectedly was voted to cook Christmas dinner for our family of 10 (yay me!!!) and she made sure I had everything I needed to prepare dinner. She even sent me photos of all cookware and appliances to reassure me there was no need to bring anything with me.
I can’t thank her enough for the exceptional hospitality she showed during our stay. Christmas time is hectic for everyone, but she never skipped a beat… if I had a question, she was right on it to accommodate us!
Oh, by the way, go to Bella Cucina for lunch or dinner (she runs this charming restaurant), you will not be disappointed! Best meal I’ve ever had in Franklin, and I grew up here!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband's family reunion was in the area, and we booked several Airbnbs. We stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed it! The beds are very comfortable, and the house is well thought out and planned. We will stay here again when we come back!"

She was very prompt and accommodating when we made a last minute request to change our reso date- which made our stay even better!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Katrina's place is so special! And Katrina is very responsive and helpful. The river view off of the amazing deck out back was my favorite part, but the good night's rest in the beautifully decorated room was great, too. My mother has mobility issues, so I can tell you the stairs up to the second level are steep and tough for anyone in that position, but there was a pull-out couch and bathroom on the main level, so it was not a problem. I would recommend and stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,While only here for 12 hours (cross country road trip) we were so charmed by this Airbnb! It was clean and beautiful and the yard was perfect for the pups! Also the bed was extremely comfortable which was heaven sent after a long day on the road! Franklin seems like a sweet town as well I wish we could have explored! Host was kind and communicative and it was neat reading her story about the home!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place on French Creek with great interior design, clean and warm friendly hospitality by the hostess with the mostess, Katrina! Would highly recommend. I could see how every season here would be a treat with the few and coziness."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I really say? I could never do Katrina or her house the justice they merit. This is my second stay here, and each time I stay, I'm already planning my next visit. Amazing view, beautifully maintained and comfortable home, and perfect communication. There aren't enough stars in the world for me to give this a high enough rating, so so so many more than five stars. You will not regret staying at this gem!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is a great stay for anyone looking in the area. It’s placed beautifully in the center of town right on French creek. You can enjoy a quick walk to any part of the town or step out into the deck and listen to the sounds of the creek. You should stay here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beyond 5 stars!
Katrina is a top tier hostess who has thought of everything. Her place was immaculately clean, comfortable and in a great location. The beds are super comfy and the linens were soft and fresh. The bathroom has a huge stack of fresh towels and salon quality hair and shower products. The water pressure was great and the shower was piping hot. The kitchen was well equipped with everything you would need to cook a feast and the dining room has room to serve a crowd. The family room furniture is comfy and there’s lots of room to hang out and watch football or movies. The house is located on a quiet road and the deck overlooks a large creek so the view is great.
This was, by far, our best AB&B experience to date. It was like staying at a friend’s house. We truly appreciated her attention to the details that take an experience from “fine” to “outstanding”….and Katrina nailed it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING. It was like staying at a really clean friend's house mixed with a boutique hotel. Very clean, amazing location (the river view is perfection and I ""made friends"" with a heron, a cat, and some ducks). Loved that the kitchen is well stocked and there were K Cups for the Keurig! The bed was honestly so comfy and cozy I didn't want to leave. The history behind this location is amazing and it was very humbling to be so close to such an important river. I am already trying to figure out when I can go back! Katrina was super nice, too! 💞💞💞"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was absolutely perfect! It was my first experience with Air BNB and Katrina made it an excellent one. She made certain we were comfortable and happy. Her home is absolutely stunning and so peaceful. Having this be my first experience with AirBNB I don’t want to ever stay in a hotel again. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Katrina for ensuring this special girls weekend was more than anything we could have ever expected.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The house was super cute. There were snacks and drinks for us when we arrived which was really nice. We will definitely rent it again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cottage home. Very tastefully decorated with alot of thought going into the details. The bed was luxurious and the furniture was very comfortable. The home was very clean. Had no problems linking into the wi-fi and was able to stream effortless on the TV. The location is centrally located between Oil City, Seneca, Franklin and Titusville. Country setting with a beautiful pond view out the back. Very peaceful. Alot of amenities were available such as shampoo, conditioner, nice selection of hot drinks, etc. and a really good variety and selection of reading materials. Washer and dryer on site. Enjoyable stay and would highly recommend this cottage. Would definitely stay here again. Everything went smoothly and had no reason to reach out to owner for anything. Thank you Debbie for making this a pleasant and easy stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a lovely time staying here for a long weekend getaway. We loved the quiet, peaceful setting and that it was easy to get to town where he attended a gravel bike event and I explored Oil Creek State Park and its extensive trails. Great location--thank you so much!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay greatly. The setting and surroundings were beautiful and peaceful.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved getting away for a few days and Kathy's airbnb was the perfect place for a peaceful time of rest. We visited at the beginning of May. My husband walked through the vast wooded property. I enjoyed reading on the back porch with view of the pond and many birds. We visited Franklin, which was a quick drive down the road, and we enjoyed talking with Kathy & her husband, who shared some great gardening knowledge with us. We will definitely return if we travel to the area again! Thank you for sharing your beautiful place in the woods with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was perfect! Would be fun to go with friends and/or family!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here - it was in a beautiful secluded location surrounded by forest, and yet was only as few miles from the town of Franklin. Kathy was very hospitable and flexible, and accommodated our changing plans. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. If we return to this area we will be staying here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were there just for a short trip for my father's memorial. Kathy was super responsive when it came to any question I had. Once we got in late at night (which lights were left on for us), we felt super comfortable in the room we were staying in. Really peaceful place with it being out in the woods. Really needed the detachment from the city/town feel while grieving. Loved bonding with their cat and chickens! Whenever we have the chance to visit the area again, will 100% book here again."
2024-03-01,2,Stayed one night,"The place is infested with huge ticks lined up in the corner of the ceiling, above the entrance and bed , and on the windows. At check in she said she had a boarder adjacent to the room and will be washing clothes; the banging lasted til 10 pm from behind the headboard, defeating purpose of staying in Timbuktu. Roads were muddied after the rains, and place hard to find. Carpet, dusty, not good for anyone with allergies. Tv was hard to operate. Sleeps 5 for $79.00 after fees and taxes, cheap if you are willing to take a chance with your health."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice country stay in the woods with kind, helpful hosts! Jerry made us a wonderful fire our first night and helped carry bags in. They thought of everything you could possibly need. And …they were Jesus people which in my book is pretty cool!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay! Everything was as described and more! the property is beautiful, and our hosts could not have been kinder... We intend to visit again!! TY folks!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet and affordable place. We wish we could stay longer. They have horses.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my time at Kathy's place. The upstairs room is separated by a door and is spacious and clean. I would recommend it for a larger groups (3-4) for shorter stays. The area is rural so I had a fun time visiting farms for some meats and dairy products.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, quiet place a bit removed from town noise."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our trip was short but I wouldn’t mind staying at this home for a longer stay. It is super secluded and quiet. Very peaceful and surrounded by woods. Tho down down isn’t too far. The home owner Kathy is super friendly. Very responsive and kind.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I LOVED this stay!! Being back in the woods it was Beautiful, Quiet, Peaceful..great porch AND deck to sit on and see the natural beauty as well as gorgeous horses out in pasture and deer going through woods!! They were more than attentive to everything!! And they were comfortable with me having friends to come visit me!!! I will go back next year!!!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy was very easy to communicate with, and the space provided was so cozy and spacious for the price paid! I got in pretty late at night, but Kathy still made sure to greet me and chat for a few when I arrived. The space was very clean and comfortable, with lots to do. Overall, a very easy process, and I felt very at home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a quiet, private, beautiful, serene location, this is your place. The house is on a gorgeous wooded property with a pool and pond. Your room is actually a “great room”, equipped with books, games, DVDs, a high top table and chairs, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, and snacks. There are multiple beds as well as a futon. The room and it’s bathroom were spotless and nicely decorated. Kathy was incredibly responsive and helpful with directions getting to her home, as we were arriving after dark. She, Jerry, and Major (the dog) even met us upon arrival (at our request- we wanted to say hello and thank her for having us). I strongly recommend staying with Kathy if you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful, respite spot that is surrounded by nature."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a quiet setting close by an event I was attending. I appreciated the tranquility and knew the hosts were very responsive if I had any questions.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here. It was well kept up, clean and very peaceful. I will definetly keep this place in mind should I pass through here again. Great place and great price for all that you get."

Thanks Kathy"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you like a rural area, this is the perfect place. It is close to many outdoor activities, historic venues and great restaurants.
This is a lovely, restful and beautiful place to stay. The room was comfortable and spacious. Kathy put a lot of love and care into the place, which made us feel right at home.
Major is a big, loveable, fun dog!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My family stayed here for a few days. It is a bit out of the way but peaceful and nice.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Jerry are such wonderful hosts! Their entire family welcomed us in with open arms. Their space is peaceful, beautiful, clean and comfortable. It is away from the distractions of the busy life, so you can actually relax. It is a home full of so much love and God. Talking with them was literally life altering for me, inspiring me to do things I never thought I could or would. I hope and pray that if you are entertaining the idea of staying here, that you will. This was a great nights sleep, and a wonderful family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kathy's place was wonderful. It was peaceful and beautiful nestled in the woods. She had everything ready for us and we slept great.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As before, I was very pleased and impressed with the property!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great friendly private hideaway. Would definitely recommend for folks who like country settings.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Off the beaten path, but that’s what makes this location wonderful. Lots of acreage to roam around, but sadly I didn’t have time. Kathy was extremely welcoming and helpful at check in. Nice nice fridge and freezer with lots of little, thoughtful amenities. Beautiful home with lovely animals."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy was a generous with the space and with her time as well! The area is so peaceful and beautiful!
We enjoyed our visit with her and the kids loved using the pool!
Very satisfied with our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy’s place is just like going and staying at Grandma’s house! Clean, comfortable, friendly! My boys (8,10) played with the dogs and in the pool and on the swing set and even went fishing in the pond with the host’s family on July 4! We were so comfortable in the space, extremely roomy for a family. Every little accommodation is there including different sized life jackets, plastic cups and utensils and plates etc., snacks, soap, board games, etc. Kathy and Jerry are a pleasure to socialize with. My favorite thing was waking up at 6:30 AM to make a cup of coffee and sitting on the deck watching the birds while knitting and reading!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our 3rd stay at Kathy’s. It is as advertised and located just right for our visits to family in NW PA
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect place to stay, right in the middle of our journey from Kentucky to Rhode Island. They were able to accommodate all six of us comfortably in the room, the only Airbnb that I could find that could do so in one room. Four of us were teenagers and they were excited about the chocolates, hot chocolate, board games but most of all the animals: horses, chickens and the super friendly dog and cat. They also had a wii, a pool and a fire pit. Town is not far with cute shops. There is a McDonald’s 9 minutes away that is open late. I just loved waking up and making fresh coffee in the Keurig and then going and sitting on the back porch in the beautiful morning and looking over the lovely pond, listening to the the birds and frogs and petting the cat. The hosts were wonderful and friendly and I enjoyed talking to them. They even gave us fresh lettuce from their garden!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my first AirB&B experience and I must say I only hope all AirB&B experiences are this great. The room was exceptional and the hospitality was second to none. I definitely would stay there again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice stay while we were in town for the weekend visiting family and friends. Unfortunately the weather was terrible all weekend so we didn’t get a chance to take advantage of the other amenities offered, but we did have a nice cozy stay with adequate sleeping arrangements for our family! It was a bit further off the beaten path than I was initially expecting, but that made it much more quaint and definitely quiet. We did get to see the fields full of lightning bugs and my daughters loved that!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Would absolutely stay again and wish I could have stayed longer!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"imagine driving into a lovely forest, floors carpets with ferns, deer along the stone path, and you end up at a pond with a lovely house... that's what you get here. The peacefulness of the property is like laying your mind down on a fluffy pillow mentally. The host couple was very friendly and helpful but not intrusive. Not the fanciest place we've stayed, but more than adequate. A very restful retreat inviting us to return"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy was incredibly friendly and helpful when it came to finding the location. She even provided us with brrakfast materials in the morning and had a wii plus boardgames to keep ourselves busy with. She also recommended local restaurants for us.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy was a great host! Would stay again.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,🙂
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Better than expected by far! Loved the coffee station and assortment of games. Beautiful views too!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy’s place is as advertised, clean, neat, outfitted with any convenience you might need. We would certainly stay again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s easy to feel at home in this clean, spacious room overlooking woods and a pond. I had no trouble going to sleep to a spring chorus of peep frogs. Best of all though is the thought and effort Kathy puts into making this space hospitable. Video and board games. Roku. A nice variety of quick breakfast items including coffee, teas, cocoa, oatmeal and nutrition bars. A drawing desk for kids. And lots of helpful instructions and recommendations. She makes sure you have what you need while still respecting your privacy. I’m looking forward to returning someday."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,they very kind.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying here. Super accommodations. Will go back again for sure.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful and comfortable base of operations while visiting friends in the area! The hosts were amazingly accommodating and I have to admit our favorite thing about our stay was their dog, Major :). We definitely plan to stay again when we return to the area. Thank you for a great stay!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had come up to visit my son (3 years old) for a few days. The hosts were very helpful with everything, the only trouble I had was staying connected to people that didn’t have an iPhone (AT&T doesn’t get service here). No fault to the hosts, it is what it is. The wifi worked pretty good that I could still email clients, it just had trouble with streaming shows on Netflix. Regardless, it’s still well worth it for the price they are charging. It’s quiet, it’s peaceful and nostalgic if you grew up on a farm. Their dog Major was such a loving, friendly pup, he did get a little hyper with my son but that’s on me as well, I just didn’t realize my son would be skittish toward a dog Majors size, since he’s been around big dogs all the time before. The dog was just trying to be friendly, loving and playful so he was NEVER aggressive. I would come back again if AT&T had better service and there was a full kitchen (which I knew there wasn’t, just realizing my needs). All in all I still loved it"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay. Everything was thoughtfully provided and beautiful.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This couple was amazing.. we had accidentally booked the wrong date.. they changed it without any problems.. helped to suggest to many different things.. they treated us like we were family which was exactly what we needed.. would definitely stay again and would give it a 10 star if possible
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect stay. quiet, quaint and just what we needed. Kathy & her husband were friendly, inviting and available for their guests; not to mention the beautiful views their place provides."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place & people
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place if you like peace and quiet in the country and being right outside of town for convenience also way cleaner than a motel Major the dog is a teddy bear and will play as long as you will ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,I'm handicaped and can only stand briefly and walk short distances. Could not stay here because of flight of steps to get to the room.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Communications was very good. Nice place to stay. Everything was as described. There is a lot of detail and thought put into the directions and instructions posted in the room. Lots of space to be comfortable. Splendid hosts!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s always a good place to be for the areas you visit there. Quiet and enjoying the woods, animals and view. Great people to talk with and they will do anything for you if needed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our host provided great instructions on finding the house. Everything was clean and thoughtful. A wonderful stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place in the woods with lots of room. Clean, reasonably priced, and great communication."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check-in, comfy bed to rest, easy location to find."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed for our short stay in the area. This was the first time staying in a room that was part of a house. The hosts were very nice and allowed us to have our privacy. The dog was a cutie.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A peaceful spot in the woods. A great choice if your looking for a chance to getaway
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place lots of room. Basic hotel type kitchenette set up. Clean. Great communication & directions . Window AC worked great on 90 degree day. Not really enough light to read on a rainy day. Had hoped to swim before rain but the pool had some algae on the bottom & side that made it not so appealing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here back in December. Things were really great so we came back for our Sumer visit with family. The property is beautiful and very welcoming. Kathy and Jerry are very easy to communicate with and very helpful.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy’s place is perfect for an overnight stay in the Franklin area! She provided very detailed, accurate directions on how to find it, but I recommend arriving during daylight hours if possible, just to make sure you can confidently feel your way around. Kathy and her husband were very welcoming, and her dog is awesome, too! We had everything we needed for our quick stay, and we loved her beautiful piece of the wilderness."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a true Allegheny Forest getaway but close to trails and the beautiful town of Franklin. Kathy is a sweetie.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy was great, very friendly and informative. She gave us a great dinner recommendation and provided snacks, water and oatmeal for breakfast. Major, their dog gave us a warm welcome. Would stay again for sure."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jerry and Kathy are wonderful hosts! The private room they offer is comfortable and extremely peaceful. You can't hear cars or anything but nature! Their dog was lovely as well as their beautiful horses. They were very accomodating and welcomed us with joy. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in the woods.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very kind hosts and had a restful stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked Kathy's space as a resting point between NY and Michigan. Kathy was very accomodating and responsive. Her directions were very clear. You do need to follow them, as the GPS can take you in the wrong direction, which would be very confusing at night. The surrounding area is pretty dark. The paths are clearly marked with reflective tape. The property was secure, and we were able to conveniently enter without any issues. We met the hosts when leaving, not at arrival because of our own schedule. The space was very large, with plenty of place to sleep and lounge. We had lots of towels, toiletries, and many small considerations that made us feel welcome. We were also so surprised to see the horses. My son (4) was so excited to see animals. The environment is very tranquil, and we enjoyed the views. We hope to be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Communication was excellent!
Everything was as described.
She had breakfast items, coffee, water, and some candy.
To top things off, her husband got up super early to help us jump start our vehicle!
So thankful for their hospitality and kindness!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have ever wanted to wake up in a tree house but are a grown up and need amenities ; like a comfy bed, tv, coffee, and a bathroom this is the spot! We have stayed twice with Kathy and each time has been great. She answered questions, helped navigate this KC crew to her home, and was a gracious hostess. When I woke up facing the windows and saw the tall trees it felt like being in a treehouse surrounded by beauty. Thanks, Kathy, for a safe place for weary travelers."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy was a splendid hostess and went above and beyond for us. We came in late and she helped to guide us on the roads to the house. Her space was clean, fresh, and cozy. In the morning with the views it felt like we woke up in a tree house :) Will be coming back soon."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Down a dirt road, at the bottom of a hill, nestled in beautiful Pennsylvania woodlands, in the upstairs and back of a spacious self-built house with a pond and lots of peace and quiet, you'll find Kathy's AirBnB space. The main room is large with several beds, a sofa, table, and chairs; the big bed has the best mattress (imho). Bath was fine. The best things about the place: the personal warm welcome Kathy's husband gave me, the personal and thoughtful care for guests with which the place is maintained, and the lovely quiet woods. Real country dark and real rural peace. Helpful notes and tourist info provided. An easy drive to Franklin or to Titusville."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was more than accommodating. My car got stuck in the mud and they got my car pulled out. I’m beyond thankful for my hosts. Location is away from everything on a lovely estate. I could see horses, the pond and i can’t forget their lovely kitty and puppy. If you need a place around Franklin this is IT. Will be coming back."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great time
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place for a family get away! Whether it is a couple or a whole family, this is the place. We felt right at home and welcomed right from the start. This is the kind of place you would like to live, just not stay at!
Kathy and Jerry met us as we arrived, and Kathy made sure to keep us updated with any weather changes or details we needed to know.
We had 3 adults, a child and a toddler and the room was more than spacious. All the little extras from the candy on a plate to coffee, tea and water were fantastic.
We will definetly be back! Can't wait to see the place in the Summer!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a safe, cozy place in nature to stay, I would highly recommend Kathy’s AirBnB. I felt right at home and very comfortable. I loved that the spot is located in the woods. At first I was a little bit nervous of the drive to the house in the dark at night, but it’s a very clear, open path and I had no trouble at all. I also really appreciated Kathy’s communication and her friendliness at my arrival. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy has all the details right regarding creating a ""home"" feeling and the conveniences that a person might need when traveling."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place! It’s off the beaten path making it so quiet and peaceful. Kathy was great to work with and she was very communicative, ensuring I had everything I needed. The room is huge! She has a lot of games and puzzles and even a tv with a gaming console. Everything was comfortable, clean, and quiet. She also has a very sweet dog that greeted me one night. Overall my stay was a wonderful experience with a really lovely host."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveled to Franklin with my mom, doing some genealogical research. We had a FABULOUS time! Kathy and Jerry were lovely, the room was comfy and cozy! Coffee maker, microwave, mini-fridge: everything we needed for a quiet week away. Their pets (dog and cat) are total love bugs (mom called them the welcoming committee lol). Just a few minutes drive from Oil City and the City of Franklin. Talk about Main Street America! It’s a sweet little town, like something out of a hallmark movie. Cranberry is the next town over if you need to do any shopping.
Definitely consider this stay if you’re in the area! If we come up north again we’ll definitely be back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was hospitable, kind, and helpful. Everything was as described. The scenic view was lovely. Will definitely keep this in mind for future stays. If you're traveling in the snow, you'll want a durable and 4-wheel drive vehicle to travel the lane to the house."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy is a wonderful host and pays close attention to detail. Her home is extremely comfortable, well kept, and you'll wake up to peace, quiet, and horses grazing in a field for your view. Appreciated the different books, board games, and breakfast items that were made available. Highly recommend and I would stay again if in the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Quite place in the woods!!!!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great lodging value for engaging in Pennsylvania's Oil Region activities.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very pleased with our stay at Kathy's place. Great value, excellent communication, clean, and quiet. Highly recommended."
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,none
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy’s Airbnb is fantastic!
I only stopped here for about 7 hours or so to get some sleep on a long drive home— she was so accommodating for me, helped me out in a tough bind, and really saved our butts in the middle of the night even though she should’ve gone to bed! Haha.
This place is awesome, and I am already telling my friends I want to come back here for an actual vacation stay. Lots of beds, blankets, board games, candy, well stocked bathrooms, and an AC! Also, a pool and seemingly amazing grassy area outside. Also, I met a CUTE cat who showed us lots of love.
Be careful, though, folks, it gets dark on the drive in."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely Airbnb! Accurate description, easy to find and kind hosts! The Airbnb had everything we needed and we would definitely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very attentive host. Kathy made sure to call me when I wasn’t able to get in touch to make sure I was okay, if I needed anything and guide us to get to her property and the next day we met her and James and both were so kind to us and welcomed us.

The entrance to the room is behind the house, so you get to see the horses and the pond before you climb the inside stairs to the room. Once you're there, it's like being at home.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and spacious up stairs loft. The location is very quiet. Located in a rural setting without any neighbors nearby. The hosts where great and I would stay again.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quite place, real country house with a rooster waking you up in the morning. The communication from the host was excellent. When my GPS said that I had arrived to my destination, I was in the middle of nowhere with two horses in the field. So I opened my ipad and read the instructions how to get to the house and in 5 minutes I was in front of the house. I opened my ipad again and looked at the airbnb picture and the same picture was in front of me. Following the same instructions, it was easy to find the key and get to the room. The room was spacious and clean, has everything you need: bathroom, refrigerator, coffee machine and a board with answrers to all the questions you may have. I am a city girl, but I really enjoyed quitness and peacefulness of that place. Thank you very much."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place and a beautiful location. John couldn’t be a kinder or more friendly host. Unlike many listings this home and location look exactly like the picture shown. Very clean and comfortable quiet place. Even cold, rainy weather didn’t damp in our enjoyment."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came hear as a place to stay and explore the local scenery and go see the eclipse. We came during the off season but the place was still wonderful. It's a very peaceful place. The bald eagle nest across the river was an extra treat. (Will need binoculars or long telephoto lens to get a good view.) I think we will certainly consider coming back during the summer when we can enjoy the river and surroundings even more.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This is a beautiful modern and clean cabin. Perfect for a relaxing get away and pet friendly! John is quick to respond and nearby if you need anything! We will be back!

The home was spotless and the bedding of a good quality. Actually, everything in the cottage was top notch quality. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook meals like you were in your own home. John helped us out on a couple of things which we were very appreciative for. We would most definitely recommend and stay here again."

The home is very well maintained and is just what we were looking for!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is at least my third time staying with John and Darlene - who are fantastic hosts. I grew up literally along this stretch of river and there is no more beautiful place in the county. Highly recommended!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and setting, we could not have had a better experience. Perfect place to stay for a quiet weekend away with the family!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My family's second stay here, and now I am not interested in spending time anywhere else. Beautiful house on the bank of a lovely river -- if it's good enough for the eagles, herons, ducks, geese, turkeys, deer, turtles and the rest of the wildlife, it's good enough for us. The verandah is great for sitting morning, noon and evening, and there are hammocks and chairs all over the grounds for rest and ease. More restaurants than there used to be in this area, but with a wonderful kitchen and farm stands, who cares?"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Johns place is wonderful. It is quiet and serene. While you sit on the covered porch watching the river go by all you hear is the wind and the insects! The house is very quiet and comfortable! It has everything you need. I have stayed here before and will again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Right on the water, spacious kitchen stocked with anything you would need. The grill is excellent and on the porch which overlooks the river. John was very friendly and made us feel right at home but also gave us our space, it was a perfect combination. We utilized the kayaks which were an amazing touch. The fire pit is built out of large stones and was really cool. I can’t say enough good things about this spot."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had the best time! This cottage is beautiful, very clean, very stocked, very peaceful and relaxing! The porch is the best- most of our time was sitting at the table laughing and talking. The hosts are super nice and accommodating! This is our second time here and hopefully many more to come. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"John and Dar, thank you for opening your beautiful home to us! The pictures you have posted didn’t do it justice! Absolutely beautiful! The kayaks were an extra bonus! My girls really enjoyed their time on the river! Thank you and we will see you next year!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect place for our family get away
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we loved staying here! the huge porch was wonderful, kitchen had everything needed, and access to the river and kayaks really made the experience. We found the upstairs bed to be pretty firm, and we usually like firm beds, though the others were fine. The tap water was soft (sulfer smell), so we bought water to drink. These are minor issues in an otherwise very positive experience. Condition of the house was fantastic. Definitely hope to be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful location, comfortable home, and excellent host! Highly recommended for a peaceful, relaxing getaway"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Breathtaking the pictures don’t do the cabin justice. Secluded private got to spend some amazing time with kids and husband. Great way to unplug from your electronics. John and wife were great hostess. Would definitely be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John and Darlene are wonderful hosts. We had the best time kayaking every day and watching the bald eagles and their fledglings. Rain or shine, nothing beats morning coffee on that front deck. Bring your binoculars. Thank you so much, we’re coming back next year :)"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"John & Darlene’s place was beautiful. The views are amazing! The porch is so gorgeous and inviting I wish we would have had the weather to enjoy it. I get homesick on the road as my husband, little dog and I travel a lot, but the home was so comfortable that I almost didn’t miss my own beautiful home!
John and Darlene’s place was cleaner and more well stocked than any of the former homes we have stayed in."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nothing short of a wonderful time - spending a post-Christmas holiday with loved ones and pups! We had a beautiful winters fire by the river, and cooked a few meals together all the while sharing laughter and serenity. Recommend highly!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely my favorite place to unwind and relax. It’s a good place to disconnect before the holiday season and I very much look forward to staying here. John is a very kind host.
My personal favorites are the river view, the grill on the porch, the couch is super comfy and perfect to sit and do work, the kitchen is phenomenal—everything you could possibly need to make whatever you’re craving and the bed is comfy!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I had already stayed here and added another week. I was in need of a quiet peaceful place to just relax ! This place was perfect.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John and Darlene’s place is a piece of heaven that I’ve returned to twice this year. As a native of this area, I can confidently say there is no better place to stay along the Allegheny River than this cottage. Nothing like waking up to eagles flying overhead! Great services and modern conveniences - my T-Mobile cell phone was pulling down 75-80 and pushing up 25. Friends using other providers had similar luck. Great place to get off the grid and still be able to take a call or check email when you want to."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything in the AirBnB description is as stated. It is in a quiet location and very well appointed. We enjoyed biking the bike trails in the area and hanging out at the cabin.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fantastically gorgeous setting on the river for fun or relaxation. Eagles, herons, ducks and bunnies thrive there and so did I. The house is spectacular and comfortable, fully equipped for indoor and outdoor entertainment. The porch is amazing, great to sit out on even in the pouring rain. The hosts are nearby, if you need them, but we didn't. Everything was perfect."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time back at the cabin. Words cannot explain our experience, it was such a relaxing week for our family. Mr.John and Mrs.Darlene are such amazing people always attentive to anything we needed. The river was so relaxing and joyful as we spent most of our days there. The paddle board lessons taught by Mr.John was a memory my husband will forever cherish. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner was so enjoyable out on the porch, no rainy days except one but that didn’t get in our way of enjoying our vacation. The way Mr.John and Mrs.Darlene cared for us as if we were apart of their family, was incredible just as we see them as one of us. To top it off, the boat ride Mr.John and Mrs.Darlene offered us was a cherry on top! We are definitely coming back! Thank you. Sincerely, The Serrano Family."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at this cabin on the Allegheny River was absolutely perfect. The cabin was immaculate and comfortable. The view and access to the river was fabulous! We hiked along the river & swam. We did not make use of the kayaks on this trip but will do so next time. We will definitely return next summer, and will be rebooking soon. Thanks John for a top notch experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is glorious! Attention to detail is second to none, and the description is spot on. The river is beautiful, the cabin is delightful, and John is attentive and friendly! I’d recommend this stay to anyone, hope to return again."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The Cabin is pristine and the location is excellent. The ammenties are above and beyond, everything anyone could as for an more. A nice surprise for my granddaughters was a trampoline, they bounced there hearts out. The owners thought of everything possible, from spices for cooking, access to kayaks, to firewood to purchase on site. John and Darlene were helpful with suggestions for activities to attend in the area. We took advantage of the large comfortable porch, with playing games, making crafts, eating on the large table next to the large propane grill. Definitely a 5/5 or a 10/10 or 100/100 whatever number you use this Cabin is an A+. We enjoyed a fabulous long holidy weekend from the minute we arrived on Friday till we left on Monday."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,John's home is a relaxing paradise. There is so much to do without ever leaving the property. This vacation was exactly what my family needed. thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,John's house was beautiful. It was well furnished and everything we needed was provided. Getting out on the river in the kayak's was fun and the kids loved it. We had a wonderful time!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will not be disappointed with this beautiful home and the location is absolutely amazing. The porch is a place that you will talk about month after you leave. There is everything you need and more. The homeowner really took the time to make sure you have everything you need. We will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin has a cozy, folksy feeling, but at the same time it contains high-quality appliances, furniture, cookware, bedding, etc. Scruptulously clean. Nothing cheap or flimsy here. Very generously provisioned with supplies. The kitchen is equipped for serious cooking, if you're up for it. (Not much in the way of restaurants in the area, so we ate most of our meals at the cabin.) Our party ranged in age from 8 months to 75 years, and everyone happily enjoyed the venue in different ways. The covered porch overlooking the river was so comfortable and inviting. Even a rainy day was magical. The hosts, who live nearby, were friendly and helpful, but also respected our privacy."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This cottage is a piece of heaven! I grew up in this community, so I can say without any hesitation this is one of if not the nicest cottages in the county and Pennsylvania. And John and Darlene are excellent, attentive, communicative and kind hosts who have thought of everything.
Everyday you will see deer, geese, ducks, otters, amongst other wildlife. The cottage is recent construction and has all the modern conveniences and is spotlessly clean. Bedrooms are large with very comfortable beds. A big kitchen with an island is a perfect breakfast spot, while the large front porch facing the river is a fantastic lunch and dinner venue. We grilled every day on the huge gas grill in between trips down to the river dock for fishing and swimming. Down by the river, the fire pit is huge and the Adirondack chairs and picnic tables make a great place for family gatherings. I've already booked to come back in October!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,10 Star vacation! Lovely location and super host. Certainly did not want to leave. Coffee on the deck with a good book in the morning was the best. GREAT kayaking. Quiet and peaceful.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"John’s place is a treat to yourself if you wanna go with family or friends. It’s a really cozy place just by the river. We loved doing bonfire by river and kayaking. The house has everything that you need a break from city life. Even though it rained on one of the days during our stay, we enjoyed that as well by just seating on porch and doing BBQ. John is an amazing host. I would recommend His place to everyone. We will definitely visit this place again.
Thank you John and Darlene."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,John and Darlene are great hosts! This house and property are beautiful! We couldn't have asked for a better experience. The home has everything you would need for a great stay on the river!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at this cabin over Easter weekend, and it was perfect. While the weather wasn’t the best, we were still able to enjoy walking along the river, relaxing on the covered porch, and keeping warm by the fire pit. The house was spotless and the beds were comfortable. Also located close to Oil City and Franklin to take advantage of their restaurants and coffee shops. Can’t wait to return when the weather is warmer."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely cabin, with a beautiful view-- if you love nature and wildlife, this is the spot for you! John and Darlene are great hosts, very close if you need something, but not bothersome. Beds are comfy, kitchen is stocked with all the essentials & appliances, and the front porch is right out of a magazine. The cabin is clean, spacious and has a great layout. Fishing on the Allegheny is an added bonus. We will be back when warmer weather comes to PA!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place! Super clean, very peaceful, beautiful environment! You just can’t get enough of it. John and Darlene were wonderful hosts, very nice and super blessed. We made memories there and we hope to make more. We’re for sure coming back! Thank you, John and Darlene."

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful place to spend a vacation in. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Many thanks to John and Darlene! This was the first time my wife and I ever stayed at a property through AirBnB. This was a great experience. We visited Oil City and the Oil Creek State Park. Although it rained throughout most of our stay we were able to get out and hike many of the area trails, check out waterfalls, and then come back to relax at such a nice home. 4 wheel drive will come in handy when visiting some of the obscure trails and would be a ""must have"" when there is snow and ice. We now have relatives that want to book this home. Thank you John and Darlene."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay at this beautiful cabin on the river. The hosts were very kind and accommodating. Couldn’t have asked for a better setting for spending time with family.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing cabin on a beautiful location. The hosts are top notch!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and secluded location. We wanted a peaceful place to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and we found exactly that. From sitting on the porch in the rain to watching the ducks and listening to the sounds of nature, everything was perfect. John and Darlene provide a clean and beautiful place with everything you could possibly need for cooking."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you’re looking for peace and quiet. Awesome owners.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our secluded, quiet, scenic and hospitable stay. The house was clean and comfortable. The property was perfect for kids and adults."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"John and Darlene were exceptional hosts. Their place was lovely, clean, bright, and welcoming. We had everything we needed - all the comforts of home, everything we needed to cook and serve a meal. There was a nice array of spices as well, and everything we needed to make a pot of drip brew coffee (we did bring our own coffee abs filters just in case though). The only thing we found missing in the kitchen was a wine bottle (corkscrew) opener. However there is a liquor store right in town in Oil City, so we picked one up there. The location right on the river was wonderful and mostly private. You can’t see any other homes except for John and Darlene who live about 50 or so yards away next door. Because they’re so close they checked on us once we got settled in to make sure we had everything we needed. They also left a little note with tips on the kitchen counter as well. Don’t forget to sign their guest book!
They also offer daily kayak rentals including life jackets and firewood can be purchased on site (at a premium for the convenience, compared to purchasing a cord yourself). The fire pit is quite large and there are Adirondack chairs for 5 or 6. The only downside about the fire pit is that it’s hard to get quite close enough to make mountain pies and s’mores because of the large rocks that make up the outer “ring”. We managed though and it worked out just fine. Small children will need a little extra help.
The beds and couch were comfy, and there were enough linens and blankets for everyone. Internet was decent but you’re in the woods so shut it off anyhow!
We were able to swim from the shore and play in the water with the little one. We also tied a few floaties off the dock and spent some time floating and relaxing in place. Lots of eagle sightings and an owl, too.
The only other thing I would like to mention, and it’s at no fault of the hosts, is the water has a slight odor. I believe it may be because this is well water? I’m not certain, but there was a definite odor to the water. We ended up going into town and buying several large 3 gallon jugs of water for drinking, cooking, and brushing our teeth. I’m sure it’s safe to drink, it was just unpleasant. Again, no fault of John - you’ll have that in the country sometimes. No big deal.
All in all it was a wonderful stay and we definitely plan to return. I’ve already told a few friends about the place because we enjoyed it so much!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay ! The hospitality was excellent and absolutely everything was considered , truly felt like home away from home. The location is exactly what we wanted , very peaceful and surrounded by the beauty of nature. Also the communication was great and very personable, we had a question and the owners were quick to reply. If we are ever planning a trip out that way in the future we would love to book a stay here again.
Thank you again !"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing getaway. The view was perfect and the place was everything we wanted and more.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rain or shine we had a fantastic time. John and Darlene were extremely enjoyable to talk to as well as accommodating. The porch was perfect, during the rain we lounged watching the river and it’s big enough to have movies on our projector at night. We floated in tubes anchored to the dock most of the trip and saw an abundance of wildlife throughout the stay. It was really close to perfect."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spacious cabin is in a peaceful and enchanting setting along the river. It is well-maintained and has good quality furnishings. The kitchen is well-stocked with cooking pots, pans, and utensils, (and has a nice variety of spices). We found the bedding in the second floor master to be very comfortable. We spent hours enjoying the fresh air on the wide porch, which has sitting and eating areas, complete with new grill. The basement and dock areas are used by the owners; they lived in the cabin for several years, before building the house next door. They could not have been nicer. A perfect place to enjoy the comforts of home and the great outdoors! You will not be disappointed."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,a beautiful place the hosts were incredible very nice people we want to return again waooo it was wonderful to stay there
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, quiet home with amazing scenery. John is the perfect host and we look forward to staying there whenever we are in the area."
