The home is a separate location and on the same property as their family home. It was a bit off the interstate, down an unpaved country road. It is super easy to get to from Quincy proper. Rudy was very accessible and made himself available for any of my needs. I will be staying when I am in the Quincy area."

She has thought of special touches (snacks, coffee, sugar, etc.) that we haven't seen at other Airbnbs and they were appreciated after a long day of driving. The living room is incredibly inviting and the kitchen and dining room are set up perfectly. We wish we would have been able to stay for more than one night but look forward to visiting again soon.

The house is in a really great location, the dollar store you can walk to if you forget something or need something and the gas station is right beside it. Shandi was a great host, she answered all my questions when we was trying to make the decision of where to stay. Shandi was very quick to get back to us when we messaged her. When we arrived there was drinks and snacks if needed for the first night. My boys really loved the triple bunk in the room so they all had their own beds, and didn't have to share.

I was particularly grateful for a well-equipped kitchen, which allowed me to cook my own meals while I was in town.
The house is a bit off the beaten path, on the edge of town, but that means you're away from the hustle and bustle of the city traffic.
It snowed heavily one day/night I was in town. I was delighted to find that Shandi had the driveway plowed and walkway shoveled and salted before I woke up. Very kind and greatly appreciated.
Shandi was incredibly communicative, with quick responses and she was very accommodating.
I highly recommend booking this place."

There was no hand rail on the stairs leading up to the entrance, which was a little difficult for my mom’s bad knees. The two small steps inside between the hallway and kitchen are a little hard to see, as they are similarly tiled to the adjacent flooring. There was also some noise in the evenings from the upstairs neighbors. The neighborhood was otherwise quiet and so close to town. Ashley’s space was overall great and I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Quincy while I attended a wedding in Barry.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed for nearly two weeks and it truly felt like a home away from home. It was a beautiful home and property. The photos are wonderful but it’s even more spacious in real life. Next time we’re in Quincy we will look to see if the home is available as it served our family perfectly and there is no need to look elsewhere.

The downstairs bed could be improved, but overall this was a great stay and we'd stay here again and highly recommend it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at their place. They were super easy hosts to work with and were always responsive. The house was clearly recently (and thoughtfully) remodeled. It was nice that there were 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. The living room was cozy and my kiddos loved played foosball in the basement or curling up on the big couch watching TV. They also loved playing the board games.
The back yard was great and we enjoyed hanging out there as well. The location is perfect. I would highly recommend this place and hope to stay again next year!"

The beds and pillows were very comfortable.
I would book with Jamie and Jordan again if I need a space in Quincy another time down the road."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a family wedding nearby and several older couples needed a place to stay. This place was perfect for them, since we needed multiple bathrooms and rooms on the main floor. It was well equipped and as described. The only thing we found difficult was the parking situation since the street isn't an option and we had a lot of coming and going because of the wedding."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This nicely renovated home was perfect for our three couples, with a well-equipped kitchen, a living room, and nice family room with tv and foosball. The backyard is beautiful, and we enjoyed visiting on the comfy seating on the front porch. It’s a great place!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"A group of us college friends met up for a reunion in Quincy since it was kind of the center-most location for everyone. When I came across this house, it was PERFECT! We spent so much time in the kitchen and the basement playing games, cooking, laughing and making memories! The house was spacious and there was PLENTY of room for everyone. Plus, the kitchen had enough supplies for us to cook and make dinner instead of having to eat out all weekend. It also was SUPER clean which was a huge plus. Jamie and Jordan also had games available, which we stayed up way to late playing. We had a fantastic time!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! The house was perfect for our stay. Everything was exactly as described, the little extras were just so nice! I haven't had many stays with so many nice details - q-tips, first aid kit, lotions in the bathrooms. All the towels you could need, enough trash bags, soap. It was just wonderful. The extras blankets were so nice to have as well."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We cannot say enough good things about Jordan and Jamie's place! They thought of every single detail and had everything we could need. We used it as a home base for a group of adult cousins in town for Thanksgiving and it was so great that we didn't even end up needing to leave! Each bedroom was spacious, clean and comfortable. The basement was the best part - we spent many hours down there playing games and hanging out. Thank you so much for such a wonderful stay!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a family emergency. Drove up that morning after receiving bad news. Jessica was very nice. We were able to check in early due to the emergency. Jessica also advised on other things that could help while we were there and for the nature of our visit. She was very nice and understanding. We had to leave early but enjoyed every minute there. The place is just as described and the neighborhood was really quiet. Thank you again Jessica, for everything."

The house was very nice, two great bedrooms and was perfect for what we needed. Nice neighborhood walking distance to some restaurants and bars. Easy parking. Very clean. Would definitely stay again and probably will since we’ll be back to see my son there again in the future."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Property served as an overnight stay for part of 4 adults (wife & I + her two sisters) traveling from Boston to St Joseph, Missouri. It is located in a neighborhood and was a bit difficult to find because we arrived late at night and there is also a Google Maps issue. However, using the Airbnb pictures, we were able to make a positive ID. We were very pleased with the property. The beds were comfortable, and the home was very clean and well appointed. We really had no opportunity to explore the area. We must stress that we were very pleased with our stay and have no reservations recommending this property for your travels."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,lovely home

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfection! I most likely won't have enough room so I'll sum it up. I have already traveled to 15 states this year(3rd week of February) this is far beyond any other airbnb that I've stayed in. Jessica has absolutely nailed the home. She's considered everything. The obvious remodel is amazing and all the amenities are more than the norm by air bnb standards.
As much as I travel I always rent an entire house so I can ensure my comfort. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was supplied with everything needed to cook my meals and eat as healthy as I normally do. 5 stars! I would highly recommend staying with Jessica's for a night or weeks at a time. You can't go wrong!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay! We were able to get away and enjoy ourselves without hassling with an annoying hotel. Jessica’s home was gorgeous and homey at the same time. We immediately felt comfortable to cozy right in when we arrived.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay & host. Comfy and clean home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was exactly as described and was one of the most well-appointed Airbnb places I’ve stayed at with extra towels, plentiful dishes and pots/pans in the kitchen, games, WiFi, and even some things for our four-legged guest. I’d come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, thanks!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was comfortable and clean, had a very nice stay here."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had an enjoyable stay at Jessica’s. The place was very spacious and the bathrooms were in good condition. The mattresses are memory foam and on the firmer side, so if that’s not your cup of tea it may not be comfortable for you."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Jessica’s AirBnB! It was extremely clean, had absolutely everything we would needed, and comfortable beds. 10/10 would stay again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful spot, so charming and clean! Highly recommend, we hope to come back again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It’s a very good size place for 3 adults, a Labrador, 7 month old, and 2 year old. Lots of room for the babies to run and crawl. My husband and I had a bathroom separate from one for my dad. They provided everything needed for the babies (booster high chair, pack and play, dishes for the toddler). They even provided things for our dog so if we had forgotten anything, it was available.
This neighborhood has come a long ways since the 90s! My dad loved the place so much he’s making his own account with plans to save this place to be a repeat guest in the future when we or just him come back to see family and family friends."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute place, as advertised. Dogs loved the toys there and our family sat at the dinner table and played uno and boggle (games provided there) for hours. Easy to get to and from anywhere in Quincy.
There for family visit."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot to stay, very clean and comfortable!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great to stay here again! Very cool place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’m just not sure where to start. Jessica and her place are lovely.. She thought of everything! From the Bath & Body Works hand soap, to the abundance of towels, paper towels, toilet paper, dishes, cleaning supplies. There were plenty of beds and bedding. She accommodated a big group, plus our 2 Cocker Spaniels. She is laid back in her approach, and it just makes you want to go out of your way to respect her and her place. She was very quick to respond, within minutes, and so so nice!!! The place was peaceful, clean, and I didn’t want to leave. They really know what they are doing as hosts, and I hope they continue to expand so many others can have the same great experience that we did!"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was deep cleaned for the most part but there were many places within the home that were not clean or missed: The refrigerator and freezer were dirty, please see photos. It looked as if both had not been cleaned in between stays. There was opened food left in the freezer. The dishwasher was full of dirty dishes when we arrived. The shower in the primary bedroom had spots of dirt and hair while the sink had the same. The chair/twin sized ‘bed’ in the second bedroom, it’s fairly uncomfortable. The cushioning is not soft, it’s rather hard and stiff. Once unfolded, the legs drop down and would cause someone to sleep at an angle. The thermostat seemed to keep switching on its own and blasting heat upstairs at random while the downstairs was freezing. We did read the manual but despite our efforts in correcting the heat, it didn’t work."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the decor of the house. Fresh bedding! Great choice.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Quiet neighborhood

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just returned from my niece’s wedding and enjoyed a wonderful weekend stay in Quincy Quarters! Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The unit was clean, well-appointed, and super cozy. The location was a fantastic home-base for traveling to and from wedding festivities in downtown Quincy. Communication was seamless and Jessica was super responsive and thoughtful. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing!!!! I felt right at home as soon as I walked in!!!! The place is comfy and cozy! They had coffee and creamer!!!! I knew I would love this place on that fact alone. The bed was super comfortable and I got the most restful sleep I have had in a while. She was extremely accommodating and allowed me to drop luggage off early. Then I went on to see the play without having to worry about bags in my car!!! I will definitely return, even if just for the relaxing vibe her place has!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was spotless and had amenities above and beyond what was listed. We wanted for nothing. It was nicely decorated and in a very cute neighborhood. Would highly recommend this place for a weekend stay with family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable, easy check in and out and well equipped. She has a box of dog toys in the dining area which is a special touch."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second time staying at one of Jessica’s units. The place is lovely, comfortable and immaculate! I will be back:)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It felt like being right at home in a different city. I would recommend to anyone and it was a nice quiet neighborhood. The host always responded in great timing.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. They have the house prepared for any occasion. Fully stocked with anything a person could need. Maybe more than I have at home. It was very clean, cute, quiet and comfortable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Air bnb we’ve ever stayed at! Jessica’s place was extremely clean, smelled fantastic and decorated well. She really thought of everything from brochures about the town, to clear signage identifying the bnb."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice duplex, pet friendly, our dog Beans liked the basket of dog toys, very nice kitchen, and a spacious downstairs bathroom / laundry room.
The stairs to bedrooms were challenging for me, but doable. Good value."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.. Had everything I needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were so pleased with our stay in Quincy. Jessica's place was situated in a quiet neighborhood that was easy to find. The home doesn't have much of a yard and the duplex next door gets most of it since its fenced in. There were plenty of pillows and blankets for everyone who came on our trip and the bed in the room with an attached bathroom was heavenly. Although it is not listed, they do have a portable high chair which made feeding my son much easier while we were there. Everything worked as it should, but I did see a note in the guest book that the dishwasher had been leaking, which made me worried to use it (luckily no leaking when we were there). I couldn't find a noodle strainer which made cooking a big spaghetti dinner for my family a bit tricky, but we made due. The kitchen was amazing, with all the amenities you could need. A beautiful space for sure. The next time we stay in Quincy, this will be the first place that we try to book because the stay was so pleasant."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was fantastic! My husband and I were in Quincy for a little getaway to say goodbye to summer. We stayed at Quincy Quarters and loved it. Everything was spotless and beautiful, and there were so many great touches and amenities. Jessica thought of everything. We especially loved that there were brochures and maps
of the area, as well as Jessica's recommendations for places to eat or drink. We tried a few of the places, and she was spot on. We can't wait to come back and try to get to the rest! We love that the home is pet friendly! Our little shihpoo was so excited to see a full basket full of toys. There was a second basket with a dog bowl and some extra poop bags! 😀 Like I said, Jessica thought of everything, and we cannot wait to return!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jessica property just like Jessica was Awesome!!! It was so clean and everything was Awesome! The property is very nice and I recommend this property highly!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I was in Quincy for 1 night to get my son moved into the University. The house was 5 mins drive away from campus which was perfect. I've already decided to stay here again if it's available on my next trip.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved the home and where it was located. Everything was ABOVE my expectations as a first time air bnb renter. When I come back to visit family again I would absolutely choose her first if available. Anything you could possibly have needed other than food was available to you upon arrival.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Jessica's place which surpassed all my expectations, and I cannot contain my excitement to share my extraordinary experience. From the moment I arrived until the day of departure, every aspect of my stay was simply outstanding.
The communication from the host was exemplary. From the initial booking inquiry to the end of my stay, the host was prompt, courteous, and incredibly helpful. They responded to my messages in a timely manner, providing detailed information about the property, and local attractions.
Overall, I cannot emphasize enough how amazing my stay at this Airbnb was. The combination of exceptional cleanliness, remarkable communication, and comprehensive amenities made it a truly outstanding experience. Whether you're seeking a tranquil retreat or a bustling city adventure, this Airbnb offers the perfect sanctuary to unwind and recharge. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at The Quincy Quarters! Super cute place & very clean and organized. Jessica was a great host sending thorough, proactive communication before we arrived. Once arriving, we discovered that that same approach was taken with setting the home up….from bedding, to paper plates, to laundry detergent & even coffee creamer…..she has thought of it all, making it a wonderful home away from home. We booked our next stay before checking out today."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An awesome place to stay. Will definitely look to book again when we are in the area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jessica’s house is amazing! It is adorably decorated and includes everything you could need in a home away from home! The house was very clean, which is the most important thing for my husband and I, when traveling. We can be a little OCD. I always bring my own cleaning supplies on vacation, I didn’t need to use them.
Jessica did a wonderful job with providing information prior to arriving, as well as instructions left in the home. We did not need to contact her during our stay.
The only thing that was disappointing was the noise level of the neighbors on our first night. The home is a duplex and the walls were thin in between the two units. It sounded as if the neighbors were running up and down the stairs and around the bedrooms well past midnight. We realized that that unit is another Airbnb, so that will not be the case for everyone. Even with the noise (only on the first night) we still give our stay 5 stars. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quincy Quarters is comfortable with lots of extra touches - happy to have stayed there again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect space for us. The home was beyond clean and so cozy. Jessica was so kind throughout our whole experience.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Clean, cute and great location. Would definitely stay here again!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quincy Quarters was the perfect location for our stay. Its location is close to everything you need, yet far enough away from the hustle and bustle. There was plenty of room for the four of us to spread out when we had down time from the swim meet (what brought us to Quincy).
Every aspect of the listing and pictures were accurate. Jessica was accommodating with my initial booking (I had trouble on my end adding an extra night), and we also needed a slightly earlier check-in based on the swim meet schedule. She was a great communicator from the beginning.
The welcome book and guest book contained so much helpful information, including some local recommendations! We would highly recommend The Abbey, Underbrinks Bakery, Scottie’s Fun Spot (for those with kids), Gem City Pizza, Chick’s on the River, and of course TCBY!
(Something to note is that although there is a bathroom on the second floor, you must go through one of the bedrooms to get there. If you are in the other bedroom, your options are to go downstairs, or go through the other bedroom.)
This will be our first choice when we visit Quincy again next summer!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful, CLEAN, comfortable and conveniently located home. We were in town for a family reunion and this home comfortably fit me, my husband, our one year old daughter and my in-laws. Next time we are in town we would love to stay here again! Next time we won’t bother packing a pack n play or an infant eating chair - both were there and available for use."

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you will be staying anywhere near Quincy Illinois, this place is the perfect spot! Look no farther. The place was meticulously clean. The check in process was simple and easy. The decoration was spot on, right down to the fall decorations for our October stay, and the bath and Bodyworks scented soaps in the bathrooms. This truly felt like a home away from home. From the moment you walked in, you felt cozy. The towels, linens and bath mats felt high quality and brand new. Even the selection of pillows was varied with different firmnesses to accommodate your preference. There was even a box fan in one of the rooms, which helped us sleep well. I plan to be a return guest in the near future!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"By far the best AirBNB in Quincy! So comfy, we all felt at home! The pictures make it seem like it’s smaller than it really is! We were very pleased and impressed!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best Airbnb we've stayed at. Very nicely decorated. Homey and comfortable. Beds were so comfortable. There were so many nice amenities with everything we could need or want. Plenty of paper goods, soap, shampoo, shower gel, towels, bedding, ice, etc. Nice to have coffee and all the different creamers. So happy to find such a nice place that allowed pets. We took our two dogs and they were comfortable too. One of them found the basket of dog toys and had things pulled out to play with before we even got all our things inside. Seamless check in and check out. Nice to have privacy. Great job on the renovation with special details that added to the charm; Modern needs met with a hint of 1880 character such as the door trim and baseboards. If we come back to Quincy we will definitely stay at Quincy Quarters. Thank you for offering this lovely property."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, lovely"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the beautiful,stylish and comfortable space that Jessica has. It was very private and you'd never know you're in the middle of a busy city.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderfully restored charming duplex home. Location is near downtown but is in a quiet residential neighborhood. It has easy access to everything Quincy and nearby Missouri has to offer. We will definitely stay here again!!
2021-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"We expected “upstairs bedrooms” to be up 8 or 10 steps up instead of 16 steps up, and then 16 steps down.
And 2 bathrooms suggested 2 separate bathrooms. Instead, this place had one bathroom downstairs and one bathroom upstairs that required walking through one bedroom to get to. Just one bathroom upstairs with two bedrooms, and that bathroom inside one of the bedrooms was not good accommodations.
Another comment - why was I charged $25 to clean when I stripped the sheets off the beds, took out the trash and picked up kitchen before leaving?"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was exceptional. We loved that it was close to the historic district. We enjoyed walking to see so many beautiful old homes. It was clean and very classy throughout.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Decorated very nicely. Clean and fresh smelling. Upstairs bedrooms were a little warm but cooled off and provided fans were a great help! Master bath has a very small sink-adding some shelves or a small table would help for storage. Fabulous kitchen stocked w lots of extras, living room, and dining area w games. Huge laundry/bath was nice too. It was 20-30 mins to get to Hannibal but not too bad. We enjoyed our stay. Great value!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, felt like home. Very clean and organized. The attention to detail is unmatched. Many extras like board games to play, toys for dogs, even baby friendly items available like a baby gate, a baby seat with tray and more. 12/10 would recommend. I appreciated the local recommendations Jessica provided for restaurants and grocery stores as well as brochures for the area. Easy to see why she's a superhost."

It is sleek, well designed, and clean. Fantastic bedrooms and showers. This was worth every penny not to mention all of the amenities and cooking tools available. The downstairs washroom has an amzing amount of room for laundry over long stays. You get your moneys worth here and dogs can stay too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully renovated space with everything we needed for a visit to family in the area. The spacious kitchen gave us plenty of room to gather while we prepped our contribution to a picnic, and the inclusion of many flavors of coffee creamer was a huge hit! It's a lovely place to stay."

My suggestion would be a hook outside of the shower in the primary bedroom to hang the towel closer to grab it without stepping out of the shower.
Also a garbage can outside possibly. We had to leave the garbage in the kitchen."

It was great to have a handwritten note and a box of cookies waiting for us upon arrival, and the guestbook was a great idea! We preferred parking in the garage as opposed to in the street in front of the house because the street can be busy, so it was great to have an alternative.

I love that there are no stairs or even a porch step-up, which made it very easy to get in and out. I enjoyed the neighborhood: walkable with interesting houses nearby. It was fun having a front porch to sit on and watch neighbors walk by. Also a back porch with a table for eating outdoors, very pleasant. Nice spacious master bathroom with lots of space to put stuff. Very comfy bed and linens. No dressers in bedrooms, though, except for child bedroom. You'll have to get creative to put your stuff away. Host was super responsive and fun to communicate with. I enjoyed my nearly 2-week stay. This is now one of my favorite airbnbs in Quincy"

This home was built in 2022 so everything was brand spanking new. Ordering DoorDash for liquor or food delivery was a breeze.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was quite impressed with the Carriage House. It is just like the pictures. Clean, organized, roomy off street parking, nice semi-private patio area, and the inside space was larger than I thought it would be. The inside theme of the house was what originally caught my interest, since I love history and horses. Other little things during my stay that made it even better were good water pressure in the shower, a quiet (and nicely cold) refrigerator, I could walk around barefoot inside and not step on anything on the bare floor areas. There were a couple little items I didn't have with me, and I found them available here, no mad dash needed to be made to a store . Temperature inside was easily controlled to my liking. Outside lighting kept my car visible, and I felt comfortable there traveling alone. The host Carol quickly replied to any of my inquiries. This is the third bnb I've stayed at in Quincy, definitely the best one so far to me. I would definitely stay here again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked with Miss Carol at the absolute last minute, but thankfully she approved the booking and she did so quite quickly. The pictures of her place were what drew me to it and it was even better in person. I love horses and the horse themed decor was fabulous. Miss Carol is so very talented in decorating! I don't think it could have been any nicer. From the rugs to the chandeliers, the full sized painting of the horse looking in the side door to the running wrought iron horse behind the stove, it was all amazing. The bed was ""just right"", the kitchen had everything we needed for cooking our meals, and the ample supply of towels in the bathroom were so soft and plush. The love seat and chair were sooo comfortable--I could go on and on. The carriage house was very clean and so inviting and relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carol went way above the call of duty for a hostess.
I booked because I was attending my brothers funeral. Unfortunately The airline industry had massive cancellations due to a winter storm and all my flights were. Cancelled. Initially Airbnb was refunding only half my two night booking because of late notice cancellation rules. I was already depressed about missing the funeral. She fought to get me a full refund. She’s great!
Definitely will try to book with her next summer for family reunion.
Thank you so much Carol!!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My Wife and I came to town to visit her family. The Gem perfectly fit our needs. Blake was immediately responsive when I called with a question upon our arrival. The apartment was immaculate and outfitted with solid furniture and appliances. The apartment was very comfortable. The internet worked beautifully. My Wife is from Quincy and the Gem’s central location made all areas convenient. We liked the Gem so well I’ve already booked it for the Family Reunion July 4th Holiday.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were in town to visit family and this place was perfect. Blake was super communicable when I had questions and even let me bring my little cat last-minute to our stay! She absolutely loved lounging on the living room chair while we were away. It was quiet pretty much 24/7, and the parking lot right at the door made it easy for us to get up and go in the mornings and not worry about parking on our returns. LOVED the coffee options for the Keurig—no less than four different types to brew! Thank you Blake!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best place you could stay at this price
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for eight days for Christmas with my fiancé and my dog and this place was more than perfect! When we arrived, everything was clean, spotless, and very cozy.
The apartment was fully stocked and my favorite part was the Keurig machine of course (I had a cup of coffee every morning and there was still plenty of k cups to go around). The kitchen was helpful during the big freeze because we could cook easily and the wifi was perfect for my fiancé to work remotely from his computer for a few days. The central heating was a lifesaver too in the -33 degree windchill!
The host was very responsive and friendly to any questions we had during our trip. I very much appreciate how welcoming he was to us and our little dog we brought along.
I highly recommend staying here (especially if you are a travel nurse since it is so close to the hospital and this apartment is perfectly stocked for long stays). I will definitely come back for future holidays! :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely well-appointed kitchen and home. Lots of room to spread out. Everything we needed to be comfortable and feel like a home away from home. Especially appreciated the luggage stand and TV in the bedroom. We will definitely rebook this location on future trips to Quincy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolute gem of a home! Beautiful to look at (a gorgeous pairing of natural tones and pops of color), comfortable, and even entertaining (with historical books, including picture books, of Quincy, and ping-pong and corn hole games in the basement). Even though it's a block from busy Broadway, you'd never know it from inside because the home is perfectly quiet. The owners paid attention to all the touches, including a coffee/tea station with supplies, fluffy towels, and a flowering tree in the yard, visible from the couch. It's a 5 min. walk to lovely Madison Park and Chaddock School. You can walk to the grocery store, too. The host is friendly and responsive. A+ all-around."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay this past week. My family felt like home instantly. We love the basement hang out with ping pong and games. I was able to relax and complete a puzzle in the kitchenette. We just enjoyed our family time there and will plan to stay again!

The house works great us and our adult children, and the location is perfect - a lovely neighborhood with the ability to walk to restaurants, etc. There were a couple things I mentioned in my first review that needed to be addressed and Kenneth had totally fixed them ! Will definitely stay again ."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay in this gem very much. The home is situated in the nicest neighborhood in Quincy. It had everything we needed and more to make our five night visit to Quincy for our daughter’s graduation a habitat for connecting and making memories. I loved that all of the bedrooms were on upper floors so that the entire first floor was open for family time. But the comfort of the front and back porch was an added bonus. The neighborhood itself is very sweet. The birds and the squirrels provided great entertainment. We have visited Quincy several times over that last couple of years and this was by far my favorite place we have stayed.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We have rented this house many times and it is always a great rental and Kenneth is great to work with - thank you!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place & wonderful quiet neighborhood!

The beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed! The location and surrounding area is beautiful! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Quincy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kenneth’s home was a comfortable place to stay for our family. I loved that he had plenty of clean towels available, a stocked coffee bar, and outdoor seating on the porch and in the backyard. We recommend this rental for anyone visiting Quincy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our family of six. Everyone had their own sleeping space, the modern kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, and the white and pink dogwoods in the front yard were in full bloom. We especially enjoyed the fully stocked coffee bar. One afternoon we spent grilling and sitting around the backyard gas fire pit with our 90-year-old mothers enjoying each other's company (three generations!) and playing cornhole and pingpong (in garage). An added bonus was the beautiful, quiet, historical neighborhood. My son and I walked down to State Street Bar & Grill for dinner one night and my son and daughter-in-law walked to get ice cream and tour a local museum. A real gem!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My father and myself and 2 adult siblings stayed for a few nights. The house is very clean and the bedrooms were fresh. Kenneth was very helpful and always responded within the hour with any questions we had. Highly recommended.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed in this home for 4 nights to attend my daughter’s wedding in Quincy. The house was clean, comfortable and close to everything.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were very pleased with the Airbnb. The photos and description of the house were accurate, and the location was fantastic. We spent so much time walking around the area in awe of the beautiful homes and friendly people. We will be back for a visit, and we would love to come back to this location. Kenneth was kind and easy to reach when we had a question. We highly recommend this location!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home is beautiful! Very comfortable and the kitchen is well appointed with appliances and ample cookware. The coffee bar was so great, our daughter loved the hot cocoa and marshmallows.
The home was very clean, beds were comfy.
The only drawbacks we had were no driveway access and unable to utilize game room in garage due to construction equipment/supplies. Wish we had known in advance and that it wasn’t $453 for one night since not all amenities were available, but that was not a deal breaker for us. And we will gladly return and pay for the comfort, safe neighborhood, and easy location again in a heartbeat."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was perfect for our family stay in Quincy. It has plenty of space and was extremely clean. The little touches make it welcoming and inviting.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was a great house. It was newly renovated and all new appliances. Very clean and well decorated. The house was close to all major restaurants and stores. Very quiet neighborhood.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay at Kenneth's place was wonderful. There were 8 adults in our party and his place accommodated us well. The location is great for getting around Quincy and also for visiting surrounding areas like Ursa and Mendon. If our travels take us back to Quincy in the future we will definitely be staying here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were here as a family for a funeral. We had plenty of room for the 9 of us. The firepit was wonderful! We loved sitting around the fire and exchanging stories. The kids enjoyed playing basketball, along with the Foosball and Ping-pong. They also enjoyed playing the games supplied upstairs on 3rd floor.
The coffee bar was excellent! So much to choose from.
Home was very clean and comfortable.
Definately would rent again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I don’t have anything to base the price on because I didn’t price this out. I can say Kenneth did respond quickly when I reached out to him. The Airbnb has easy access, low checkout maintenance, just clean up after yourself and make good choices basically. I will say if you are looking for something for a group of adult couples this may not be the Airbnb for you because it only has two rooms with a queen and king bed, that is stated. It does sleep 5 more people in two other rooms. This home has been beautifully decorated and has a front porch you won’t want to leave. They have a basketball hoop, basketball, fuze ball table all in the garage area, which was nice. This is definitely a great place for a family, or two families to stay. If you are just a group of friends looking for a place to stay this would be wonderful as well. This home is very inviting and the neighborhood is so quiet."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,I would highly recommend staying here. It was absolutely beautiful and Kenneth anticipated our needs well with a fully stocked kitchen. My family loved the coffee bar in particular. The younger people loved the third floor space--I think little kids would absolutely love it. But our older guests enjoyed the second floor and were happy to skip the extra stairs. The neighborhood was absolutely gorgeous and there were lots of restaurants and stores nearby. We felt very safe and taken care of.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superb place. Superb host. This lovely home is situated in a great neighborhood. Recently remodeled, the main floor is a lovely with a really nice kitchen. The coffee bar is a nice touch and perfect. Comfortable beds, remodeled bathrooms and more. We did not use all the facilities like the washer dryer, games in the garage or bbq but they all looked great. Finally a responsive host who made our stay perfect. 10 out of 10. Recommended."

The property offers plenty of space. Our family felt very safe and comfortable in this home for the entire stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place felt comfortable, clean, and well updated. There was nothing we went without - from ironing board to paper plates.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The property is decorated wonderfully, the cute design details and the preservation of the historic charm of the property are top notch! A lot of thought went into this
home, a wonderful coffee bar, an outdoor space to play Foosball and ping pong made our little vacation even more special. This is a quality historic property on a beautiful tree lined quiet street perfect for an evening stroll. If you are in the area, Kenneth is a great host, you can't go wrong staying with him in the ""Q""!"
