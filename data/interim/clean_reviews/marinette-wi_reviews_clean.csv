I grew up near Henes Park, so it's always nice to see what is changing, or not changing in the old neighborhood. My wife always likes to visit Quilter's Haven.

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mitzi has a largely great place. Lots of nice homie touches, high quality furnishing, very clean, great value. I'm not sure if this was just a simple mistake, but in the spirit of the self-referee system of air bnb, I do feel I should mention that we were unable to shower while we were there (water came out of the spot where you control the water temp rather than the showerhead). Our stay was short, so we didn't have a chance for the host to resolve this while we were there, but it felt like a bit of a substantial oversight to us and we have not received any explanation or communication from the host since mentioning this yesterday morning during check out (~24 hrs ago)."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mitzi has a wonderful, cozy spot for the get away you need. Clean, home away from home style. She’s very kind and welcoming. Will definitely book again!"

2020-10-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"Most of the stay was pleasant and the place is well-stocked. Lovely marina and lots of places that deliver around the area. The host was aggressive and accosting over a miscommunication pertaining to house rules. She started accusing me of things that never happened and spoke in a childish, uncontrolled tone. Some issues pertaining to Covid safety as well (people come around the house to work without wearing masks, host wanted to come into the house despite me living with an immunocompromised person predicating that visit not on Covid testing and isolation, but on us being ""well""--God forbid we were asymptomatic). Be prepared to be surrounded by paranoid people who scream and throw a fit rather than settling issues in a calm and collected way."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mitzi’s place was clean and comfortable. She was a thoughtful, communicative host and we had a smooth check in, stay, and check out. We enjoyed our weekend at Mitzi’s!"

There was even a local guide on the table when we walked in and it led us to wine tasting. There were extra pillows and blankets for our stay, utensils and all for us to comfortably make breakfast - and everything was super clean! We will definitely be back again soon for some peace and quiet. One of the most relaxing stays I’ve had."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mitzi's place is clean, quiet, and comfortable.

The bed is super plush, which was great for our travel weariness. I highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a getaway in the South Central UP."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful three days my husband and I had staying in Mitzi’s super apartment in Menominee.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we found ourselves traveling once again to Menominee, we didn’t consider staying anywhere else since we had such a good experience the previous month. It’s clean, comfortable, and close to everything we needed during our trip."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cute, comfortable and clean apartment, close (but not too close) to some good restaurants (including a classic ""evening only"" supper club) and some boutique shopping places. We stayed in winter and found the electric baseboard heat to be more than adequate and quickly adjustable. Though we didn't meet Mitzi, we communicated easily through Airbnb. We'll stay again!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mitzi’s place is home away from home. The apartment is so cozy and warm. It was perfect!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little cottage right on the river! We felt very comfortable staying here. Originally booked our trip hoping to do some ice fishing, but the river didn't cooperate. We ended up hiking 2 nearby waterfalls - beautiful area of Wisconsin! Tricia was very helpful and friendly and even stopped by in person to make sure we were settling in okay. Will definitely reconsider booking here in the summer months to take advantage of the beautiful river."

We grew up in Marinette but never experienced the Menominee River, we were pleasantly surprised.
It was definitely worth the stay.
They are great hosts."

Can’t wait to be back next year! :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn't have imagined a more beautiful place to spend an extended weekend to get away from the city! The pictures don't really do the beauty of this place justice. My partner and I and our dog spent four days in early September and cooked up a storm in the well-equipped kitchen, kayaked and paddle-boated the river a few times, watched scary movies inside, and just generally enjoyed the cozy, comfortable, and peaceful cottage and its surroundings. While we were there, we checked out the Peshtigo Fire Museum (love a good museum!), Forgotten Fire Winery (tasty wine and friendly people!), and Zinger Coffee (fantastic coffee and house-baked scones). Tricia was a wonderful host, keeping the place spotless and comfortable and checking on us moments after we arrived. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, beautiful place to write, reflect, rest, or just spend some time away from life."

The location was perfect, right on the river but still close to everything. I look forward to staying here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I had such and amazing stay! The cabin was extremely clean and welcoming. We really enjoyed kayaking down the river and couldn’t be more grateful that Tricia had kayaks readily available at the site. Coming from Chicago it was so nice to get away and sit by the fire pit multiple nights and enjoy the peace and quiet. Also the location is dog friendly!!! My wife and I had a great 5yr anniversary!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was absolutely beautiful and immaculately clean! Tricia was an awesome host and was checking in daily to see if we needed anything and making sure we were enjoying our stay. I would highly recommend staying here.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was PERFECT! So clean, yet cozy in such a serene location. Close to town and a short drive to great hiking trails, waterfalls, the lake, and other outdoor activities. The kayaks and paddle boards are an added bonus to take advantage of the river. Can’t wait to return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was looking for a place where we could wake up to a view of nature and access to a body of water for a few days and we found exactly that in Evergreen cottage. Lovely little cottage next to the Menominee river. Very clean and cute home. Comfortable beds. Grill which we used every night. Our favorite features were the all day access to the kayaks, paddle boards, and pedal boat. Our pre-teen and teenage kids loved the paddle boards. Also, the fire pit was great. The owners are so friendly. If you are looking for a camp like experience, but with the comforts of home, this is an excellent choice."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay here was wonderful! The cottage was beautiful and the amenities were great. We rented the boat and had a great time out on the river! We highly recommend staying here :)
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful getaway. Exactly what I wanted/needed for a birthday retreat. The property is stunning, and the hosts were kind, informative and respond to your questions very quickly. Our dogs were very comfortable. There's Rivers Edge supper club walking distance from you. Try the Friday perch dinner! It was so much fun playing with all the water toys and fishing off the dock. Between the property, the view, and the hosts, we couldn't have asked for a better stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect space for our family and dogs. The cottage was the perfect size for us and so clean and cute. The views were absolutely incredible, and Tricia was so kind and helpful. I can’t express how wonderful it was to be able to bring our dogs. It was actually our older dog’s last trip with us (he passed away the day after we got home). We’ll always cherish the time we spent here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay here. The view was beautiful!! The cottage was very clean and functional. Being a few feet from the water was very convenient for fishing. The list goes on! Exactly as described and more! Thank you for having us!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Evergreen was amazing to stay in! My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect! Tricia even stopped by with a gift and some coupons for the winery! I will always recommend staying with Tricia!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I and our two small children loved our stay while we were in town to visit family. The beds were so comfortable, the place was clean, peaceful surroundings, and had everything we needed. We will definitely return!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. Tricia was great to work with and communicated well. The views are amazing and we can’t wait to go back sometime. The place was very clean and comfortable. She was very accommodating as the coffee maker wasn’t working correctly so she replaced it in a timely manner. All of the instructions that were given for check in, check out, directions, etc. were easy to understand."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tricia was very detailed in her directions, and we appreciated the additional information she included about the area. The cabin is right on the water, but even in the winter, it’s a beautiful location to escape to (and watch the snowfall). It’s located on a busier highway, but the riverfront and inside are still cozy and nice. The supper club that is a short walk away has really great food and drinks! Would stay again when we visit!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for a winter weekend with my family and it was cozy, clean and comfortable. It’s clear the host, Tricia, but a lot of thought into the esthetic of the rental and the place was exactly as described."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really appreciated the communication Tricia provided and the beauty of the river. Watching the stars at night was wonderful.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Tricia’s airbnb during November for a weekend stay. We wanted to do some winter hiking and enjoy the outdoors with our dog. It’s hard finding places who are trusting of dogs, so this was a huge win for us! 4 adults were able to stay comfortably. The place was beautiful, cozy and everything the listing said. We would love to come back in the summer to be able to use the fire pit and water activities. Before we arrived, Tricia stayed in touch with recommendations and clear instructions and directions. She checked in throughout the weekend and made sure we had everything we needed. Such a positive experience and very reasonably priced! You won’t regret booking her place! Thank you so much!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy stay. Tricia the host did a great job staying in touch and checking in.

We spent weekends with pleasure"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Winding River cottage was great! Clean space and centrally located to all things Marinette! Excellent access to the river and having our own private area outside with a fire pit was excellent!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place. It is so cute and well done. Very comfortable, easy check in. Immaculately clean and stocked with everything you need. The river is beautiful and there are kayaks, canoes, paddle boards for free and a very nice pontoon boat to rent. Spend the day on the water and go to a sandbar to hang out. Great fishing as well. Enjoyed having fires out by the water at night and the owners even brought us a bottle of wine. Really enjoyed it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very nice cabin with a modern look, with updated appliances. The location was very easy to get to and near the downtown area so if you needed anything you’re 10 minutes away.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend! Super clean, was stocked with everything we could’ve needed, perfect for our daughter and dog. Tricia let us check in early, which was great for our daughter to nap on time. Our dog LOVED running and jumping into the river. We plan on going back!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was there that you needed. Owner is nice and make sure everything is good while your there. Don't follow GPS it won't take you to the right spot
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect place for a private, relaxing weekend with nature. All the cottages are right on the water. There were multiple docks my boyfriend and I fished off of. There was easy access to firewood so we were able to have our own private fire each night. Anything we needed I was able to message Tricia and she’d get back to us right away! It was a great stay and I’d definitely go back again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect little spot to rest after a day of hiking. Just the right size for a little family. Super clean. Close to downtown.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely. Perfect get away. The river was so peaceful. Cottage had everything we needed.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy cottage with relaxing vibe! Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. All the necessities were there along with perfect directions for getting around. The view was gorgeous and so was the place. We enjoyed most of our time outside on the porch just talking as well as taking out the canoe to go fishing. Tricia and her husband were so welcoming upon arrival along with a little gift they had given us on our last night there. There communication was also impeccable and continued checking in on us during our stay. We continued to praise this Airbnb in saying that we definitely want to come back. 10/10 would recommend!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Evergreen cottage was wonderful and we enjoyed our 5 day stay. The cabin is beautifully maintained and decorated. She really takes pride in her property! Having access to the canoe, kayaks and paddle boards was great deal of fun and our daughter used the paddle boards a lot! Communication was great and we did not encounter any problems! I searched for a property on the water that would allow dogs and this property fit our needs. Our dogs loved walking the area parks and sitting outside with us. I would highly recommend Tricia’s properties and we plan to return in the future!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to communicate with. Check in was very easy. Chexk out was not complicated with a huge list of ""to do's"". Only had to take trash out, made it worth the cleaning fee. The location was less than desirable being right on a busy main road. Not as secluded & quiet as we would have liked. The water was clear but the lake was very weedy! Nothing we would want to swim in, habingbthe kayak & paddle boards was great!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was really nice and homey. The access to the kayaks and paddle boards was something we took advantage of and enjoyed. We were provided a list of things to do in the area and places to eat which was very helpful. It was a nice place to get away with friends. We hope to go back.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely 5 stars. Tricia went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable and relaxing. The cottage was stocked with everything you need for a weekend getaway! Tricia’s attention to detail was remarkable. The beds were extremely comfy and kayaking around the island nearby was a fun adventure. Nighttime fires on the water were the cherry on top. Our dog even had a great time exploring! Tricia’s recommendations of the Forgotten Fire Winery & La Cabana restaurant added more fun memories to this trip. There is no doubt I will be back and I plan on recommending Winding River Cottages to many family and friends! Do not hesitate to book a trip, you will not be disappointed!!"

We would definitely come here again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! The cottage was clean, warm, and welcoming. We had everything we needed to feel at home and relax. The river setting is beautiful and peaceful. Tricia provided great information about the area and was willing to help if we needed anything."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a true 5-star experience for your visit to Marinette/Menominee River. This cabin is directly on the river and has easy access to food, grocery, etc.
My family and I visited Marinette to fish Walleye on the Menominee river. Our drive to fishing locations was only minutes away and made our experience amazing!
If you are in the area for fishing, summer vacation, travel, etc... I absolutely recommend booking with Tricia! (she is also extremely helpful with all recommendations and makes your stay painless)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay!
We are a family of 4.
Two are 4&5 year olds. They loved their bunk room. Enjoyed all of the different birds, roasting marshmallows over the fire. Beavers swimming in the river! It was the perfect spot for us!
The view was everything we needed to step away from our busy Lives from Florida.
The location is perfect!
Beds are Super comfortable and cottage is simplified and minimalist yet has everything you actually need. Super adorable decor!
The cleanliness was important to me & it met all my standards!!
Truly, Everything was amazing!
Tricia is super on top of everything including communication. This will be our home away from home for now on when we visit our northern family! Thank you for such a beautiful place to stay!
💛Seger family."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent NYE weekend at Tricia's place. The cabin is cozy, warm, and very clean. The wifi worked perfectly and there were many streaming services to choose from. The kitchen was also well stocked with all the cooking equipment we needed. Our only critique is that the cabin is located close to the side of the road, so there's considerable traffic noise at times. Other than that, I would highly recommend this cabin."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was so cute, clean, very well maintained. Well stocked with high end appliances. The view of the river was great. We went in winter so we didn’t get the sitting out on the back porch experience by the water but I hope to return to get that experience. Tricia was very informative and replied back right away. Great experience"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place! I was visiting family in Stephenson this Christmas and Tricia’s is the perfect place for a cozy winter getaway!

Tricia is a fantastic host and provided so much wonderful information about area attractions, and is incredibly responsive to any questions at all. Very happy with my experience!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! The unit was extremely clean & well equipped. The beds were very comfy and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals. The views of the river from the bedroom and living room were beautiful with the recent snowfall. Tricia was also a great host & made sure we were comfortable despite a small power outage due to the snowstorm.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place to stay and the host was very accommodating; we are definitely staying again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at this property over the Thanksgiving weekend (2021) Tricia was our host and she provided very clear instructions when we needed them. Great communicator. Property was as-advertised and was a quiet respite from the bustle and hustle of Game-Day in Green Bay. I highly recommend this property and I hope to return there when the warmer weather returns.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tricia is a very attentive host and the cottage is well appointed. I appreciated her clear and timely communication, and her care is evident in the details and design of the cottage as well. The kitchen was fully stocked and clean, the beds were super comfortable, and we had everything we needed for a relaxing weekend retreat."

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tricia’s cottage is very cozy and we were pleasantly surprised with everything that it is stocked with; everything you’ll need is in the house. It is very clean and connecting to the wifi was easy. Walmart, Aldi and other stores/restaurants are pretty close by. The fire pit to the side was a big plus, especially since the bonfire accessories were easily accessible on the side of the house. This was a great relaxing weekend away and we would recommend this place!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a dream getaway. The cottage is so clean and cozy. It is right on the water, with spectacular views. The bed made me feel like I was sleeping on a cloud, it was so very comfortable! We walked to the nearby Supper Club for drinks and dinner on the first night, which was so convenient. Anything you needed was within a very short drive. Tricia was so accommodating and great with directions and communication. We look forward to staying again and recommend to everyone."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect shoreline retreat.. with kayaks, a dock, a nice firepit with adirondack chairs around... watching birds diving in the Menominee and the white pines on the far shoreline. The cottage was immaculate, the kitchen well equipped, and the bed just right. Thanks, Tricia."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The view of the river was beautiful and everything was very clean! We did a lot of hiking on trails that we fairly close by; easy to get to and beautiful waterfalls! I would highly recommend!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would absolutely recommend a stay here at Evergreen cottage. My son, Husband and I stayed for two nights and I wish we could have stayed longer. Tricia was extremely helpful at answering our questions and giving us suggestions on options for recreation in the area, our favorite was the waterfall hikes. The cottage is right on the water, the view from the bedroom is stunning. The cottage is fully stocked, well organized, and very clean."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked this stay for a quick anniversary stay. Dog friendly! Loved being about to bring our pups. Beautiful scenery and campfire set up. Cabin was immaculate.
Great location with quick access to town."

The hosts were super kind and accommodating and would leave a message mid trip to make sure you had everything you needed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tricias place is very nice and clean with everything you need for a getaway. the view is just beautiful!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and relaxing! Check in and out was very easy and the pictures are spot on. Great view of the water and the fire pit outside was perfect for relaxing and watching the water. We usually stay at dog friendly places and this is one of the best we have found and no crazy high pet fee! Tricia was great with communication and when we arrived she loved on pups and made them feel welcome too. It’s incredibly close to Marinette and Menominee so we could explore both and find great food and coffee, but also feels miles away from everything when you return to relax. We will return as often as we can!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot for me, my husband, and our corgi. Convenient location with beautiful views of the river. Tricia was super welcoming and helpful too."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was perfect for our family of 4 and was located not only right on the River front but near dining, gym and shops. Tricia was the perfect host. Her cottage had everything you needed and more. We would definitely visit again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful is the best word to describe our time at the lake cottage! The cottage was clean, so beautifully furnished with everything we could need and no detail spared on the supplies provided, the furniture quality and even the features throughout such as dimming lights in bedrooms, motion detectors in front and back, reading lights behind bed, very comfortable and spacious beds and so much more. Outside the cottage was just as wonderful! The scenery, the so beautiful! The calm river to kayak, canoe and paddle boat on, plus the ease of using the items, it was all just so fun and my daughter and I had a great end of summer trip. So thankful to have found the cottages and to have met the hosts too!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Tricia’s cottage. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway out of the city for my husband’s birthday. It was also our first time traveling with our dog and she loved it too! The cottage was clean and had everything you could need. Also, the bed was so comfortable! We enjoyed the gorgeous views and having fires at night. Tricia was responsive when we communicated and checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable and asked if we needed anything. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and it exceeded our expectations. Tricia and Tom were wonderful host and easy to get ahold of if needed! There are endless adventures around the area which was a big bonus. Thanks for a great time!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views from a cozy setting! We loved staying here with our two kids, the cabin had everything we needed and more and the views were amazing from almost every window. This was a perfect base for us while we toured waterfalls and provided a very comfortable and fun place to come back to at the end of the day. The kids loved the paddle boat especially. The cabin is sort of close to the road but the fence made it much more private and quiet than you would expect. The hosts were very helpful with whatever we needed, we loved our stay! Thank you Tricia!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent four nights and had a wonderful time! The host, Tricia, was fantastic! Great communication, easy check-in, very responsive, and she made sure everything was as expected. The cottage was just like the pictures. It was clean and new. We used kayaks and the pedal boat. There were two docks you could fish from. We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and having fires in the fire pit. We also enjoyed Tricia's recommendations - visited several waterfalls and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, ate at local restaurants - La Cabana was by far our favorite. We highly recommend staying here."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pleasant stay with plenty to do. The cabin was clean, fully stocked and the owner was nice and welcoming. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting northern Wisconsin."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much for a relaxing and fun stay! This was our first family trip and we enjoyed the coziness and beauty of winding river cottages. We loved the fire pit and the views. We didn’t get to use the kayaks much because of our baby but hope to do it next time. The cottage was close to some kid friendly activities and beaches. Tricia was really helpful when it came to finding things to do around the area and always responded quickly. We will definitely be back again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in the cottage! It was clean, comfortable, and cute. We felt that it was thoughtfully designed and stocked, and it was great to have a full kitchen available if we needed it. There are plenty of stores nearby for groceries, etc. There is some traffic noise as it is right off the road, but it wasn’t too bad. The easy access to the river was wonderful, and it was so nice to be able to use the kayaks and pedal boat. When we were there, the river was not busy at all so we were very comfortable with our kids doing water activities without having to worry about them being in the way of boats or jet skis; they were able to have more independence and be safe. The water is shallow for a good bit around the docks and there are lots of water plants, which isn’t particularly great for swimming (although that didn’t stop our kids), but it was great for floating around in inner tubes and other water activities. Our family highly recommends Winding River Cottages, and we hope to vacation here in the future."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay and we were just as impressed as the first time! You could not ask for a better location and the place is stocked with everything you need both inside and out! We especially enjoyed kayaking the river and bon fires at night with a chorus of frogs.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The cottage is adorable and had everything we needed to prepare meals. Being on the water made this place feel so special. We had beautiful views of the sunrise and sunset. The inside is decorated nicely and is very clean. We will recommend this place to others for sure.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Do yourself a favor and book now!! This cottage is beyond adorable- every detail is perfect. The bunk beds are so fun for littles, the fire pit is such a delight with the picturesque views overlooking the water, and the best part is definitely all of the fun to be had with the water toys. We could have spent all day on the water in the kayaks. Such a lovely time!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! This place is so cute and comfy. The view is amazing and the house is really cute. The fire pit is on the side of the house, which gives good privacy in the evening. We were able to use the kayaks during our stay a few times to explore the river, which was so fun. We even took the pontoon out, which was awesome. The river is pretty quiet and not overly crowded even on the weekends. The host supplies pretty much all you need during your stay. The dogs were comfortable here, although there isn't much room for them to run outside. We did find a park that we took them to for their walks which was about 10 minutes away on Lake Michigan. The bed was probably one of the comfiest I have slept in during a trip. Tricia is very responsive to all questions we had during our trip and reached out to us when we were there to make sure we were comfortable. We loved this place and can't wait to stay again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great cottage with an excellent location. Water access could not be better, and the kayaks made available to use make seeing the river all the more exciting. We saw lots of wildlife on the river, and enjoyed the sunrises and sunsets. Tricia is a great host who was extremely helpful during our stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The previous reviews have said it all- great location, lovely little cottage, excellent shared resources (eg kayaks), hostess informed, etc. The spot was amazing for me and my dog to chill out for a week.
Highly, highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I stayed here for a couples trip and had a great time. The area has plenty to do, but we had some of the most fun just at the cottage! The view is stunning (catch a sunrise over the river if you can) and the property is super cute and well-cared for. We really appreciated having access to the canoe and kayaks - we spent a few hours outside enjoying the scenery on the river. The kitchen is stocked with everything you’d need to cook or grill with. We also loved having a fire pit for s’mores and relaxing at night. Tricia is so welcoming and attentive, she even helped us get in the boats (we would have struggled without her at first, haha!). She gives great suggestions for things to do in the area, so you won’t be wondering what to do. It’s a border town, so you can go to and from Michigan in a matter of 10 minutes or less. Menominee had a great sunset view and a lot of restaurants. In Marinette, we went to the Forgotten Fire winery - a must-go! There were also plenty of stores near by. The cottage itself was modern, clean, had a smart thermostat, good wifi, as well as plenty of necessities/extras in the kitchen and bathroom. I can’t recommend this enough if you’re looking for a stay in NE Wisconsin! We hope to go back for another fun weekend in the future."

The cabin is absolutely adorable. You can tell there was a lot of thought and love put into the decor & amenities.
The kitchen is stocked with everything you could need for cooking. Beds are comfy, and the whole place was so clean. Like other reviews say, there’s more room than the pictures make it seem.
The views are beautiful and there is a lot close enough to be convenient but still feel like you are ‘away.’ (Restaurants, stores, things to do)
Host was great and quick to respond!
We will definitely be back ☺️"

Will absolutely book again!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice. They have obviously put some money into updating it. The Wifi was out most of one day. I messaged Tricia & she was able to have it re-booted in a timely manner.

From the amount of privacy to the attention to detail in regards to the cabins amenities, this airbnb had it all! The river on your doorstep was incredible to wake up to. My dog was able to explore and experience the same freedom we had. The kayaks were an added bonus! 10/10 definitely booking again in the future."

The outdoor kitchen is a lovely overlook of the river, with a big propane patio grill, a camp stove, and a fire pit. Comprehensive cooking options!
Cathy was accommodating and prepared everything well for us. It's great to have the drinking water ready to go and the outdoor shower, plus the solar charger. We loved borrowing the kayaks, and our dog loved zooming around the open mown field around the cabin."

My friend and I had a lovely time making campfires, going for nature walks, making dinner on the grill, resting in hammocks, and exploring the area. Cathy made sure we had detailed maps. She answered all our questions. She made sure we had a splendid time. If you're looking for a private, relaxing, and peaceful time, this site is perfect. I already can't wait to go back :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This wonderful, private spot in the woods was like a dream come true. We had the best time swimming, fishing, and cooking on the grill. We had a nice little campfire and lovely view of the stars. The cabin has three twin beds and an air mattress so can accommodate several people. It is equipped with solar power for the ceiling fan and lights. It was quiet, comfortable, and in a very nice location. The driveway was a little tricky but we made it in just fine. Would highly recommend this place and would come back!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable tiny house. Wish there would have been a full sized main bed but it was cozy. Made some great meals on the available gas grill. As much as I like cooking on a campfire gas grills are a lot easier.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place to stay for a few nights! Tarina has the house so nicely decorated and the kitchen had everything I needed for making quick meals.

Beautiful home in a small town, peaceful surroundings."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice secluded place to relax. Very clean and the amenities were very helpful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our second year staying here, amazing place to host a group of guys. Will be staying every year for years to come!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was great, decent price, very clean and new appliances. Everything you need to cook is there pots, pans, cutting boards, cutlery etc. Elizabeth is very responsive and worked with my schedule. Back deck and yard were beautiful in the fall. Beds were extremely comfortable!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a beautiful secluded place. We really enjoyed the quiet and the seclusion. The house is gorgeous with large windows and lots of space. I recommend this place to anyone!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful! The house, the deck, and the surrounding forest were wonderful. It was peaceful and quiet. It was nice that there was a separate bedroom on the first floor (for my mother-in-law in her 70s). The Wi-Fi was great for my laptop usage."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house we enjoyed our stay and would rent again if back in the areas!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the most beautiful place of the 3 we have rented over the last 2 years. Elizabeth was a joy to work with and super fast in responding to us. We had a very minor issue that she handled and resolved quickly and completely.
The home is absolutely beautiful and so quiet it almost seemed too much so. Honestly, I wish I had had another couple of days to stay there. It was obvious that she had given lots of attention to detail and decor of the house.
We have already recommended it to family members and hope to stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect get away home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed staying here for 4 nights.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and great place to stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is lovely! There was enough space for everyone to spread out and do their own thing. Everything was easy to find too.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The space was gorgeous and a lovely spot to stay, however it was not as described in regards to being “water front” with a “river view” which I feel is misleading. We came for the easy access to water for fishing and swimming for the kids, but instead we had to waltz through forest and fields to gain access, so we had to find another spot to do what this place originally offered.
Otherwise a clean and responsive host, but know that gaining access to the river is not a walk in the park."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful and very clean. Pretty yard but was described as water front and river view. It had neither. We booked it upon those descriptions. Were quite disappointed about that.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from the large living room windows was lovely. We enjoyed the surrounding forest and even got the chance to see some wildlife. Perfect place to stay for my partners first time in the north. We would highly recommend, thank you so much for having us!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for the Cabelas national championship fishing tournament. Felt right at home, nice quiet area and no worries. The house was beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay! Very clean and had everything you could want. Hope to come back some day! Really appreciated that she let us check in early as we had a 13 hour drive and arrived at 3am with no issues or complaints"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place and overall great experience! Would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect location!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice place on a dead end road. It’s a quick 10 minute drive to the city of marinette. The house is very clean and cozy. The host was very responsive with any questions we had. Definitely recommend this place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay, quiet and peaceful."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House as described will stay again when we are in town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Usually when we travel, we are ready to go home at the end of a week, but not this time staying here felt like home and we had so much fun we did not want to leave. The place was spacious and Eriz was very responsive, Guy the caretaker is also awesome. We had a few questions and he helped us out every time we asked him. The place was so clean when we arrived, it was like home. Already booked again for next year."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Aside from the furnace being super loud & master bedroom being cold (space heater was provided, but it was loud), it's a beautiful home. Looks just like the photos provided. Sadly we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor space since it was snowing & raining during our stay, but Monopoly kept us busy. Would recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best place that you can find yourself if you are ever in the Marinette/Peshtigo area. You will not want to miss this.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,So perfect for our Mama’s Night Away!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay with good communication. Thanks!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place last minute due to a family member passing away. Erez was so flexible and responsive when we inquired about his place overnight as we made our way to Michigan. The home is exactly as pictured. It was very clean, updated, and comfortable. It was just what we needed to get a good nights rest!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home with lots of space. Very easy to find due to large ranch sign. Erez was kind enough to let us check in early which allowed my family and I to freshen up before attending a family funeral. Will stay here again next time we visit family.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the Peshtigo Ranch. Erez was an excellent host. He was quick to respond when we had a question. The ranch was a perfect home base for our holiday visit with family. We will definitely stay here again! Hopefully in the summer when we can take advantage of the yard and fire pit.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very, very nice accommodation. The house has been done up very well. There is lots of space in case you’d like to have a gathering there, and the kitchen is big enough to cater a gathering. The beds are all comfortable, as is the recliner in the sectional in the living room. There were plenty of supplies available in the bathrooms, kitchen and laundry.
The ranch is out far enough that it is very quiet, but not so far that’s it’s a journey to get anywhere close by (Peshtigo, Marinette, etc.). Communication with the owner is very good; responsive and prompt.
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.
Oh, and our granddog liked it too! 😊"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I needed a place to stay with my dog for the weekend. This house was ideal with a big yard for the pup to run around in.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay in Peshtigo visiting family. Had a slight inconvenience when checking in but Erez more than made up for it. Property is exactly as described and we had such beautiful views (deer sightings every morning)! The host was great and so responsive and helpful. We will definitely stay here again in our next trip up. Thank you again Erez for being such a wonderful host and sharing your great property! Can’t wait to come back.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Erez was such a wonderful host! He responded to everything and always did a check up to make sure things were going smoothly. The house was absolutely gorgeous along with all the beautiful fall colors!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place to stay at.
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,you do have to clean up as in do dishes take trash out and put bedding in laundry even though there’s a hefty cleaning fee. But other than that it was a great stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very large space with bedrooms on the ends which was nice since we had a baby with us (my mother did not hear him cry in the night being on the other side of the house). Spacious kitchen and dining room perfect for any size to eat very comfortably.
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Property appeared just as presented through the app. Had great weather, and location was prime.
An unfortunate thing to mention is the overwhelming smell of cat urine and/or litter box smell found through the residence. Contacted Erez right away and he asked what could be done and was attentive. Unfortunately there wasn’t much they could do at that hour when we checked in. We masked the smell with cooking dinner.
It should be noted that Erez states no cats live or have been on the property although all 4 visitors displayed allergy symptoms with the house closed up.
Price was a little steep seeing that the home needs some improvements and the cat urine smell.
Still a beautiful property and would give a second chance if issue was corrected."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"beautiful spot, wonderful house"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for what we needed to do. It was peaceful and pretty. Our only real complaint was that it didn't feel freshly cleaned and the one bed wasn't made.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, and comfortable. The kitchen is beautiful. We all thought the living room would be perfect for a Christmas tree. Although we didn’t have time to enjoy it during our stay, the outside area looks very nice and relaxing. I would highly recommend this place."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful location in the woods. Place was clean and comfortable. The sectional in the living room is very comfy, and the patio furniture is nice. One thing to be aware of is the showers are both in bath tubs, so they may be difficult for some to step into."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time in Peshtigo. The property was beautiful and well-maintained. The only issue we had was that water filter alarm was beeping occasionally because it probably needed to be changed. The owner was responsive to this and had someone come out to check it quickly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Ranch was exactly what my family needed. My husband and daughter enjoyed fishing, had a great day out on a boat catching walleye. I needed a little bit of time to get some work done and then caught up on some reading. I loved sitting on the patio, having a glass of wine and talking with my family."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and as listed. Garage helped a ton with having a boat. Plenty of space in the house and property. Only complaint are the mosquitoes bad inside and outside the house.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and away from people which I really enjoyed. big garage for my car which is a plus. only complaint is the mosquitos at night but I'm aware that it's not necessarily a controllable thing all the time so take that info as you will. All in All really enjoyed my stay.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Neat and a pleasant stay. Had a great time.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Airbnb is on a former horse farm. It is a very pretty property with the former stables still on the property. A couple acres of land. The house itself I believe is a double wide manufactured home. There is a dining room and kitchen. Note the coffee maker was in one of the kitchen cabinets. There is not a Keurig. There is a dishwasher. There is a full sized washer and dryer. Two bedrooms. Two baths, one of which is a large master bathroom. A large living room, though part of it is just empty space. There is what looked like an old wood fireplace in the living room. The master had a tv. The floor vents are kind of in odd places. The bed in the master was a California King. Very comfortable."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ranch was very private and comfortable.
It sits off from the road a bit. There are neighbors but you can’t see them, which was great. Just the way we like it.
Communication was top notch.
The property was well groomed. The beds were very comfortable.
I wouldn’t think twice about booking again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Nice kitchen, deck, privacy, and plenty of room for boats or whatever your toy of choice is. The home was very clean and well equipped. Erez does a good job of communicating and managing the process. We will be back."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We traveled with our young children on our way to visit family & stayed here for the night. The bunk room was perfect for our 3 kiddos (6 years old & younger). I appreciated all the room outside AND inside for our kids to run around after being in the car most of the day. I appreciated that the house was also very clean. Recommend if you need a rental in the area! Location is in the country and private.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Great location!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect getaway
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is great for a weekend getaway. There’s several local places in driving distance for dining and a great local winery in town that we loved (Forgotten Fire). The house itself was clean and just what we expected. The outside seating and fire pit was perfect for evenings outside. There was a pretty bad storm which caused the power to go out but the host was very quick to reply and help in any way he could. I highly recommend this location and property if you’re looking for a relaxing weekend.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,If you are looking for a place that has not only room inside but plenty outside for your next outdoor adventure this is the place.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great winter escape to the North! Spacious home with an impressive lot for the kiddos to unplug and run around outside. Fresh snow created an impressive ""exploration"" for all in our crew. Garage provided ample space to store our vehicle inside! After the 2 nights of snow the driveway and front steps (as well as the back deck) were quickly cleared and salted. Kitchen provided necessary items to cook a few meals. Everything was clean and uncluttered. We were arriving early due to projected weather and were accommodated very quickly! It was greatly appreciated ! Would stay again when traveling north."

We had no apps and had a hard time figuring out how to watch any tv. The basement steps are steep and scary. I was in contact with Marian and her manager Amy who were both perceptive, about the steps. I recommend you keep that door closed. Get some automatic lighting for the stairway. Caution sign? Railing on the right to the top of the steps? We would have liked to have made the table smaller as well but couldn’t figure it out. Otherwise the place was lovely. Very nice and close to lake. Just wish more to do for entertainment in the area"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great stay over the holidays. Within walking distance of several restaurants. Older, but well maintained house.

There wasn’t but she made sure to have them on the property before we arrived.

,,,"Horrible experience w/ double booking, do NOT book, and do NOT trust Erez’s “Superhost” status
**Tl;dr: There was already ANOTHER GUEST in it when we checked in. We couldn’t reach the host at all, and had to find alternative lodging around midnight.
When we arrived, the passcode did not open the door. As we were fumbling with the lock, a tall man showed up at the door, and asked us what was our problem. Feeling threatened and confused (“what was he doing in our house?”), we backed off and called and texted the host. The host read our message but did not respond.
After failing to reach the host for an hour in 35F temperature, we drove to a hotel at 1am. The hotel fortunately had a room left.
The host got back to us around noon the next day. In a short note, he stated that the listing was double booked. How could that be allowed to happen? And Erez is a superhost?"
