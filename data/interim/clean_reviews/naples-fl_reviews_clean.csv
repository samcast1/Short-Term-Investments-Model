2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Little Gem is the perfect place in old Naples to stay, it is exceptionally clean, well maintained with no expense spared. Patti & Bruce are perfect hosts who have thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable & stress free as possible. Patti met us on check in to give us a quick tour and we met Bruce also, as he came to tend the lovely garden area. Patti messaged us the next day to make sure we were ok. So nice to know they were at hand if we had any questions.
The bed & bedlinen were amazing, we slept so well and the beautiful little patio overlooking the lake is just perfect.
Thank you Patti & Bruce for letting us stay in your lovely home. We will hopefully be back soon."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at the Little Gem! It truly is named accurately. We spent time biking around town, to Starbucks for coffee in the mornings and to the beach. It was very quiet- except for some smaller jets that flew over but we loved it! The room was well maintained, super clean and Patti met us on checkin for a quick intro to where everything was. One of our goals was to look at condos and we found one, otherwise we would come back there without hesitation. That porch area was the best morning and evening sitting area. We eve had a bird come and visit us every day. Just a fantastic time and no worries. There was everything we needed and more. Patti didn’t forget anything- even sunscreen! I would recommend any couple looking to relax, explore or just needing a change of pace to stay at The Little Gem! It truly is!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Another excellent vacation for my husband and I staying at the Little Gem! The area is extremely walkable and really close to restaurants, shopping and the beach. Bruce and Patti are really welcoming, always checking in to make sure everything is perfect, which we really appreciated! The condo itself has been beautifully renovated and is the perfect size for two people, has excellent internet and easy parking. This is our second trip staying at the Little Gem and we will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved the apartment and it could not have been more convenient to all the shops, restaurants, beach, and harbor. But for a broken beach umbrella that Patti quickly replaced, our stay was perfect. We will definitely look up the Little Gem on our next trip down to Naples!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"So many great things about this ""Little Gem""--wonderful hosts, short walk to the beach (10m), short stroll to 5th Ave S (5m), short walk to 3rd St S (10m), short drive to so many interesting places (10-30m), decent distance (40m drive) to Fenway South (spring training stadium for the Red Sox), well-stocked with everything we need, very clean, pleasantly decorated, nice patio with frequent bird visits, etc. We also love the shower; it has both a shower head and and a hand-held; the water pressure was strong which we like very much. This is our first stay here. We immediately booked a week for March 2025. Thank you Patty and Bruce for a wonderful stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Where do I begin to describe how great ""Little Gem"" is?
Beautifully decorated, cozy, and charming, its location, and wonderful hosts. All boxes checked!
Escaping the New England cold, it was so lovely to enjoy my morning coffee on the patio. We were able to walk to the beach and fabulous 5th Avenue to enjoy top notch restaurants.
Aptly named, we will be back "" Little Gem""!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bruce & Patti are excellent hosts, they really go above & beyond to ensure you have a great stay. The directions were clear, and the condo was spotlessly clean, and it looked exactly like the photos, so what you see is what get. It was very well equipped, so you could cook at home, there was a gas grill outside to use as well. The patio area was an added bonus, and this is what makes the condo stand our from the others in the block, a nice private area with table / chairs & sunbeds, a lovely place to relax. The location is great, 10 mins walk to the Bach, which is beautiful, and 5-10 mins to all restaurants, you really don’t need to drive much if you don’t want to. Bruce & Patti were very responsive, and excellent communicators, I would highly recommend their place"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had such a great time yet again. This was our second stay here and it was as perfect as the first time. Bruce and Patti always make sure that we feel welcome and comfortable. The condo is very clean, well furnished and only a short walk from the beach. We can’t wait to come back and stay here again. Thank you Bruce and Patti for being such great hosts."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Patti and Bruce were great hosts! They were at their condo when we arrived to give us a short tour of their place so we would know where everything was. They were so helpful throughout our stay and very easy to communicate with! Their condo was spotless upon our arrival and had everything we needed! It is close to shops, restaurants and a short walk to the beach! If you are looking for a special place in downtown Naples, this is it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Patti and Bruce’s apartment looks exactly like the photos and had everything we needed. Great location, we walked to the beach (15 min) and 5th ave in 5min. I will definitely book the apartment again when we return to Naples!
Thank you :) see you soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved the accomodation.. comfortable and well equipped. Close to beach and lovely restaurants
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce and Patti's place is by far one the the nicest we have stayed in. It was spotless and well equipped. The location is terrific and the outside space was so nice to sit and enjoy. The bed was very comfortable and having laundry in the unit was a real plus. The decor is serene, beautiful and very homey. Thank you Bruce and Patti for making our stay a great one."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is our second time back and we absolutely love this place. Truly a little “Gem”. Patti and Bruce are great and communicates well with tenants.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Our goal for this trip was to simply get some rest and relaxation. Little Gem was perfect. It is a quiet and peaceful spot that is perfect for two. It is very clean and decorated simply and tastefully. The bedroom was perfect with a firm king bed and soft cool sheets. We both slept extremely well. The kitchen was nice and bright and had all the tools I needed to prepare a few simple meals. The little patio is very inviting and private. We enjoyed our morning coffee while watching the wildlife. With the beach just at the end of the street we had all we needed. We are already thinking about our next visit!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bruce and Patti are amazing hosts. They are so kind and helpful and their place is extremely clean with everything you need readily available. We had so much fun biking to the beach on the bikes they provided, and enjoying the beach with all new and clean items they provided (chairs, cooler, umbrella etc). Our 3rd year in a row visiting and we can’t wait to come back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It's easy to run out of superlatives to describe Little Gem.
The accommodation is perfect - spotlessly clean, beautifully furnished, extremely well-equipped and in the perfect location. Bruce and Patti have put a lot of thought into providing everything you could possibly need to make Little Gem that perfect home-from-home.
The bikes and beach chairs were an extra little touch to make our stay more special. We loved cycling around the neighbourhood and exploring what Naples has to offer.
The accommodation is perfectly located. It's a very short walk to 5th Street Sth, with lots of shops and restaurants, although our preference was 3rd Ave, which again is only a short walk.
Bruce and Patti are the perfect hosts. They have great local knowledge and gave us loads of information on restaurants, cafes and places to visit that we wouldn't have otherwise discovered. They're on hand and very quick to respond to any queries, but they also leave you free to enjoy your vacation.
Perfect❤"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my 3rd trip to Naples and I always stay here. It’s the perfect location and surroundings for a beach trip. Everything is walkable… the beach is a 5 minute walk. Patti and Bruce provide everything you will need beach chairs, umbrellas, towels, cooler.
Multiple top notch restaurants within a few blocks. The patio is wonderful for morning coffee, evening cocktails or a BBQ dinner at home
They also provide 2 bikes which I used several morning for bike rides and to go to local grocery and bay front restaurants
You won’t find a better place in Old Naples!
Patti and Bruce are 5 star hosts in every way
I’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow, what a wonderful stay at Bruce and Patti's Little Gem! Besides all the positives guests before me have mentioned (great location, immaculate, the patio, bikes and beach supplies), let me highlight a few other delights. As someone who lives on a well with wimpy water pressure, the shower here is AMAZING--it literally blasts any last trace of sand off your body! The little desk in the bedroom corner with the lighted mirror creates a lovely vanity for putting on makeup. The neighborhood and building are so quiet and peaceful. And, finally, the AC is very efficient here. We left it off all day while out and were very pleased with how quickly it cooled the place down upon our return. The sleek lighted overhead fans also helped to keep it comfortable. We will definitely return on our next trip to Naples!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful patio really added to the vacation.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We just concluded a beautiful 3 week stay and could not have been happier! The location is fabulous and Little Gem had everything we needed plus a perfect patio that extended the living space. Bruce and Patti were great hosts. We only wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The Little Gem was just perfect. Bruce and Patti met as we arrived and were so helpful from the start. The condo was spotless and included everything we could possibly need. We booked a week for next year after being there for only a couple days. Can't wait to go back! Nice brand new bikes too!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place spotlessly clean great location highly recommended
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We found what we were looking for: rest, be comfortable, close to the beach, enjoy the place and have fun!
A luxury everything!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect Airbnb by the beach for our vacation! The Little Gem was extremely clean, had all of the amenities we needed and was walking distance to the beach, shopping and so many restaurants! The home itself had perfect A/C, a full kitchen, and all of the beach gear we would need! On top of all of this Patti was so fantastic with communicating with us to make sure our stay was perfect 😄 ☀️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had the most amazing time and stayed in the apartment as part of our Honeymoon. The condo was perfect. It was exceptionally clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, the reclining chair was awesome and everything you could possibly wish came with the apartment. We especially enjoyed the bikes. They were great to ride to the beach and through town.
However, by far the best part about our stay was meeting Patti and Bruce and experiencing their kindness and hospitality. Their superhost status is well deserved and even a bit of an understatement as there is not one negative thing we can say about them or the condo. They were so helpful. For example, when we arrived we found a cake waiting for us in the refrigerate that Patti had put there to congratulate us on our marriage. That was such a nice gesture. Thank you so much!
Besides, their knowledge of Naples and all the amenities the city has to offer really helped us find great dining options and fun activities to do during our stay.
We will definitely come back as soon as possible and recommend their unit to everybody we know.
Thank you so much for making our honeymoon so special and unforgettable."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our second time visiting and it was wonderful. The place is cleaned so well it’s spotless, wonderful communication by Patti, and the bikes to use make the trip even better for us. Can’t beat the location and the area is very quiet. We look forward to returning!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying here and it is in a great position close to the beach.
The condo is well equipped, perfectly clean and very comfortable. We had breakfast on the outside patio each morning and looked at the wildlife on the lake, including ducks and ducklings.
Bruce and Patti checked in regularly to see if we had everything we needed and to offer use of a swimming pool. We were sad to leave as it had been a perfect holiday."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful location. 3 blocks from the beach. Close to shopping and restaurants
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is perfect for 2 people. The location could not be better. We were able to walk to 5th Ave, the beach, 3rd St, etc. Bruce and Patti were excellent hosts. The condo was very clean and the kitchen well stocked. We loved the little patio to have our coffee or afternoon cocktail. We will be back for sure!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely place convenient to all the best parts of Naples. You are walking or biking distance to shops, restaurants and the beach. The condo is not huge, but has everything you need and the outdoor patio is great. And Bruce and Patti are great hosts, great communication."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This condo is wonderful! It is very well appointed and has everything you will need during your stay.
The location is perfect. We walked and biked everywhere. Beach, shopping, and tons of restaurants. The bikes are like new and it’s easy to adjust seats.
The patio is large and overlooks a lake. The city is working on the lake so it’s empty right now. A generator pump is running 24 hrs while the lake is being revamped. We only saw workers a couple of days while we were there for a week.
We used our Wi-Fi speaker and played music while on the patio. It was fine.
Patti was fantastic and met me at the condo at check in and walked me through everything.
I highly recommend this condo! I’m going back in June!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A lovely condo in a fabulous location! The private outside patio is special; a wonderful place to start & end your day!
We could walk everywhere; yet the location is residential & quiet.
The condo had everything you need with great A/C, very comfortable bed, and full kitchen.
We hope to come many times again!!!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Bruce and Patti are great hosts. The house has everything you need and has great outdoor space. Beware you may get lazy and just use the outdoor space instead of the beach!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We spent a lovely week at this condo, it is absolutely the perfect place to stay in Naples. It was clean and very well equipped. The location is amazing, just a few streets to the beach and to fantastic dining options. The private patio was my favorite spot with the view and the avocado tree that provided delicious breakfast. Book this place, you won't be disappointed."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,All we had to do was show up everything was prepared when we arrived
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bruce and Patti’s condo is the perfect place to stay while in Naples! Bruce and Patti have literally thought of everything you could possible want while on a beach vacation… 2 bicycles, beach chairs, a cooler, beach umbrella and beach towels! The condo is cozy and one of my favorite touches was that they have soft and fluffy throw blankets while hanging out at home. The home is a short distance to the beach and many restaurants and the patio is a delight. The kitchen is equipped with any cooking utensils you may need and there is also a small grill on the patio. Patti was super easy to communicate with and is a gracious host. Book this property now, you won’t be disappointed!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bruce and Patti’s place is perfect! It was my first time renting an AirBNB and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Their home is very clean, quiet and cute. The location is not far from Naples Main Street if you’re looking for some great food and shopping. Not to mention the beach that is only minutes away. Patti was always available whenever I had a question. I will definitely stay here again in the future and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is planning a trip to Naples."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The reviews for this stay are overwhelmingly positive for a reason!
Key points for your decision making process:
Absolutely spotless location, and amenities are awesome.
Hosts are sweet and caring, and very good with communication and information on the area.
Renting a car is virtually unnecessary unless you need or plan to go somewhere outside biking distance. We took an uber a handful of times while we were there, including to and from the airport.
Local food is great, and plenty of places to try. Hosts provide a list of places that previous guests enjoyed, but we found a couple of our own as well!
The bikes are awesome! There is a basket on one of them and it was used every time we went out.
The beach is a couple blocks away. There is an umbrella, chairs, and beach towels provided. Everything we wanted to take was easily held or transported on our bikes in one trip.
This is the best value location we've ever been to and certainly hope to return some time soon!
Thank you again Bruce and Patti"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Book it immediately!! Location can't be beat. Just a few blocks from the beautiful beach. If you prefer to visit the Pier, just hop on the bikes and you'll be there within a few minutes. It was so nice not to have to worry about driving and parking everywhere.
The unit has everything you could possibly need on your trip and then some. There's even a huge avocado tree that drops more avocados a day than you can possibly eat. I could go on and on but it comes back to how this review started.... Book it immediately!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We found the Little Gem to be exactly as the reviews said it was !
If possible,we would have given 10 stars in every category !
The location is PERFECT !
Bruce & Patti were always available,usually within minutes,via texting,if we had any questions.
The surrounding neighborhood is truly idyllic,like ""Pleasantville""
And though we are both in our 70s,Starbucks on 5th Avenue was but a 10 minute walk ..... and the beach was only a few minutes by bicycle or pleasant walk of only 6 blocks.
What else ? Parking was by our front door ... that has a nice keyless entry.
And the Little Gem was SO quiet that it was like being in Outer Space .... which was conducive to falling asleep on the living room 2-person recliner.
Lastly,there is a BEAUTIFUL private patio outside the living room side door.The landscaping was so lush that the adjacent homes were almost 100% unseen .... and the view is of a quaint little pond where you always here running water.In short your own little Sanctuary where you can relax on a chaise-lounge,of which there are two,plus 6 other chairs and a table.
10 Stars from us in ALL categories !
We apologize in advance for any Type-Ohs above 😊"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect location in Olde Naples! You will find this to be a very comfortable, well equipped “home” away from home. Hosts provide everything you could need and things you realize are really nice to have! Patti’s place is on a great street located within walking distance to a beautiful, peaceful beach and three minutes walk to 5th Avenue dining and shops. Communication was outstanding. We look forward to our next visit and will absolutely stay at this “Gem” again. Highly recommend. Also recommend Bha! Bha! Restaurant on 5th Avenue for Persian cuisine…"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The “Little Gem” of Naples is exactly that and much more. We love to travel and haven’t had a more pleasant experience in an Airbnb anywhere. The setting is lovely, the location is perfect and the condo is attractive and comfortable. It really felt like home! Patti and Bruce personalized the condo with everything you could possibly need and more. And, you cannot beat the spectacular beach only six blocks away!!
We look forward to our next visit!
Thanks so much!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I came to this property for our honeymoon and our expectations were exceeded by far. Patti is the best/kindest host you could ask for, she made our stay so easy. She even provided us a little cake and chocolates for our honeymoon which we loved! Everything we needed for the beach was provided, umbrella, cooler, chairs, everything which was a wonderful surprise. Also having the bikes to ride downtown was our favorite part, which we were not even expecting to use but after trying them out on the first night, we rode around at least for an hour every night just sightseeing. The condo was very clean and well taken care of, even the mattress and pillows were comfortable. Small details that do not go unnoticed by us. If you are looking for the perfect place to stay in Naples for 2 people, you have found your place and your host. Thanks Patti!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Little Gem is truly a Gem! Patti and Bruce are the kindest hosts who truly make their guests feel welcomed and relaxed while staying in the condo. As a gift for our parents 50th Wedding Anniversary, we sent them to Naples for 18 days to sit on the beautiful porch and the beach and soak up the sun. Patti and Bruce met them on the day of arrival to welcome them and give a quick tour of the condo. They suggested things to do and were just friendly and welcoming to my parents. Then on the day of their anniversary Patti brought them a cake to help them celebrate. If I could give more then a 5 star review I would. They were an absolute pleasure to work with from the 1st day we booked the trip. Thank you so much again for truly making this trip so special for my Mom and Dad!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We highly recommend staying in this perfectly located, spotlessly clean, well appointed, condo in the old downtown area of Naples.
The condo was comfortable, bright, perfectly sized, and within walking distance of two areas of shopping, restaurants, bars, cafes, as well as the beach and pier. The private patio area is such an enjoyable extra perk to this location, beautiful and relaxing.
Patti and Bruce couldn’t have been more accommodating, and kind, from greeting us at check in, to making sure we were enjoying our stay. We hope to be staying here often."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOCATION! This was the cutest stay in the best location in old Naples. The bikes make it even better!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely PERFECT!
Patti and Bruce were amazing hosts and easy to communicate with throughout the process. They were very flexible with our check in/check out times and made us feel very comfortable like we were at our own home. In addition to that, they provided great tips about Naples in their booklet. The apartment itself was sparkling clean and had pretty much everything we could have asked for including a great private outside area with grill, bikes and beach essentials. Lastly, location couldn’t be better. Only about 7mins from the beach and a few blocks from the main street. Can’t wait to return to Naples and hopefully this little gem with be available for our next trip!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon here and it was wonderful. Patti greeted us at the Airbnb and even bought us a delicious mini cake as a honeymoon gift. Due to COVID our honeymoon was planned last minute and Patti was so helpful with recommendations and tips on things for us to do. Her communication was consistent and thoughtful. And the location of their Airbnb is incredible, we took full advantage and biked to the beach everyday. Bikes were included as well as beach equipment- chairs, towels, umbrella. You could walk to the beach if you wanted, as well as all the best restaurants in the downtown area. The space was super clean and included everything you could need. I would recommend to anyone looking in Naples! Or southwest Florida really- we took day trips to the Everglades, Marco island, and Miami too!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Bruce and Patti's place. We truly appreciated their attention to detail and cleanliness. This was our first time using AirB&B since the start of Covid and walking into the unit we could tell that the hosts took cleaning very seriously (and provided additional cleaning supplies) The condo is a 5 min bike ride to the beach and you can walk to 5th street. The location is perfect.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect downtown location with a beautifully landscaped patio and all of the amenities you'll need to ride bikes to enjoy the beach. Sparkling clean living spaces and I especially enjoyed all of the natural light inside the condo as well as the modern open kitchen and brightly decorated living room. Lots of great recommendations for exploring the local area easily.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patti and Bruch made us feel right at home, so much so that we extended our stay during our visit. The Little Gem really is just that with thoughtful details, all the comforts of home and hand sanitizer at the front door!

Watching the sunset is a must as well as riding bikes around town (bikes included with the stay!). We to hope to visit again soon."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You absolutely cannot beat the location, the amenities and the service by the hosts! We did not have a car, however, this condo is perfectly located within walking or biking distance of everything we wanted and needed. We spent as much time outside on the patio as we did inside the condo... it's a beautiful and serene spot. The hosts provided beach chairs and an umbrella which made our time at the beach much more enjoyable. Such a lovely experience all the way around... one we will treasure."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a lovely spot, attractive, convenient location, very lovely patio where we ate numerous meals being serenaded by a very energetic mockingbird.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Bruce and Patti are wonderful hosts that go above and beyond efforts to make renters comfortable. Their close proximity to the rental made it convenient to respond if an issue were to arise. The condo was very clean and comfortable. The king size bed was very comfortable. Their is a lovely private brick paved patio. Great for barbequeing or just relaxing in the comfortable chaises. It sits on a small pond with ducks and their
offspring waddling by.
Location, location, location!! Short walk to the beach and a few blocks to Historic old Naples with shopping and fine restaurants. It is without hesitation that I recommend this rental for your next getaway!"

Sam is the perfect host, and he also gave us a gift of wine and strawberries to celebrate us. This was very kind and very appreciated! He was very responsive when we had questions and he responded within minutes. I would recommend his properties to anyone and everyone looking to travel to Naples. 100000/10!"

Nice and neat, well equipped with the main appliances and small equipment that make you feel at home like beach chairs and beach umbrella. We also appreciated being provided with basic cooking stuff (salt, sugar, oil, paper tissue, …) and courtesy items like coffee. Sam was both proactive with arrival instructions and reactive to our questions. He was also flexible to let us in early. A five star stay. Thanks again Sam!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a lovely place, everything was really thought of in terms of amenities.
You felt at home.
The gas grill and fire pit were really great, we also used both, there were even some spices in the kitchen.
For questions for things to do in the area, Sam responded super quickly and gave tips.
We also thought the sun loungers and umbrella were great that they were offered for use.
Since the 1.5-mile walk to 5th Avenue was too long for us to walk, we just called an Uber and were quickly at the restaurant.
I highly recommend it and would spend a few days at Sam's place right away."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sam was a fantastic and generous host. The amenities, fridge, coffee maker, stove, ac, oven and stove, coouches and grill were awesome. what I loved best was the king bed matress. I think it really makes a huge difference to sleep on a quality (it was a memory foam type) mattress, my back thanks you! Sam provided two Tommy Bahama beach chairs and a beach umbrella and two brand new beach towels. This was indispensable given the close proximity to naples beach. The apartment was clean. The shower had a powerful shower head. The water pressure throughout the home was outstanding. I would return here. Thanks"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was perfect for us!
My husband and I wanted to stay in a central location because we would be driving to Sanibel and Marco Island during our stay. The location gave us easy access to the Tamiami Trail. It is located near grocery stores and restaurants, and Sam gave us a great recommendation for dinner out.
The space was nicely decorated and was just right for the two of us. We had everything we needed during our stay, including the necessities to cook a couple meals ourselves. Bonus points for the ""good"" dishwashing and hand soap! I appreciate having a nightstand on both sides of the king size bed for water, glasses, and a phone. The furniture is both comfortable and pretty.
The price was very reasonable. Sam was just a text message or call away when we had questions. We would definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sam’s Villa is a quiet get-away, yet just minutes to downtown and the beautiful beach! The Villa was clean and updated, open and airy. I particularly enjoyed the side patio during the day, and the outdoor fire pit at night. Mid-century modern accents complimented the overall décor, and the shower pressure was amazing! Sam was attentive and offered suggestions on where to go for tacos, helped with the internet issue, and shared his bug spray so I could venture to Corkscrew Swamp (highly recommended to wildlife/nature enthusiasts) without the worry of mosquitos. The Nespresso machine made awesome coffee drinks in record time! The king bed was super comfy, and the beach towels and chairs were an added bonus. I would definitely stay here again!!"

There are also bicycles, beach chairs (even small ones for the littles), games, a ping pong table, yoga mats, and plenty of beach/pool towels. The backyard is private and oh so comfortable. John is the most responsive owner we have ever dealt with and is just incredible to work with. The home is so well maintained and cared for. Truly the best home we have ever stayed in.

It’s the little additions that separates this from others. There are several bicycles available for rides, board games, foosball, ping pong etc. The back yard set up is amazing. I came here for a weekend away with a group of friends and would 100% come back. Location is a 5 mins drive from the beach and 7 minute uber to the downtown area where there are several bars and night clubs.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was truly one of the most responsive hosts we've ever used. We have small children so naturally had tons of questions and worries. John responded immediately and answered all of our questions. This spot is perfect for children. The house has a screened-in the porch (that is nearly impossible for kids under 4 to open) and the main door outside has multiple locks. The yard is a dream, the pool was perfectly clean. For parents of small children who worry about napping I have to say the blinds are AMAZING, the rooms were very dark. The house is also in a real perfect location. Highly recommend!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful and felt so homey. Its very spacious, very clean and lots of different games to play with the family. John was also responded very quickly with any questions I had."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time renting with John and we enjoyed every moment. The house was clean, pool was amazing, and John had everything organized and ready for our arrival. I would definitely rent from John again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was excellent. The house was well appointed and easy to use the amenities. John was very responsive and helpful throughout. We had no issues and appreciated the updated appliances and technology (thermostat, door entry and smart TV) that made things feel like home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property in a great location! The backyard is truly PARADISE! No complaints what so ever!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The house is even prettier than the pictures if that’s even possible. The decoration is very, very, pretty it has the perfect balance between modern, cozy and beach styles. It is a extremely comfortable, and peaceful house, we found everything we needed and more and everything was in impeccable conditions. The pool has such a nice vibe it wasn’t even necessary to leave the first couple of days… I honestly had the perfect vacations and it was mainly because this is a place you actually enjoy staying at. John was also a great host, reachable and respectful. I would definitely come back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Will book again!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing property everything is brand new and it’s relatively close to the beach definitely recommend John as a host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location for our family vacation. This home had all the amenities you could possibly imagine and more. Beautiful home! You can literally show up and feel like home. Good location! Pool was excellent!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The poolsite of the property is just behind the mainroad. Very noisy because of the traffic and if you like the city life this is okay but if you come here for rest this is not your place. For me this was very disappointing. The pool and the hoose was good!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a lovely home, nicely decorated, welcoming. A bottle of wine waiting, paper towels, tissue, soaps. Lovely pool, which Anthony and Kari tried extra hard to accommodate, heated to my preferred temperature during a brief cold spell. Clear instructions, easy contact, lightning speed responses. This home is on a large cul de sac lot, contained by a high subdivision back wall as it is adjacent to busy Livingston Blvd, which was actually very convenient for bypassing other Naples traffic. Road noise was no problem at all, and indoors was perfectly quiet. I would rent again, highly recommend this accommodation. Anthony and Kari are most hospitable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the first Airbnb we rented, and I have to say, I’m done with hotels. This place was perfect and the people were very friendly and responded within minutes."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was amazing! The beds were comfortable and made you feel at home. The house was spotless and had ample necessities like towels, cleaning products, dishes, cups, etc. The pool was very large with a nice lanai area. The gated community was easy to access with very friendly staff at the gates. Short drive to the beaches and downtown Naples. Would definitely stay again anytime visiting Naples!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was very clean and nicely furnished. Hottub was great after 12 hour drive!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is nice/pretty on the inside and definitely renovated but there was hair on the shower wall and dead bugs and dust on the window cills when we got there. Also rusty water in one of the utensil drawers. Usually at places I stay they have water in the fridge and some type of snack but there was nothing. Not too much hospitality here and the hot tub has rust on some of the jets. The place is not dirty at all it just wasn’t properly cleaned all the way. I wouldn’t stay here again to be honest. But the hosts were very responsive and friendly to me.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It matched perfectly with the photos, very clean and close to Vanderbilt Beach, my husband and I walked there. We loved it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice spot. Quiet and a mile from the beach. Clean and comfortable! Maybe the only downside would just be that I enjoy being able to walk to more options for shopping and restaurants but really very nice if you just drive. Naples has a lot to offer!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Thank you so much!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great week at Mark’s place! The unit was clean, updated and comfortable. The hot tub was a great amenity to have. And the location was terrific. We could walk to the beach and the shopping and restaurants at Mercato. Highly recommend Mark’s place!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Except for connectivity issues on both TV’s (intermittently dropping connectivity and inability to connect to local channels on main TV in living room), we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Communication with property managers was great, kitchen was stocked well, and we enjoyed both the backyard and biking to the beach. Although the air conditioning system shut down and was repaired first thing the next day, it may have been prevented by more frequent maintenance. Highly recommend!"

Mark made it easy for us to ""move right in"" with a place to hang coats and put purses and bags by the door, and large closet with shelves and a place to put the suitcases, and a nice basket in the bathroom to organize toiletries. We enjoyed the outside space only briefly due to the weather but it was also very nice! Thank you, Mark, we would love to come back!"

Each time Mark was inquiring about how our stay was and if there was anything he could do to make our stay better. The place was exactly as described. Everything you would need for a day at the beach was provided. Beach chairs, umbrellas, beach towels, a cooler and a little wagon to put everything in. The kitchen was the most stocked kitchen of any place I have stayed. The fenced in back yard was perfect for our Benji to play in. I can't say enough about how enjoyable Mark and the rest of the team made our stay."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I typically always leave favorable reviews granted the hosts are fair but this 5 star rating from me is well earned. The space is tastefully done, easy to check into and if anything comes up, Mark and Carrie respond within minutes. The backyard is beautiful. If you’re up early enough before it’s too hot, I would encourage you to sit in the hot tub to watch and listen to the birds. So peaceful. When I return to work with clients I will always check to see if their spot is available first."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! Very clean, private, and a walking distance to the ocean. Hot tub was great. Washer and dryer available and full bottle of body wash and shampoo were available for guest.

Top notch."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in other airbnbs that friends or family had booked. This was my first booking, and I am pleased with myself. My husband was also impressed with Mark's place, so much that we looked into his other properties for future trips. Any issues were promptly addressed. I was able to get 3 nights of sleep without any sleep aids, which never happens traveling. Comfy beds, stocked kitchen, great water pressure, climate controled, and kicking back patio.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place with great yard to stay. Felt right at home and had everything necessary. Would stay again for sure!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Even better than described. I was so pleasantly surprised when I opened the door, I literally delayed my plans for a couple hrs so I could just sit in the hammock and relax in the FL sunshine with a glass of wine (not to mention I was fortunate enough to be allowed for an earlier check in time)!
I spent the prior week at a rental house 15 min drive south, which was fine, but nothing special to write home about. Unfortunately the red tide dead fish were bad in naples/west coast of FL this week, so beach time wasn’t happening, so I was actually a little nervous about this location being only 2 blocks to the water/canals- but there was air flow and no smell outside in the area, so was able to enjoy the backyard/hammock/hot tub without issue, nor any issues with dog walks (which wasn’t the case in my rental last week). Wish I could have stayed longer!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a Naples vacation.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mark has a great home and takes very good care of it. The home had everything we needed and more.

Thanks for the great vacation."

Mark's home is beautiful - it's newly renovated, very clean, has new appliances, and is all decorated in a cute Florida beach vibe. The location is a 15 walk to the beach and they also supply 2 bikes which was so fun! The backyard is a HUGE highlight - the hot tub with twinkly lights, grassy yard, hammock, table for eating, tall fencing for a private feel, and lounge chairs make for a lovely place to hang out!

One of my best Airbnb experiences and I will definitely book one of Mark’s properties when I’m in town again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful place! The backyard was spacious and perfect for my dog ! The jacuzzi was wonderful and I enjoyed it so much.

The pictures were perfect and it is great when you are pleasantly surprised when you walk into an Airbnb. The hot tub was a huge bonus and I was in it daily! The Kitchen was beautifully appointed.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt completely at home 🏡 from the moment we opened the front door! His home is so well organized & he thought of everything!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This might have been our best Airbnb experience yet. The place had everything we wanted and needed. It was very clean and comfortable, had all the kitchen appliances, and the back yard was great! It is very close to Vanderbilt beach and to a few grocery stores.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Mark’s place for a couple nights after we arrived to Naples, while we waited for the movers to deliver everything to our house. Because we were fairly busy handling all that moving states entails, we didn’t truly get to enjoy all the perks of this place. The location is amazing. My husband did get to easily walk our son in his stroller down to the beach once. The Airbnb is stocked with all kinds of equipment to make your beach day go smoothly.
The fenced in yard was absolutely perfect for our pups to stretch their legs out after 17 hours of driving over 2 days. There was plenty of room in the driveway to tandem park our 2 full size suvs. There was so much room inside as well, which our toddler loved. A great size kitchen, plus a laundry room were great for us to get caught up on our laundry from the drive down. The backyard was also outfitted nicely- too bad we didn’t have any downtime to just enjoy it!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably one of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at in a while. It was a great size for just my partner and I. I've been in a lot of nice Airbnb's but they are always missing something and I end up having to run out to the store. This place had everything we could've needed, especially since we were going to the beach. All we needed to buy was our own food and sunscreen! For just two people, this was the perfect little getaway. I'm born and raised in Miami, so I'm very familiar with what can actually be considered ""beach side"" and this checks all the boxes for me."

Mark replied to all inquiries immediately. Our dog enjoyed the yard and walking through the friendly neighborhood.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home perfect for couples! Host has really thought of everything, especially for the beach, which is very close by.

Totally quiet and private. We loved hanging out in the backyard and were happy to find beach cruisers to use for a short one mile trip to the beach. Mark thought of everything and is very organized. I would absolutely rent the place again & recommend it!!"

2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Description accurately depicts the rental. More spacious than expected. Space was spotless. Very quiet residential neighborhood. Property manager was very responsive. Some issues should have been resolved before space was rented (light bulb was out near door lock requiring a flashlight to operate the lock; bathroom exhaust fan was broken; no instructions explaining operation of TV & cable).
2020-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,A perfect place for 1 couple. Mark was very attentive making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.

The pool was awesome!😎"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mark's place was absolutely amazing. The pool was the warmest outdoor pool I have ever been in and the outdoor space was lovely. As long as you don't mind occasionally sharing the outdoor pool space with the attached unit, this is a perfect spot. We spent two weeks here and met many wonderful families, staying in attached unit, who swam with our little 2 year-old. We ate breakfast and dinner, almost daily, outside on the patio. This space was perfect for our little family of three. We have a 2 year-old who still takes naps during the afternoon. There is a VERY large attached walk in closet/converted into a spare space to the master bedroom that has a dresser and closet space to hang clothes. This space was so large we ended up making it our 2-year old's sleeping space so he would not be disturbed. There actually was a nice pack and play available to use, but we ended up wanting a crib to mimic our son's room at home. We rented a crib and highchair from a very nice place nearby called ""Twinkle Twinkle."" This place even delivers, installs and picks up if needed. The washer and dryer in the unit was very new and detergent and dryer sheets were provided. Kitchen was equipped with everything we needed including things like spices, Tupperware for beach snacks, plastic bags and coffee filters. As a family with a little one we did a lot of cooking in the unit which was nice. The unit was close to the beach and within walking distance. Very nice neighborhood and felt very safe. The bikes, umbrella and beach wagon were a nice touch. Mark and Juan were wonderful and always available when we had questions. Would definitely recommend and will be staying again when we return."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my very first Air B n B rental.....and my first solo trip anywhere....I am very glad that I chose Naples. If you're looking for the following combination as I was, then this place is for you: Great personable host, close to the beach(es), close to health food options (Whole Foods), and more....tons of restaurants and the usual city amenities, quiet house and neighbourhood...and more....this is the place for you. Initially I was apprehensive of going the air b n b route...but with limited hotels that included a kitchen for me to cook my own food, and eat as 'clean' as possible.... then this was the way to go....it worked out very well. The backyard is spacious and has a few rest areas....I would have loved to use the bbq there, but that didn't work out. I met Mark's parents, a very lovely couple as they happened to be visiting next door. They ate my scones!!! I had overdid it on my baking.
Next door is where I want to rent when I come down in the future with my whole family. (3BR and a kitchen island!) Mark seems like a very resourceful guy, very energetic and just a go-getter type. I wish him the best with life and all his future plans."

He allowed us to check in early that day. The place was even better than the pictures: very clean, towels and personal care items (soap, shower gel, etc), floaties for the pool, lounge chairs, kitchen utensils, everything was provided along with 2 grills outside. Mark's space felt very homey as soon as we walked in the door. The heated pool was a huge attraction for the weekend. The outside backyard area is beautiful and private, as it's fenced all around. Juan, Mark's property manager, was also very helpful. I can't say enough about the place as well as Mark and Juan. Thank you for having us at your place, it was a great birthday weekend and we hope to be back!!!"

They are great personable hosts - and the space is simply adorable, squeaky clean, bright, modern, cozy and well appointed.
I will have no problem returning to this jewel of a rental in the future.
The grounds and the pool were wonderful and well done!
I loved the fact that the location was a 1 mile, easy, flat walk to the beach - through shady, pretty neighborhoods...I went everyday for a long walk in the cool morning hours and it was fabulous!
Getting into town on foot or by car was quick. The location was great, located in a quiet neighborhood....which is a rare thing in Naples!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fantastic. Bruce and Patti are angels on earth and their studio+yard+
landscaping is heavenly. It’s obvious their goal is to do everything at 100% perfection. The studio was spotless and wonderfully supplied. The key pad entry was easy to use as was the climate control. The guidebook was really interesting and informative. The yard plantings had me mesmerized and in a state of zen. :)
Anyone wishing to be an Airbnb host should first have to go to the “Patti and Bruce School of Airbnb Excellence ”.
However, more than that, they are kind and genuine human beings.
We are blessed to have found their place and to have met these kind souls."

We knew where to go, when to go, and how to get there best (beach, food, entertainment, etc).
Finally, they allowed us to borrow their bikes for transportation, and allowed us to use their jacuzzi whenever we wanted as long as we communicated ahead of time.
Great stay and even better hosts!"

They really cared about our experience and about our feedback and had plenty of great suggestions for exploring the Naples area. As for the place itself, it was neat as in very tidy and neat as in had every amenity we needed and was nicely laid out. And it was super cozy and comfortable. It’s in the middle of a residential neighborhood but a brewery and a number of restaurants are a few short blocks away. And the whole of Naples is easily bikeable on the bikes that the hosts provide. Overall, a great experience and a great place with the best hosts. Thank you!"

The bed is very comfortable, the shower was big and spacious, and the place was beautiful, stylish and sparkling clean. They provided beach chairs, beach towels, beach umbrellas, and coolers as well which totally helps when you’re traveling for some beach time and can’t bring all of that stuff with you of course!
Patti and Bruce exceeded our expectations entirely. Our stay was absolutely lovely, relaxing and fun.

Everything is close to this location. The sunset is every evening just down 7th street. If you can ride a bike , you must ride gordon st south of 7th st. It’s safe to ride on the street. The suite is great for a quite Naples experience that you will remember. I would strongly recommend to a family/friend.🕶🚴‍♀️"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb was exactly how the pictures look. Very clean, new, cozy! Charlotte and Ivan were very kind and provided everything we could think of including snacks and supplies, and manual! They were amazing and super responsive. Bed was so comfy and bathroom was so nice with a big mirror. The only little thing is we thought the airbnb was it’s own property/apartment, it was more like a guest suite inside the main house. Sometimes me and my partner felt a bit shy speaking loudly as we would think people could hear us through the walls. But nonetheless, the airbnb was everything we could need and we would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Will likely stay again when i'm in the area.

Their place is comfortable and clean with all the supplies we might have needed including beach towels and chairs, suntan lotion and a wonderful patio with large gas grill and fire pit.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ivan and Charlotte were always very attentive, they lived on the same plot and it's a plus. The house was very clean and with all the useful and products you can get to need (shampoos, gel, razor blades, repellent, washing machine soap, oil, infusions, coffee maker, hair iron and clothes,...).
The house is close to supermarkets and other amenities, 15min, they have created a book detailing all these amenities so that the user has more facilities.
The internet is pretty good for remote work.
The entrance is quite comfortable and has everything to be able to have breakfast and live out.
We were afraid of “violent” wild animals but we only saw squirrels, rabbits, ... they told me that it was very difficult that they will cherish bears but they are required to warn.
If we have a trip to that area again, we wouldn't hesitate to repeat it."

The two have thought of many amenities for guests, such as a bath bag with towels, sunscreen, mosquito spray, grill, fireplace, etc. The apartment is on a very spacious property and invites you to sit outside under palm trees in the evening. Optimal is the two person accommodation. We, with two teenagers, had to organize ourselves well in the interiors."

The space was well thought out and bigger than I thought it would be from the photos.

Full of towering pine and palm trees with hanging Spanish moss, the yard is lit up with strings of lights for nice ambiance at night. I could even enjoy an outside fire in the pit. Inside is all new and every drawer, cabinet, and closet has stuff to use. They thought of everything so you can just bring your clothes and call this home. Even after I get permanent residency in the area, I'd like to come back and hang out here for some solitude in this excellent, natural setting."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed our 6 night stay at Bear Necessities last week. We had never been to the Naples area before and this allowed us to stay at a private residential area just outside of the city. We did not have to deal with noisy traffic here and after our day trips we were able to relax at our private back patio. We had use of the gas grill which I love! The rooms were clean, newly renovated and new appliances. The hosts provided snacks and beach accessories that helped us during our 2 beach day visits. A cooler with wheels and beach towels. The bed linens were silky soft and the bed was quite comfortable. The kitchen and dining room are together in one room and the table that folded down is quite small but worked for us. There is also a patio table and chairs with an umbrella for dining as well. Our experience was very pleasant and we would definitely go back to Bear Necessities if we get back to Naples. We met Charlotte and Ivan and they were very nice and quick to respond to our questions."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house in a great location. Had everything for the little ones. Some confusion with the pool heater/spa, which Elena did her best to accommodate. Our weather was colder than normal which affected the pool being pretty chilly. Overall great location on a quiet street and had everything we needed. Wish the basketball hoop was still there in the pool, but it wasn’t."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our family to meet my older in-laws, one of whom has mobility issues. Elena was able to flexible with the check in for them as well which was a huge relief and help. The layout is great for privacy for whoever takes the primary suite. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood in striking distance to anything you could want around Naples. We were there for a sports tournament at Paradise Coast Sports Complex and it was an easy drive. The pool and hot tub were a huge hit! The house (and pool) has everything you need to make it fun and comfortable. The outdoor space is lovely. We enjoyed the stay, would recommend the house, and would stay again if we are in the area!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Elena was a great host, property was in a good location to get to downtown Naples and Paradise Spirts Complex in just 15 minutes. Great layout and amenities. A few small hiccups with check in but resolved in 20 minutes, and the hot tub jets wouldn’t work but we still enjoyed the pool. Host was also very accommodating to our late checkout request. Would highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I and our two sisters spent four nights and three days at this beautiful property . All amenities , location, and services from our host Elena exceeded our expectation. Our only regret was having to leave. We highly recommend this beautiful home to all future guests. - John"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elena’s home was spotlessly clean and as beautiful as it is in the pictures. We loved lounging and dining by the pool on the screened patio. The neighborhood is very quiet. We took a 2.5 mile walk every morning on the sidewalk that circled the neighborhood. There was very little traffic and felt quite safe. It is an easy 15 minute drive to the shops and restaurants downtown. We had a great takeout meal one evening from Kareem’s Lebanese restaurant, a short 5 minute drive from the house. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The home was extremely clean and the decor was great. I felt immediately comfortable and had everything we could need. I highly recommend this rental...clean, beautiful home in a very convenient location. The neighborhood was very quiet
Just two small things that would have made our stay even better:
* Master bedroom linens need to be upgraded/refreshed
* The hot tub didn't get very hot and jets often didn't work
Overall, well worth the money."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much! I cooked a lot and baked a birthday cake for my daughter—great kitchen! Loved the pool area—probably the highlight gathering space! Master suite was very comfortable and well apponted! Thank you—we’d lovr to come back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elena’s home was immaculate. Beautifully furnished, scrupulously clean, and in a pristine natural preserve environment! Can’t say enough how
much our family enjoyed our stay!!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Very satisfied with this place, you have everything you need to stay confortable, my family enjoy this place like home; thank you Elena."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the house was lovely, nicely decorated, comfortable and convenient to restaurants and activities. My only complaint was the pool area… the spa and pool were temperamental during our stay. The filter wasn’t working so it was dirty in our arrival. There was also left over trash on the pool deck .. The spa and pool were WHY we booked in the first place, so that was extremely disappointing. Elena tried to help but unfortunately she’s not local so sent a friend to help, and it ended up being a, “is what it is” type of situation.. not the best thing to hear on a long awaited vacation. We made the best of it.. but if you plan on booking, do so on a Monday or Tuesday when the pool person comes so it’ll be clean and ready for you!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,I recommend the house. My family and I felt like home. I would definitely recommend a spectacular vacation. I guarantee it. We will repeat it. We will be happy to love it again 🥰

2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What an amazing stay at Elena's property. Exactly as described and even more wonderful when you're there. So peaceful and quiet in a safe and luxurious neighbourhood. Easy access to all local amenities with Publix and Walmart on your doorstep. Traditionally we've stayed in hotels in Naples, and for the first time opted for an Airbnb, with no regrets whatsoever. So much space for the family to move around and not be climbing over each other as with a standard hotel. Great size rooms, comfy beds, perfect air con and beautiful bathrooms. The pool deck was larger than expected and the pool of perfect depth for enjoyment. Elena was supportive and responsive albeit we had no issues to make contact over. I would highly recommend this property."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Beautiful, peaceful, clean and confortable. Good location. We really enjoyed this place in Naples ♥️. 100% recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Every detail was carefully considered, from the tasteful decor to the comfortable furnishings. This blended seamlessly with the modern amenities, creating an inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home. One standout aspect was the location. From taking our daily trips to the beach, exploring nearby restaurants, or taking a stroll through the neighborhood, everything was within reach. The pool is a stunning centerpiece of the property and was a sight to behold. The hot tub offered a perfect space to unwind and rejuvenate. For an hour each morning, a waterfall would turn on flowing from the hot tub to the pool. This produced a beautiful sound that filled the air while sitting outside. The ambiance surrounding the lanai was nothing short of enchanting. Lush greenery and well-placed lighting created an atmosphere of pure bliss.
I highly recommend this property to anyone seeking a remarkable getaway, and I look forward to returning in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house was just what I need it. Elena’s house is beautiful - gorgeous. She was always very responsive, helpful at all times.

My girls and I enjoyed the pool and spa everyday after a day at the beach. The neighborhood is safe, clean and walkable. You can also ride the provided bicycles around the neighborhood. The Home is near grocery store, pharmacy and coffee shop. It was wonderful to have the beach chairs and umbrella available.
We really enjoyed our stay at Elena’s home. I have no reservations in recommending this property."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We thought the house was beautiful all decor was spot on .

We especially enjoyed hanging out in the pool and hot tub during the day and late at night. Everything was very clean and well kept - the whole house looked brand new! We found all the essentials we were looking for and then some. We also enjoyed having the beach chairs and umbrella to take with us and use. It was less than 15 minutes to the nearest beach on 5th Ave. The house itself was very spacious and open, leaving us plenty of room to spread out and relax. The outdoor seating area was great for enjoying morning coffee and was very comfortable! We took several bike rides around the lake right down the road and in the surrounding neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Naples! Highly recommended!"

The bikes in the garage and all of the beach gear, including cooler, chairs and umbrella, were much appreciated."

Thanks!!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We highly enjoyed our stay for 2 wks at this house. As others have stated, pictures do not do it justice. Felt light and airy with plenty of room for this family of four. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub daily, cooking and having meals outside and movies and game nights in the evening. Naples by itself is beautiful but having a lovely environment to come home to made our vacation unforgettable. Owner is very easy to get a hold of for any questions and we definitely plan on returning and staying here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elena is a superb host. The house is absolutely gorgeous. The out door area with the seating, pool and hot tub are sure to make any vacation an outstanding one.

The location is also phenomenal it’s a ten minute drive from the shops and restaurants on Fifth Ave and the beach. I cannot recommend Elena and her beautiful home in Naples enough!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible house and area. The neighbors are quite and polite. The pictures don't do enough justice for how amazing the house is. Plenty of space. Great room in the kitchen. I would definitely stay again.

Her standards are something that everyone should strive for. Thank you Andrea 😎"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea's Home feels like home. It gets nicer each time and is well worth it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a great surprise! This was a relatively short-notice booking due to a VBRO sudden cancellation. It turned out to be one of my favorite Air B&B stays yet! Andrea was a wonderful host Her ""nest"" was beautiful and she truly treated me as a special guest! I loved her pool and beautiful plant life surrounding her home. It was extremely peaceful. A favorite part of my experience was our conversations about travel in Europe and other interesting topics.
I consider myself fortunate to have stayed here and look forward to doing so again!
Thank you Andrea, for the wonderful stay! God Bless!"

I cannot recommend staying here enough.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My college roommate and I had an amazing time staying with Andrea. The atmosphere was clean, peaceful, welcoming, and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing her two kitties and her puppy Grady. We were a little rambunctious because we came for spring break and she gave us grace. Andrea also gave us great advice about the area and we loved kayaking the Estero river from her recommendation. Andrea was very pleasant, accommodating, and fun to be around. We have one suggestion for Airbnb and that would be to make check in more secure by not releasing hosts addresses until the day of check in, and releasing guests profiles to the host prior to check in for better safety and security for the host."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea is a dream host with a lush and beautiful home. She is extremely personable and friendly. I absolutely loved staying at her property for peace and serenity. My goal is to stay at her place every year. I never felt so comfortable at any AirBnB as I did with Andrea’s place.
Love love it! 5 stars are not enough quite frankly!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea was a superstar host. The pride she takes in her home was equally matched with her honest commitment to connect with her guests. Staying with her was one of the highlights of our trip. We have a new friend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and conversations with Andrea. She has a very pretty yard, gardens, and a relaxing pool. We used her bikes to get around the beach and parks. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,If I could give every category 6 stars instead of 5 I would. The house was great and Andrea is a terrific host. She quickly became more like a friend than a host. The location was perfect for me as I was doing allot of hiking out along the Tamiami. Several really nice parks close by as well. Thanks a bunch Andrea!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Air BNB I've ever been to by far. Nothing else needs to be said.

This is my first time staying in an owner's home while they are present, and the experience exceeded all expectations."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Andrea rents a nicely furnished room with a private bathroom. Everything is super clean and very tastefully decorated, in a separate area in her house. The room is ideal for one person, but also suitable for a couple.
It's up to you, whether you live with or with Andrea. Great trips together with it are possible. Among other things, we had a beautiful canoe tour. We fully recommend the place and spent 10 great days with her."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Naples is a paradise and Andrea's house is too. Its kindness makes you feel comfortable as in your home. Her love and host vocation can be seen in all the details.

2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house is clean and the poolside nice.
But the house has 500 rules you have to follow, sometimes we thought the housekeeper has even set up a trap to disregard a rule that she could give a further annoying comment.
Under this circumstances the stay was not so enjoyable for us.
In the past we have had better experiences with airbnb."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea's home gets nicer every time I'm there. She recently updated the guest shower.
It's Awesome. Feels just like home."

Andreas Geheim-Tip's gave us many great experiences.
Thank you for letting us be your guests. We would definitely come back. 😊
Kind regards P & L from Germany 🇩🇪😊"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea is an enchanting host. She greeted me very kindly and showed and explained everything to me. The location of the accommodation is quiet in a very good area, I felt very welcome and comfortable and the cats and only the dog have conquered my heart. The house is super well maintained and clean. The room is as described and the bed is very comfortable and I haven't slept so well in a long time 😊
Andrea answers all questions and gives helpful tips for doing things. It's a shame I couldn't stay longer, but I'll be back.
I recommend this place to anyone who likes it quietly in the area. I will definitely come back."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for opening your house to us.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea's place met all the advertised expectations. The water is delicious and the house is odor-free, the level of cleanliness is impeccable. Staying in Andrea's nest is truly a delightful experience, one might call it a private spa, a conservatory for the natural senses. One can not put into words the sheer beauty of the morning sunrise witnessed here with the nooks of benches and enclaves of seats with pendulums measuring the earth’s turning and time’s passage to provoke one to contemplate the purpose of existence. Andrea possesses a remarkable talent for transforming hospitality into something akin to family. Her warm demeanor has her incredibly charming power to make you laugh, instill hope, and complete your day with joy, effectively dispelling any lingering clouds of negativity, and inspiring a desire to stay forever. As a host, Andrea is nothing short of perfect. She has a way of being present that is as soft as the gentle morning light, there to brighten your day. Stay here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Andera was like staying with a friend. She has embraced the original concept of Airbnb, which is very refreshing. I liked talking with her at the end of the day and getting to know her while sharing the stories of my life. Her home is beautiful. The pool is fantastic (I didn't think I'd use it, but I enjoyed it twice). The backyard is a sanctuary and is very peaceful. When I return to Naples. I hope to stay at Andera's again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay! It was not an anonymous rental of the space only. A few hours after check-in we got a feeling, that we are visiting a very good friend from the old days. Delicious grilled food prepared together, long and interesting conversations almost until midnight - with my wife we arrived as strangers, and after a couple of days we left as the best friends! The interaction with Andrea was really perfect and the stay have greatly exceeded our expectations thanks to her hospitality. That was the most added value of this stay - sharing concept by Andrea was really perfect."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea takes great pride in her lovely home which is immaculately clean and in a nice neighborhood.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea was a really great host. While being very discreet, we could have with her nice discussions and she was really good advice for places to see in the area and activities to do.

If we ever return to this region, we will be delighted to return to Andrea's place.

Her home is warm and calming…I simply don’t have the words to explain it. I’m certainly not one to write reviews often, so for me to write this should alone indicate my experience was beyond satisfying. I have stayed in dozens of air bnb’s, and this is the first one I am certain I will be returning to in the future."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful spot! She has all kinds of very special touch that makes the stay super nice. Didn't get to enjoy the outdoor so much but it looked and was super pretty.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea’s place was very nice, laid back, and comfortable. The location is perfect although we wished we had rented a car while there ubering around wasn’t bad because most things to do were only 10-15 minutes away. Her listing really does no justice to what her place has to offer. Andrea went above and beyond as a host making us feel comfortable. Offering advice and suggestions on places to go and things to do in the area. Even let us use her bikes and beach gear. Would definitely recommend Andreas place."

We were so happy to book this place. 😍 Andrea’s charisma and unexpected generosity instantly made us feel at home/welcome. We were treated with so much love, we didn’t even feel like strangers.
She’s very understanding, and friendly that you won’t have no regrets. We went back home happy, I’m sure you will too. She gave us the list of all the best places of Napples which counted exactly as a touristic guide. She’s good at it 😄. We’ll miss u dearly, Andrea. Hopefully we can come back every summer! ♥️"

I like to bike ride and her home is perfect for me, close to Pickleball, many nice restaurants, downtown, and the beach. The pool area is great for a relaxing afternoon when I need some downtime, and after the passing of my dog this year it was wonderful to have her dog Grady around to give some loving to. I would stay again for sure the next time I'm in Naples."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we could give Andrea more than five stars, we would do so. Her home is attractive and squeaky clean. Sometimes when we’ve stayed at Airbnbs with access to the kitchen and living areas, we’ve felt like we were intruding. We felt very comfortable utilizing the kitchen and hanging out in the living room and the lanai. If we get back to Naples, we would love to stay at Andrea’s again."

Andrea is so welcoming and generous. Sharing all she has. Her home is very stylish and the space is wonderful. We loved the two cats and dog . Kitchen has everything and then some needed to cook as well as the grill. Yard and pool are tops for a relaxing vacation. Bed is very comfortable and I slept better there than at home. She’s a wealth of knowledge on the area and worthwhile attractions. Would love to return in the near future.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a relaxed and very Zen like Airbnb, where attention to detail has been paid.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Best Airbnb experience ever! There is everything in the house you need for a more than perfect stay, even more :) Andrea is a caring, loving host who can just feel comfortable with.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were clean and stylish! Quiet neighborhood and good location for sightseeing from Naples and into the Big Cypress and Everglades. Friendly cats and good cinnamon rolls! I stayed two nights and have no complaint! Andrea is fluent in German and will be a great host for international guests. She has lived in the area for many years and is familiar with the sights and places to visit. Very enjoyable!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea is delight. So helpful. Her home is beautiful and so well decorated. I plan on using again on Naples visits if available. Thanks Andrea.

Her home is comfortable, exceptionally clean, quiet and stocked with soap, shampoos, coffee, tea, cereal and drinking water. She also offers additional amenities beyond any other nice Airbnb I have stayed in. There is a kayak to use in the waterway just outside her back door, a large back yard to relax in and the pool is perfect.
Saving the best for last… Andrea is a warm, delightful conversationalist. She is thoughtful, interesting and well traveled. She and her home were a treat. When I get back to Naples, I will make every effort to stay at her home."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea is a lovely, responsive host and makes every effort to create a comfortable, private space for guests. Her home is cozy, clean, and very well-maintained with thoughtful touches. It is located in a quiet, safe, beautiful neighborhood and convenient to shopping, eating establishments, and freeways. Andrea's two cats and dog are adorable. This is a great place to stay if you are traveling to Naples, FL."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time to the Naples area and first time staying in the type of airbnb that the host lives there too. I’ve previously rented out entire places. I liked it a lot! Andrea is a wonderful host and communication was great. The room was comfortable, bathroom was clean with many amenities. Andrea let me borrow a beach chair and towel. I loved meeting the cats, and got to briefly meet the dog as well! Close drive to downtown Naples and the beach."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay in Naples with a pool and plenty of privacy, look no further than Andrea's! She had everything so clean, and showed me around so I knew where everything was, from the microwave to how to lock the door. On the last morning of my stay she invited me to have coffee with her and we had a great long conversation before my flight out. When I return to Naples I plan to stay there again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful get-away! Andrea was very welcoming & we had great conversation! Very cozy, would def recommend to family & friends coming to visit the city x"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea was the most amazing host!! She not only has a beautiful home, but she is the kindest host you will get. She was tremendously accommodating and even brought her dog home for me and my friend to play with after she heard about our love for dogs. She truly went above and beyond with the hospitality and even baked food for us every morning. This place is perfect for a beautifully quiet place to stay in Naples and a tremendously beautiful and clean house and an amazing host with beautifully kind animals! And if you want something more private, this place is still an amazing stay with a clean private room and bathroom. We will be sure to come back and stay again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of the best Airbnb places I have stayed. Very convenient to stay in a quieter neighborhood than smack in downtown Naples. Lots of options to relax in the house, kitchen, your private room, the lanai or the pool. Loved the solar powered lights that come on at dusk, and the birds that visit the yard are a bonus. Andrea has all the kitchen gadgets that anyone could need to create delicious meals which were fun to learn about. She gives you the opportunity to have your privacy or to interact with her as you choose. The bed is so comfortable and the private room, bath and entrance is perfect. I was looking for a quiet week to relax, read a few books, and find some quiet beaches and dining on fresh seafood. I avoided the touristy hangouts. Loved Naples dog park, the Florida state parks nearby, and this Airbnb."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Above and beyond my expectations.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What can I say it’s TRULLY an oasis hide away with a most friendly host! She has 3 fabulous pets; her grey dog and 2 cats. I fell in love with her doggie. Andrea will accommodate you in just about EVERYTHING and anything you may need. I thouroughly enjoyed my stay there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea’s place is great. The house is wonderful, the lanai is inviting and relaxing. I felt remarkably welcome. My bedroom and bath were perfect. I felt like she had thought of every detail.
Initially I hesitated to book because of her home’s distance from the conference I was to attend. I read about “arriving as a guest and leaving as a friend” and booked with her. I am SOOOO grateful that I did. A couple of times while meeting people I said “heading home” (as opposed to “heading back to my hotel/BnB” And I laughed because I felt that welcome. Even if the conference had been a horrible experience, staying with Andrea would have still made the trip worth it.
My experience at the Tropical Hideaway surpassed every expectation. I absolutely feel like I gained friend.
The only thing I wish I could change was the length of my stay... I wanted to stay longer."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place Very accommodating host.Good location .
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay...will be back!
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A home close enough to attractions, but far enough away to need a vehicle.
Host was very accommodating, but present morning, noon, and night.
Her dog and cats were lovely, but the dog was not listed.
If you want privacy this home may not suite your needs. However, if you want guidance on how to use everything in this home, Andrea will walk you through and clearly show you and inform you of the things you can do and what you can not do.
Andrea provided various beverages, bikes, chairs, umbrella and towels for the beach which was a big plus."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea's place is a beauitful oasis in Naples.Siuated in central location and everything you need is nearby.you will hear the sounds of chirping words when you wake up in the morninig.The Dog and cats she has are so friendly and adorable and you can spend whole day playing with them.We were in Naples for two days and we have enjoyed her hospitality and company so much.Defintely going to stay back again if i ever visit Naples again.

She was very attentive and made sure we were comfortable. The room was nice and spacious. There is a small refrigerator available for storage. Water is also available. The indoor pool is heated and the atmosphere was so pretty! I got to meet her two cute cats and her friendly dog. The area is safe and it’s close to Naples beach. Overall our experience was great and we wished we stayed longer! Would definitely come back again. Thank you for everything! Take care!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea is a terrific host. She pays attention to her guests’ needs and wants. We would love to come back.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Andrea and this Private Room was amazing; very comfortable, super-clean with great amenities. We especially loved the shower. I know it may seem unsubstantial, but this was the best shower we've had for the past 3 months staying exclusively at AirBnBs. Andrea made us feel very welcome. Our only regret is that we didn't spend more time talking with her. With social distancing and respect for someone's home, we kept more distance than should've with a very sociable and friendly host. Great location & neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,My stay was very nice.Andre is a pleasant host whos home is clean and organized. She has pets that are friendly and like people.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was my second visit there and I enjoyed my relaxing 2 night stay.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Look no further - Andrea's place has it all!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"TLDR: Fun, friendly and a very accommodating host. Clean accommodations in a quiet area, with a spacious and idyllic backyard and within a short driving distance to the beach. The goal of my vacation was to sleep in and relax and that is exactly what I got.      
Our family has booked a couple of apartments and houses on Airbnb, but never with a live-in host. The arrangement was well organized from the beginning to the end: the day before my flight, Andrea contacted me to inquire about my travel plans to ensure I could easily access the house. She was very easy to reach during the entire trip. 
The house was clean, I had everything I needed and more: when I went to the beach, Andrea offered her beach chair, a sun-umbrella, and some useful info about beach parking. If I wanted my vacation to be active, I didn't have to go far: she has several bikes and a kayak + a river/pond at the end of her property (and probably more stuff if you ask).
On my first night and then morning, I was too lazy to get out of the house for take out, dine-in or grocery shopping. So Andrea graciously offered her supplies. 
I would say throughout my entire stay, Andrea was caring and attentive but without being intrusive. 
I am a very social person, so when we both were in the house, I would inevitably strike a conversation. Instead of staying at a stranger's house, it kind of felt like I was visiting a friend: we ended up celebrating Christmas together, she showed me around Naples and we frequently had dinners together and watched TV in the evenings sharing many stories and laughs. 
I would definitely recommend this accommodation to a friend and if I travel to Naples again, I know where I will be staying =)   
 "

2020-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Place is well situated. Short drive to shops, downtown, beach, highways. Lots of convenience items offered by host (we even got a small cooler for our day trips). Beautiful backyard / garden setting. Convenient bar fridge in room. Friendly cats. Space does not have a separate entrance as outlined in post and the TV required app accounts to access programming. Friendly and helpful host, but feels a bit more like living in someone's home vs. feeling ""at home""."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay in a super clean home with a sun lit pool. Enjoyed the host and her kindness, the cool breeze and son in the bedroom and eating on the lanai. Easy drive into town and near the botanical gardens. Great way to visit Florida"

We were visiting Everglades NP and her place is convenient for visiting the western part of the everglades. Andrea made it easy for us to check-in - we arrived late night and were still able to check-in without any issues. Andrea's house is well planned with a fabulous backyard - she takes pride in setting up her place and it shows as many thoughtful touches. She also gave us good tips on places to visit nearby. All in all, it was a very good stay for us."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Keith was excellent to communicate with allowing for early check in. Everything was as described. The home was very clean and nicely upgraded to modern standards; practically a new home. Keith stayed in touch to make sure all was good but left us alone once he knew we were all tucked in. The location was very close to upscale amenities and restaurants. We would definitely recommend to others and would definitely stay again should we have the need.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this house! We had an amazing stay. The hosts were super responsive and helpful. Any issues we had (our umbrella broke) they took care of right away. The house had all the appliances we needed for our one year old (high chair, pack and play etc) it was our first trip with our baby so we were super nervous but having a house with everything we needed made it so much easier! It was an amazing experience and we had a wonderful time! The backyard is beautiful too and a perfect place to relax."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stay at a lot of Airbnb’s and find that so many of them lack essentials like can openers or even baking sheets.

From the ambiance of the fireplace and the massive TV in the living room perfect for socializing and watching a weekend of football, we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay. We enjoyed being so close to the ocean, we watched sunset with the host’s provided beach chairs and a glass of wine every night.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful stay for our sister’s getaway in Naples. Mary’s lovely condo was perfectly situated in the resort for privacy and quiet, a corner unit nestled in a lush, tropical setting with scenic walkways. We loved having breakfast on the lanai with its pretty garden view, listening to the birds and rustling palms. It was a charming stroll to the pool over raised boardwalks, and the tennis / pickleball courts were just around the bend, yet out of earshot. This was the height of the busy season but it never felt crowded or noisy. There was plenty of parking just outside the door, and we loved riding the included bikes to the beach. We appreciated the cleanliness and easy comfort of this well-furnished and appointed unit, including the comfortable beds. The location is a perfect starting point for exploring all of Naples.
Mary proved to be a super responsive and thoughtful host and I highly recommend her beautiful home."

Mary was so thoughtful, prior to us going she ordered a padded mattress cover as she knew late in pregnancy I would need it. 10/10 recommend Mary for any relaxing stay!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot inside of a larger resort. I really appreciated how much care Mary put into making the home useful and comfortable.

For me this was more of a work trip, but Mary made it easy to get some recreation in too."

The accommodation has a beautiful garden view, but a bit far from the pool.
Mary clearly explained that there will be a noise from construction (which wasn’t too bad) but we didn’t know the patio is not accessible (there are signs on the patio doors)
Great place for a family stay!"

The place is spacious enough for and offered a comfortable king size bed and did have a pair of murphy beds in the sunroom.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house was very clean, in a good area where everything is close by and Mary is a good host who responds to the guest's concerns."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thanks
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place is a very comfortable home away from home. She provides most everything you'd need for your stay. Space was clean and very inviting, unlike your average hotel. Ground floor, end unit made for easy access and a quiet setting. A short 10 minute drive to the best beaches in Naples!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Host is awesome! She gets 5 Stars all the way! We had some noise one evening coming from 2nd floor at building by the courts. It was a loud, but small crowd. It started outside and then ended up on a 2nd floor balcony. Sounded like a group of several young folks on balcony really having a good time, but we did not come there for all that noise. Plus it is against the rules at Park Shore. There are quiet hours. This place was very quiet and peaceful... It was resolved by police/security fairly quickly as expected. I called the front desk about the noise 1st, but they were NO help. Front desk stated that someone else had complained about the noise too. It was not just us. They referred me to the local Police which I hated to call, but I guess someone had to... Not sure why someone would think it was okay to be that loud at a place like that. It was after 11pm before they got quiet. You could hear them thru the walls and windows even with our tv on.... We tried to ignore it. The condo was very organized, clean and had everything we needed. Hot tub was very small. Pool was crowded. Check in was easy. Again, the Host was awesome. She even gave us a few bucks off for our trouble, but it was NO fault of hers that we had an issue."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place, the apartment was clean and cozy."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mary is the absolute best hostess ever!!! Her place is AWESOME and is very well kept! It is stocked with everything you would need! The only thing I was bummed about was I tried to make a smoothie and when I turned on the blinder it didn’t work, which is not Mary’s fault at all, someone just didn’t inform her that the broke it and it should have been replaced with a new one from whomever broke it in my opinion!
The place was super clean, has a nice size pool, great restaurant on the premises, literally at the pool!! It has like 5 gas BBQ grills also right next to the pool!! The front desk guest attendants are super nice and very helpful!! It is only like 5 to 10 min from 2-3 different beaches! Naples beach was beautiful!!
When on a tight budget like I was this place is reasonably priced and absolutely worth staying at! We absolutely give Mary and her place 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠!!
Thank you for everything Mary! You made my kids and my vacation full off nothing but good memories that we will hold onto forever! Your the best!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay loved it
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s condo is a gem of a place. It is located in a desirable location near the white sanded Clam Pass state park. We came in when the tropical storm Elsa was about to pass by so not much of beach action. However, we were there to visit our friends too so not all was lost. Because of that, we spent a bit more time at the condo and it was a comfortable place to ride out the storm. Quiet neighbors, comfy beds, two clean bathrooms and full kitchen to prepare meals. This is a cozy home away from home. I am glad Mary was able to share the place. Highly recommended this condo!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and close to great restaurants and bars. Definitely a place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was clean and very convenient. Mary was quick to answer any questions we had and was kind enough to know that we were able to check in early so we had more time to enjoy beautiful Naples! Thanks Mary!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Condo was great the and the amenities that come with the condo are wonderful for a day at the beach. Mary communicated very well. My wife even left a pair of shorts in the beach chair and we were able to go back and get them from the lobby several days later.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location, very clean home, communicative host. Highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is wonderful and the bikes are a great addition. Mary is a superhost, she has a great Naples guide that is perfect for a family with kids. The location of the condo is the best with a nice outside patio overlooking the beautiful garden. We loved it and cannot wait to go back!!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mary. Your place was great. Excellent location. The complex's amenities are top notch. Pool, restaurant, lobby, etc. all the best. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, spacious and centralized to Naples beaches, shopping, dining, nightlife, etc. This was our first trip to the Naples area and we were able to cross lots of activities off our to-do list by staying here. A short drive down to both the Marco Island and Everglades areas. We were happy to find paper products and laundry supplies already provided when we arrived. We enjoyed the resort pool & amenities as well. Friendly staff on-site, and Mary was very helpful throughout our stay! Definitely recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Everything was super clean and comfortable. We loved eating on our lanai and having a washer & dryer in the unit. The kitchen was fully stocked to cook meals at home. We also enjoyed using the beach chairs and umbrella for our beach days. I would have appreciated larger beach towels that could fit my whole body laying down, but it's not a huge deal. Also, the fitness center at the resort was disappointing and I would disregard it as an amenity--most of the cardio equipment was broken and unusable. This isn't the fault of our Airbnb host, this was an issue with the resort where the condo is located.
The resort is beautiful and has a calming and relaxing atmosphere with lots of water features and wildlife. The nights were quiet and peaceful. We also thoroughly enjoyed Hogfish Harry's, the restaurant on the resort. Also, communication with our host was excellent. Mary was so helpful to answer our questions quickly. Overall we would both love to stay here again and we want to move to Naples because we love it so much!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mary's place is very clean and the pictures are an accurate representation of the space. Some of the decor and furniture has been updated/upgraded. This was our first trip with our 5-month-old son and Mary was not only great with quickly answering my questions as it related to details I needed to know to prepare for a trip with such a young child, but she was kind enough to leave some baby gear for us to use! We found that having a full kitchen-- with all the utensils, dishes, pots, pans etc.-- really came in handy so we weren't having to schlep the baby and necessary gear to restaurants for 3 meals a day. We also found the in-unit washer and dryer very handy. The couch was very comfy and we really enjoyed the screened-in porch. Each morning we sipped on a cup of coffee and listened to the birds chirping in the trees. The foliage outside of the porch was indeed lush, beautiful and full of life. The complex that this unit is in is a little aged but it seems to be well-kept with no issues. The location is great: you are walking distance to Publix grocery, Walgreens, several restaurants, the beach, some ponds and canals. All in all, we were really comfortable at Mary's place. Thanks!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I stayed at Mary's condo for 8 days. It was a great vacation. The location is excellent. We walked to the beach, restaurants and grocery store. The condo and resort are as described. It is a private quiet area of the resort. The beach chairs, cooler, and umbrella were a great addition. We have already started planning our stay for next year."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"New owner Mary could not be more responsive. The location (and on the first floor) is superb. Sitting on the lanai and looking at the lush view is priceless.
The king size bed is very comfortable. The layout of the condo is perfect. Everyone at the front desk is pleasant and helpful.
I rate the entire experience 10/10."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Mary was as good of a host as you could ever ask. She immediately reached out after our booking, was responsive if we had questions thorough out our visit and had the place outfitted perfectly. This year we stayed for 3 week and are hoping to stay with her again next season. Park Shore Resort is a hidden gem in Naples.
An absolute pleasure."

The house was spotless, perfectly located and had everything we needed (pool/beach towels, beach chairs and umprellas, kitchen tools, etc). All of the bedrooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean making i t a perfect stay for my family. The pool was incredible, we didn't want to get out! There are beaches, restaurants and grocery stores very close to the house. Keith was a responsive host and was able to accommodate a late check out, which we really appreciated!
We would love to stay in this beautiful home again on our next trip to Naples!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was hands down the best airbnb experience I’ve ever had.

I 100% would recommend booking here. I definitely will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Keith is a very responsive host and very friendly
Great home, great location, quiet street but close to beach. The house was clean and full of natural light. Everything is brand new. Only one negative comment, the windows in the bedrooms needs blackouts.
Would definitely stay here again!"
