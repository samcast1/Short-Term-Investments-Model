2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Wife’s parents live near Tupelo so we wanted to stay somewhere close to visit them plus have a quiet vacation.
We had a very enjoyable time. The Apiary home and property are beautiful and secluded…yet within 10-15 mins of everything. My wife and I enjoyed interacting with the animals, having morning coffee on the front porch with the friendly roosters and relaxing out at the pond.
The crowing rooster and symphonic buzz of the Cicadas added to the calm, peaceful setting.
Justin is a great host, I highly recommend staying here. Thank you for having us and we’d definitely come back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Justin's house is simply stunning! Our blues band pulled in late after a show in Memphis and he left the lights on and made it easy to get in. In the morning after a great night's sleep, we walked outside to find a beautiful pond, donkeys to pet, and gorgeous scenery to enjoy our coffee. Inside, the house was clean and so comfortable! There is no doubt that we'll stay here again should our travels take us through Tupelo!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great location with a beautiful hobby farm. We were left a dozen farm-fresh eggs and the house was a great location. You should be aware that the half bath is located outside by the pond.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely beautiful and peaceful place. Responsive Host and Great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place. Large property with farm animals
2024-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place don’t get me wrong but we did find bed bugs and was very upset we couldn’t use the beds
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. A very unique place and the fishing was great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience! Such a beautiful home!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our short stay at The Apiary. Our group had so much fun loving on and feeding the animals, sitting by a fire near the lake, swinging on the porch swing, and playing the piano and the games that were provided. The home was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The upper level was a perfect space for our group of teens. Justin and Laura Beth were excellent hosts and responded quickly when we had a question. It was an overall great experience and we definitely hope to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Justin’s farmhouse is a great getaway place for privacy, outdoor activities and fun for the kids. Kids had a great fun at the pond and with interacting with the farm animals sheep donkey, chicken/roosters. Our almost 4 year old child ￼loved the playground area and man-made swing. Justin was great. He answered all the questions immediately. When we forgot something valuable, he made sure to find it right away to get back to us :)"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place was awesome for me & my groomsmen the night before my wedding .
I would DEFINTELY recommend"
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,"This farm house is very adorable. I needed a private, relaxing location to serve as a home away from home while we dealt with a death in the family. It was perfect. The property is secluded from the surrounding area and other homes, so once you arrive you feel as if you have escaped to a private get away. The animals are a lovely distraction. A walk around the pond is a good daily exercise. The fire pit was nice a warm during this late January stay. My only reservation is the bathroom situation: There is only one bedroom with an attached bath. The other bath is very small and a stand alone to be shared with the rest of the house. So, just make sure that works for your group. Lastly, my Dad wants to go back and try fishing in the pond, as he didn't bring a pole this trip. He loved it. Thanks Justin!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Loved, Loved, Loved the Farm! spent the wknd there for my daughter's 30 birthday and it's so beautiful! so peaceful! Will definitely book again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Justin and Laura were excellent hosts. We bought a fire starter and fire log for the fire pit by the lake, as well as a wonderful bottle of wine that we’re waiting for us upon check in. They were very responsive and were helpful with anything we needed. The house was pristine, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinner. Our favorite thing we’re the animals! There was food available to feed the roosters, chickens, donkeys, goats, and sheep. You don’t need an alarm set on your phone, because the sweet roosters will let you know when it’s time to wake up by hanging around the front door or windows and singing us a good morning song - we thought it was hilarious! It was close to town, but still isolated and private to enjoy time together. We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place to meet with family. We enjoyed visiting with the animals and cooking together in the big open living area. The dining table is perfect for a big dinner or playing board games.
The only issue is that the check in is on the later side, check out is on the earlier side, and the chore list is on the longer side.
We’d stay with a big group again!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely gorgeous property! We had our family Thanksgiving here because we’ve moved out of state and we no longer fit in a smaller kitchen. This was perfect and everyone had a great time. The house is stocked very well to prepare a meal and house a large group. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful home with a great layout
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Justin’s place is amazing and we will definitely be back! It’s conveniently located to all things in Tupelo, but has the feel of privacy on the farm. We absolutely loved it and Justin was a fantastic host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was nice and tidy. It was just as the description said. My kids loved the playground and the animals. Had to go to both every morning before leaving. It fit our family of 5 great.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family of 8 plus 2 grandchildren want to come back to Justin’s Farm. We made great family memories. The farm exceeded everyone’s expectations. Justin was great!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,It was nice place to stay and clean
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at The Apiary! Peaceful setting with plenty of room to spread out. House was spotless - especially the bathrooms which is always a nice touch. The farm animals were all friendly, and you can’t hear them from inside of the house which was a plus for our group. 10ish minutes from Downtown Tupelo makes it a great location.
We will stay here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,House was very nice. We enjoyed our stay
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place :)
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great experience, if I return again next year for this tournament, I will be booking this location."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,What a charming little get away~my family of 12 was so comfortable here. Not one complaint except that we wished for more time to enjoy the beautiful setting!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent place! Will absolutely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,My family and I enjoyed Justin’s place. Everyone wants to return for another family vacation!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have an annual family reunion/vacation, and this year we were excited to stay at the farm which was perfect for our family of ten. The house is not only beautiful but spacious inside and out. It was perfect for what we were looking for and our exterior surroundings were peaceful and lovely with a variety of outdoor spaces to enjoy. We loved coming together in the open living/kitchen/dining areas for breakfasts, dinners, board games and/or to watch movies together. Everyone, especially the kiddos enjoyed the animals, playing outside, and fishing was a huge hit for all. Shopping/Dining/Downtown was just a short driving distance away. We enjoyed the fresh eggs and we also picked fresh berries. Blueberries for pancakes and a blueberry/blackberry pastry. Our host was very friendly, helpful and quick to respond if needed. Thank you Justin, for allowing us to create special memories together. It was truly a wonderful experience my family will never forget."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The place is just beautiful! We loved the outdoor areas where we could drink our coffe, watch the animals, and just visit. Justin was so prompt to respond to and was very accomodating with all our requests. We would definitely recommend his place and would stay there again ourselves!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The place was great and very clean. Location was close enough to town to get to everything we need yet far enough away to not be bothered. Justin came out to feed the animals and he was very friendly. My only complaint is that there are not televisions in the bedroom and the beds are full size. We were several couple and a queen size bed would have been easier to sleep. Justin was very accommodating with check in/out and the entire house was very clean. The animals are a joy to see. We loved drinking coffee and having the chickens come up to us each morning. Would 100% recommend this place to friends and family.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about our stay! The home felt like a retreat. Our children LOVED getting to feed the animals and explore the beautiful property. The home is very updated and adorable. We also really appreciated all of the local recommendations! We would love to come back and stay longer next time.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great place to stretch our legs after a long day in the van. The spaces are all decorated beautifully and you can tell a lot of thought went into making it comfortable. The kids loved the bonus room, swingset, and animals. Lots of places for people to gather and chill. Only thing I would change would be to switch the double bed for a queen, but we knew that when we booked it. We would love to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Apiary! Justin was super accommodating to me and my family as we pass through on our way to the beach. So nice and peaceful and we honestly wish we could’ve stayed longer! Definitely a beautiful property and lots to do! Would recommend to anyone and everyone!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Such a cool place! We enjoyed our quick stop in Tupelo.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our stay and recharge with Justin. The animals were super friendly and reminded us of our farm days but with simplicity. After staying in several airbnbs that didnt meet our expectations, Justin's place was a complete reset and gave us the revitalization that we needed to continue our journey across country. I would seek out his airbnb should it be available. Our family just felt free and at home."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious house! Loved the animals and property amenities"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"The place was absolutely gorgeous. It was peaceful and quiet and just like they described. The host was very responsive and polite and easy to work with. We LOVED everything about! It was a GREAT place to spend time with family a few days for my daughter’s SR high school graduation. We spent time with family from Denver, CO and Phoenix, AZ. We will most definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,👌
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great house in a great location - stocked with all you need!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem!
The home was perfect for our family of six and could comfortably accommodate more people. Justin was responsive and accommodating. Loved the local art on the walls. Beds we’re comfortable. A true oasis. Hope to visit again. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was beautiful. It had a secluded feel but was just minutes from the amazing town of Tupelo. The inside was super spacious, the yard was amazing, the farm animals were a great hit with the kids, and the stay was very comfortable. I would stay here again for sure."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! We had a large group of family members caravaning to the beach, and it was the perfect and peaceful place to stop for the night on the way and have a slow morning. Beautiful! Justin was very responsive and friendly. Would stay again."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,The location and home was just as described. Extremely clean and very comfortable. King bed was heavenly. Host was a great communicator. He even checked on us as we were running a little and turned the lights on for us. Definitely recommend for families. Only regret was we didn’t have more time here.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful home! We had our outdoor micro-wedding at this home and it was more than expected. Looks even better than the photos! The kid’s playground in the back and the adorable baby animals made it even better! The host was quick to respond and helped in more ways than 1. Be sure to bring quarters to purchase animal feed and it gives a petting zoo feel.
The perfect farmhouse! Would absolutely return if given the opportunity."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Words can’t express how beautiful your farmhouse is. I wish it was my home. I’ve never stayed anywhere like this absolutely amazing. Great fishing. Beautiful porch and anything you can ask for. I will be staying again. Thanks for giving us this amazing experience.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed in Justin’s Airbnb when we attended my grandmothers funeral. The house was clean and Justin and Laura were always available to assist us. I would recommend their home to anyone staying in Tupelo, Ms.
The Roseburgh"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We would stay again in a heart beat. My kids loved the creek, the animals and the swings. I would recommend this Air BNB to anyone who would like a quiet, restful retreat. There were 11 people in our party and it was great. My only ‘issue’ was needing another bathroom but we were well aware of this prior to booking.
I would strongly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place! I’m bummed that I traveled for work purposes so I could not utilize all the additional amenities that this place had to offer. I definitely will be back with my kiddos!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at The Apiary! It had plenty of space for our entire party. It was fully stocked with everything we needed plus more. Not to mention the beautiful farm there! Great location and we will definitely be back!!
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"The property is so fun with tons of space to explore and an opportunity to feed the farm animals! The house itself is gorgeous and spotlessly clean. We had a very minor challenge with checkout instructions that were confusing but Justin cleared it up quickly and was super helpful.
Note that there are only 2 bathrooms inside the house, the 1/2 bath is outside in a separate building."
2023-01-01,4,Group trip,We really enjoyed staying in this space. It was so cozy and comfortable. It was rainy so we didn’t get to take advantage of the outside areas. I would definitely recommend for others.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the nicest AirBNB’s we have ever stayed in! It was so spacious for our family of seven. The property was so beautiful. Our grand kids had an absolute ball playing on the playground, trampoline, saucer swing, and rope swing. They were so excited to get to feed the chickens, and goats, and to pet the sheep and donkey! When it rained, they enjoyed playing with all the games and toys in the huge upstairs bedroom/ playroom. The giant chalk board wall was their favorite activity!
We were in Tupelo for a family funeral and it was just wonderful to have a place so spacious that we could invite relatives to come out and re-connect with each other.
The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare an impromptu family meal for ourselves and extended family.
Justin was a wonderful host who was always available for anything we needed. I highly recommend The Apiary Farm to anyone who wants a uniquely perfect place to stay !"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, place as described and pictured. Could use some lighting outside for after hours arrivals, and neighbors dogs at the entrance weren’t the most inviting as 4 of them chased the car down the driveway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is great. Lots of space, really nice, and a great outdoor space. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home and awesome host!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this beautiful property. Quaint farmhouse on peaceful and private property. We loved feeding and petting the donkey, sheep and goats. House was just as advertised. The host Justin is amazing. Super responsive to questions and very detailed instructions about check in and check out. Everything went smoothly and we really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Apiary is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy family time! Justin and Laura have stocked the place well and have beautifully decorated the home. We loved the animals and the feeling of farm life. As hosts, they were super-responsive and great at providing information. We'd definitely recommend this wonderful home."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay- perfect for a large family.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Apiary is truly something special and for the price, you just can’t beat it. The home is well appointed, extremely comfortable and the farm animals in the front yard make this a must AIRbnb. Justin was very responsive to all of my communications. It was just my wife and I, but this place essentially has four separate bedrooms and can accommodate a large family. We we there for only two nights and the weather horrible with constant rain. We wished we could have enjoyed the outdoor amenities, like morning coffee on the front porch to enjoy the view of the animals. If you are visiting Tupelo, MS, look no further than The Apiary for a memorable stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this spot for a work team retreat and it was the perfect place to get away and bond as a team. It’s tucked away and a little hard to find at first but Justin was super responsive and helpful with anything that came up. The pics are very accurate. I’d definitely come back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are on the fence about staying here - DO IT!!! This was the best AirBnB experience we've ever had and we're already planning our return trip! We were just passing through for 1 night and we were so bummed we didn't have more time! We were going to extend our day and even add another night but severe weather was coming through and we didn't want to risk it. Justin was so kind and understanding and was quick to communicate during that stressful morning of us trying to figure out what to do about the storms rolling in. I appreciated his kindness and flexibility so much.
Every piece of furniture in the entire house was beyond comfortable! Once I sat down somwhere or laid in the bed I didn't want to move. They have curated and amazing space and it was classy, comfortable, and cozy all at the same time.
Bring quarters to feed the sheep, donkey, goats, and chickens!
I can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to return for a longer visit!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a perfect stay at Justin's farm!! We thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the animals, especially Olaf! The home is gorgeous, comfortable and well-stocked. I hope we can visit again in the future."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"My retreat group of six quilt makers had a lovely stay at the Apiary. Comfy beds, a quiet location and everything you need to spend some quality time with friends was available. The magic of this spot is the combination of open concept in the main part of the house, with lots of spots to get away for some quiet time. My favorite was the bed swing on the screen porch. The animals were so charming!
We are already planning a return visit - we loved it!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our second stay as much as our first. This is a beautiful and peaceful retreat, perfect to unwind at after a long day of travel. We would definitely stay here again if we pass through Tupelo."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this for our guests and they loved it!! Will definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful property with so much to do! Would absolutely come back here again. Justin was a great host and check in/out was very easy. They are extremely accommodating!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely farmhouse on a beautiful farm. Very relaxing and peaceful after a long day on the road. We would have loved to stay here for several days if we had the time. Kids loved exploring the property and collecting fresh eggs. There is a playground and a few swings to help them stretch their legs. Highly recommended.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family to relax before and after an Ole Miss game.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely home
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Our family came together to celebrate a milestone birthday and this home was the perfect setting. It is warm and inviting with plenty of space both inside and out. We were pleasantly surprised with all of the extra amenities and the overall sense of tranquility.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time I've stayed here. Both times were perfect!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Super cute house, enjoyed our stay."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is one of those places you want to share how amazing the house is but at the same time you want to keep this a secret lol.
I highly recommend this home as its perfect for family gatherings, families with children and family reunions. We stayed here for business and everyone loved the house so much they want to bring their families back to experience it.
We will return and this is the only place we will consider staying. Yes it’s that great!
Justin is an amazing host and very accommodating. We had to cancel twice before and he said no problem and welcomed us with open arms.
We can’t wait to return!"

This lovely AirBnb was equipped with everything we needed during our stay. Beds were super comfortable and the property was so quiet and spacious.. just like the pictures!
Thanks for a wonderful weekend,
We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stayed here with our family of ten and everyone really loved this property.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"AMAZING! This whole place is absolutely stunning! Justin was so accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed to make the night special for a 50th birthday celebration.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Apiary by Tulip Creek is a wonderful family get away. From toys and outdoor play gym for the kids to a variety of porches and scenic areas for adults, you are never lacking fun things to do. The artwork and culinary delights there were all from local artists, bee keepers, coffee shops and bakeries. You will not be disappointed in this lovely farm."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far my best Airbnb experience. The home is clean and well presented. The ability to have that county life with all the needed modern touches was key. Six minutes to the main strip of town and far enough to have peace of mind. In the host, you won't get one better than Justin. His dedication and attention to detail are second to none. I've already booked my stay for next three visits...think about that."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect spot for our girl's cycling trip this year! It was close to local restaurants, a mid-way to getting to the trails and Natchez Trace!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! Very private/secluded.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Be prepared to be blown away at how beautiful this house is. We can’t say enough good things about how relaxing our stay was. From the moment we walked in it was peaceful, quiet and felt like a true home away from home.
Greeted with a handwritten card, fresh chicken eggs and local coffee, this place was just what we needed to escape to. There are plenty of board games, a playground area, karaoke machine, corn hole, fire pit and other wonderful surprises to keep the kiddos busy.
Don’t search anymore! Book this place, you will not regret it!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t do the house justice. It is beautiful and spotless. So much space in the house and on the property. The hosts responds super quick.Will definitely stay here again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had the best time at the farm! The house is so tastefully decorated and so comfortable. It really is a refreshing escape. It was also conveniently only 10 minutes from the grocery store. Our favorite activity was walking the grounds and visiting with the animals. We have stayed in air bnbs in many different states and countries and this one was one of our absolute favorites. We will be back!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,A must book gem. I loved everything about our stay. The hosts made sure to add little details to make our stay special. They have done a wonderful job decorating the interior and outside there was many options of entertainment as well. Will stay here again!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"These are EXCELLENT hosts. We had my daughter's 16th birthday celebration here with nine teenage girls who drive 3 hours for a concert in Tupelo. The house is close enough to all the activities yet has a total retreat feel to it. The house itself was decorated in a way that made all the girls see that care was given to details, the beds were comfortable, the amenities are just what was needed and the hosts were in full communication and super supportive. An excellent choice!!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,The best Airbnb we've stayed in! The perfect spot for our girls weekend. Such attention to detail in decor and amenities. Wonderful book and game selection. The property is beautiful. And farm fresh eggs in the morning?! So great! The property was private and secluded but also close enough to things to do. Forklift was our fav dinner spot. Thanks for hosting Emilee and Brandon - we’d love to stay again!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,This was absolutely one of the best airbnb experiences I've had so far. Everything was super easy and there were several small touches that really made this experience great. I would 100% stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emilee and Brandons place is an absolute dream! It was so quiet and relaxing and made my country girl heart so happy. Definitely one of the best AirBnbs we have ever been to and we were sad we could only stay one night. We definitely plan to come back sometime when we have more time to take it all in.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Extremely quiet and peaceful! Definitely worth it. Huge area especially if you have kids! I have 3 little boys 6,3,1 they really enjoyed all the space especially outside!! 😊 10/10 RECOMMEND!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily has thought of everything, and we had a fantastic experience on the farm.
The house is decorated beautifully and has tons of space, both inside and out!
Emily was an outstanding communicator!
We shared this house with our family, and had a wonderful time, and we hope to come back to this home again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emilee and Brandon went out of their way to make sure I had decaf coffee to drink since I can’t have caffeine for health reasons. It was the biggest blessing. They also helped navigate our dinner choice by asking their friends what restaurants serve gluten free foods. I highly recommend this couple and their gorgeous farmhouse.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a Gem! Not only was the house beautiful and spacious but the animals made the time there feel dark idyllic. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome with a basket of fresh eggs from their chickens and a tray box from a local store. This house was well stocked with all kinds of games and all of the art on the walls was from local artists and was for sale (I bought a really cool cow picture)! I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again!
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"It's a beautiful home, and they were very thoughtful hosts. They responded quickly to any questions. We would certainly stay here in the future, and we highly recommend the farm!"

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"We made a trip over to visit with our two daughters who attend Ole Miss. We chose Tupelo because we wanted somewhere we had never visited that was convenient to Oxford. We couldn't have been happier with Emilee and Brandon's place. Clean, spacious, comfortable, relaxing, and only about 7 miles from town. Worked perfectly for our family of 5. They have done a wonderful job with this little farmhouse located in a very peaceful setting. Emilee was fantastic to work and communicate with. Would most certainly visit again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had so much fun during our stay at Sonny Creek! The house was so cozy and clean, and the kids had a BLAST running around outside. Such a peaceful location while still being close to Tupelo amenities. A perfect, refreshing getaway!"

Though the area surrounding the area is a mix of commercial and industrial, the street on which the house is located is quaint and welcoming. The house is clean and as described in the listing. As noted, it is within walking distance of downtown, with restaurants, coffee shops, bakery etc. The location is convenient to everything! Ample off-street parking was a plus! We liked the open floor plan with kitchen, dining area and living room all together in one space. The beds were comfortable and we slept well at the end of our days exploring the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rebecca's place was FABULOUS! What a beautiful place -- we felt right at home immediately. The beds were so comfortable after the long drive. We were travelling with a baby . . . the master bedroom is very large, has a terrific bathroom, and is at the back of the house so it was easy to give the young man and his mom their own space. Rebecca was so easy to communicate with about the details of our stay. For a dreamy stay in historic Tupelo neighborhood, choose this place! I wish this was a regular stop on my travels!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca’s place is quiet, peaceful and feels just like home. I have enjoyed my stay so much while I’ve been here. I am a nurse and worked night shift, so I slept during the day. The master bedroom was dark enough for me to sleep comfortably. It was also 5 minutes from the hospital which was wonderful. Rebecca was kind enough to provide me with an early check in per request and an extended stay last minute! The next time I pick up a shift at Tupelo, I will stay at Rebecca’s place.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was the best host of anyone I’ve ever stayed with in an Air BB. Her place is exactly what we needed but she went way above and beyond to accommodate our schedule.

She had coffee, chips, snacks for us to enjoy and I can’t say enough about the house. The beds were outstanding. This house has a master somewhat separated and we loved that!! Everything couldn’t have been more perfect!!! Thank you and we WILL be back!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Rebecca was awesome. Due to unfortunate events I needed to rent something quickly and 3 hotel rooms just wasn't right for me. Long story short my brother originally needed brain surgery in Tupelo but the morning of we decided to take my brother home to pass in peace. I reached out to Rebecca because we were checking out a day early and I needed to know what I need to do before leaving. She told me to just leave because I had enough to deal with. Our one night was awesome and I'm very grateful for her getting back to me within a matter of minutes even though she had 24 hours to do so. Definitely would stay there again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house to stay in! Clean, spacious, comfortable bed!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Very spacious and extremely comfortable beds. Nice high-quality linens and towels. Very convenient and nice Kroger grocery store just down the street less than 5 minutes.
We had a little hiccup checking in, Airbnb had given us the wrong door code however Rebecca was able to quickly get us the correct code.
There was also a hiccup with the cleaning service, the he r bathtub wasn’t cleaned and there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Thankfully the bedding and towels were fresh and clean. The owner was very apologetic and gave us a credit for the cleaning fee."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very clean well appointed house! You will want for nothing staying here. The value here is exceptional.

I can highly recommend it."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Such a great experience at this lovely house in Tupelo. We loved the historic cottage look and feel of their quaint house.

Great communication and so many thoughtful touches (dum dums, snacks, coffee, restaurant recommendations, Mississippi decor, etc.) to make us feel welcome. Great, updated space. Master suite is huge! Again, so pleased with our experience….would definitely return!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This was a great place to stay for our family. Plenty of room. Rebecca provided excellent communication during our stay.

A very welcoming, spacious and comfortable place to rest while we were traveling. She was very responsive and kind to us. We were traveling with a 4 and 1 year old and the house had plenty of room for them to stretch their legs for the night. I couldn’t recommend this stay enough if traveling through Tupelo! The master bathroom alone is something to note… promise! :) We even got to catch a cool lightning storm while sitting on the front porch. It was a great experience all around. Thank you endlessly, Rebecca!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We couldn’t have asked for a better stay while traveling through town. The home is charming and spacious! It was my mother-in-laws first Airbnb stay and she absolutely loved it. Some have mentioned the noise of the train. I can say we didn’t hear it one time at night. Rebecca provided us with sound machines as she knew we had three kids under 6. THIS IS THE PLACE TO STAY IN TUPELO!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is in an older neighborhood but the interior has been extensively rehabbed and upgraded. It is beautifully decorated, as the listing photos show. Everything was very clean. We have stayed in a different Airbnb in this neighborhood before so we knew about the train being in close proximity, but we slept through it because we were so worn out from Fourth of July weekend festivities. If you have kids in your group, definitely check out the fountain at Fair Park and the playground there. Walmart neighborhood market is very close by for groceries.
Rebecca was kind enough to contact me about an item we left behind and she’s mailing it to me!"

This home is beautifully decorated, wonderfully clean and has a huge bathtub to soothe all our moving, or whatever, stresses you.

We will definitely stay here again next year!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what can i say! i do not like to leave reviews as i had a person write a bad and wrong review about me in the past, however this place was so welcoming it felt wrong not to. this home is quaint and lovely. the owners even had a christmas tree lit up when we arrived. the beds and linen were clean and soft and the kitchen was well appointed. my family and i thoroughly enjoyed our time there. beautiful home"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"really nice house, well worth the stay"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We decided to stay and Ken and Helen's cottage as we were in town to go to the Ole Miss game. Nice that you can check in by 2 pm. another huge plus for my son and myself was the park is literally across the street, and we played a lot of catch with the football. the place is on a busy road with a stop light, so there is a lot of traffic that you hear, but you are close to everything. just minutes from Downtown. we had a great time, and we love Tupelo and its history. I hope someday we finally get to move there. As for the house, it is 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a really cool split shower with a slider door and laundry on the otherside it's pretty cool and clever. The kitchen was very good as well. We had a wonderful time, and Ken and Helen were wonderful hosts and lived just a few houses down. we can't wait to come back to Tupelo next year!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying in this adorable cottage! Everything was beautiful and very clean!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful stay. Loved the decor and mood of the home, so creative and relaxing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved our stay here. They’ve made this historic bungalow look and feel amazing. The decor, extra towels and blankets were a nice touch.
The only extras I’d personally would have loved was maybe a grill outside and more cooking essentials in general. (You will need to buy these things if you plan to host a small gathering and cook.) We have family in the area, so that option would be a lovely addition. However, Parkside was perfection even without those things."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cutest little cottage and close to downtown and plenty of room for me and the kids! Thank you Ken and Helen! We enjoyed our stay!

It’s an older home updated to PERFECTION! Charming isn’t even the word. You can tell they poured their heart and soul in to making this cottage comfortable, cozy, and beautiful. I love the interactive personal touches inside, but I can’t give them away in the review - you must find out for yourself!"

We stayed in Tupelo to visit with family and the location was perfect. I can’t say enough of how quaint and inviting this home was to stay in for our family!

The only problem that I had with my stay, which was not of the host’s control, was a random lady knocking on the door begging for food.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Place was convenient and attractive. It was basically one room with a bath. Negatives were, no private space and low on amenities. Booked as a romantic get -a -way, but no glasses, wine glasses or corkscrew. John was very responsive to our needs and I am sure he will have these basics for his next guests."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The stay was fine. Nothing crazy fancy, but charming. It is relatively quiet, until about 3-4pm when the children get home from school. The bed is comfy, tv is nice. WiFi’s a little weird sometimes but that could be the weather. Other than that, very nice."

Definitely didn’t ruin our stay since the place was so nice :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is very nice and everything inside is exactly as described. Nice touches with snacks during the stay.

2023-03-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Out of all my stays at a property, I gave this review much thought. Thank you John for offering this place most of all, but these words are for future guests.
If you are travelling with a pet, or you require 1st floor access, this place is a perfect. Otherwise there are many other options that will probably meet your needs at a more reasonable price.
Improvements here must include better bedding and pillows, plus cleaning of the towels so that they are not sour. My wife's allergies flared up and left as early as possible the next day, as we could not identify the source.
Think of this stay as more of a motel and you will not be disappointed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute spot for a quick getaway I would love to come back soon.

2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a quiet place to rest after a long day of traveling, don’t stay here on a Saturday night. It’s located behind a popular restaurant/bar that has a live band on weekends. It was a nice place with minimum furnishings. Includes a microwave, mini fridge and coffee maker along with sweet treats and two bottles of water."

My husband and I were in town for the loss of my mom and needed a place to stay for a few of the nights here and it was super last minute. The condo was ready within the hour. The photos were accurate with extra toiletries and snacks provided (life savers!). The evenings were quiet, the mornings were a more lively as the surrounding residents are getting ready for work. Just a heads up if you’re a light sleeper. All in all, a wonderful stay and we are so grateful and blessed to have found this AirBnb."

It was so cute and cozy, very well renovated. It was in a great area and easy to find. My kids found a little bucket of toys and it was a life save after our 5.5 hour drive. If we had more time to spend in Tupelo, we would have loved to stay here longer, but it was absolutely perfect for what we needed!"

The area is quiet & peaceful. I’d definitely stay again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute cozy little house! Police training center right behind house and they seemed to be there at night and in the morning so that makes you feel safe!!! We stayed one night but I would definitely stay more in this house. Everything you need and I’m someone that is huge on how a place smells. As soon as you open the door it smells amazing!!! There was a book on the kitchen counter that I enjoyed reading also!

We were able to get every place we had planned very easily. Great place"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but it was the perfect spot to rest after a concert in Southaven. Very clean, well stocked with everything you should need. We enjoyed our short stay and would stay here again. The only thing that I think should be mentioned is that there is a police training facility very near by and by 8am you could hear their target practice and tons of cop cars speeding out of the road near the house. It didn't bother me too much but some people may get nervous or scared hearing gunshots constantly."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,new and clean
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The beds were comfortable (super important for me). The layout of the house is great. Everything felt new and fresh, yet cozy and homey at the same time. It's a little off the beaten path, and there's a shooting range nearby that had activity in the early morning, but that didn't bother me and I'd absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, and a home away from home! Our favorite place to stay when we pass through Tupelo."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb stay and I wasn't sure what to expect. The place was great. Far better than any motel or hotel I have ever stayed in. The house was clean, in a quiet safe neighborhood and a peaceful setting. In town but out of the rat race. The house is within 10 minutes or less of good places to eat. Lori is a great host. I will try to stay with Lori the next time I am in town. The house has a nice deck with chairs and a table. You won't go wrong staying at this place. The house came with coffee and the feeling of home. Lori is a great host. What more could I ask for? Nothing as it was a great stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful house with a large yard in a peaceful setting. Everything about this house is warm and welcoming.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Lori's was peaceful and comfortable. While we only stayed one night on our way through town, the home was clean inviting, and very comfortable. We didn't really use the kitchen much, bit it looked well stocked, beds and furniture were comfy. we also were able to do a drive by of Elvis' home since it was only about 2.5 miles away. Lori was communicative and pleasant. She offered local suggestions. We would definitely stay here again if we're came back to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We love the Honey House! Our favorite place to stay in Tupelo.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lori's place was great. Confortable and homey. Easy to find. Communication was good. We enjoyed our stay.

Lori was wonderful and responsive to any questions or concerns I had. she was professional and friendly. the house is bee-autiful! 🐝"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lori’s Honeycomb Hideout in Tupelo is the perfect secluded vibe. No worries, this home is as pictured and fully equipped. I love that Lori had a map on the wall for visitors to mark where we have traveled from. It was cool to see all but 5 🇺🇸 states with a pin them. 10/10."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was awesome, it was close to where I needed to be! It was peaceful and beautiful overall! If you’re looking to visit the Tupelo area, I definitely recommend Lori’s place!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent home, excellent service. Great experience and convenience for what my travel was for."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Really liked the house. Super cute. Feels right at home. Love the wrap around little porch deck. Hot water was amazinggggg. The only weird thing is it’s right next to a law enforcement training facility. And you hear shooting and gunfire literally allllll day long. Loved the stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was delighted with this cute little house, which perfectly fit my needs when I was in Tupelo visiting friends and also working remotely. The house is clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable. Lori responded promptly to a few questions that I had.
The house is in a primarily residential area, but it should be noted that it's near a law enforcement training center and sometimes during the daytime hours I could hear shots from the police shooting range. The house is far enough away so that it wasn't loud and it didn't bother me, and I note it only for those people who might be sensitive to that kind of noise.
I definitely plan to stay at The Tupelo Honey House again the next time I visit Tupelo."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Home away from home airbnb. Decor was stylish with plenty of room to relax. We loved the style of the home. Nice personal touch by Loti for giving us some honey to enjoy during our stay. . A really great airbnb and host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage was perfect! It was cozy, clean, and private. It had everything we needed and was very comfortable. Definitely a place we would stay at again if we were in the area."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"adorable house, very clean,"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying at this super cozy and quiet cottage and highly recommend the Tupelo Honey House. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen is ready for any cooking you may want to tackle. We were just minutes from downtown and good restaurants. Lori is a wonderful hostess and had just what you need for a one night stay to a 30 day stay, if needed. We plan to stay again next time we come through Tupelo."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Honey House was he perfect getaway for us!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very great responsive host. She left us honey! Yummy! And chocolate! Very cozy place. I came here from Alabama for a place to stay traveling. It is very close to Elvis’s birthplace which is cool. However, I give the location rating a four as it was right in front of a police training range and we kept hearing gun fire. Place had tide pods for us to use. Thank you! 🙏 overall I really really really enjoyed the stay but some nitpicks: no oven mits to take hot pan out of oven, place doesn’t really have three beds. It has one bed in the master bedroom, then a couch like bed in the other room. And other the couch type bed, it had roll away mattress that sat low to the ground. It has three mattresses, not beds. Also the deck is dry rotted in one place and my friend fell through it, which is a safety concern. Please get that fixed. Also no towel rack in bathroom. But very little nitpicks I loved staying here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The most precious home and kindest hosts! We felt right at home and loved being so close to downtown Tupelo. This home exceeded our expectation and we can’t wait to book our next stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay with Lori, the house was so beautiful! Small, perfect for a couple! Loved the little extras like the dominoes, puzzles, and games! Would definitely recommend the Honey House to anyone looking for a cute little place to stay! Hope to stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"what a lovely house. the kitchen is wonderful, we didn't cook anything, too tired of driving all day, but I really liked the kitchen. nice house and very comfortable and quiet. Lori is a wonderful host and messaged me to make sure we didn't have any trouble unlocking the front door. I highly recommend this home away from home. A. Dickens"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot for us to stay....travelled to Gulf shores from St Louis and Lori's place was about halfway so we spent one night.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I did not get to stay at Lori’s due to inclement weather. She had messaged me and advised that the roads were icy and probably not safe leading to the rental. I appreciate a host willing to forgo a profit in order to look after the safety of the guests. While I cannot comment on the actual rental I would recommend booking with her based off her being a decent human.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Can’t wait to stay at Lori’s place again. Super cozy and clean.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice cozy place- super cute kitchen. Electric fireplace was a nice touch for a cool evening

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was just as described. It was clean, comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. Although we only stayed one night traveling home, we would love to come back and explore Tupelo! I would highly recommend this lovely spot!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed here with our two pups and had a great experience. Everything was super clean and comfortable.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Tupelo Honey House was a cute little bungalow with easy access off Interstate 22 and just a few minutes into the city of Tupelo. I loved that it was just a few minutes from Veteran’s Park, which is a good place to get some exercise and give my dog a run.
The house was immaculate, well stocked with necessities, comfy bed, nice linens….exactly as described. Lori was a gracious host and a clear communicator. I loved the place and hope to return the next time I’m visiting Tupelo."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Loved the Tupelo Honey theme. The home was renovated, very clean, while keeping aligned with the rustic charm of the area. I liked that it was in a neighborhood with a semi rural feel and also really close to town amenities. There was a neat collection of games and a sweet children’s book. I felt very cozy and adored this stay"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tupelo Honey is adorable and Lori is so easy to work with. This is our 4th time staying in this little home and it is perfect! We stayed on the way to our Thanksgiving trip and on the way back as it is a half way point for our family. In between stays, Lori had the Christmas decorations put up. It was so joyful to arrive and the kids see the little Christmas tree in the house. Tupelo Honey is so cozy, the linens and beds are comfy, and the decor is chic and timeless! We will continue to return because we always feel we get even more than what we pay for. Love that there are always coffee pods and creamer ready for us, bottled water in the fridge and a little Tupelo happy from Lori's family. I save all the little cards from her! Stay in this home if you are passing through or make a point to come check out this adorable home and this precious Southern town. Tupelo Honey is well managed, well cared for and packed with AirBnB perks!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the Tupelo Honey House for just 1 night as we were passing through on our way to the beach, but would 100% stay again. The house was so cute and clean! Just a short drive to a huge park to walk our dogs, Elvis’ house and Tupelo’s Main Street for dinner and coffee. Do not hesitate to book!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lori’s place was amazing! A real Gem! Comfortable, quiet, great kitchen with candy and honey gifts! Washer & Dryer in laundry room just off the kitchen was a real plus!! My German Shepherd Dog and I stayed two nights and absolutely Loved it and Tupelo. Visited a fabulous Veterans Park which included a picturesque lake, walking path, children’s playground and more. Elvis’s Birthplace was so much better than expected. Tupelo is so friendly. Definitely a gem! I hope I get back this way!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lori’s house is very cute and comfortable. Perfect for small family and pet friendly. Very clean and had everything we needed.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a neat, small, private home in a great and peaceful area. It's a small drive beside the heart of Tupelo, so you can access whatever you'd like with ease (I like that a gas station store was only 4 minutes away! But you wouldn't know it by the tree-full surroundings!)
The place itself is simple and neat. Very easy to access and get comfortable. Don't hesitate to book a stay here. It's worth it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lori's place was wonderful. The kids loved the extra goodies and toys. This was our 2nd stay and we will plan to stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second time staying at Lori’s. This time I was with my two young children and dogs. It was the perfect space for us, quiet but still close enough to town to easily grab food and entertainment. It’s small, but the living area is bright and open. I’ve enjoyed both of my stays and plan to book again in the future."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time. Kitchen and overall house was great, exactly what we were looking for. The couch was very uncomfortable and worn down. At times felt it maybe about to break. The master bed was on wheels and was very shocking when you lean against it for the first time. The head board to the bed was also very loose and would hit the wall with any movement at all in the bed. Over all the house was great and we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Lori’s place is so cute and nice. We have a 100 year old house so I loved the character of the home with pocket doors and antiques. Lori also left thoughtful snacks and a well equipped home.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lori's place is exactly how described, and in a perfect location! It was quiet, dark and comfortable, and I would absolutely make a return visit. Veteran Memorial Park and the Elvis Birth Place are very close. This is a must stay in Tupelo. Thanks Lori!!"

I definitely recommend staying here!"

This was awesome and we fully recommend it!"

The house itself was immaculate, with two bottled waters in the fridge, and a thank you note with Tupelo honey sitting out on the kitchen counter. Our pets were also welcome, with two dog bowls awaiting. The back porch, patio, and private back yard was an oasis for the pets and us. Moreover, on our second night we experienced a power outage and Lori was quick to respond. She offered us many options and kept us informed of the situation. We would gladly stay at this home again in the future. Highly recommend!"

Thank you again Lori!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful home to stay in and we felt welcomed by the host from our first connection.
The home is beautifully up to date with every possible amenity. Our stay was a refreshing pit stop from a long road trip. The beds were comfortable, the shower felt like a spa and having a wonderful laundry machine and dryer to do laundry was a big bonus.
We enjoyed reading by the sweet little ""fireplace"" from the books local to Mississippi and Tupelo. It felt like we were home and was hard to leave!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was just looking for a midway point for a regular 16 hour drive I do twice a year. It was super quiet and comfy. Also right off the interstate, will definitely stay there again and recommend family looking for a nice spot to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved my stay at Lori’s home. This cute house is the perfect for two. The location is unbeatable. It was so quiet and peaceful. A great getaway if you’re in the city in search for some solitude. The area makes for a beautiful walk. Lori gave us a ton of great recommendations and she was super friendly. She’s very responsive. Easiest check-in process ever. I totally recommend Lori’s place. I wouldn’t pick another place in Tupelo!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning house ... very nice and comfy
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Honey house was perfect for our one night stay in Tupelo. Would definitely stay again if back in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When you get a pack of starbursts and share it with a friend, admit it, you keep just a few more pink starbursts for yourself. Not Lori. Her counter featured a candy jar filled with pink starbursts. The “honey house” is filled with all kinds of pink starbursts: the small jar of honey left on the counter, the quality soap in the bathroom, the thoughtful decor touches…. The attention to detail in the house and host’s friendly communication at this AirBnB epitomize southern hospitality. This was one of the best experiences we’ve had on this app."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Comfortable and quiet. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,As described. Clean and comfortable and easy to find. Slept great!!! Thanks for hosting us!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lori’s Airbnb is one of our favorite stays to date. This Airbnb is extremely clean and cute! Lori went above and beyond recommending places to visit around town. There isn’t much of a backyard, but our dog still had plenty to explore on leash."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tupelo Honey was perfect! Lori’s space is adorable and just right. It was clean, close to the highway, but easy to get to downtown Tupelo! We loved Lori’s home, and would highly recommend it to any of our friends heading to Tupelo!
My daughter forgot her bear and Lori was quick to let me know that she’d found it and is shipping it to us!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful space! Only regret was I couldn’t stay later. Everything needed was thought of and provided, and the home was suuuuper cozy. Lori was very communicative and responsive. Would definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing find! Lori was an amazing host... very responsive, cordial, and helpful. Although pets are allowed there is no fenced in backyard, and not much of a backyard. You'll need a leash for your dogs to go outside. The home was spotless and smelled great! There is a daybed in one BR with a trundle bed underneath. We weren't able to raise it and make a king size bed, but maybe you can. We definitely got our monies worth and the nightly price is right where it should be. Thank you Lori... we will come back next time we're in town."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori’s place was one of the cleanest places I’ve ever stayed at. She is an excellent host!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loris place was the perfect place for my cross country drive. It was so home-y and cozy and I wish I could give it 6 stars! This is the right way to do Airbnbs. Awesome accommodations, easy to find/check in, great host, and even allowed me to checkout an hour later since I checked in very late. 11/10:)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely house! Super cute, had a fun night staying there."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute updated cottage in a great location. 5 minutes to Elvis Birthplace and 10 to downtown to shops and dining. Roku and wifi available. Small bathroom but nicely furnished. Washer and dryer come in handy if needed. Responsive host if you run into any issues. One and only downside is the police training academy down the hill. If they are training cadets then you will hear the gun fire until dark which dis scare our pup for 20 minutes then she got use to it and fell asleep. That was the only con. The deck was great for sitting and having dinner or coffee. We would definitely stay again if back in the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host, wonderful house. I was staying with an infant for 2 weeks visiting family and it was very nice to stay in a well-equipped house in a good location for me. Lori was very responsive during my stay and we we were very satisfied!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oh my goodness how “sweet” is the honey house!! Left me local honey, recommendations and was super accommodating for my pet and I while working on the road. Listing is as pictured, probably even better. Thank you so much!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the Honey House was perfect for our family (and dog). Lori has thought of everything (even had dog bowls if we forgot ours).

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Tupelo Honey House is charming and in a very serene, private area. Very comfy and safe.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Tupelo Honey House is so lovely and comfortable and peaceful. Our family of 4 (plus our beloved dogs) settled in easily and quickly, and the house was equipped with everything we needed (plus more). Lori - our host- was responsive, easy to communicate with, helpful, and kind. The love and care that went into creating the space and maintaining the home is very apparent. Thank you for hosting us!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Lori's home was great! Lori was good with communication. Perfect for the 3 of us.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were just making a quick stop through as part of our road trip and this place was perfect! It was super clean, sweetly decorated, and had everything we needed.

We were in Tupelo for my late brother’s memorial and Desiree’s home was clean, comfortable, and private with a great back deck and fenced in yard. The decor was eclectic and interesting ( I slept in the Elvis room😁) with everything we needed. I would certainly stay with Desiree again if I required lodging."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great experience at Desiree’s place. We were in town for a wedding and this was a great please to come back to at night to regroup for the next days festivities.

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I thoroughly enioyed our stay! The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe. The house was comfy and spacious. We couldnt really use the deck due to the rain, but it was nice back there. We would absolutely stay again. If I had to say there were any cons, it would be that there weren't any curtains covering the window above the kitchen sink..... outside of that, all was well!"

Host was very responsive and flexible. On our next trip up to Tupelo we will definitely be trying to book this place again.

2023-09-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Overall the house was ok. The queen bed had a broken box spring, so it was very uncomfortable. The pillows were awful. The bed sheets were wrinkled and had hair on them. The dining room table was falling apart. There were stains on the walls. There were dried splotches of who knows what on the floors. The caulking in the bathrooms had large cracks and mold. The lock on the door was automatic and would not stay unlocked. If you had not learned the 8 character code you would get locked outside. Don’t waste your money. If you can’t find an Airbnb stay in a hotel."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time to stay at Desiree's, so that probably says enough. I did want to say something extra to the responsiveness of Desiree and Christian. The power knob on the dryer broke while we were there. I notified them, and in less than two hours Christian had a replacement dryer set up. This really impressed me."

The owner sent direct directions to the home. Arrived with no hiccups! The house has plenty of space, awesome back patio area. The bedrooms were perfect, bathrooms spotless, the temperature stayed consistent throughout the house which was a BIG plus in cold weather. Very peaceful, quiet, neighborhood. In the morning, go out back and soak in the fantastic trees and view. This home made this virgin Air BnB user sold on this experience!

Desiree went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed for our stay - including a pack and play and an air mattress (the only thing that would have made it better was a high chair!).
Our big kids loved playing in the backyard and racing their bikes up and down the driveway - the carport was PERFECT for that!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Tupelo for six weeks this year for work, and staying at this AirBnB made the stay feel like an actual vacation at times. The photos do not do the elegance and luxury of the apartment justice. This location was perfect, smack dab in the middle of town, Chris always communicated quickly and was nothing but pleasant. If you're staying in Tupelo for a night or a month, I highly recommend this spot."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved it! Chris was a wonderful host, very communicative. The space was amazing, clean, smelled wonderful & decorated beautifully. We walked to dinner right across the street at Forklift- location was great! Will definitely be back!"

This was the most thoughtful preparation I could have wanted! We were able to sit back and enjoy the relaxing lighting, design and delightful aroma. When I walked in there was beautiful music playing, the home smelled amazing and very clean! We are so grateful for this memory made."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chris’s Airbnb was our first experience visiting an Airbnb and I was amazed at the beauty, cleanliness, every thing was beautifully decorated. The price was exceptional too!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect !
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly can’t describe the comfort in text, because no one would believe me. From the moment we arrived, after a stressful week of dealing with the expiration of my best dog of 17 years, though he didnt know he was a ‘dog’, we were already booked for a wedding weekend, and missing it was not an option. This amazing, comfortable, clean and classy abode, was the exact spot we needed to relax, reflect and celebrate in a style I didn’t expect. Hands down, the best spot she and I have stayed."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chris's place was quite a nice surprise ! Everything was exactly as shown and all the amenities were fabulous ! I really couldn't ask for more. When I am back in that area, I will definitely plan to stay there again !"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was beautiful made me feel very welcome also, it felt so peaceful on the inside. I highly recommend next time I come to Tupelo I will be staying there. No more hotels for me. Thank you for welcoming me.💜💜💜"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic property. Old school charm with upper end décor. Beautifully designed. Spacious with lots of character. That kitchen!! I have three words for the kitchen....A MAZ ING. No expense was spared to make this a stunning property. Well done! If only I were allowed to take it home with me! :-)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This house was so cozy and beautiful. We loved the epsom salt bath and the bed was so comfortable with wonderful linens. The decor was exactly my style and it felt so homey. It was super clean and one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed in. My husband and I enjoyed our stay and hope to return again in the near future.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This suite in the house was stunning, so much attention to details! I loved the little Elvis touches as well. The epsom salt for the big bath tub was perfect ending after a long car ride. We loved Tupelo and ate at so many places recommended by other guests and in the information left at the house. Chris was an attentive host and communicated well! The house also has a great cookbook library in the kitchen- what fun!"

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place is fab! Looks just like the pictures so no unpleasant surprises! Tastefuly done. Roomey and comfortable. Clean. Excellent quality of furniture and linens. Beautiful french antiques mixed-in with some fun, creative flair. Everything was finished-out beautifully, especially the bathroom. Great attention to details and loved all of the modern amenities like the LED mirrors and shower with all of the different sprayers. Chris was also very responsive and communicative. We went out to dinner but the kitchen was awesome. Wish we could have used. Great for staying in and cooking. He allowed me bring my two small dogs which I appreciated. There was a pet-fee but I thought that was reasonable, as dogs can be hard on homes! The bed needs a new mattress though. I have a bad neck and am particularly sensitive to this. Otherwise it was a lovely stay and would absolutely recommend to even the most persnickety of folks! As long as mattress get’s replaced!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was AMAZING!!! Chris was very responsive and nice. He was so thoughtful in providing everything we might need. I actually went barefoot in the house, because it was so clean! 1000/10!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time coming to stay at the Rare House! We spent our honeymoon here and we just wrapped up our first anniversary! We could not have asked for a better place or a better host! Chris is so nice, and so so sweet! He left us flowers and some champagne to celebrate our anniversary. The house is always pristine and always smells AMAZING! We will definitely plan to come back in the future! And possibly every year!❤️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Breathtaking home in downtown Tupelo! Close to all of our favorite restaurants! Very clean and beautifully designed
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Luxe suite was exactly as described and more. The photos did not do it justice! It was private and quiet while being close to everything the quaint town of Tupelo has to offer. Everything was clean and well stocked, and the decor was perfect! Chris was so proactive in his communication in providing checkin and out instructions and making sure everything for our stay went smoothly. Will absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is such a beautiful retreat! Once you enter you are hit with such an amazing aroma of coziness. The owners thought of everything to make their guests feel so comfortable! This was the cleanest rental space that I’ve ever stayed! There is an awesome outdoor space out back! Picture perfect stay and setting!! Thank you for making us feel right at home
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent 3 nights here for an anniversary trip, and was not disappointed. The kitchen is absolutely a chef’s kitchen, if you enjoy cooking like I do this house is PERFECT for you. The bathroom is the cherry on top. There is a certain feel of luxury that comes from the extra features of the bathroom. From the walk-in shower with 6 shower heads and a bench, to the smart mirrors that have built in heaters to prevent them from fogging up. 20 out of 10, will be back for sure"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Chris was excellent. This place is above and beyond perfect for whatever you are doing in Tupelo.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Spectacular, Immaculate, and Majestic. The kitchen and bedroom was beautiful with the high ceilings. Then there's the bathroom it's like being teleported to Paris. A definite must stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this home! Comfortable, peaceful, clean, beautiful! Highly recommend! I would give ten stars if I could."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fantastic. It was super clean, well furnished, and welcoming. Chris does a great job preparing it for a quiet retreat. It’s a very comfortable place and I hope to return again. There were even fresh flowers as a warm welcoming and the decor made you feel extra special!!
Walking distance to restaurants, close to downtown Tupelo, and easy parking. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and it was even better than the last time! The place is absolutely beautiful! There are so many great restaurants, coffee houses, and bars all within a a short drive or even a quick walk for some. We will definitely be back again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful and very well kept. It was in a good location, and the house was very luxurious. However, the kitchen was not well stocked; and the description was a bit misleading. It was not the “whole house,” but rather just the back portion of a larger house. We had a great stay, and we would probably stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely place. My husband and I were visiting for work. My husband was able to work from the home. The Wi-Fi was great.
We enjoyed the local eateries, coffee shops and beautiful kitchen for our meals at home. Easy access to the highways. The mattress, shower and tub are heavenly. Such an exquisite space. Every amenity you would expect and then so many more that you never would have expected. The outdoor space was as delightful as the indoors. Great seating spaces with a light breeze making the Mississippi heat enjoyable.
Chris was thoughtful to have the lights on for our very early morning arrival and accommodating for our short notice late departure. You have a beautiful space here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place nice and clean will definitely be back
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I would give this place above the 5 star rating! It was by far one of the best experiences we have ever had. The decor was beautiful and Chris thought of everything. It smelled so good when we walked in and they had soothing violin music playing on the screen. There were books and recommendations everywhere. The kitchen was pristine with everything you needed! The bathroom was huge and i really enjoyed my bubble bath in the soaker tub. The art was intriguing and everything was decorated so beautifully. Thank you for this wonderful stay. We will be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect would stay again and again and again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful place!!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed this spectacular house. The details were indescribable and my wife was constantly saying, “oh wow, look at this.” Excellent choice by all means. When we visit family there again we will definitely book with Chris if available. Perfect host!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This house was absolutely immaculate. Gorgeous house and 1000% worth every penny. My fiancé and I both said that was the nicest place we’ve ever stayed. Wonderful host who worked well with our schedule. Lovely bathroom for the ladies and wonderful bed. Such great little details too like decorative napkins and chocolates on the nightstand.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A Rare Gem in Tupelo
This place was nothing short of remarkable. Offers an unparalleled blend of sophistication and coziness, instantly creating a sense of 'home away from home'.
The property charmed us right from the start, with its thoughtful design standing out. The host has invested considerable effort into crafting a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also
functional. It was spotless throughout, with meticulous attention to detail visible in every corner.
Every need has been anticipated. From plush bedding to well-equipped kitchen facilities, ""Rare"" was a haven of comfort. Every amenity felt like it was handpicked, providing an elevated stay. This is one of the best places we have stayed. It is a place where charm, cleanliness, and comfort blend to offer an outstanding accommodation experience. We look forward to revisiting Tupelo, knowing we have a perfect home waiting for us there!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just Perfect!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful house, It was very clean and comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I visited for the Elvis Festival. The location was great and the house was very nice and clean. We will definitely stay again when we are in Tupelo.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house. We are house builders and we walked away with a great appreciation for the beautiful design of this place. Please take the time to enjoy this oasis. It is well worth the trip.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is aptly named: RARE. Rarely have I been in a place I felt so instantly at home. I noticed two things simultaneously when I opened the door for the first time: the beautifully framed art work on the wall to my right and the incredible smell of the room.
The rest of the space was equally lovely. The pictures can’t tell the whole story; it has to be seen. The bed linens were soft and the bed comfy; Ample coffee in the well-stocked kitchen; The adorable pink toaster! As another reviewer mentioned, the bathroom alone is it’s own experience, complete with provided bubble bath and bath salts.
But perhaps the highest praise I can offer is this: I walked barefoot the entirety of my stay. I don’t do that anywhere that is not my own home; I’m just weird about cleanliness that way. This home is not just clean, “it’s MONICA clean!”
Thank you for such a perfectly RARE experience.!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My favorite air bnb so far! Highly recommend. Beautifully decorated and relaxing environment. Very clean, too!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our anniversary get away. Got there a little later than we wanted due to weather but found it easy.

You can tell how much attention to detail and love he put into this house. The only slight issue we had was the description said you rent the whole house but it was not. You don’t have access to a living room. Still a great place and would rent again.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came for a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary. When we walked in and the first thing my husband said was “ well damn babe you outdid yourself on this one.” We had a couple things planned to do, but honestly we were just so sucked into staying in! It was that comfortable! It was worth the money in every single way! It’s all the LUX for me! We did manage to make it to the Blue Canoe bc it’s ALWAYS on the list when we’re in town! Bathroom is top tier! Slept like a baby, everything there we needed, check in/out is a breeze, location is perfect, it’s just ALL THE THINGS! And I’m kind of like a Airbnb snob so there’s that! Our thing we do together is take random trips all over and pick a cool place to stay so it’s always a competition to nail a good stay! So thanks Chris for the win! We would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful New Years getaway at Chris’s place! The place was spotless and smelled amazing!

Not only will I book this property again in the future but I will also recommend friends/family to stay as well.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airb&b is possibly the most beautiful accommodation I have ever stayed. It was a perfect combo of cozy but spacious. And you would be lucky to find a decent hotel room for less. If you are going to Tupelo I highly recommend this airb&b.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Rhonda's place was clean and well-equipped. I was there for one night and to deliver a dog to new owner and couldn't enjoy the hot tub or local amenities. My only concern was the many knick-knacks that the dog wanted to enjoy. The dog and I worked it out and may not be a concern for others. A great place and would recommend. I would request to stay again. I enjoyed the theme and the tribute to Elvis. Great place.

This house is not even a mile from the Cadence Center but far enough to take your mind off. The decor is absolutely amazing and the setup is awesome for conversation and relaxing. My Guests who visited fell in love with the place. One actually said if they could build that’s the layout they would want. The house is a nice size without being too much. Uber and Door Dash found me with ease and Rhonda and her husband were the most responsive, helpful hosts. It was my first time in Tupelo and we plan to go back for another sorority function. I’m praying the house is available. I don’t want to stay anywhere else."

It was immediately apparent that a ton of love and effort went into the planning and preparation of this rental space, it was unlike any rental we have stayed in before. Upon entering the decorations were so personable to the history of the town and very fun to be greeted with. Rhonda personalized every room to have a theme. We appreciated the fresh baked bread, snacks and an abundance of comfort items like extra linens, blankets, and a variety of pillows for each visitors sleep preferences. The hot tub was a lovely addition to the relaxing stay. I highly recommend staying at the Sugar Shack if you find yourselves visiting Tupelo."

The hot tub was super nice. I highly recommend staying here to anyone who is visiting Tupelo. It’s also close to everything that Tupelo has to offer. Thanks again Rhonda.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I have stayed at this location, it was great and will be back. The host was great and accommodating. Highly recommend this spot for staying with friends and or family when in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Rhonda has taken a lot of time and effort to decorate this space. The details to highlight the local area add to the space and make the stay fun. Hot tub a huge bonus as well. Thank you Rhonda!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I Like the name Sugar Shack but this place was no shack at all😊😍 I would have called it the little Oasis. It was such a beautiful place in a deserted/ unattractive looking neighborhood. Very safe but unattractive. Everything else you could need in a home was at your fingertips in the Sugar Shack. Very very clean and well kept. Beds comfortable and slept well. 🤔 Did I say BEAUTIFUL❓the decor is the 💣 .com😍it’s close to the downtown area and anything you would need is fairly close to the location. There’s a nice little park across the street from the house and the locals ❤️ their pickle ball. The only negative thing about that is there’s no good parking so they’ll block the driveway, which makes it hard for you to come and go. A sign saying don’t block drive would definitely help. I hope the next guest treats the Sugar Shack as good as my family did because we will be coming back Ms. Rhonda"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Sugar Shack is such a quaint and eccentrically decorated house. We loved exploring everything. Every corner had special touches. The beds were very comfortable, everything was super clean, and the hot tub was an added bonus. We stayed for a weekend getaway for my 14 year old daughter's birthday. They surprised her with a birthday balloon and Crumbl cookie upon check in. We will be staying here again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in was easy and the host was very responsive with questions. House was very clean and everything was perfect. Pickle ball courts across the street are a plus if that's your thing. Layout of the house was good. Kitchen was well stocked with any cooking utensil you could need, better stocked than other kitchens at places I've stayed in the past. We had a great stay and would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a hidden gem. Would highly recommend it. The house is decorated so cute. Loved it all. Everything was so clean. Owner left us a note with a loaf of homemade bread that was to die for. Enjoyed the hot tub. Will definitely be back. Don’t hesitate if you are looking for a place to stay. It’s very spacious.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house looks like brand new rehab. Everything was sparkling clean. Kitchen was more than adequately stocked and first time I’ve had an air fryer. It came in quite handy. Pickleball court directly across. They take the courts down after so not open to public, but players were very nice. Only slight complaint might be a little too much “decor,” but it was fun and homey. Loved the homemade bread and snacks!! Really wonderful place. Location was close to downtown. I’d definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This may have been the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Definitely worth the stay. The amenities were great.
I look forward to staying again in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place, very clean, beds were very comfortable, hot tub was great and they even left a loaf of what seemed to be homemade bread! We also loved the record player! We had to get in late and leave at a odd hour because we were there for our sons swim meet and Rhonda was very accommodating! close to downtown and if you are into pickle ball there’s brand new courts across the street! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place!!! Very clean, beds were very comfortable, new appliances, and the hot tub was awesome. All the amenities of home. Close to everything downtown and Great restaurants! The owners were very accommodating. We had to check in and out at odd hours because we were in town for my sons state swim meet. There’s pickle ball courts across the street if you like that and we loved the record player. 10 out of 10 would recommend!!!!!
P.s. we loved the homemade loaf of bread that was left for us."
