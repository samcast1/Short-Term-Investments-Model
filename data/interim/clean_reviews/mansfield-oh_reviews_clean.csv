2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew, WOW!. The Building was carefully redone all details considered.
The room 104 was magnificent, with tastefully decorations and pix of Mansfield.
Remembering how the Bissman building front door was. The Voegele kept the front entrance intact, with the stairs and the offices to the right & left of the stairs , converted to the large living room , to the right and bedroom to the left. The wonderful high ceilings, made the suite so open and spacious. Loved how easy to enter using lock codes, not having to fuss with keys. Wonderfully brought up to date, Elevator, modern appliances.
(got the see the room 404 how clean and modern and tastefully decorated, different from 104.)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well-decorated, large and spacious apartment that was clean. It had everything we needed. Cool to stay in a historic building. Nice to be greeted by Andrew who provided a lot of good information to help us enjoy the area."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is what an AIRBNB should be: beautiful, clean, great host, easy access, and everything you need for a wonderful stay. Andrew was very accommodating, he met us upon our arrival and showed us around his place. His place was spotless, one of the cleanest AIRBNBs we've stayed. He has great decor too. Even had a record player with a ton of albums available to play. There are several local restaurants within walking distance (5-15 minute walk). I wish we could have stayed longer, we were only in town for a quick weekend getaway to visit Westmeister Farms in nearby Shelby. But if we ever make it back to town we will definitely book our stay here. I highly recommend it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fantastic! The place is historic and beautiful. We loved the amenities, a record player, a big kitchen that we took advantage of, and an electric fireplace. It’s located really close to downtown where we visited phoenix brewery. It was also a great home base for hiking in Mohican state park and skiing at snow trails. Andrew was really friendly and easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Excellent location and loved the apartment. 5 Star on all counts. Andrew was fabulous! Will definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our son and daughter-in-law, Stacy and Renee Beauford stayed 4 nights at the Voegele! We booked them there because we knew it was amazing! They enjoyed their stay and we loved having them here! They really enjoyed the privacy, quiet and gorgeous surroundings! Thank you, Andrew, for helping make our holiday perfect and giving us enough room at our condo so our grandsons could stay with us! Will book every time we have out of town guests!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in Mansfield. Impeccably furnished, squeaky clean, and just a great apartment. Andrew was very responsive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very convenient location to shops and restaurants in the Carousel District. Parking in the building's lot was very convenient. Although there could be a little bit of traffic noise at times, this was not a big deal. Staying in a historic building was a big plus, as the new details were very in sync with the original building. The interior was really, really nice, and everything was well maintained."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andrew was extremely nice and flexible with the booking. His place is gorgeous!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This 1-bedroom apartment in the Voegele Historic Lofts in downtown Mansfield is so cool! It was in perfect walkable proximity to the downtown. Our anniversary trip centered around dinner at Prohibition at the Caverns but we also hit Final Friday, dinner at Hudson & Essex, the Prairie Peddler Festival and Phoenix Brewing. Andrew was proactive about coordinating a flexible check-in, and we appreciated the personal touch of meeting him at check-in, hearing the story of the lofts, and getting his recommendations. We loved how it was so thoughtfully decorated, it smelled so good, and we enjoyed utilizing the outdoor space as well. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words and photos cannot accurately describe this apartment, you must see it in person!
It’s absolutely gorgeous, and the building is very secure with exterior door lock codes and outdoor lighting. We had an amazing view of the Bissman building right outside our windows.
The back yard is wonderful! Very private and peaceful, with so many places to lounge along with multiple fire pits.
Andrew was very responsive, friendly and helpful the whole weekend.
The location is great for any downtown event you want to go to. We didn’t use the car one time while we were there, everything is accessible by walking."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I book this Air BnB for business, and every guest we’ve had stay here raves about how beautiful the space is. The host is excellent; very responsive and easy to communicate with. This place is truly a gem for Mansfield and sure to amaze any guest!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew was a fantastic host.He was extremely nice and knowledgeable of the area. The loft was so much more than in the pictures. The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower had fantastic water pressure and the building itslef was very quiet. All the lights, ceiling fans, and temperature controls are very easy to operate. We will definitely be back and recommeding this place to all of our friends that head that way."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. The location right in the downtown area makes it so easy to walk/drive to restaurants and shops.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Voegele Historic Loft Air BnB is a true gem in downtown Mansfield. The character is so charming, and it’s been beautifully renovated.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well Appointed. Walkable and accessible to entire downtown area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing place that takes you back to when craftsmanship was a big part of building the community.
It is a very regal setting with soaring punch tin ceilings and a remarkable touch of taste with golds and black leather.
They place had a very historic feel with a built in museum to your stay.
I will be coming back to this again.
I’m a avid traveler-There is a wonderful bed with blackout velvet curtains that gave me a great sleep to. That sometimes is as good as a vacation."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The photos don’t do this place justice! Truly a gem for the area. My husband and I stayed for almost a whole week and felt right at home. Sits right next to a noisy street but that is the ONLY complaint. Highly recommend!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew is a great host! He reserved a parking spot for us right outside the loft and met us when we arrived to show us around.

Andrew was super nice and gave us great suggestions for restaurants and places to check out. I would highly recommend staying here."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay couldn't of been better. Andrew was highly communicative and responsive. Pictures don't do the place justice. It is beautiful, designed with such care and though, well taken care of, and definitely put together with the visitor in mind. The bed is extremely comfortable, the water pressure is great in the shower, they offer streaming services on the television, and there is just everything you could need. It is hands down the most beautiful place you can stay in Mansfield. Wish I could give 10 stars."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! And a great alternative to local hotels. Central location, easy parking and airbnb access. Charming interiors and insane ceilings!!! Would stay again next time I’m in town."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is beautiful and full of charm. The furniture is super comfortable. Great location by downtown and private. One can tell the host pays a lot of attention to detail.
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, lovely space, and in a great location. The only issues we had were a banister on top of the curtains falling not once but twice during the stay around 2am. I would also like to see a checklist for checkout implemented for this host as we were charged for leaving the banister down, and for apparently misplacing the insert in the trash can without much more description."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Mansfield. This is a well taken care of apartment that was in the perfect location for us. Nothing is overlooked plenty of comfort. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for your Mansfield OH stay!! Andrew is quick to reply and is detail oriented from the flameless candles, blue tooth speaker, record player, coffee, FULL size shampoo and conditioner!! The location is central to so many activities including the Shawshank trail so fun!! I cannot say enough about this place. Just book it!!! Stop looking…you found your place:) five stars
Hope to see you again Mansfield I know where I’ll be landing:) next time."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was beautifully decorated and appointed. We were taken with the historic space, high ceilings and light. It was a comfortable space and we appreciated being able to walk to a local coffee spot and a brewery. The record player and albums were also a treat to enjoy! Would stay again next time we’re in Mansfield."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andrew was very flexible with us. He was quick to respond with everyquestion and was very informed. He was willing to work on a last moment booking and we appreciate it very much.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely space, conveniently located within steps of downtown. The apartment is decorated tastefully ( no “Live, Laugh, Love!” plaques in sight) and tbh the kitchen is nicer than mine at home. We especially loved the turntable and classic 70s record albums. There is a little traffic sound from Main Street and the railroad at night—not a big deal for a city-dweller like myself, but take note if you’re a light sleeper. I’d be delighted to live full time in such a beautiful apartment."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures do not do it justice. Was one of the nicest places I've stayed at. Also if you are doing the shawshank trail, this building is in the movie for just a second (still really cool as we were watching the movie there, and saw where we were staying). Would 100% stay again, and will recommend to everyone who is interested in doing the trail or visiting Mansfield."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Gorgeous apartment, in a great location! Really spacious, nicely decorated, and a pleasure to stay at for 3 weeks. Definitely recommend it! It’s pretty quiet too!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"amazing property, tons of history! host was super accommodating, even with me arriving very late due to a delayed flight. will absolutely stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to downtown. Awesome host made for a relaxing weekend away from the kids. Would highly recommend this stay to others!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time. Beautiful space with lovely accommodations. Would definitely stay again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Andrew’s place was perfect for our short stay in Mansfield. The place is architecturally beautiful. It feels like someplace special. The location is very convenient; within easy walking distance to several eateries, a coffee shop/bakery, and a brewery. There is a comfortable community outdoor space that was nice in the evenings. And on site parking was a plus. We felt safe during our stay. We can’t think of any amenities we wish we felt we were missing. Andrew was a very welcoming host. He spent time with us upon arrival, familiarizing us with the Airbnb and community, and to answer any questions. He was very approachable and easy to reach if we had any needs."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your visiting Mansfield or anywhere in Richland County, you'll be hard-pressed to find an AirBnB or hotel that offers the luxury, comfort and value of Andrew's loft apartment. We visited to explore the Ohio State Reformatory, and then go hiking in Mohican State Park. The location of this AirBnB was perfect. After exploring all day, we relaxed on the comfy couch with the fireplace on, playing records from the eclectic selection available. The location makes it easy to venture out and walk around downtown Mansfield, where there are cute shops, amazing architecture, great food and even a brewery and winery. It was always a welcome surprise to enter the loft at the end of the day. No expense was spared on amenities, comfort and décor. Andrew was a great host, as well. We showed up later than anticipated, but he was there to greet us with a smile and give us a tour of the property. He gave us ideas for things to do in town, provided brochures for local attractions, and left his card with us in case we needed anything during our stay. I can go on and on, but you truly have to experience this loft for yourself. The pictures can only convey so much. If you love historical buildings, luxury accommodations, convenience and value, then this is the place for you. We're looking forward to retuning here again in the future!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay in this beautifully renovated building, full of historic charm and all the modern conveniences. In additon, Andrew was very personally welcoming and kind. We may return in the future with our kids!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in such a great location. Such a unique beautiful place. Andrew is a great host!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend Andrew’s place. Very charming decor and all the needed amenities. Andrew was a fantastic host.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb is wonderful !
10/10 highly recommend. Beyond the impeccable cleanliness, excellent location and wonderful natural light my personal favorite was the record player and the wonderful album collection of some of the worlds favorites !
The host is super responsive and helpful.
I will definitely be back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Clean, cozy and very comfortable historical building! Informative and responsive host."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were lucky enough to book this amazing space as part of an 80th birthday event as a gathering place and somewhere for our son and his wife to stay! It is stunning and had every convenience you could imagine. We all want to just move in! The furnishings, vibe, parking, ambiance were exceptional. The host was so accommodating and the place was spotless! Every connivence was well above our expectations right down to access to the cleaning crew and building super! Our niece is planning on booking several weeks so part of her work trips! Thank you Andrew for helping make this event a success!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a weekend while in town for a wedding at Kingwood. The place seems to have a deep history which can be seen in the woodwork, ceilings, and layout. It's a beautiful apartment packed with everything you could need. We relaxed with the record player and electric fireplace going at night. Very easy walk to a brewery, the carousel, restaurants, diners, and coffee shops."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew was great, we was very responsive if we needed anything. The place is exactly as described and exactly what we were looking for. Perfect location and the only place we’ll stay when we go back to Mansfield."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Decided last minute to get out of town and found this historic and beautifully renovated loft in a restored 1897 building. Andrew was everything you could hope for in a host, he was quick and thorough with communication from the start. He met us at the door to let us in and gave us a tour of the loft and it's amenities and offered suggestions for restaurants and places of interest. The loft is gorgeous and very comfortable with everything you would need. We especially enjoyed the turntable and listening to records in the morning with our coffee. We found the bedroom very nice with one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in! The loft is located only a few blocks from the downtown which has many historical buildings and impressive architecture. You'll find a few nice restaurants, some shops, bars and a brewery. If you're into breweries, we found the Phoenix Brewing Co in Mansfield had average beers but a great atmosphere. We found that Uniontown Brewing in Ashland, OH(25 min. drive) to have very good beers with excellent food. And if you're into biking, check out the B&O Rail Trail that starts in Mansfield and heads through the towns of Lexington and Bellville about 18 miles south to the town of Butler. We really enjoyed our stay at the Voegele loft. Thanks, Andrew!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been my favorite property thus far! Phenomenal location right on the Shawshank trail and near Mansfield’s Carousel district which has great food options with a small-town feel, antique shops, bakery, tea cafe, and even a functional, indoor carousel right in the center of it all.

After visiting the Ohio State Reformatory this property kept me securely locked in that historic “step-back-in-time” feeling, but with all the modern conveniences I could possibly ask for thanks to its recent, luxurious renovation inside a beautiful, historic building. Everything seemed brand new, but still felt like I was in a completely different era where art and craftsmanship mattered when constructing a building. The photos do not do it justice, it has RGB LED lighting in the bathroom and kitchen, remote led candles everywhere for ambience, good collection of vinyl records to play on the vinyl player, surround soundbar in the living room, smart TV in the bedroom, even a bluetooth speaker for the shower built into the ceiling so I truly felt right at home because I didn’t even need to use the travel speaker that I brought; the host seemed to have thought of everything! Honestly, I did not want to leave this property, plus one of the Shawshank trail movie sites is literally next door, with another (Carousel Antiques) just down the street; perfect for a history fanatic like myself and my day of traveling the trail. I spent my second day in Cleveland, but was thrilled to escape from the hustle of the city to this property that night to teleport back-in-time again for relaxation after a long day.
Parking was excellent and convenient in the building’s parking lot located at the side of the building which is always important to me since I prefer to keep my car off of city streets (I’m a car guy so persnickety about where I park my ride). The host was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, quick to communicate, and his recommendation for a dinner location in town was excellent. I will be returning to this location the next time I am in the area; I can’t say enough good things about it."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I have been waiting over a decade for a space to stay when visiting my family back home in Mansfield with my dog Penny. It’s difficult to find pet friendly hotels in town that make you feel at home. I’ve been driving between Cleveland to Mansfield which takes away from precious time spent with my family. The space itself is pristinely kept, clean and holds every amenity one would need - including a vinyl record collection that will keep you dancing as the daylight fades into night, which you can conveniently watch from the ceiling to floor windows. Once the sun is down you can sit by the electric fireplace and play a little guitar or monopoly. For hometown folks like me the historical building is a true reflection of Mansfield’s glory but the decor itself is another keynote of the space! It’s thoughtfully curated to honor Mansfield’s industrial roots and cultural highlights - Vintage photos line the vaulted ceiling walls, not one but two Timothy Brian McKee Mansfield vintage books sit on the bookshelf near current guides so you can reflect on Mansfields past and present. I cannot wait to come back home more often and know I have a such an incredibly beautiful space to relax and unwind after a long day of catching up with my large family back in Sunny Mansfield."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place. High quality accommodations. Tons of thought put into the design and esthetics. Cozy and comfortable. Spacious. Tons of natural light. Walking distance to downtown. Parking free and convenient. Andrew was welcoming, friendly, and readily accessible."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautifully done. Andrew was a great host. We needed a place to get away for the weekend and we definitely couldn’t have found a better spot. Thank you Andrew
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a treasure! The Voegele loft is a stunning historic property AND totally modern and up-to-date. Our favorite was the comfortable king bed in the beautiful bedroom with floor to ceiling windows. The kitchen is super functional and chic. We’ll definitely book again the next time we are in Mansfield.

It's conveniently located within a 5minute drive to the grocery stores & fast food that's on Lexington Ave. The driveway /parking availability is really nice. The pictures matched reality! The beds were comfy! The living room is spacious (My niece could fit a PacknPlay by the TV & there was still room to walk around). The kitchen area is just beautiful & has everything you'll need to prepare meals! *The kitchen windows don't have full blinds so don't expect privacy there. We had a question about the ice machine on the fridge, so Irene & her husband came right over to help us without a problem (very responsive)! The bathroom was clean with a step-in shower. There's no shortage of hot water which is GREAT but be careful. The washer & dryer was also a great bonus!

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here, with the first being a really great experience. This time it seemed like things weren’t kept up on as well.
The TV was very finicky, there is a huge delay with the remote to the Tv and it would just freeze up and close out of the Netflix randomly, the dishwasher was broken ( they didn’t know this prior to our arrival) one of the vents in the room wouldn’t stay open and the room was getting to 85-90 degrees, then we discovered the problem so we wedge a screw in it.
The basement area needs a little love. There is tons of cob webs everywhere and last time there was not. It felt a little more dingy than before.
Other than that it was a good experience. The host was responsive to any messages that I had sent."

I liked that at night time the driveway (which was a very nice size) was lit up by a street light.
We booked it on our drive which didn't give Irene anytime to do any last minute things before we got there, so she was actually there when we got there and her and her husband were super nice.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Cozy Bluebird Stay was perfect and Irene was awesome. The place was super clean and Irene was great to communicate with. We just needed a quick overnight stay and this place was perfect. It has 2 bedrooms on the main level and a bed in the basement. Everything was just as stated in the information. Our only regret was not being able to have time to enjoy the back deck and fire pit. Since I am also an Airbnb host, I know how hard it is to keep everything clean and organized.

The air tools and loud vehicles were not appreciated. Not Kristen’s fault. All in all, a good stay. Kristen and Michael are great hosts. They’ve thought of everything. Hope we meet all of their expectations."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and in-laws stayed here a year ago. Kristen is most hospitable and provides all the sweet little touches not always seen with Airbnb rentals. If you are staying in Mansfield this is THE SPOT! Close to town & local diner just right down the street. We will always stay here if it's available. Such a comfortable space.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Where do I begin? This was a terrific place to stay. As someone who stays in AirBnBs everywhere I travel, I can say that this was one of my favorites. Large enough to be comfortable and small enough to feel cozy. Safe neighborhood, close to the main roads. The little touches are the best, like a plush rug in the bathroom, reclining sofas, rain showerhead, etc. The Polaroid idea is sweet (you have to stay there to understand that one).
Kristen, I hope I go through this area again just so I can stay in your house. Thank you."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were visiting Ohio from another state for a basketball tournament I was coaching at. I needed a basic place for my family to stay at. I have to say, this was the most comfy AirBNB I have ever stayed at. The beds, sheets, and pillows were so incredibly comfortable. Living room was cozy and we enjoyed relaxing at the house between our games. Was nice to be able to laundry there at the house and not have to bring home tons of dirty clothes. Seriously had everything we needed and everything in the house was done so well. Definitely recommend staying here!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came back to Ohio to spend the holidays with families and friends. Kristen was an amazing host. She had remembered that I was gonna do our yearly tradition of baking cookies with the grandchildren so she made sure we had extra baking supplies including cut outs. There was an electronic lock on the door and we were locked out. She opened it immediately remotely and brought us the key for future use.
The house was emasculate and well stocked.
She even had it decorated for Christmas.
Loved the polaride picture idea and guest book.
Will definitely book this again"

2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The check in was a little difficult - there is a bio-metric lock on the back door and the numbers were hard to see and there was a miscommunication on what buttons to hit - overall the lock eventually opened and I was able to get in. There was a slight odor entering the house through the back door - it smelled a little musty. The entire home was all newly remodeled and all the appliance worked Great however the bed in the master bedroom had a very soft mattress that hurt my back. It was my first time in Mansfield and the neighborhood was not the Greatest. I felt like Kristen could of had another lock on the back door off the kitchen at night it was a little creepy the back yard at night.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay!!! It was such a cute and clean house! Such a peaceful get away with my girls! Kristen really goes above and beyond to make sure her guests have everything they need. I would absolutely love to stay here again! Definitely recommend

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was amazing! it was so nicely remodeled and everything was fresh and new from the furnishings to the paint on the walls. There were sweet touches like a snack basket, candy jars, a Polaroid camera to snap some memories, and toiletries, etc. Kristen is an amazing host. I was in a bind as the original Airbnb did not work out after the 1st night staying there. Kristen got back to me immediately and gave permission to check in as early as we needed. We loved it so much, we are going back in May for our daughter's wedding. My in-laws are joining us again and we all cannot wait to stay again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Deborah's place was as advertised and was very nice. My only issue was only one bathroom, but that was my fault, not hers. It clearly states there is one bathroom. But it all worked out fine for everyone anyway. I give Deborah's place my highest recommendation."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deborah’s place was in a nice quiet neighborhood and was easy to find. It was comfortable and well appointed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! Home is located in a nice neighborhood with easy access to local amenities. The rental is just as described and filled with everything you should need, including spices and toiletries that would often be forgotten. My favorite amenities were the fenced in back yard and parking space in the attached garage. Deborah is quick and responsive. Would definitely book again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came into town to visit the Mansfield Reformatory. Deborah's place was in a great location. Close to the reformatory and restaurants. We had hoped to be able to visit more than the reformatory but a snow storm hit so we decided to stay inside. Deborah's sister even shoveled our cars out and the sidewalks. Her place was comfortable and well maintained. They had baby gates available to block off the stairs. Which was very fortunate because we have an old blind dog that would have continually tried to fall down them. I would recommend this place to other people visiting Mansfield.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Deborah's rental was spotless, nicely decorated for the holidays, plenty of toiletries/kitchen 'stuff' and she was great at communication. The only downsides were a tiny strip of a side yard and it abuts the highway, so there is a lot of street noise. But for the price, a great rental."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We needed a quick get away before the busy Christmas season began. This home was the perfect place for us to rest. We were just a short drive to downtown where we enjoyed a carousel ride, a delicious meal, and a walk around the center of town to look at all the beautiful Christmas lights. The home is clean and comfortable."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was better than the pictures! Deborah was very responsive with questions and flexible with our check-in/out times. The house was very clean and thoughtfully prepared. Although we did not have kids, there were lots of toys and stuffed animals in the kids room and lots of games for families to play. The bathroom had plenty of products and different types for different individual's preferences. There were many coffee and instant oatmeal options for breakfast and we appreciated the Brita filter so we could have filtered water at home. If we stayed in Mansfield again, I would totally stay here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy and clean house in a nice quiet neighborhood right off the highway. Being able to park in the garage and have a huge fenced in yard are huge pluses! Perfect for a stopover while traveling. Deborah is a great host!

Her pet friendly policy allowed us to bring our two dogs and the driveway fence gate gave us all peace of mind when they were outside enjoying the ample backyard.

You will feel right at home no matter if you staying for 1 night or for a month. The king bed was very comfortable (yes we noticed the excellent quality of the mattress) . It’s close to mid-Ohio raceway and was easy to run back and forth as needed. Thanks Deborah for providing us a comfortable, clean, and wonderful place to stay while visiting the area. We will absolutely stay here again in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very quiet neighborhood- perfect for your family and your pet!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I (along with our two fur babies) stayed at Deborah's home for three months, while working in town. We can't say enough about her wonderful hospitality, punctuality with any/all concerns and all of the extra attention she put into her lovely home! Each holiday/season she changed the exterior decorations, she always kept the yard clean, responded to any questions/requests promptly, and really just went above and beyond to make our stay great! We would welcome the opportunity to stay in her home again. It was, truly, a ""Home away from home.""
In addition, you will enjoy the lovely back patio and privacy of a fenced-in back yard. Our dogs loved patrolling the area and watching the birds. Deborah's place is wonderful gem, and an absolute blessing."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deborah was amazing and the house was super clean and cozy. Highly recommend!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly what we wanted. Clean, close to Mansfield activities (reformatory, snow sledding, etc.), and plenty of space.

Although she had a not so tidy previous guest prior to our arrival, she made sure that everything was ready for our stay. Going non-stop for hours getting the home ready. She had everything that we could of needed and even supplied some goodies. We live out of state and would definitely stay here again. The best part for us was that it was pet friendly and we were able to take Buster our FURbaby :) Absolutely no pet odor in the home and that’s a must!! Thank you Deborah for everything!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family (four adults) rented this home for five days when we were in town for our mom’s funeral in Shelby and despite the sad circumstances for the trip, it was a wonderful stay. This home is a split level in a nice location that felt safe and has a huge yard that our pups loved to run around. We were also able to park one car in the attached garage, which is a nice perk! The owners live next door and are super communicative and very friendly/easy to work with. The owners needed to access the detached garage/mulch pile inside the fenced area of the property a few times during our stay but they were great about communicating this so there were no issues with our pups being outside. We were allowed to bring our three miniature dachshunds and leave them alone in the house in their crates, which made dealing with the funeral and related planning so much easier. Our pups had a little trouble with the wooden stairs, as they are a bit slick, but larger dogs shouldn’t have any issues. This home would also be great for families with kids, as there is a kid-themed room with some toys. The house has a full kitchen and full-sized laundry and would be perfect for a longer term stay."

Our reservation took place during one of the extreme winter temperature and wind storms, but we felt safe and warm in the home. No issues with power outages, just a hiccup with the hot water on the last day to which she readily responded. A snowplow service arrived after the few inches of snow fell and shoveled the walk as well. Overall very clean and comfortable without a lot of to-dos upon check in or check out---much appreciated!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is great, was able to walk to any number of restaurants or stores. Would have preferred blinds on windows/door in front as you could see all the way through to Master Bedroom from the street at night when the lights were on. Outdoor patio was great for getting some work done and relaxing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Felt like home. Enough space for 3-4 people easily. The separate bedrooms was a plus. King bed was extremely comfortable!Full kitchen( we only ate out twice our whole trip) very clean! Such a cute outside patio area. We were busy but did sit outside in the morning and our last night. Washer and dryer was a bonus!! Convenient location. Great Mexican restaurant less than 1 min away. Close to stores and restaurants. We come to Ohio several times a year and will definitely be booking again! Definitely a home away from home! Tosha was very responsive when I had a question. Lovely host and home!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really loved the house very cute! my only critique would be to invest into some blinds for privacy and clear instructions on how to use the smart house appliances lol.. it took me 2 days to figure out the t.v.s 😆 lol and a Cafe table would be really cute between the kitchen and living room.

The house is comfortably decorated with the lovely furnishings appropriate to the style of the home. Using the side door allows easy unloading of the car as it accesses directly into the kitchen. The kitchen is fully stocked. I found every kitchen tool I needed. The architecture reflects the time of curved archways, interesting little nooks, and curved living room walls with bay windows viewing out into the gardens - both front and back. Have a plant identification app handy as you tour her gardens. Walking throughout the neighborhood is another enjoyable aspect of our trip. We have greyhounds so many neighbors wanted to stop and chat. Lovely neighborhood and neighbors. We plan on staying more than one night next stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are so glad that this time we opted to stay off site of the Mid Ohio Sports Car Course. The racetrack is always a fun weekend for my husband and his club, but this time our daughter and son in law were planning to meet us there for an extended visit. Melanie's house was immediately inviting and comfortable. Having the house allowed us time away from the track to spend relaxing and connecting with loved ones. It was the perfect fit for the 4 of us, each couple traveling with a small dachshund. The neighborhood was quiet and welcoming, great for morning and evening walks. There was ample parking for 3 cars. We slept very well, like being at Grandma's and enjoyed the multiple sitting areas the house had to offer. The plants indoor and out were beautiful and added to the experience. I especially enjoyed the orchid blooming above the shower. Too bad we only visit that area once every couple years, but would definitely stay again if it were to work out. Thank you Melanie!"

Its been modernized just enough to be comfortable but keeps its old world style. I loved the old fashioned chandelier in the entrance way and the glass doorknobs with skeleton keys. We absolutely adored this place and would have loved to stay longer! The host provided a plethora of towels, toiletries, food in fridge, snacks on counter, pop-ice in freezer and many more homey touches. The gardens outside are spectacular! The backyard was an oasis!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stay at this property every chance I get and I am never disappointed. The house is very well stocked and equipped with everything from an abundance of extra linens to more styles of cups and glasses than I knew existed. Sitting on the balcony on a nice day gives you a very real sense of being out in the woods and the Disney princess levels of little critters playing out on the yard and in the trees certainly helps with that. I don’t think I’ll ever run out of good things to say about this place no matter how many times I stay and review it.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Melanie’s home is comfortable, spacious, and has great character. There are many windows that allow for beautiful light and views of the yard.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very comfortable place to stay with a private entrance and homey feel. The kitchenette is well stocked with cookware. I even found Everything Bagel spice in the cupboard. The bedroom has a beachy feel and the place is well cared for. The host was super friendly and available for any questions and I honestly didn't have any because instructions were very clear. The entry has a keypad, so you are not hunting for a hidden key anywhere, which is also nice. I totally recommend this place if you are staying in the Mansfield area and want a private place to stay with living room, dining room, kitchenette, bedroom/bathroom that feels comfortable like home, but special like a get away."

Apartment was very centrally located and close to the family we were there visiting. Spoke with Michael a couple of times and he is very nice and personable. Contacted him for 1 thing during stay and was answered very quickly and accommodated. We have a full size pickup truck so had to park on the street but felt safe doing so and walking while from car to the apartment (it is located in the back). Will stay here again next time in town to visit (hopefully it will be available)
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Amber were wonderful hosts and we hope to stay in their airbnb in the future! The space was very clean and welcoming and had easy access. I cannot stress enough how kind Michael and Amber are! We arrived with a broken bike trailer and Michael took time out of his day to help us load our broken trailer onto a u-haul trailer, and then load our bikes on top as well.

They have everything available for your cooking needs, which is a plus. Seemed like a very nice set of folks and allow you complete privacy even though its a sectioned off portion of their home. You get your own entrance way and it really does feel like your own little apartment. Five stars for the description and also the value"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Andrew was very accommodating from the beginning of my booking! He was very responsive and kind. I typically don't meet the hosts. But he made sure he got me in and showed me everything! He was very professional as well! Now, the home, wow! It is beautiful in the photos, but they just don't do the justice of how nice this place is! Everything was spotless! I absolutely LOVED using the record player while cooking dinner! Thank you, Andrew! 10/10 Recommend!!! I'll be back for sure, as I come to Mansfield frequently!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay. This was a different unit from the last. This was equally as nice as well as offering a Birds Eye view of the downtown.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience, speechless to find words how much I have enjoyed Andrew's place of the many hundreds places where I stay in airbnb. Keep up the great work Andrew. You should visit Mansfield so you can just try and a great airbnb it was. :)"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have nothing but great things to say about both Andrew and his place! It was very nice to have Andrew meet us and give us the layout of the apartment so there was no guessing on how anything worked. We'll definitely book again when we come back into town!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was, simply stated, incredible. I wish I had had more time to just ""chill out"" and relax. I would consider this place for pretty much any situation (work, vacation, etc). Andrew was a great host, amicable fella. There are other people who live in this building, but you would not have known it other than the cars in in the parking lot. It is a very quiet and peaceful setting.
Speaking of cars in parking lot, my only negative on the place was there appears to be a very large bird population in the general area. I base this observation on ever increasing evidence left on the car every day, but no major concern... I discovered Buckeye Carwash because of it. Downtown Mansfield is a brief walk, and it was all lit up for the Holiday. Made for a nice stroll each night. I look very forward to my next stay at this place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in downtown Mansfield. The apartment is very well decorated with lots of fun and interesting features. Andrew is very communicative. We'd stay here again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we found a conflict with our initial booking, Andrew graciously accommodated our request to change. His response was timely, as was every communication. Andrew is knowledgeable about the area and helpful. The location is in an area of development, a short drive into the town square but a titch too far to walk in cold or rainy weather. The penthouse was new, stylish, immaculate, and very comfortable for four adults."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Great place!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden gem for locals and those traveling! This Penthouse Apartment is located in a charming old building just outside the Square. The building is clean and quiet with touches that make it feel upscale. The apartment is even cuter than the pictures show - and so fun!! Andrew is a gracious, kind and helpful host. His suggestions for food and drinks were spot on! Definitely ask him where to go and what to eat. We were visiting from out of state and made a poiny to share with family and friends who live local!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This gorgeous, high-ceilinged loft was perfect for our weekend visit! The space was well-appointed in every way: super clean, beautiful decor, comfortable & cozy beds, kitchen with everything we needed, and plenty of space to hang out & share meals. We enjoyed the cool, urban/industrial views of Mansfield from our 4th floor perch. Looking south towards downtown and the picturesque, old Bissman building was a treat. We took advantage of the record player to spin some vinyl but were too busy having fun with friends to watch TV—although sets were available in the living room and bedroom. A short, easy walk up the hill led us to all sorts of restaurant options. Check out Relax It’s Just Coffee for a top-notch caffeine and bakery fix! Coney Island Diner was closed while we were visiting but it’s old school soda counter is on the to-do list for next time. Andrew was an engaging and helpful host who made us feel immediately at home in this supercool Airbnb! Highly recommended. We loved it."

Thanks Mac."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Will definitely stay again. Perfectly tucked away - yet - everything was accessible. Very clean.

Very quiet and peaceful. Close to downtown area that is being built up to get businesses and younger adults in. I will say, at night while it’s a short 20 min walk, you’d want to drive or Uber. Daytime very walkable."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great getaway in Mansfield Ohio! Went skiing at Snow Trails, had an amazing dinner at Hudson and Essex (including a visit to their winery), then a relaxing stay at The Carriage House-Hay Loft. What a cool space! Hard to believe it used to be an actual barn. Fun to imagine what it must have been like. Michael pays incredible attention to details. Some of the old features mixed in with updated amenities. Also, Michael was so quick to respond to any questions we had. Highly recommend!"

Also Michale is super fast at communicating. We’ll be back!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay - Michael made sure everything was perfect.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a hidden gem in the midst of a lot of businesses. When driving to the house, some areas were sketchy in the immediate neighborhood and Mike's place was set back a little and hidden which was good. Parking was very adequate and we had the upstairs unit which was easily accessible via exterior stairs. Everything was very clean and set up nicely for moving around with our guests not bumping into each other. Furniture and beds were comfortable. My bed was a little too firm for me but that's no one's fault but my old bones. Thanks Mike for all you did and we'll definitely be calling again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is not only beautiful, it is also so rich in history. Ask Mike anything and he’ll give you the answer and more! He was super accommodating and sweet to chat with. There are some super cool finds in this place, plus it being the central of Mansfield. Try “Relax, It’s Just Coffee” - super cute coffee shop."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Even better in person! This loft is extra special! Do yourself a favor and book this place! We felt like we took a step back in time but with all the modern conveniences. Little touches that make this place an adorable stay. Our daughter was delighted to have her own loft room!! The speedy chats with the owner were great! Love when we work with easy breezy hosts that really care about their property and their guests!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A stay at the Carriage House is guaranteed to delight you! I stayed in the Hay Loft and loved every minute! It is so charming, unique and full of history. Michael pays attention to the details and I can honestly say the place was the cleanest I’ve ever stayed in. It was just like home!!! The quality of the furnishings is superb (comfy beds, aviator chairs, couch, tv) and the thoughtful touches that emphasize the history make this stay an unforgettable experience. Seriously, we probably would have stayed another night - but it was already booked :( Thank you!!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding place with a great host! Great communication throughout. He even helped with a special request to make our trip great! Would definitely stay there again.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, cozy & full of historical charm! We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect first Airbnb experience!
Michael’s attentiveness and quick response to ALL our questions was icing on the top! Great value! No hotel could compete with the price, let alone the seclusion and relaxed environment! You might wanna consider bringing info to your streaming services as Roku is available with most of the popular options. If we are ever come to Mansfield again, we will stay with Michael!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in this unique AirB&B. It was quiet and very comfortable. We were in town for a family event, and everything was only a 5 or 10-minute drive. It is well located in the centre of town. We would happily stay here again next time we are in Mansfield!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very cool place- with unique antique features. I loved the overall vibe of the restored carriage house.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful long weekend here. The aesthetic of this 18th century building was really beautiful. The loft was extremely clean which was comforting during the time of covid. The grape vineyard had delicious grapes and made for beautiful pictures Michael was very nice and communicative.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Very well kept and exceptionally clean!! Has everything you need. Michael was very communicative and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. Check in and out was super easy and everything was exactly as described. My 79 year old mother had no problem with the stairs. If you are staying in Mansfield or the surrounding area you can not stay at a more clean and unique place. Excellent place to stay!!

Host is very quick to respond and friendly.
When in the area again will definitely stay again. Very very clean place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Michael's place was just as advertised, although the photos really don't do it justice. It isn't often you can stay in such an historic, but incredibly comfortable place.
Great communication and an easy check in only added to our awesome night. Five stars! You'll love it."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a cozy place with historical charm this is the place to stay! The place was comfortable and so close to so many attractions. There was more then enough space. We loved the open feel, but the ability to close the sliding door and have privacy in the master bedroom was very nice. The only bathroom is off the master bedroom, but this was perfect for my husband and I."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great property and host. Would stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gorgeous old building. For the first 10 minutes of your stay, you'll surely play with the barn doors, look at the historic photos on the wall and generally be amazed at the transformation. Michael was a great communicator. We would happily stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The property was beautiful! We really enjoyed getting to hang out in the back yard. The place was clean and easy to find. Jeff was a great host and even messaged me once the place was available for us to check in.
,,,The place was very nice
,,,Host will call the cops if you don’t answer messages immediately. Host did not clean the oven after last guest started. Asked Airbnb to fix it and contacted the host and the issue was not appropriately addressed. Host will constantly harass you from the house next door. Stares out the windows and acts like they are gardening. Pipes were leaking in the basement utility room. Pots and pans were not clean. Stove is very outdated.
,,,"The stay was beautiful but the host was so concerned about the needs/wants/requests of his other guests that he forgot to care for the current guest he had. He talked about how My Fiancée’s group was loud and disruptive but never did any “investigating”. He just came scolding everyone. He then tried to sweet talk us so we wouldn’t leave a bad review. My fiancée and her brides maids were in bed before midnight and were EXTREMELY quiet then and in the morning just trying to have a peaceful start to our wedding day and Michael didn’t care one bit. My fiancée and her bridesmaids arrived at the Airbnb at around 10:30pm simply took their bags inside, took showers and then went to bed. There was no partying. There was no yelling or disruptive sounds. The other guests had their TV very loud and ended up keeping my fiancée up until 2am. In addition, I had asked Michael if it were possible to extend the checkout time to 1:30pm the next day. He gladly told me that they could stay in the Airbnb till 2pm. To which, he then tried to force everyone out of the Airbnb by 1pm. Which was not what was agreed upon. I informed him that there would be multiple people showing up that day to help get ready, the whole reason for renting this Airbnb was for prettier “getting ready” photos and this was communicated to him when I first made the reservation back in March. He came to the Airbnb while people were trying to get ready multiple times. 3 to be exact. The wedding was in September. In addition to him scolding guests, his driveway was unkept and the parking was not clearly marked for my fiancée. He kept trying to smooth over the entire day by making small talk and trying to save face so he could prevent himself from getting a bad review. He kept asking for the mother of the bride and the mother of the groom and kept them from getting ready for more than 30 minutes collectively.
All in all, the place was beautiful and clean. It was a nice stay. But the host was inconsiderate and disruptive during the stay which only added more stress to an already stressful day."
