2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We asked to extend our stay by another day as we felt so comfortable. It was like home away from home. If in the area again, we will definitely stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've been coming to Danville for events at VIR for a couple of decades, usually staying in a hotel - this was a better value, quieter and a better space than any of the hotels. Communication was wonderful and the attention to detail really enhanced the stay."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful job Eresterine and her husband have done with this place. I will be trying to get this place every time I come to Danville in the future. I was lucky enough to meet Eresterine and her husband when they were doing yard work. It was a real pleasure and they are clearly great people.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great weekend stay! Eresterine left super clear instructions on how to find it! It was beautiful and cozy! Had a nice relaxing time! Thank you Eresterine!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the third time I’ve stayed at Eresterine’s place. It is always clean and very comfortable. The location is great. You park right next to the unit. It is in walking distance to a coffee shop and restaurant. It had everything I needed for my stay.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location. Nicely renovated historic building. Half a block to a coffee, breakfast, lunch and dinner cafe with wine and beer . . . with occasional live entertainment. Good instructions to get you to the back of the property where parking was.
Kitchen had everything we needed for this short stay. .
Bedroom had several luggage stands which we love. That is often overlooked by innkeepers. The mattress was very noisy, I woke my wife whenever I got in and out of bed. It was a comfortable mattress, just loud.
Bathroom was small but adequate. Updated with good hot water. The toilet was pretty small and seemed low to the ground. It worked fine, just a little awkward.
Lounge area and couch were great. Nice larger TV with streaming options and good internet.
Overall a good stay."

Eresterine is very helpful and responsive. I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Danville to run the Danville Half Marathon - if the weather had cooperated, I could have run to the start line by the MLK Bridge! The kitchen had everything needed for basic cooking, and even though the restaurant three doors down had live music, it was very quiet in the apartment. It was great to have such a lovely place to come back to after racing. It's a hilly neighborhood, but the apartment is in a great location to explore downtown. Also, great value for money; you could find a decent to good hotel for what I paid, but the apartment offered so much more! I would definitely stay here again!"

The accommodations were very clean; comfortable; nice work desk area; great kitchen and table to eat at. Bed and shower were great. Nice little deck to sit out on in the evening.

This was a great stay - strong wifi signal, well-stocked kitchen, comfortable bed and roomy living area. Easy to follow instructions for check in and out. Eresterine, the host, was so friendly, helpful and polite. I highly recommend this location. A+!"

Ron and Michaela Seckar, Indiana, PA"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying at a AirBnB and the experience was great. i would like to stay here again and Eresterine was a excellent hostess. I really like how she left the menus of the surrounding restaurants so that I didn't have to guess what they offered.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Biggest thing to say is to follow their directions. If you do that it’s easy to find. Great place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a really charming little house that was close to the main roads without having to see or hear them. (About a mile from the main artery.). Lovely downtown location and across the street from a phenomenal little restaurant. The HVAC was perfect (cooled when I wanted cool, warmed when I wanted warm.)
Really loved all the little notes scattered around the house explaining any little detail I would need to know. (Think “augmented reality” but with handwritten notes.)
The host did a fantastic job of anticipating things you would need out of the gate (eg, coffee and an easy way to make it.)
All around, this is what an ideal Airbnb experience should be."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our needs. We didn't prepare meals there but there are good restaurants close. We had an issue with the a/c. Eresterine responded quickly and was very accommodating in helping resolve the issue. We will be staying here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about our stay. The hostess was so easy to contact and was very responsive. The place was beautiful. In fact, I don't think the pictures do it justice. It was a perfect size for my husband and me. We also were able to have a few people over to visit and there was plenty of space. The deck was great for sitting out in the evenings.
The rooms were beautifully furnished and comfortable. The location was perfect to go anywhere in Danville, whether walking or driving. We will stay here again the next time we're in town."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful. We may even visit Danville again just to stay in the same apartment! The decor in the apartment is super cute and the old homes in the neighborhood are fascinating. Love that Eresterine included some history of the house in the house book.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"BEST AIR BNB STAY!
This was the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at. Beautiful home and a great location. Our host was so responsive and nice. The house was SPOTLESS. It was so clean. She went above and beyond providing amenities and labeling everything so we didn’t have to guess or look for anything.
10/10 would recommend for anybody staying in the area and we would definitely return."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment in a duplex, conveniently located in downtown Danville. The unit was very clean and well stocked, true to the photos and description. Eresterine was very accommodating and a great communicator. We'll stay here again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend! She was great!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location close to a great coffee and wine bar and short drive to downtown. The host was very communicated with pictures and messages on check in to make sure we knew where we were going. Only issue was my parents (elderly) couldn't figure out how to get the Roku to ""Watch Live TV"" They don't use streaming devices so they kept trying before giving up."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a quiet neighborhood, it is quaint and clean and has everything you need. Eresterine is very accommodating and we will probably stay here often."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s an avid traveler’s dream come true, especially if you’re in need of comfort, relaxation and restoration. The “Blessing” house’s location couldn’t be more ideal: it’s conveniently located on Main St. in a historic district and in walking distance from several main attractions. The house is just as charming and cozy as the neighborhood. I’m already looking forward to my next stay.
Our gracious host, Eresterine, was expeditious in her responses and a stellar host, overall. Her recommendations for local activities and food were great too! In essence, the “Blessing House” was unequivocally a “blessed” experience! You won’t be disappointed with this gem."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful little apartment with lots of privacy & many areas of interesting things to do & see with in walking distance.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, organized place to stay in the perfect Danville location. Eresterine was incredibly sweet, even adding some holiday decor for our stay over Christmas. I’d be happy to stay here again when visiting!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is clean, comfortable, and in a great peaceful location. Eresterine was amazing! She answered every phone call swiftly, was respectful, and had an extraordinary personality. Checking in and out was easy and straightforward. It was my second time staying at this place, and I highly recommend it."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mrs. Eresterine was awesome. She sent driving instructions on how to find the place as well as pictures of landmarks because it can be tricky. The home is beautiful and comfortable. The next time I’m in the area I will definitely be back.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at the blessed house, can't say enough good things about it."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mrs Eresterine is an extraordinary person and host she exceeded every expectation that I was hoping for hospitality, responded instantly to any and every of my needs, I visit my kids 4 to 6 times a year and because of her I will never stay at another hotel in Danville Virginia as long as she's around. She is awesome"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good hospitality, clean, neat, owner is personable and easy to talk with. Would be willing to stay each time I need a place. Looking forward to coming back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eresterine’s place is a wonderful spot to stay in downtown Danville. We were within walking distance to a few local landmarks and restaurants, and only a quick 3 minute drive to the main downtown strip. There is a lot of thought and care put into this Airbnb; plenty of extra amenities and Eresterine was extremely helpful in communicating with us on the check in and check out process. We also enjoyed the little touches around the place like the seasonal decor and the guide book with history about the home. We would recommend this stay to our friends and family!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is so cute and it is a great location. It has a great mix of historic and modern. It is right in the middle of city! I walked to a coffee shop every morning for coffee and a pastry and to local restaurants for meals!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice place, conveniently located."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Blessing house is such a great place to stay. Easy parking options on the street or back of the property, fantastic location, clean & cute apartment with everything you need. Eresterine is a great host - very fast, thorough responses and instructions, lots of cute little touches all around the house (i wont spoil them for you though!). The cafe and wine bar basically next door, crema & vine is beyond fabulous. We went bike riding at anglers park just 10 minutes from the house which was amazing. We werent quite sure what to expect when visiting danville but it was truly a fun, easy, enjoyable weekend. Danville and the Blessing house is somewhere we will definitely try to visit again in the future."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eresterine is a fantastic communicator and has remarkable attention to detail. She seems to have anticipated my every need, and the apartment was clean, cute and comfortable. Would highly recommend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a little hidden Gem in Danville. Stayed for four nights while on a work trip, and Eresterine's place was a great place to stay. I highly recommend if coming to Danville."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Spent a week here while I was in the area to visit my parents. The place was great for one person but would have been perfect for a couple too.
It was super clean and I really liked the decoration. There was a nice walk in closet too which was an unexpected perk. The AC kept things nice and cool despite the heat outside. I did a lot of remote work and the desk setup was great for that. The TV setup was very nice when I decided to knock off for the day. Also crazy fast internet!
Definitely would stay here again!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment so cute, clean and great location. It was perfect. Could walk to an awesome restaurant and the hospital (where I work) if needed. It was perfect!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quiet and very clean. Everything I needed was in the house, including soap and shampoo, which is a small thing, but you don't always get at an Airbnb."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and clean place. Good location. Eresterine is a great host! Be careful when pulling into the gravel driveway, as it may scratch the bottom of your vehicle."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Eresterine place in Danville is ideally located and close to everything. Being able to walk to the Midtown Market and the Crema & Vine Cafe was a charm. This place is perfect for a long stay with fully functional kitchen, and separate bedroom and living room areas. Eresterine also provided ample quantities of kitchen and bathroom supplies."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely apartment with nice furnishings and great thoughtful touches. Eresterine truly cares that you have an enjoyable experience. The location couldn't be better with a great little wine bar next door.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying here. It is a very convenient location close to downtown and the riverwalk trail. The space was exactly as described and easy to access. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was clean. The air conditioning was a bit loud at times but it kept us nice and cool. There were a few bugs which makes sense since the unit is close to the forest and we visited in the summer - it wasn't a problem for us but just a heads up.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, spacious & as described. Kim is a very friendly host and easy to reach with any questions."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay if you want to walk to shops and restaurants downtown.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if attending VIR for any event. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two female travelers for an event at VIR, really liked the apartment. And very easy to get to the track. A bit tricky to find entrance- we found building no problem, just had to look a little- although the description is concise and accurate. Reserved parking also. Regardless, rental was clean, very spacious, bedding and linens were very nice. Door lock was a little tricky but Kimberly was quick to attend to the issue- which really wasn’t much of one. Coffee pods available, good wifi. Close to a walkable area with restaurants and a trail along the river. Would stay here again for sure"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This air bnb by the river was a remarkable find. It is very private and yet near an entrance to the river walk and downtown. The use of space was great (roomy) and it was very clean. Definitely a place to return when in Danville!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay. It was easy find and get into. There is a historical but modern feel to the flat. The beds & pillows were very comfortable for a good night rest. We took a walk to a burger place called Me's (delicious). There is a modern art studio on the way that makes a very fun photo shoot. There is also a trail/dog park that is very close. 10/10 recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly was super responsive. Location is very walkable and enjoyed the historic look and feel of the area.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location - close to several good restaurants, a brewery and easy parking."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, great location, big, plenty of room. The place was $103 a night but with tax, service fee and cleaning it was $180 a night for our three day stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Nice walking trail next to building. Restaurants within walking distance.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place! Such a unique apartment, I loved the industrial warehouse style. The downtown area of Danville is really up and coming, with some great restaurants and coffee shops for foodies, and a farmers market literally behind this building….a great way to spend a Saturday morning.
The apartment was spotless, the beds were very comfy, the towels were incredibly soft, and I love how dog friendly it is. If you bring your fur child, there is green space steps from the apartment and a dog park within 50 yards.
The old railroad bridge has been turned into a walking path overtop of the river, it is steps from the apartment. It was fun seeing all of the ‘Love Locks’ that had been attached to the fencing.
For restaurants, check out Mucho Taqueria for great tacos, Me’s Burgers, and Link’s Coffee House, just to name a few. Thanks so much for having us! We look forward to coming back:)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location for this area! It’s easy to access, very safe and secure. This is always a plus! Clean, I highly recommend and when I return this is my home away from home!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this condo!! Great layout, comfortable, and ground floor for easy access from parking lot. And quiet…..no 2nd floor!!
The location is the best part. Step out the door and onto the Riverwalk with 11+ miles of walking / biking trails along the Dan River."
2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kimberly's place made us feel right at home. Conveniently located in Downtown Danville, you could walk to all the wonderful restaurants, shops, science museum, dog park (if you bring your fur baby), and Pavillion for concerts. An added bonus, is that it also could be handicap accessible being on the first floor/ramp access. Not only was Kimberly's instructions super clear, she was very quick to respond if we had any questions. Definitely will book for future stays!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was beautiful and so clean! Right by the walking trail and doggie park. Kimberly was quick to answer all of my questions. She’s a great host. Highly recommend!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a magical stay in Kimberly’s place in the historic river district which is just bursting with revival. Her space really reflects the surrounding area with its juxtaposition of modern simplicity in a building with a rich history. You almost instantly feel a sentimental attachment to the unit making us hope it’s available the next time we visit. Check out parks, restaurants, tours, nature trails, and events all with in walking distance. Only one small issue which was getting the WiFi set up. But I’d say small potatoes in the overall stay but worth mentioning for future guests. 5 Stars!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay so much in Danville at Kimberly’s condo! We love how Danville is working to revitalize their downtown area! It is conveniently located by the River Walk, a dog park and lots of great restaurants close by. Kimberly was great and very responsive letting us know everything in advance about the condo! We hope to be able to come back soon and stay here again!"

She had a lovely welcome board and explained everything in the house so you didn’t have questions upon entry. Porch on the front of the house was a great sitting porch as well on the screened in porch in the back. The home was decorated so nice. Every room had a different theme. All of the beds and furniture were extremely comfortable. I couldn’t ask for a better experience. For a area that has homes that are 100+ years old the renovation was spot on. All the bathrooms were so modern and clean. All the linens and towels were extremely fresh and clean as well."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We so very much enjoyed our stay! Would love to visit again.

The entire place was spotless. Though it is an older place, it was nicely painted and had a completely newly remodeled bathroom. Katie had all the linens and towels that we needed. The place was really cool and have a lot of character. We will definitely stay there again when we get back to the area if there is an opening. We would highly recommend this place to everyone!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with plenty of space!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was everything we expected and more. The house is extremely spacious, clean, comfortable with a touch of modern design in a older style building. The outdoor space is nicely furnished, which makes the place a complete retreat. If I had to point to one thing that could have been better/different it would be having darken curtains in the entry way, specially at night. But that will not stop us from booking this place in the future.
5 out of 5 stars."

Nice touches include the drinks in the refrigerator, K-Cups and snacks. It was also nice to have shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower so we didn’t have to unpack more. Lastly, the property has been renovated, but is historic with tall ceilings and interesting architecture. It was very quiet and we slept well. We will definitely come back."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casino Girls Trip - House was
approximately 2-2.5 miles from Casino. located in the River District.
Unfortunately, the weather wasn't the crisp, clear Fall day we were hoping for, so unable to explore the River Walk due to rain and wind! But weather did not stop us from having a great time. it was short drive to wonderful restaurants such as Cottons, Creme & Vine, antique stores and of course the Casino!! Frank's Italian on Bishop down the road from Casino was good.
214A Jefferson Ave was exactly as described. Cozy and relaxing; back deck was great for morning coffee and conversation. Loved hearing the train in the distance!"

One thing I only realized on the last day was a noise machine, which would have been helpful to notice was in my room as I am a sensitive sleeper (the cats upstairs were a bit full of energy when I wanted to wind down ) 😂
all in all a perfect stay."

Downtown Danville is making a comeback. Katie’s place is leading the way."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Katie is a great communicator. I had an issue with the heating and she personally showed up to resolve it.
The building is old, historic, and Katie has made use of the original features while updating the furnishings.
I was impressed by the modern decor that complimented the retro feel of the unit. Wood floors, built-in cabinets, high ceilings, really impressive.
The unit was quiet, other than the usual sounds of a home of that age. The area is busy but peaceful and I felt very safe
I appreciate all the extra touches like extra throws in the living room and bedroom and laundry supplies.
The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped and very clean.
Katie as a host goes above and beyond, I had a very comfortable stay and I would recommend this listing ."

I don't know how old the building is, but it had the original hardwood flooring, transom windows over interior doorways, leaded glass window panes, and some original cabinetry. The location is ideal for us since it is close to our favorite restaurants and cafes. It is in the most scenic part of the city. It is walkable and near activities that we enjoy."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie’s place was so cozy and very clean. It’s close to shopping, restaurants and local historic sites. Katie was one of the best and most responsive hosts we have ever encountered. Being born and raised in the Danville area, it was nice to come home for a visit and have such a great place to stay. This will definitely be our place for our yearly trip to visit family. If you haven’t tried the chicken salad from Midtown market, it’s a must!! It’s just a few blocks away."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was very spacious and well decorated. Katie was prompt and responsive. My family enjoyed our stay.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, we just needed a place to sleep for a couple nights and this place seemed nice. Our first time in Danville and we were surprised at all the abandoned/dilapidated buildings - what a weird vibe downtown. The neighbor next door hosted a LOUD party in their backyard from 7-11 p.m. We had to wake up early the final day so that was not great. But the apartment itself is very nice and Katie responded quickly to our questions about the thermostat our first night. The most unique Airbnb we've ever stayed in! It would have been neat to read about the building's history. Very comfortable and we do recommend this host/apartment."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with high ceilings and everything you need and then some. The little details like the Dohm background noise machine was perfect for a person like me that is not used to the silence, which was awesome. very walkable to restaurants and coffee."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! We loved the history of the area and the cozy yet modern feel of the apartment.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really great and surprisingly large apartment. It worked perfectly for the three of us (one couple and one solo traveler) as base camp for a music festival. About 25 minutes to the raceway. Everything was comfortable and functional!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in a lot of AirBNBs and Katie’s place is the best yet. I travel for work and normally stay in a boutique hotel in Danville. The hotel was booked so I booked Katie’s place, so glad I did! Super clean with all of the basics provided! My 19 year old daughter traveled with me and loved the furnishings and also commented on how clean the place was. Loved the back porch as well!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is beautiful! Historic but up to date! Very clean and accommodating! Beds are comfortable, everything you need is there! I would definitely stay again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Beautiful, Clean and comfortable. I will definitely book again when I am in Danville."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Katie's place was great for my family stay. It's a beautiful modern stay and looks just like the photos posted. We checked in middle of night so self check in was great. She provided light refreshments which was an awesome surprise and great for everyone upon first waking up after a late night check in. Fully equipped kitchen was definitely a plus. Beds were comfy and the futon couch was as well. She definitely thought of the comfort of her guests and went above and beyond on amenities. Conveniently located to eveything in town. Would recommend this over any hotel. Definitely staying again when visiting.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here for a night after the SRX race in South Boston down the road and Katie was super accommodating with our schedule. The place is very clean and nice. She responds quickly to any questions too. I would love to stay again for the next race :)

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adelaide provided an excellent AirBnB experience for my family and me while we visited Danville for our family reunion! Thanks for the hospitality!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was amazing. We loved our stay. The bedrooms were nice and big. The living room and kitchen were well stocked. The front and backyard were spacious. Such a beautiful house.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Seriously awesome Airbnb. Super comfortable beds and the softest sheets. Absolutely the cleanest Airbnb we’ve been in- sparkling white bathrooms. Beautiful rooms free of clutter and plenty of seats. Lovely outside yard plus deck with a big table. Pretty flowers along the deck. Well stocked kitchen with everything you would need. And the SNACKS! So many wonderful snacks, which is just fun. Fantastic communication with the host. She’s friendly and informative. We were there for a memorial and she graciously gave us a generous late check out so we could have a quick visit with family in the morning and give them one more hug. I see why this place has so many 5 star reviews."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Adalaid was great and so was the house. After a small glitch at the lock, Adalaide responded immediately and was kind and helpful.
The house was super comfortable, and clean. It had everything that we needed and we ended the evening with a wonderful campfire. Would definitely return."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely amazing stay! Adelaide has thought of everything! The house is beautifully decorated, the beds are super comfy, and all amenities are provided. A lot of thought has gone in to the home and I could easily see myself staying here for an extended stay. Communication both prior to and during our stay was great, very detailed, timely, and thoughtful. My only disappointment is I didn't find this place sooner!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little place in a convenient location - host was very responsive before/during/after stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adelaide was a very gracious and accomadating host that went above & beyond. We were in town for a wedding and I ask for recommendations on salons to do hair and makeup. Adelaide went as far as calling the local recommended salons to check availability for my needs. Her home is very modern, very clean, great location and fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. This is the best Air bnb Ihavr stayed at. I highly recommend and gets a 10/10 rating from me! Thank you very much for all your help."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Wow! What a lovely home full of so many little extras (lots of snacks, water, extra towels, blankets, pillows, great coffee selection, comfortable beds, beautiful deck).

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adelaide was great. Really enjoyed staying here. House was wonderful, clean, and plenty of room for 3 of us. And she provided plenty of snacks. Would most definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adelaide knows what to do to make you feel at home. It was decorated lovely for Christmas and everything was ready for us when we arrived. There were snacks/water, and the kitchen was well-stocked.
All three bedrooms have a comfortable king bed. That being said, it does make it quite tight in two of the rooms. There are luggage racks in each closet, which are convenient, but I would have loved a drawer or two to put clothes in. The closets had hangers, though.
The backyard is ready for relaxing and very comfortable. There is a porch and a fire pit. The driveway is perfect for pulling right up to the doorway.
The house has beautiful finishes and lots of room to spread out. You can tell the host has taken the time to design each room to be welcoming and homey. For a guest with a walker, there were some challenges. The floors have thresholds that make it challenging for the walker. The shower has a high step over and hard for mobility challenges.
We would absolutely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay! Good location, near the city and close to everything. Stayed there for my birthday weekend and the host left us a birthday cake! Such a sweet surprise! Would recommend and will return."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This is an AMAZING place! Everything as described! Very welcoming! Newly renovated house/furniture. Clear instructions on how to use appliances and electronics. Labeled switches. Throughout full additional snacks/extras that are not required. Beautiful patio and fire pit. Plenty of parking. Quick access to everything in Danville. Will stay there again!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"I'm thrilled to provide a glowing review for Adelaide’s home that I've had the pleasure of staying in not once, but twice! The experience has been nothing short of exceptional, and I cannot praise the outstanding service and immaculate cleanliness enough.
From the moment I stepped foot into the home, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere.
Adelaide’s commitment to creating a welcoming environment was evident in every aspect of the home.
I cannot recommend this home enough to anyone seeking a delightful and unforgettable stay. I look forward to returning in the future for another incredible experience!
Thank you for the great hospitality, Adelaide!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely loved this home and highly recommend it. The home was spotless and even better than described. the back deck is where we enjoyed our evening meals and even in July, with the shade from the trees, it was very comfortable. The beds were comfortable and enough pillows for anyone's sleeping preferences . Great location near lots of eating establishments, but the grill on the back deck was our choice. Its a prefect place to unwind after a day's work or play.
one of my favorite airbnb places to date."

Don’t hesitate on this one! Grab the date while it’s still available."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Adelaide was an incredible host. She went above and beyond for our family's stay. Communication was great, and the place was spotless. Absolutely what I expected based on the photos. The house was tastefully decorated for the holidays and added to our family get-together! Her response time is quite fast, and her instructions are crystal clear. She has literally thought of everything a guest might need! Especially awesome kitchen amenities, enough to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner. Her place was absolutely beautiful and we loved every moment of our stay. This is definitely somewhere you want to stay while in Danville and hate when you have to leave. If you are considering this spot- book it! 10 out of 10!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,You couldn’t ask for a better stay!!! The house is beautiful and so fully stocked with everything we needed ! Great communication and hospitality! Thank you so much!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"GOAT BnB! This house is clean, quiet and fully equipped for all of your travel needs with items like Coffee, snacks, toiletries etc ..
The deck and fire pit are the cherry on top! During our stay, Hurricane Ian’s remnants caused us to lose power for 20+ hours, and Adelaide was with us the entire time giving updates from the power company and doing what she could to check power restoration. Her efforts were above and beyond, she is the star of the show. Great place, even better host! Just book it already, you will love it!!"

Both homes were exceptionally clean and well stocked with EVERYTHING you need or could think to want. I certainly felt at home and welcomed. The locations were absolutely awesome! Both houses were updated and very well maintained. I had coffee on our deck every morning, I enjoyed the fresh smell of pine trees, and flowers in a very peaceful environment.
I can be pretty picky when it comes to staying at a Airbnb. However, I have nothing but good to say about my stay and would certainly stay again.
Adelaide, thank you for providing excellent customer service and a beautiful home away from home. 😀"

We look forward to booking with her again next year! 100 Stars Adelaide!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adelaide's home is great and by far one of the best Airbnb's that I have ever visited. While in Danville for a wedding, I needed to iron my clothes. I contacted her to find out where the iron/board were located. She didn't have them, but but her husband went out to get them and personally delivered to the door. The house comfortable tastefully decorated throughout."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adelaide’s house in Danville is an absolute gem! It looks brand new and all of the furnishings and appliances make you want to stay longer. I loved the town of Danville, and am so excited to come back and stay at Adelaide’s again!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This is a beautifully renovated and decorated home in a nice quiet neighborhood. The host was friendly and accommodating. We had everything we needed for our short stay. The home had many amenities that unfortunately we did not have enough time to enjoy as it was a busy weekend for our family. Everyone slept comfortably and the space was perfect for us. Would highly recommend staying here if you are in Danville.

We had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed all the comforts of home with our family thanks to Rebecca 's cute and inviting home!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Brought our family to Danville to watch our son’s AU lacrosse game! This house was perfect for our family to hang out together, play board games, eat dinner together, enjoy the awesome game room, have a comfy nights sleep and wake up to a nice cup of coffee in the kitchen watching the deer wander around the neighbors yard. The house was very clean and beautifully decorated. Thank you Rebecca for your hospitality and we plan to be back again very soon."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Highly recommend!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family came into town from Northern Maryland to see my brother-in-law play college lacrosse and this house was an overall great choice - close proximity to the college, peaceful neighborhood, private driveway, games for all ages, plenty of seats for gathering, and spacious enough to easily house 8 adults and 1 child (if not more). Check-in and check-out were easy, house was clean, loved the screened-in porch, and best of all, Rebecca was super responsive to questions and needs. Only issue we had were not enough bath towels or kitchen towels but Rebecca came within 15 minutes of contact and provided us more. Would definitely stay at her lovely, beautifully-decorated home again, therefore would recommend it to others too!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rebecca was an awesome host, and her place is fabulous. The best stay in Danville! The house was beautiful, very clean, and contained high quality linens, plenty of towels, and extra blankets throughout the house. My boys loved the game room, private mini kitchen downstairs, and many tv options.
I'll be back to Danville and I will definitely be staying here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was exactly as described. We felt at home and were very comfortable. Being able to wake up and drink a cup of coffee with the morning sun shining in the kitchen window was our favorite part.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We plan to stay there again. It was very nice and comfortable. We actually had a mishap and Rebecca was super gracious. The game room was a nice touch and a deviation from our rigid schedule.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice house. Was as pictured. No issues
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very clean and comfortable at a great price
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Where do I begin?This was the best Airbnb that I have ever stayed in. Rebecca's house is all that the website described and so much more. From the comfortable sleeping arrangements to the beautiful decor and lets not forget about all the amenities. Rebecca thought about every detail to make our visit feel like a home and she definitely
achieved that. Having a tranquil place to retreat to after my husband's mom's funeral was more than we could have asked for but just what was needed. I want to thank Rebecca and her husband for sharing their home and giving us our home away from home for me and my family during this time.
Thanks again!
Theresa Whitlock"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"I have to agree with other reviews I've seen that have labeled this the best place to stay in Danville for the price. We have family that lives locally and have stayed at multiple airbnb locations in the area. None have been as spacious, clean, accommodating, or affordable. This will be our first search for every future trip. Would highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Rebecca and this place are amazing! I've stayed here twice and I will stay here again. The place is very nicely set up very comfy and cozy. Rebecca is very responsive and helpful. 10/10 I would recommend this place to anyone.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I frequently visit the area and are so pleased to have discovered this home. It is not only beautiful and cozy but it fit our needs perfectly.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was absolutely wonderful and so is Rebecca. She is very thoughtful, attentive, and helpful. Her local recommendations were great and she responds quickly to texts and messages. The home was very comfortable! The water was nice and hot for showers, lots of pillows and blankets, the neighborhood was beautiful and peaceful. I have nothing but good things to say! I hope to return to the area.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,First airbnb experience and we loved it! Rebecca was very responsive and a very good communicator. The house was as described and perfect for our family weekend in Danville. There was more space than needed which was great. The screened side porch was amazing as it was like sitting in the trees because of the hills - very enjoyable.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was nothing short of perfection. Beautiful home and Rebecca was a great host. Highly recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Rebecca is a sweet, thoughtful, considerate and responsive host. Went there for graduation from LU with my folks and we all loved our stay. Rebecca made it plain and simple (easy) to stay there, and we even enjoyed a couple of the “things to do” in the list she provided after commencement/graduation ceremony(ies). She genuinely showed “love”, (as we young people say), by leaving me a really nice, hand-written note congratulating me for my graduation. Very much appreciated and all other details not mentioned to not exceed the character limit. If you are looking for a great, clean, quiet place to stay, with an excellent responsive, thoughtful host then Rebecca and her place are dedo for you. From my wife, my family and I we thank God, and secondly, Rebecca for such a great stay and experience overall. God bless."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Tank you for everything
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Rebecca's home is just as described and spacious. We were in Danville for business and truly enjoyed staying in her home. It was convenient to restaurants and everything we needed. The kitchen was stocked with coffee and essentials. She was always checking in by email to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable house. Description in listing matched the house! Lots of room with large bedrooms and living area. Very clean! Would definitely consider staying there again when we make a trip back to Danville. Only negative would be not any extra blankets for bed but small detail.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was amazing! The kids loved it, which is a huge bonus. The neighborhood was extremely quiet. The herd of deer feasting in the neighbors yard was the most interaction we had with anyone or thing lol. The house is spacious and passed the test for the two germophobes in the house. Our teenager loves her privacy and she had plenty of it. Rebecca had snacks that our youngest enjoyed way too much, but was an added bonus. If you're on the fence about staying here, just book it. We have family in the area so this will definitely be our go to house from now on."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca, responds quickly, the house was decorated well and clean. Great place to stay in Danville."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous home! We had a fantastic stay in Danville, largely because of the good vibes just emanating from this home. The photos are nice, but it’s really nicer and bigger than the photos suggest. Rebecca is a friendly and responsive host who has spared no expense making this airbnb comfortable and well-stocked with all sorts of things you might have forgotten. Thank you, Rebecca!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Super quick with her response. The house was extremely well keep up and excellent

If you are looking for a family friendly place to stay in Danville, look no further!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was a great host! My family was in town for the passing of my grandmother, so a stress free stay was needed and thanks to Rebecca, that’s exactly what we had.

I highly recommend this listing if you are visiting Danville Virginia!
Thank you
Scott Garrison"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is perfectly decorated, extremely clean and very inviting. Truly a home away from home and Rebecca is absolutely perfect to work with. Couldn’t imagine how it could be better."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful place we will
Come back. The host are wonderful"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in Danville for my sisters wedding and wanted a more spacious place for our family of five.
Unfortunately at the last moment our son got really sick, and it ended up being just myself and my daughter. Rebecca was super understanding and was comfortable with me changing the reservation to include my brothers instead so my daughter and I wouldn’t be alone.
House is adorable, cute neighborhood with a park nearby. We had a lovely stay."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This location is great when racing at VIR! Very close to downtown Danville and another main road with excellent access to restaurants and shopping.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,This Airbnb looked just like in the pictures. Rebecca always responded promptly to any questions we had. The place was nice and clean. She even provided snacks. We enjoyed sitting on the patio. We would highly recommend this place and would stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! The home was exactly as advertised. The house was very clean, great location, and nice furnishings. The hosts were great, easy check-in/check-out, great communication, and great information on area attractions. Many thanks for a lovely stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An air bnb that felt like home away from home as soon as we walked in. Super clean and cozy with little added touches such as snacks in the kitchen. Rebecca was also very great with communication, quick to respond, and even checked in without me having to say anything. We would 100% want to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Excellent stay at this property. Bedrooms large and nicely appointed. Baths worked great and kitchen very well equipped. Good neighborhood with park and playground across the street. Quiet and cool in the midst of summer too. Owner very responsive if you have questions
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay Rebecca goes above and beyond for her guest!! Highly recommend this home!!! The price is great and cheaper than most hotels!! The screened in porch was amazing we were able to set outside while it was storming and enjoy our morning coffee!! The neighborhood was very quite and well kept!! Very nice location!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home and Rebecca has the best communication of any host I’ve dealt with.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute gem! Myself and two other colleagues of mine stayed at Rebecca’s place during a work trip last week.
I personally prefer AirBNB because I like to cook and not eat out all the time and I just don’t care for hotels that much. With that being said. This place was PERFECT!!! The description was spot on. It was clean (and I’m incredibly picky)!
The location was perfect! I’m a runner and I ran every morning while there at 5am and I felt completely safe in that neighborhood. Plus there was plenty of deer to watch just hanging around the yards at that hour.
What I loved the most were two things: the attention to detail is bar none! 1)everything you would need to prepare a meal in the kitchen, to the cute decor and coziness, all the way to the little coffee/snack bar.
2) I asked Rebecca before the trip if she had food storage containers for leftovers and she told me most had disappeared with previous renters. She offered to get more and DID! Not because she had to but that’s just the type of host she is!
Last but not least… my colleagues thanked me for finding that place above going to a hotel!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We traveled all the way from Texas because my son and his track team performed in the Junior Olympics in NC. From the booking until the check-out the communication was great. The House was located in a very quiet neighborhood and convenient spot for us in Danville, Va. with convenient shopping access for us as well as Hwy access. Being a Retail Furniture Store Manager myself, Rebecca did a great job with the Decor in the home and making sure even though people travel from far and near that there is always a home like feel. Rebecca did a great job with checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything and that everything was going smoothly but not too much where we felt bothered or uncomfortable. The house has a very Clean and cozy feel and the check-in, check-out, and stay instructions where clear with 24hr contact info just incase we needed anything. My family , my team and I would definitely be back to book with Rebecca the next time we are near the area and would definitely recommend this property to anyone."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very rarely are we this pleased with a place we stay. This home was fantastic. VERY clean and a perfect ""home away from home"" feel. Rebecca definitey cares for her company. It shows in every detail throughout the house. From treats and snacks to munch while unpacking to the softest white towels to dry off with... she really has thought of everything! We will definitely come back!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Rebecca is an exceptional host! Place was as advertised and more! Spacious enough to accommodate our family of 6. Good, quiet neighborhood with a park near. Convenient to downtown Danville, Reidsville, NC and more! Would definitely rent from Rebecca again! Thanks Rebecca!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This is a beautiful home in a great neighborhood in the heart of Danville. Check in was extremely easy and Rebecca has the home equipped with everything you will need for your stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"CLEAN and Comfortable with wonderful accommodations
Rebecca is a great Host
Highly recommend for a pleasant stay
We were impressed by the quality of the furnishings and how well the home is maintained
Will book again on our next visit to the area"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,It’s An amazing place to stay. Very quiet neighborhood
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely, spacious, and quiet place to stay. Since Lynchburg was raising prices for places to stay during the University's graduation, we decided to stay an hour away south. Four adults and a youngster were comfortably happy in Rebecca's home. Lovely roses outside. My priorities include cleanliness, good showers/water, spaces to hang out comfortably, and quietness. This place offered all of that plus a great kitchen and a lovely little town in which to find a couple places to dine. Danville is a sweet community."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a great stay as always! The home is as described and the host is very friendly and responsive. You can also see my previous review for a more in-depth review!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,better than advertised
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"The host was very responsive and the home was spacious, clean, well-appointed, and seemed be in a safe neighborhood. Our family will definitely try to stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"The 6 of us had a great stay!
There’s always a little worry for us when booking a place for an extended stay. Here are a few things that were great with this home that you won’t need to worry about:
Communication with Rebecca (the host) was absolutely great! She was always fast to respond and was very hospitable and accommodating!
The internet has great speeds! Multiple of us could be working on our laptops and phones while someone else was streaming shows or playing video games online without it causing any speed issues.
Water pressure is great! We’ve dealt with poor water pressure before in homes. This home has great water pressure in the showers and the water stays hot.
The home has great natural lighting and great lighting in general! Something else we’ve experienced is homes and hotel rooms is poor lighting. No one wants to feel like they’re in a dungeon all day. This home has great lighting!
This home is in a nice quite neighborhood! We had zero issues with loud or bothersome neighbors. The area is very quite and peaceful. Even though it’s near to other homes during the day we saw lots of squirrels, birds, and rabbits in the front and back yard. One night about 7 deer visited the front lawn.
The kitchen has modern updated appliances and all the kitchenware you’ll need to make meals for a large group.
The home is about a 5 minute drive from all of Danville’s restaurants and stores.
There’s more to add but hopefully this helps answer concerns you may have before booking.
The only thing I’d say to keep in mind is that this is a renovated older home, but even though some elements of the home have a dated feel (floors, cabinets, etc.) we all loved it. All the girls felt it added charm and character. Recently we’ve only stayed in modern homes but we honestly enjoyed this home more than those.
Side note: The home is about a 5 minute drive from the Danville River Walk Trail. If you enjoy the outdoors or need a peaceful break we’d highly recommend checking it out!
I hope this review helps you decide if this is home is right for you! If not I know that if you reach out to Rebecca she’ll answer any questions you have!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean, spacious house with lots of character— made for a very comfortable stay. We had our 4-year old with us and were happy to find some toys in the closet, plus a playground just down the street. The place was well-equipped and Rebecca was very responsive. I would recommend checking out this charming house if you’re looking for a place to stay in Danville, whether you’re traveling with kids or not."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Landon’s house is phenomenal. Easily one of the nicest Airbnb’s I have stayed at as well as one of the most flexible owners I have dealt with. We were in town for a wedding and Landon let us check in early to be able to get ourselves ready. Great location. I would definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice and clean house
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed at Landon's house for almost a year during a long-term travel for work and it could not have been any better. Landon is extremely helpful and responsive and took care of me every way he could. The space is clean and beautiful and the beds very comfortable. Landon was respectful of my privacy during my stay and was communicative on when/if they would have to enter the house at all. I will truly miss staying here. Perfect location. Great host!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this home 10 stars I absolutely would! Landon was extremely hospitable and his home felt like our home away from home. The location was extremely easy to find and everything seemed to be 5 minutes away no matter the direction. The pictures don’t do their house justice! I normally travel with all of my own cleaning supplies and everything we needed was already there! The kitchen is fully stocked all the way down to there being coffee and tea options available. I appreciated the black wash clothes for makeup removal and the extra toiletries provided in the event we forgot something. The washer and dryer were amazing to have available and I loved the pots and pans, wine glasses, home like touches, decorations, blankets, mirrors……. You name it and I loved it! OH!!!!! We were in Danville for a funeral and after all of the running we had to do decided that we needed an extra day which Landon ever so graciously extended. We will absolutely be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Landon was an amazing host! The house was a home away from home and the photos displayed were more than accurate! The house had modern furniture, over the top amenities(kuerig with accessories, top notch Bosch kitchen appliances, beverages, etc) and beautiful decor. Landon was very responsive and helpful during my stay ! The location is PRIME, close to everything. Conveniently located 3 minutes from the local hospital, dozens of restaurants, and Averett University ! This is a MUST STAY property , BOOK NOW !! You won’t be disappointed!!"

on us several times during our stay. Would highly recommend this property. More cost effective than staying at a hotel and booking 2-3 rooms for larger families."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great visit at The Marshall House in Danville! The house was beautiful and comfortable, the location was close to everything, and we felt very safe and at home."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while visiting relatives in Yanceyville. We couldn't have been more pleased with the house, the location, with the interior design, comfort of beds... Really everything was as advertised or better. Rebecca was so helpful and went the extra mile to be accommodating. Loved watching cardinals and squirrels from the back deck."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were looking for a comfortable place to have a family reunion and this house was so comfortable, well set up for many, clean and updated. A nice neighborhood to take a walk around and very near DT Danville and the Dan river. My sister lives nearby and she couldn't accommodate guests, so it really worked out well and I hope to come back soon."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Our family thoroughly enjoyed our time together at the Marshall House. The house accommodated all of us with many memories made.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would come back.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"'The Marshall House' proved to be EXACTLY what we needed as out-of-towners. The house was beautifully set-up with modern amenities, and a nice surrounding area. Though the surrounding town is small, it provides plenty to do to keep yourself busy, if you're aiming for a peaceful little getaway. Not to mention, the home was prestine, on a cleanliness scale, which is always reassuring.
Rebecca proved to be a fantastic host, with her responsiveness and friendliness unparalleled.
The ONLY con of the property I could even think of, would be insects in the backyard/surrounding area, but this is at NO FAULT whatsoever to the property owners. But if that's not your speed, then just simply be warned~
Other than that, a truly exceptional experience, and would be an absolute go-to location, should we return to the area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy walking distance to Averett University, where I was attending a conference. Plenty of space for my family to travel with me! Our stay was during some hot weather, but the window units were able to keep the house comfortable. The window units do add some background white noise, which was perfect for us as some of the family could easily sleep in and not be disturbed by the early risers!
Clean, attractive decor, and nice neighborhood which felt safe to walk after dark. Assortment of snacks in the kitchen. Easy check-in & check-out."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is lovely. My co-workers & I felt at home. It’s tranquil atmosphere made it hard to work. The house is very clean & decorated nicely. Hopefully, it will be available when we are working in Danville. We’ve decided to make it our home away from home."

The neighbor hood is quiet and the neighbors are friendly. We all had ample space and the space was well kept and clean. We would certainly re book.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was remarkably clean. I walked in to the smell of freshness all around which I fully appreciated. Marisa and Natalie was awesome hosts, they were kind and flexible. Now back to the home, the bedrooms were all well appointed with everything you could possibly need. The linen closet was fully stocked, and this was the first Airbnb that I ever stayed with dark towels which I truly appreciated (especially when traveling with a toddler). The kitchen was awesome, huge, bright and very clean. Overall I give this home a 10 out of 10. The only minor issue was that a neighbor complained saying we were being loud which was absolutely untrue. It was 9 pm and we were sitting in the backyard having a drink and reminiscing with our children. However, Marissa contacted me and was very nice about it. Again, I appreciated her proactive approach. As long as this house is available I wouldn’t want to stay anyplace else while I’m In Danville."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our group was pleased with this property. It was very clean & well stocked with items a guest might need (phone chargers in bedrooms, plenty of bath towels, dishes). It had great, off the street, parking & good exterior lighting. The host was professional & prompt in responding when contacted. Everyone agreed they would stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was very smooth. Beds were comfortable and everything was very clean. And we appreciated the flexibility of the late check out 🙂
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was everything my family hoped it would be and more! We are so glad we decided to stay here! To say this house is well equipped would be an understatement.
We were so impressed with how thoughtful things were laid out and how intentional everything was labeled. Property management is excellent and very fast to address any questions! My family would stay here again without question! Rest easy with this choice- you won't be sorry!
P.S. Our family Dog gives this Airbnb two paws way up!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family came to Danville to grieve the very sudden loss of a loved one. Under those circumstances it was especially helpful to have Marissa & Nathalie as hosts.

One lovely surprise was the rainbows that shone through the transom windows when the sun came up in the mornings, it was beautiful.

The elegant suite was immaculate and just as pictured with lovely antiques and a very comfy canopy bed. William checked with me several times during my visit to see if I needed anything.
The location is perfect with parking right in front. Try Crema & Vine wine bar/coffee shop down the street. The pizza was delicious.
I had a wonderful visit and I hope to stay here again. William is truly a Super Host and provides a 5 Star Experience!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for hosting my short stay 🙏🏾
I was welcomed at the front door and shown to a very comfortable, clean, cozy, and well-appointed room on the second floor.
In the best way, I felt like I'd arrived by train or trolley at Scandinavian or Central European guest house.
The house feels like a home - huge, cared for, and full. I'm certain there were other guests, but my space was quiet and private, while still airy and well lit.
I was comfortable coming and going about my business as I pleased without worrying about disturbing others. Really, the suite was so cute that I could have spent my entire stay inside.
The snacks were heavensent, and the coffee was perfect. I would definitely stay again. 10 of 10 will recommend."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is a most gracious host. His goal is to make you happy, which he did. Relaxing in the claw foot bathtub and sleeping on that glorious bed brought me back to my youth. He even had a chenille bedspread, just like I used to have! The home was quiet and peaceful. We really rested well. It’s a lovely, well kept, older home. I highly recommend this Air B&B."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"very friendly and helpful but non intrusive William went the extra mile with little extras he made available. There is a wonderful front porch shaded with rather unusual trees, wonderful rocking chairs, a citronella candle and overhead fan.The home is across from a local college, a beautiful neighbor in hood in front and behind the home safe for walking. The Casino is now in operation in a temp building in Danville."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,William is the best abnb host. My sister was visiting from the UK and he was terrific with everything...made it very easy. The accomodations are comfortable and very roomy. The house is absolutely beautiful inside and out. Thank you William!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! This is a gorgeous home and the suite is very spacious. I was traveling with my infant and her pack-n-play fit perfectly in the dressing room so it was a great make-shift nursery space. However, due to the impeccable delicate furnishings, this may not be a fit for those with mobile little ones! It was the perfect space for us as we traveled to visit family in the neighborhood - the location is great, we took a nice walk down west main st to Crema&Vine and other local businesses. Lastly, William couldn’t be a friendlier or more accommodating host! We hope to be back again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"William was a friendly, gracious, and hospitable host. The house, room, and bathroom we're very clean and everything was easily accessible to us.

He's one of those warm host who expects you to come and helps you to settle in the house. When you leave, he would be there at the door simply trying to be helpful. He's a true host who act like one of your family members. You can tell he's very considerate of us travelers as the room have basically everything you might need. The house is historical with a lot of stories. Location is great with walking distance to everywhere. Wonderful experience would strongly recommend."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William, thank you for your beautiful place, some good discussions and your warm heart.
The bed was so comfortable.
I do recommend everybody read the full description of William's house, as there are stairs to climb and there are two steps up to the canopy bed also lol.
Your place is amazing William, thank you for everything."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of my new favorite places to stay. I will use William's flat again. The bed was not only beautiful, but it was also comfortable.

I highly recommend staying in Danville with William."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at William's couldn't have been more relaxing and comfortable. The house is filled with beautifully restored furniture, and my room looked like a work of art, so different from cookie-cutter hotel rooms. The gorgeous four-poster bed was super comfortable, and I loved the extra touches - separate small vanity room with coffee table, plenty of reading lamps, and book selection. The house is in a lovely historic neighborhood, and William was extremely welcoming and considerate."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,William was a great host. Everything was perfect.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and son enjoyed renting the room in this house very much. My son liked that it was a ""cool, old house,"" and he said ""comfy bed, nice, old-fashioned shower that was a good height (he is 6'3"") with good water pressure."" My husband shared that this house is beautiful, the host was very friendly and helpful, the room itself was comfortable, large, and just nice to be in. If you like staying in a place that feels special, has character, and is VERY nice, relaxing and welcoming, this is the place for you."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was happy with my stay. The suite was lovely. The bed was very comfortable. Loved the tub and shower head. William was professional, kind and knowledgeable about the area. He was very accommodating to our needs.

I especially enjoyed the opportunity to stay in a historical 100 year plus home with all the beautiful details."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great, unique experience! William’s home is unique, the room and bathroom were unique and authentic to the period of the house.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Superb stay. William was more than gracious. I got delayed and did not arrive until 15 minutes after midnight. He waited up for me on the front porch. The room was lovely. Had a marvelous private bathroom.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our first experience with Airbnb. William made it a total success. His attention to detail and concern for his tenants is unbelievable. Communication from start to finish was stellar. The accommodations were everything that was advertised. William is a true professional and I would recommend anyone staying in the Danville Va area to look him up. You won’t be disappointed. 5 stars do not rate the experience. 10 stars would be a better rating.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,Don’t expect near and orderly. Great host but house needs lots of decluttering.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is located, along with other beautifully maintained large houses, in Danville’s Historic Old West End. The guest suite has everything you could need and decorated with restored antiques. William was a great communicator. He truly wants his guest to have a positive experience. I visited here by myself for a quick work trip. Some last minute changes occurred to my itinerary and William was still able to connect with me to ensure I received a proper welcome. Definitely a great stay and value especially when compared to the other local hotel options. Smaller room between the large bedroom and connected bathroom was perfect for taking work calls and doing some quick computer work. Some walkable food/coffee options about 10 minutes from the house. Would definitely stay here again."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is exactly as described: lovely. William met me in the driveway and carried in my bags-what a nice surprise! I had been traveling for weeks and had refrigerator items, but the room I had booked did not have a fridge. William offered to switch me to the room upstairs (which is normally booked by long-term guests), which had a refrigerator and small apartment feel to it. It was perfect-a peaceful retreat. The bed had a Norwegian down comforter, which kept me oh-so-cozy, the room had its own heating and cooling unit with remote, a small seating area and large desk, and the bathroom was very modern and spotless. I had everything I needed for a peaceful rest."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is the hostess with the mostess. LOL. He greeted me at the front door, took my bag inside. Showed me to my wonderful suite with the private bath.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"On a scale of 1-5 this stay is a 10. It is a beautiful home, most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in, central to everything, and the host is one of the kindest people I’ve ever interacted with. If you’re on the fence about weather to stay or not just do yourself a favor and stay here. You’ll be thankful that you did."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay at this air BnB. William was the perfect host, anticipating everything I needed. The bed was extremely comfortable.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,William is a host a cut above the rest. Truly a pleasure to speak with and he provided every amenity. The Bedroom i stayed in made me feel like a prince and william did nothing to dispel that notion. Truly one of my favorite airbnb experiences

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not much to say. Exactly as described. Needed a place to sleep for one night. It was clean, quiet, dark, and cool. What else to ask for? Bed was a little soft maybe, but hey - that's just me being picky. William was very nice - offered me a ride to where I needed to go (I didn't need it because a friend of mine picked me up, but still). Had a nice chat when I checked in and out."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful historic neighborhood in a great location! The restored interior of the home was absolutely stunning and filled with beautiful period pieces and artfully paired and placed antique and vintage decor! William was so friendly and welcoming and I absolutely fell in love with his story of working in his family's clothing store as a child and learning how to put together patterns for a suit, which influences his decorating today! I will stay here again anytime we have the chance. This is THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED you will ever sleep in, people!!! Memory foam mattress, topped with more memory foam, down topper, and down comforter! Woweee! There is also a white noise machine (LOVED), and many books to choose from, including some on local history. Thanks again William!!"

William’s place is highly recommended if your ever in Danville!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I was looking for a private bed and bath that my daughter and I would feel safe in while looking at Averett University. William is a wonderful host with a wonderful room within steps of Averett’s main campus. The room is exactly as described. Do your research and feel confident that this is a safe and clean place to lay your head while in Danville.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"William is very hospitable! He greeted my daughter and I and brought our bags in for us! He was quick to respond when I contacted him several times and very accommodating! Thank you so much for your hospitality! The house is lovely and reminds me so much of my grandparents. I felt at home there. The suite is spacious and I liked the three connected spaces which gave us plenty of privacy for changing. I rested well. My daughter loved it as well, especially climbing up into the tall bed, which was like sleeping on a cloud. I plan to stay again in the future since Meghan will be there for the next four years. I love that it is across the street from the university. Thank you again William!!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am moving to Danville in a few weeks and needed a place to stay while I was apartment hunting. After driving six hours, William let me and my friend check in early to accommodate my schedule. Upon arrival, he came out to greet us and carried our bags into the room for us. He was very kind and gave me a history of the city I will soon call home. The room was very spacious, with ample space for multiple people. He gave my friend and I a bottle of wine and put it on ice in our room after a long day of apartment hunting. The next morning, when he knew we were awake, he knocked on the door with hot coffee. This was a great stay in a beautiful, historic home. I would highly recommend staying with William on your visit to Danville!"
2018-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Historic home on a great street of historic homes near downtown Danville. William is an interesting host with extensive knowledge of Danville.

2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there was a ten star option the host would definately get one from us. He was extremely attentive to our needs, and our room was exactly as described. We absolutely loved staying here, and have plans on rebooking in June. LOVED the host and accommodations!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is a welcoming, kind and helpful host. The communication around the booking went super smooth. The house is a few minutes drive (or a nice hike) from the café’s and restaurants in the Danville River District. The bedroom and private bathroom were spacious and clean. The bed was very comfy. William offered great amenities, like parking, towels, and a coffee/water/snacks corner in the room. William also had great tips on where to go for dinner."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic space that’s separate from the host so you don’t feel like you’re intruding. A large suite to yourself that mimics a 4 to 5 star stay at any hotel I’ve been to!
The bed is extremely comfy and ensuite feels very ‘homey’
It’s located in a cute neighbourhood with some fantastic buildings and wildlife along the many walking routes accessible from the house
For the price you’d be mad not to choose this place!"

2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, antique, charm! Had everything I needed. William was a great host and the room was very comfortable. He's a craftsman and finds lovely pieces to restore; some he keeps, some he sells. The house is lovingly restored, bed was comfortable, shower was hot, parking was easy. Bring your laptop or tablet and enjoy your stay. I also appreciated the dinner suggestions as well as the snacks and coffee. If I'm in the area again, I'll be back!"

2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is only one word to describe the suite and Chris hospitality - OUTSTANDING!
I had travelled from England with my son who was starting at the University - so I was feeling quite anxious. This soon evaporated as soon as I saw where I was staying. Chris couldn't have been more hospitable. I would highly recommend this place for others to stay at."

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,William is a most gracious host and insures guests are comfortable and receive personal attention. The home is beautiful and what he has done with interior decorating is stunning. His knowledge of antique furniture and history are obvious as soon as you walk in the door. A true time capsule. Feels like a museum. Highly recommended and I cannot wait for my next visit.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"William was extremely polite and accommodating. He welcomed me into his home by carrying my bags from my car for me. If and when I make it back to Danville, I will definitely stay at William's home again."

He briefly went over everything in the room. There were even snacks and water. The bed...omg...the bed. I fell in love with it. It was incredibly comfortable and I slept better than I do at home. William was very responsive with any questions or requests. He made some awesome restaurant recommendations. If you are planning a trip to the Danville area, you should stay here. We will definitely be back the next time we attend a race at VIR."

2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying in an Airbnb, and the experience was so nice I will definitely do it again. I loved staying at William's house. I had to be in Danville for work for two whole weeks, but I was very happy in my room. William's house was so much more comfortable than any of the hotels in the area in the same price range, and the house was decorated beautifully, with small thoughtful touches. The pictures on the Airbnb site don't do it justice. Another perk is that William is a very gracious host. He provided snacks and bottled water, as well as coffee and tea in the room, and he gave me suggestions about dining in Danville. All of which were great! I really liked having a local's perspective on the area. I really can't think of a single thing I didn't like about the place. Definitely far superior to any of the hotels/motels in Danville if you're staying for longer than one or two days. I highly recommend this place!"
2017-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was nice.
2017-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"First Airbnb experience. William's communications before our stay was great. Even though we got there late, we were greeted with a smile and a warm welcome.

2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first experience with Airbnb and we could not have picked a better host. William clearly communicated all we needed to know. The suite was clean and well appointed. The bed was amazingly comfortable as well as beautiful. Parking was easy and check-in and check-out convenient. We'll stay with William again on future visits to Danville area.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place! William is always welcoming and the place is nice and cozy. The dining suggestions were also excellent! Looking forward to another visit soon!

William is a very gracious and helpful host and this is definitely going to be my first choice of accommodation anytime I am in Danville."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very enjoyable time at William's beautiful home in Danville, Virginia. It was an absolute delight to talk with him over a glass of wine upon our arrival as we found out that we share some similar travel interests. William was available for us throughout our stay to help meet any needs we had, and he was accommodating to our very early departure. I would definitely recommend William's Air B&B experience to any traveler passing through. Thank you, William for a great experience."

So far, it's my best experience with airbnb. The bedroom is extremely comfortable with a climb and its own bathroom. Everything is very finely decorated. The bed is very comfortable with an excellent mattress and very good quality sheets and towels. If you have to travel to Danville, it's the perfect place to stay. William, thanks a lot for your hospitality, for the coffee and for everything. You made me feel at home. Hope to be there next year."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Appreciate you being so flexible with our arrival! Your dinner recommendation of Joe and Mimmas was off the chart - Hannah mentioned it was the best red sauce she had ever had, although the restaurant was a bit of a throw back!

The house was great, location wonderful and made our campus visit a breeze!
Thanks William!!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here in the Master Suite for a night while in town for a wedding at Gentry Farm in Ringgold.

We went to the Golden Leaf Bistro after our event for drinks and really enjoyed it."

If we are every coming through the Danville region again, we will definitely stay here."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This beautiful space is my ""go to"" place to book when making trips to VA. The suite is spacious and the very tall bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Chris is a thoughtful host who enjoys sharing the history of the home and region."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"William is an excellent host with a wealth of knowledge of the surrounding area. His place is a wonderful early-1900’s historic home. It is beautifully appointed, clean, comfortable, and safe. I had a very enjoyable visit, had a great night’s sleep, and thoroughly enjoyed the reading area; that was a bonus. If you have an interest in architecture, appreciate antiques, or just want a good night’s sleep; this is the place for you. I highly recommend this listing."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"William's place was delightful, a warm welcome and a restful stop. We so appreciated the beautiful historic home with the perfect suite accommodations and William's recommended Italian eatery was THE BEST.
Such a nice host offering beautiful accommodations in a charming locale.
If you have an opportunity, stay there."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were shown our room & the kitchen. Breakfast was offered however we left very early the next day so declined.
The neighborhood is really cute. Many older homes, most renovated to some degree and well kept. Easy access off the highway."
2016-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"William made me feel comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the chair with the light by the bed was great for reading. The shower worked great for me, although it might be difficult for someone with less mobility. The front porch was nice to sit on in the evening. I was looking forward to the additional third room advertised, although it turned out to be too small for any use."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent host!! Was very warm and welcoming. His home is beautiful and kept up very well. It gives you an early 1900's feel.

We enjoyed great conversations with William, and we would definitely return if we are ever I the area again.

We stayed in Danville to attend a Virginia International Raceway event. Anyone wanting to attend VIR event should seriously consider staying with William, as the trip is only thirty minutes at most.

William's neighborhood is rich with ""turn of the century"" homes. It is a lovely area to visit."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room was lovely, and William was a welcoming host. I especially appreciated his flexibility in accommodating our schedule. He also provided nice amenities for us; towels, soap, shampoo, and refreshments were waiting in the room for us. There were 2 minor drawbacks: (1) We could not access the wi-fi; William said it was flaky, and (2) There is a railroad line nearby, so trains can be heard at night, but probably not loud enough to wake you unless you're a very light sleeper. All in all, we would recommend this host."
2016-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"William was very welcoming and gracious. He accommodated us last minute, was kind and very warm. He made himself available and the room was just as pictured. House is cute with a lot of character and place was clean. I would definitely recommend it and if my husband and I end up back in Danville for any reason we would reach out to William again."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chris is an incredible host and great conversationalist on many topics. The house and rooms are exactly as posted. He even made room in the frig for my stay. Very helpful when it came to directions to get somewhere. The house is absolutely beautiful and I am so thankful I found this gem tucked away in Danville.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience in a lovely historic home! William was a thoughtful host and we had a very comfortable stay.
