We stayed at Christmas time, and the house was all decorated for Christmas when we arrived. It was the perfect location for me when visiting family, and was right off of the highway so it made it was very convenient for that reason as well! We stayed with our dog, and Rita even made sure to leave a roll of dog bags out for us, which was so kind! Thank your the wonderful stay! :)"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Rita is a great host!! EVERYTHING is already at the house that you would need to feel right at home! Stayed once before and was even more exciting to stay this time with the Halloween and Fall decorations that she added. Also liked the screened in porch area that was added from the previous stay. Both additions made it more of a home like feel! Ample space in the house and for a great price!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Good place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A comfortable and cozy home in a laid-back country town. Lots of room, with a big laundry room and a big enclosed front porch. The kitchen was well-equipped. Beds were comfortable , plenty of water pressure and hot water in the shower. A big lot with lots of parking.
Rita was very responsive, and our only regret was that we didn't get to meet her because she had to go out of town. However her daughter, whom we met, was very close to back her up if needed.
If we need to return to the area, we would definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was probably our favorite Airbnb that we have stayed at everything was perfect! My daughter didn’t wanna leave and it’s already making plans for our next visit!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful weekend! This airbnb was not far from Watkins Glen which was just what we needed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for an affordable place to stay about 20 minutes from Ithaca College. The place was super clean and our host was so friendly and accommodating. Would stay again in the future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed 9/8-9/12 and the only downfall is I couldn’t live here permanently. The air bnb is chíc and comfortable. There is everything you need from shampoo, body wash,towels, kitchenware every appliance needed and even fun games. Oh and IDK what she uses but her blankets smell amazing! Abra is super thoughtful and even leaves goodies for you!
The bed is super comfortable( ive stayed in tons of air bnbs and this is far the best sleep Ive ever had)
The pool is just right it has a shallow and deep end and in the right season is amazing to enjoy. Although the house is attached we had all the privacy we asked for!
It is 40 minutes from Corning Museum of Glass and Watkins Glen park which are the two musts when visiting!
Check-in is super easy as well, which is important after a long drive! We brought our dog and she had ample space to run and I felt super safe leaving her while we went to the museum! Thank you Abra well be back !!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Abra was great, and the guest suite was exactly as it’s described, would really recommend for a weekend getaway full of hiking and wineries."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I wish that I could give this home 10 stars. My Husband and I are from the area but live out of state now. We traveled home for our wedding week and needed our own space with our fur babies. Not only was Abra’s home beautiful and peaceful, she had EVERYTHING one could possibly need. Upon arrival we noticed that the fridge was stocked with waters, eggs, coffee creamer, and syrup (all the things people usually forget to bring with them). The coffee bar was easily the highlight of the kitchen amenities!!
In the bathroom there were even extra toiletries for guest that may have forgotten some essentials!
The hospitality, communication, and flexibility has been unmatched to any of our previous Air BnB stays. Highly recommend and given our frequent visits to the area, we will definitely be returning!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely would want to stay here again!!!!!!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The place was definitely clean. Abra made sure to communicate with us to make sure all was going well and ask if we needed anything.
For our purposes to get to the state parks and finger lakes, this was a good choice."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice quiet location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was visiting a friend in Ithaca and this place was perfect, far enough to feel like a little escape, and close enough to hop right over in the morning.
It was such a treat to be able to bring my dog with me! We appreciated the calm and clean space Abra provided."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great please to stay! A beautiful, quiet, peaceful little place. Abra was very responsive and made sure our stay was all good! The only con to staying was that it was a little far away from things to do but besides that it was great!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean & Cozy!
This is the cleanest AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in. It was spotless!
And everything was so cozy. The couch and the bed. Ohhhh, the bed!!! The bed was SO comfortable! I want to buy the same exact one for myself! Even the sheets & towels were soft and cozy. I kid you not, they were the softest I’ve ever used.
Icing on the cake - This place is so darn cute. Love the decor! Tasteful but not overdone. Will definitely be staying here again!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place for all types of stay. Definitely recommend this property and will be going again in the near future. 10/10
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was by far the best experience we ever had . The place and surroundings were beautiful and peaceful. Would highly recommend. Will be using this place again for sure.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the relaxing night stay! Stayed here before a trail race at Mt. Pisgah. We didnt get in til late and Stacy was very accommodating and helpful. The farm is beautiful and peaceful. We loved the complementary handmade milk soap!

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Used this as a stopping point for a road trip with two dogs and two kids and it worked for what we needed it for!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stacey’s place was very close to Mt Pisgah State Park. We loved the fireplace in the living room and the country setting was restful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stacy’s was amazing! Incredibly clean, wholesome, and comfortable home feeling! Would stay again and recommend anyone thinking about staying to do it! Thank you Stacy and her family! The farm is beautiful!!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,I enjoyed my stay and can't wait to come back
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stacy’s place is clean and cozy. We were only here overnight, but I’d happily come back.
I see several other reviews mention road noise - it’s true that the house is close to the road, but I personally didn’t find there to be much noise, if any. The cows were louder ;)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, peaceful and relaxing!!! Perfect for us!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed the comfort this home. Really nice place. Very cozy.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had a good stay! We came up to visit my son for the weekend who is a student at Mansfield and this worked out because it is only about 30 minutes from campus. The farmhouse has all amenities of home (minutes a microwave) with a huge bathroom, fireplace and a nice firepit with firewood provided. There were also sanitary napkins available in the bathroom which came in handy. There is also a dog and cat that roams around. The only things I noticed were the steps are wobbly coming up onto the porch, the bedrooms do not have dedicated doors; they have barn doors which can be difficult maneuver (declined to have the host fix it when I brought it to her attention) so you can't fully close off the bedrooms. There is a lot of road noise, so if you are a light sleeper you will not enjoy the location. Communication was fine while we were there but beforehand it was slow and I had to follow up each time before receiving a response which is surprising for a super host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great,everything was provided that we needed. We had a rainy weekend,but the place was warm and and cozy."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ve been here a few times. It’s such a beautiful spot!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfy accommodation. Stacy is very responsive. Well maintained neat and clean place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay if you are in the area!!! Sure beats the local motel!!!
Stacey and her family are great hosts….. highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was only a quick overnight stay. My boys were going up to run a tough mudder race. The location was convenient, clean and matched the description. Saving this location for a return trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great two night stay. We had an issue with heater and Stacy was quick to resolve it. We also had a wonderful time meeting the cows in the farm up-close!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable farmhouse! My family and 2 dogs thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had a friendly visit from a farm dog and an adorable farm kitten! Our pups made fast friends! We enjoyed sitting on the front porch and just catching up with our daughter! Very homey!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Just a quick overnight stay but everything was great!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were so glad to be back at Stacy's dairy farm residence. We feel so at home in this fully equipped yet quaint house in its glorious hilly setting, we might just stop by to say hello when passing through."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"It was fun being on the farm and seeing the friendly cats, dog, and cows! Only 15 minutes to ""The Barn"" wedding venue in Ulster, PA. We also enjoyed our lunch at Shore Sisters in Towanda."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The area is lovely and the cats are welcoming you on the porch. Very nice and relaxing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"a simple but very clean place. we had a restful stay for one night on our way home from Canada, with our dog. it was fun to play with the animals on the farm."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A cute and comfortable farmhouse located right on a dairy farm. Everything was as described and the room was clean and tidy. Definitely would stay here again! Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a self-contained apartment in a farmhouse on a large dairy farm that is located far from any restaurants or stores. The kitchen would be great for cooking ones own meals (but my family only was there one night, unfortunately). The host's family is very friendly, and so are the kittens and dog. We loved this stay. We will definitely return one day. Just to set expectations, it is important to realize that a dairy farm includes strong smells. We got used to it quickly. The tranquility of the setting is unique and much appreciated"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage had beautiful sceanary and was cleaned well. We’d definitely stay here again. Our dog enjoyed the open yard. Our car had a flat and the owners helped get us up and running! Great stay :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've always wanted to milk a cow. As a child, when I saw people on TV struggling to work the teets with their hands, I always thought I'd be able to do it better. I still have yet to experience that (or be proven wrong), but at age 59, this tranquil setting with the cows nearby is just perfect for my sensibilities. What an incredible view of undulating hills and farmlands stretching to the horizon. I spent a night in this lovely farmhouse with my husband and two dogs while doing some work in Athens, PA, as an alternative to a very expensive average chain hotel in the area. What an absolute treat. And since it was toward the end of our long road trip from Chicago, I was able to watch TV, get online to catch up on work, and finish a load of laundry before going to bed. But the most memorable piece was taking the dogs out for a last walk and finding a full moon so bright, we could see our shadows as we walked the vast lawn between the house and two barns with the sounds of cows stirring."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, beautiful location; comfortable home; responsive, welcoming hosts; working dairy farm with friendly cows and cats - a perfect place to rest for the evening and cook a nice meal."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our short stay at Stacy’s farmhouse. The home was perfect for the three of us, it was super clean, cute decors and private. Definitely recommend the place for anyone who enjoys breathtaking views of endless farmlands and beautiful sunsets. Oh and the cows and kittens, they were amazing to hangout with :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this house. Everything was spotless and clean. The beds were comfortable. Beautiful and peaceful place to stay. It felt like home. I highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a comfortable stay on this working dairy farm. Gracious hosts, friendly greeting from Timber the dog, and snuggles with one of the young kittens on the big wrap-around porch. The apartment was spacious and clean and air-conditioned. Views of cornfield.
The retro coffee maker/toaster oven/griddle was perfect for breakfast. We only stayed one night but if you stayed longer, there’s a big laundry room."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed a peaceful weekend at the farm with family and our dog. Had our morning tea on the front porch with a fog hanging over the surrounding hills and farmland. Met with Stacy and her family and they were wonderful people. Saw the cows and a newborn calf. Excellent experience overall.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so glad the farmhouse was available for us to stay again! It’s has everything we need, is very clean, and is in a beautiful place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kittens were just very fond of us, visitors.
At n T service was dead for 10 miles near the place. But house was easy to find as far as you got GPS"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I have stayed at several rentals throughout the county, and this was my teenage girls’ favorite place! The house itself was cozy and we never heard the person living upstairs. We felt comfortable and welcome. My girls had so much fun playing with the dog and cats on the property and we all enjoyed visiting with the cows and watching the inner workings of a dairy farm. The entire property was gorgeous and offered up an amazing sunset. We grabbed pizza from Vinnie’s in Troy on the way in….highly recommend. Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here! It has character, it’s super clean, and Stacy is very helpful!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is one of our favorite Airbnbs we have stayed at. Stopped for a night traveling through from Massachusetts to Indiana. Was an amazing experience to really step into a working farm environment. Coffee on the farmer’s porch with pristine views while watching and hearing the cows, kittens, and chocolate lab was something me and my family won’t soon forget. This was an experience that makes Airbnb the way to travel. A slice of American life that just isn’t easy to access and experience up close. Recommend in every way. Thanks again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to overnight. It is on a working dairy farm so is in a rural agricultural setting.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,nice place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this place it was a beautiful setting, very peaceful, and driving through the surrounding countryside was a treat."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,very nice
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. The cow farm was of course our highlight. On top of their cute dog Timber. Highly recommend staying here. :)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay with everything you need to be cozy. Getting to see all the cows was so fun!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at the farm for our short night. It was clean, easy to access, and everything you could need inside. It was even nicer and cozier than the pictures let on. Getting to meet the cows in the morning is an amazing added bonus, they’re stingy with their kisses but a few can be wooed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very cute & spacious space! Located on a dairy farm, it has tons of charm and all the amenities you could want. A well stocked kitchen, TVs with roku, wifi, plenty of towels, laundry, huge bathtub. I felt right at home and didn’t want to leave! It was also just so cute!
Host is super accommodating and was flexible with my changing travel plans. Dog friendly and so many
cool spaces for the dog to sniff. Also, space was very clean.
I would love to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful farm
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A charming sweet place. Loved the tub
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacy’s place is one of our favorites to stay in. Always clean, always relaxing, and always reliable. Seeing the sweet cows in the pasture is always a plus as well 🐮"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Good times and highly recommended.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stop by on a drive through. Great people. It’s a legit farm so it will have farm smell. But the inside was completely fine. Though I did not use it, the firepit was super conveniently located with stars at night. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It is a self-contained dwelling in a house (it is only the first floor of a two-storey house). Very clean and pretty. We arrived late at night and in the morning we visited the cows. Too bad we couldn't stay any longer.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect! It had everything that we needed, and was very comfortable. I would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet farmhouse that was perfect for our short overnight stay. That tub! It was the first time I could lie down in a bath as an adult!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiance and I really enjoyed our stay. Stacy was very accommodating and friendly. We will definitely be back in the future!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"First off, this is a very cozy place to stay and perfect for people who don’t mind lack of privacy. It is a shared farmhouse and it is clean. Had a shower and tub showed in the pictures and washer and dryer. The kitchen has a range and full size fridge and freezer but there was no microwave but they had a 3-in-1 toaster oven, 3 cup coffee pot, and grill. Sink area with plenty of dishes and silverware. The bedroom with the queen size bed has one power outlet which is enough if you don’t need to plug in a lot of stuff. There were two tvs in the place. Plenty of extra bedding if needed. The cows were cute. It is next to a busy road so you have the noise from that and light from a street light shining in the bedroom window. Despite all that it was still worth it for us and we found it cute and cozy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable shared farmhouse the sweetest farm dog so friendly to us and my dog. I loved seeing the baby cows! Beautiful view from porch. The bathtub was an amazing treat.

The washer/dryer were especially appreciated after a full day out in the rain. Stacy and her family were great hosts. Watching the work that goes into a dairy farm will make you appreciate your next double scoop of icecream.
We hope to make it back next year."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Noisy. Right on hwy. noise from people upstairs. No pots or pans. Couldn’t even boil water. Cumbersome, small place. Wouldn’t recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will surely enjoy your visit to Stacy's Farm stay! All the comforts of home away from home, including very comfortable beds and a huge bathroom with a great shower. Only a short drive to Troy and Sayre, but so cozy and relaxing just to hang out at the farmhouse. We loved it! You won't be disappointed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely Amazing, definitely a 5 star review from me, everything went so well and smooth"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely worth the money. We loved the trough and unique amenities, like the 3/1 coffee pot and toaster. Thank you."

The porch is really nice to spend morning with family as it has ample space, scenic view and rays from the rising sun to sit with the family and enjoy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Couldn’t ask for a more relaxing place to stay the night before a trail run at Pisgah State Park. Would definitely stay again! Only a few miles away from the park we were able to have a relaxing evening and morning prior to our run for the Chief Westona Challenge.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Accurate pictures of the space. It may have been helpful to include an outside pic of the building. I’m originally from the area but still would have liked an outside pic. The location was nice. Quick walk to dandy mini mart convenience store and great cafe across the street. Don’t let the stairway and hallway mislead you… the apartment is very nice, clean and spacious. We had trouble with hit water and Jessica responded very quickly. We communicated frequently and I appreciated that."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an awesome few nights here, it’s right in downtown so make sure you have some coin on you for the meter for street parking! I stayed in this apartment for how close it was to the hospital and it was cheap. I did have to contact the host multiple times due to things out of her control but she was very helpful and always responded quickly. My family and I loved this place and felt right at home. Thank you Jessica!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nicole’s place was clean and bright! I only used the space to sleep and shower. If I had more down time, the space would have been more than enough to be comfortable in. Very cozy. I slept in the bedroom and my son used the pull out in the living room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nicole's apartment was perfect for our weekend away! would gladly stay again if in the area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is in a lovely location with a beautiful view. It is very private and cozy. The owners were sweet and welcoming, I would highly recommend meeting the horses. The bathroom isn’t attached to the cabin but there is a personal porta potty and the full pictured shower a minute away"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin for a quick overnight stay with my dog. There was also a barrel horse competition which was fun to watch!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful stay perfect for a family of 3, the host was incredibly friendly and welcoming. My son had such a wonderful time interacting with the horses and cows, creating special moments that made our visit truly memorable. The cabin itself was stunning—clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed. Despite its secluded, peaceful setting, it was conveniently close to local stores, giving us the perfect balance of tranquility and accessibility. The hosts also provided a high-speed internet connection, which worked great and added to the overall comfort of our stay. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that we thoroughly enjoyed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin was such a great stay - cozy with beautiful surroundings and horses nearby! We watched a clear, unpolluted sky full of stars. Our host has been very friendly and responsive too. Definitely recommend"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay, only one night but wonderful to wake up with the view. The bathroom is a delightful surprise in the horse barn, super warm and clean. Our host was kind, responsive and helpful. Would give 6 stars if I could."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rockin in Ranch was a great place for my partner and I to stay as a getaway from home. The view is beautiful, the horses are fun to be around, and the cabin was amazing. The host is extremely nice and gave us recommendations on where to eat."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, dog and I were staying here while visiting with family over the holidays. I met our host, Nancy, right when we arrived and she showed me around, introduced me to their horses and even let our dog run around in their horse arena. The hosts were beyond lovely and very accommodating. The cabin was cozy and quaint and while the bathroom is about 100 yards away in their barn, there was a porta potty we could use right next to the cabin. It was a charming little holiday getaway and we would for sure stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were recently in Athens, PA for a work event and came across this little gem. The host provided some snacks and water, which was so appreciated after a long day filled with work AND travel! She was also super responsive and thorough with directions/instructions. The cabin itself is quaint, comfortable and clean. From the surrounding hills to the sparkling stars above, the views are absolutely incredible here. We truly enjoyed disconnecting alongside nature and a crackling fire. Not to mention, it's on a horse farm so we actually took some riding lessons before checking out. I was anxious as a first-time rider, but our host, Nancy, made me feel more at ease and is just the sweetest soul!! We look forward to visiting again -- thank you for a lovely stay :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a unique and beautiful property. I stayed for one night and the hosts were very helpful and responsive. The cabin was new and clean - oh, and it DOES have air conditioning! I was cool and comfortable on a hot night. Even though it's a small and cozy space, I felt like I had plenty of room for my suitcase and belongings. The hosts provided a mini fridge (stocked with water bottles), snacks, a coffee maker, and coffee. The porch was lovely and I was encouraged to walk around to greet the horses and cows (which I did, happily!). As is advertised, the bathroom is 100 yards away, but it is brand new and I had no problem with it. The hosts provided all linens and basic toiletries. I was only their second guest, so I'm sure they are still getting into their airbnb groove, but I couldn't tell because they seemed like pros. I had a great experience and would love to go back sometime!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You don't always get what you, but sometimes you get what you need.
I was in a last minute rush and didn't read the listing properly. The beautiful little cabin wasn't what I was expecting. (Literacy is importance, kids.)
No Wi-Fi? Strolls past horses to use the bathroom?
Turns out it was exactly what I needed during a very chaotic family visit. Beautiful view at sunset. Very comfy bed.
Nancy is incredibly kind and they respond very quickly to messages. Great snacks. Little creamer pods (instead of the powdered creamer usually reserved for guests you don't actually like).
Plus the horses are rad. When's the last time you hung out with a horse?"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very good place!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a spectacular Airbnb! The location on the farm is peaceful and beautiful. The place is very dog friendly and ours enjoyed romping around the property and the dog run made late night outings much easier.
The highlight is the kitchen! Not only is it large and perfect for group gatherings, it’s one of the best equipped kitchens I’ve ever seen for an Airbnb. This was very handy for us as we were visiting family in the area for thanksgiving. There was a large crockpot, serving dishes and platters, and even a bread machine. Everything you could imagine needing is available here.
We even had deer, raccoons and groundhogs visit us in the early mornings. Perfect stay for what we needed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful farmhouse in the hills of PA. We loved this peaceful stay and the house was stocked with everything we needed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. House had everything we needed and was on a beautiful and private lot. Not too far to town with things to do.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I want to say Thank you so much for everything, the place was so beautiful and you as well as your daughter were extremely helpful and kind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our group had an absolute BLAST staying here! The property is beyong stunning (the photos don't even do it justice) and the area feels so private and peaceful. The space is cozy and large and we had a great time using the kitchen space. The location is great too as Owego is just a short drive down the road. Cynthia was also super communicative and a fantastic host - we would most definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Cynthia’s place!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"A group of friends went down to watkins glen international, and we decided to try something new and stay in an air bnb. The best choice in my opinion! Was very quiet, nice and clean, and Cynthia was a great host! We will be back next time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying here and it feels like home. Beautiful, comfortable and certainly well appointed and helpful items left for a guest to get started.
We are three generations of family and we are already looking forward to our next visit.
I asked my teenaged grandson what was his favorite part and he said family game nights. I am blessed. Thank you both for everything."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s so nice to get back to the country, the quietness. You forget how quiet quiet actually is. It’s beyond peaceful. My wife and I were just talking how it is a home away from home. We get to bring our dogs, that is so very appreciated. The kitchen is what matters most to me- and Cynthia has it stocked with all the things one needs to prepare a meal. It was a nice looking country house before the updates. - the updates modernized it and look simply FANTASTIC!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable home. I loved the stocked coffee bar and welcome gift. It saved us an immediate trip to the grocery store. The kitchen is well stocked with both spices and ziploc bags for left overs. The house was very clean. Our family would rent this place again without hesitation.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great, peaceful, cozy place to stay. The kitchen was excellent and the beds were comfortable. Everything we might have needed was there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a serene and private place to stay. It fits a lot of people and is both kid and animal friendly. There is a lot of space and fits a lot of people where everyone has their own space.
It was perfect for our stay with friends and close to many beautiful sights like Ithaca and Watkins Glen, as well as Owega and Binghamton.
Cynthia is very communicative and gave easy to follow instructions. They even left us a treat. It was very sweet.
I loved our stay and have no complaints, just some heads up: the county well water has a sulfur smell which can be strong. Come knowing this for your showers and come prepared with spring water to drink. It’s not a big deal but definitely something to come prepared for.
If you’re looking for a cozy and private place this is a perfect spot. Thank you for a great space! If we’re ever back in the area, we will be back."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Well appointed home on a very quiet and private lot. Perfect for my large family group coming into town for a get together. Plenty of room to park and very good WiFi. Furniture was comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Lovely setting. Comfortable beds. Super kitchen.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, the kitchen had everything we needed.
Stock up on gallons of water to drink. , a minor minor detail.
The view- nothing like a NY country view, but I may be bias.
Cynthia and her cohost Shannon are great at communicating, quick to respond and very very accommodating. 10/10"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great outdoor views. Plenty of privacy.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Glorious views, quaint, clean home. Super peaceful atmosphere, exactly what we needed. Wonderful hosts, very thoughtful and had an attention for detail."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was great with this olace! Cynthia and Shannon communicated with me very fast when I had questions.
The place was like in dead end at first we were scared but it was okay, oh! And the stars while we were staying were beautiful! We went out and looked at the stars with kids!
Just one thing that was little hard for us to adjust was the water smell. It smelled like a rotten egg because of the sewer so we had to hold our breath to shower. Were just not used to the smell that is why. But since its an old house we understood that it could happen."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although there was confusion with our reservation, I would suggest using the check-in guide from Airbnb app which is sent automatically to guests prior check-in with step by step guide. There, you can share code details to inform guest the use of last 4 digits from reservation’s phone number . That way guest can follow without the need to call."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The great service and attention started before we arrived and did not stop, even after we left. We loved our stay at Hickory Grove - Farm House Perfect. It actually was perfect for our family. The children enjoyed being able to play safely outside and my 5 year-old grandson kept wanting to sit in the field because he wanted to enjoy the ""biew."" He took photos with his iPad and even drew the skyline for us. We ranged in age from ""chronological adults"" to 2 years-old and everyone loved it.
The kitchen was well equipped and the rooms comfortable and the thoughtfulness and care of the owners was demonstrated in so many ways and appreciated throughout. The rooms and porches were comfortable and welcoming. I can't say enough good things about this home and the folks who own it.
As we drove out of the driveway, I heard the children through the windows saying, ""Bye, we'll see you next year!"" (I said it too.)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was as pictured. It was a peaceful and great place. The hosts were amazing and great with communicating and had everything we needed and then some in the house!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"The farmhouse was perfect for what my friends' and I were looking for. Cynthia and Shannon were incredibly helpful and reached out to make sure everything was as it should be. The location was nice and out of the way, but only 15 minutes away from town. Everything was great!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"What a gem! A super clean, quiet and peaceful spot in a beautiful setting. We were visiting family area and stayed here over the Easter holiday. From the thoughtful extras to great communication, everything was perfect."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice place, good Internet , comfortable beds ,would recommend it to anyone"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a city getaway, look no further! This is your dream spot! We really enjoyed our stay at Cyndi’s. The house was very charming and spacious. The kitchen was well stocked with all essentials. The bathroom was cozy and warm. The beds and linens were super comfortable and clean to the point that we wanted to sleep in all day. We had the best communication with Shannon (Cyndi’s cohost) since Day 1 and throughout our stay. Shannon made herself available for us for anything we would need. She was kind, she checked in with us via text every morning. We swung by the city center of Owego as Shannon recommended. We unbelievably spent solid 4hrs in the gigantic antique mall there. Cyndi and Shannon were so considered. They welcomed us with a gift basket and a box of goodies that survived us the first night we arrived, after our 4hr drive. We loved the location of the house; it was away from neighbors and we felt like we had the world to ourselves. We ran outside with our Corgi pup and chased after him, we played in snow, and a lot more. The house had everything for everyone. High speed internet, smart TV and you name it. You won’t regret staying here. We will come again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and property, friendly host. Perfect country retreat we, along with our pups loved it!"
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,We were only able to stay one night and the weather was bad but we enjoyed our stay .

2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great getaway house with beautiful rural scenery. We enjoyed hiking the land around the property and the kids liked feeding the horses during the farm tour. Hunter, the owner, was very friendly and informative."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Hunter's place! It felt a bit like walking into my grandparent's house when I was a kid--a nice nostalgic feeling. Hunter was very patient with my city kids on our tour of the farm. We had a lovely stay and would love to return.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super beautiful farm and amazing hosts. The kids loved it and had an amazing experience with the family and animals. Definitely will be back. If youre an outdoorsy family this is a great go to. Surrounded by nature and a responsive host. What more could you want ?
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay on the farm. We enjoyed looking at all the antiques around the house. Thanks for letting us stay!
I suggest that renters take a screenshot of the checkin code prior to arriving since there is no cell service in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was really nice and the host was great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We did not stay long due to our plans but Hunters place is beautiful! I will definitely come again but with time to experience the amazing landscape. It’s a must see.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our 3rd visit to Legacy Ranch and it just keeps getting better. Hunter is a spectacular host. We enjoyed meeting all her new animals and see the wonderful changes to the farm!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very friendly host, very clean house. We recommend you to stay with Hunter."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was what we were looking for, about 20 minutes away from Owego, private/quiet. Did the standard farm tour, which was great; got to feed the animals, our host was friendly and knowledgeable."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super friendly hosts, location was great and peaceful. January and it was incredibly warm and cozy"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Miss Hunter was great and very informative. She obviously put a lot of thought into the place. The decor was amazing, including an old (working) record player and an old safe as a night stand. Amazing vibe! Farm tour was very cool too! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a peaceful getaway. If only it would have snowed! One note, cell coverage is spotty at best, so make sure you screenshot your check-in instructions and WiFi password before you arrive."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. This was the first time that we stayed at a working farm. I dealt with animals when I was a kid, but had never been so close to a horse, it was a unique experience for us, especially for my wife who has always lived in the city. She enjoyed the farm tour and interactions with the animals very much. The place was huge, it is super quiet other than the noise of the heating system. It is such a nice change from the city life we live. Our dog enjoyed his stay too. Miss Hunter is very helpful, the best host ever."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful family, the only thing missing was the snow!!! Great location, peaceful!!! Good luck Mable, will visit again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Hunter was very nice and very responsive. She made sure we checked in alright and was respectful to me and my friends. The house was very clean and was pretty as well, gorgeous views. Will stay here again :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunters place was just what we needed for a low-key guys weekend/reunion. Beautiful views every morning and evening, quiet and tucked away but not inconveniently isolated."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful weekend getaway! My girls, 5 and 7, absolutely loved the farm tour and helping out. The hosts were patient, kind and helpful! Certainly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Hunter's beautiful farm was peaceful and wonderful to stay at. Would definitely recommend for anyone traveling across NY or just wants a farmhouse getaway.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, beautiful view of the farm."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We took the farm tour and that was fun. Barn right next door was the focus for us to meet and greet their horses, goats, donky and two geese. The little stream out back was a surprise for our dog who loved wading in the water. I spotted some small native trout before the rains came and muddied up the water. Wildflowers in the field across the stream, Jewelweed, Musk Mallow, Meadow Knapweed, Soapwort and some others I didn't get to identify."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter’s Place was absolutely perfect. A beautiful, peaceful home to relax in.
We loved the tour of the farm, it was a wonderful family experience we won’t forget.
We will definitely try to return in the future if we are in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, perfect for animal lovers and getting away to a beautiful, peaceful country setting. Enjoyed the drive almost as much as the stay. Hunter was super responsive, friendly, and an all-around great host. We loved the farm tour, the sound of the creek and birds, and general beauty of the setting. The farmhouse was spacious and lovely, furnished with antiques and all you might need. Just wish we’d had a longer stay with more time to enjoy it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely couple and beautiful place to stay. Great place for kids too with the creek right there. Absolutely enjoyed our time there.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,fantastic place for a 3 week remote work get away with da boiz - beautiful expanse of 200 acres which is basically totally private for you to roam around in - great host - nearby town has everything you need
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hunters home is a gem, amazing collection of antiques with a farm to add. Hunter made us feel right at home, highly recommend! Big two room Airbnb with a large living room between. Rare to have the large dinning room space. Sparkling clean kitchen with washer dryer.
Thank you Hunter!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, cozy place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our kids like the farm very much，especially the campfire and creek in the backyard of the house. Thank you so much for everything you prepared for us.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’ve been in lots of airbnb homes, Hunter’s house is by far our best and the most authentic experience!
Wonderful peaceful location, close to a nice creek. You can cross the creek and you get a hiking trail - we’ve seen a few deers there! It’s so peaceful and different from our day to day lives.
The house itself is fully equipped with EVERYTHING you may need on a vacation. With lots of vintage objects making this place so unique and authentic! Hunter has thought about every detail and even put a small gift to our kids ❤️.
Kids loved interacting with goats, the donkey and other animals.
At some point we’ve thought to cancel our plans and stay there for another few days."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay there!! So much history and charm and lovely hosts! The farm tour is a must!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter's place is very spacious and cute. It gives an old farm house feel, as if living in a small museum, yet, it has the modern amenities and is kept clean. I wore a pair of black socks indoors, it looked clean when I left.
Hunter is a very friendly and considerate host.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our experience at Hunter's farmhouse was beyond our expectations. The children loved playing in the creek, checking out the animals, and hiking within the property. The grown-ups loved the relaxing atmosphere and proximity to state parks. The house was very clean, well-decorated, spacious, and well-stocked. Hunter was extremely helpful and accommodating. We did the farm tour, which I highly recommend. We hope to come back soon!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the self check in option as I had to arrive later than the normal check in. Hunter was extremely responsive and always with a positive attitude. The house was comfy and cozy as if you were at home.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a wonderful stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hunter's place was a fantastic peaceful stay that we really needed. The babbling brook just outside the door provided just that extra thing to the idyllic setting. We'll be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hunter is the perfect host and her cabin is everything and more! The scenery is the perfect refresh from the day to day, the animals are close by, the town area is close by, and Hunter is super friendly! Will definitely be back especially when she gets her stable up and running for riding lessons :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing host and a wonderful place tucked away in a tranquil place. The stream of water next to the cabin is an amazing plus!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, thanks for having us!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a nice location for a little self-care getaway. The location was quiet and private. I visited in the winter and was glad the house was so cozy and welcoming. Also very pet friendly, which was wonderful for my dog and I. The host was friendly and responsive, even came out to greet me when I arrived. Would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farm was very beautiful, had a lot of character to it. We came at a perfect time, it started snowing our second day there. We literally woke up to a winter wonderland, it was soooo beautiful. Hunter was a great host, she made us the cutest welcome basket & also showed us the animals. My daughter loved the farm & Hunter lol. We'll definitely be booking again very soon."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Miss Hunter was such a lovely hostess. We felt so welcome and at home. The farmhouse was even more cozy than we expected and a perfect place for a quick weekend getaway from the city. Our family had a great time exploring the property and seeing the goats and horses. The girls loved playing songs on the piano and exploring the house asking questions about all the antique things. Unexpectedly, we needed to have a couple visitors for a belated Christmas visit and Hunter was supportive and helpful. Everyone felt right at home like we were at our own Grandmothers house. It was perfect. Thanks Hunter! Looking forward to coming back in the summer or fall."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunters farm is one of the top places I have been to in the world. The farm is such a special place with the most beautiful surroundings and sweetest animals. What hunter is doing with her farm is an amazing feat carried on by the strength of her will. That is enough to make the trip to her farm worth it but on top of that she let my daughter and I help with all the animals, which is her happiest place. The farmhouse is so eclectic and well decorated we loved it! There is a bucolic babbling brook behind the house and a flock of cardinals were at the bird feeder in the morning. It was cold, snowy and still so lovely but the 2nd bedroom is not heated if cold be sure to ask for heaters and keep door open. If you want to use the jetted tub I would ask in advance it’s a process. It is a little house right off the road but I saw maybe three cars go by.Definitely one of my favorite stays we could be here forever and the town is very cute eat @MJ’s unforgettable with the best view of the river"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Hunter was an excellent host. Our stay was a tad weird because of the power outage, which is nobody's fault. The house was beautiful & comfortable, as was the farm. They left us a very thoughtful basket which came in handy! The only complaint I have is that there was no hand or shower soap or laundry detergent (there was laundry softener) Thank you Hunter for your hospitality & definitely thank you two-fold for having the back-up generator!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay in Owego! We were visiting friends nearby and this accommodation suited our needs perfectly. Lovely hamper on arrival was a nice touch. Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and relax!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place itself is incredible. The furniture is all really nice and they place is well decorated giving it a homey vibe. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of spare blankets if needed. I love staying at places that are more than just a bed and this was definitely that. We were taken on a tour of the farm and got to meet and feed the horse, cows, and goats. The goats were so funny, friendly, and playful and I am so glad we got to learn about the farm."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hunter’s listing will allow you to truly experience rural upstate New York living! Hunter is transitioning her family’s 4th generation farm to a ranch. The authentic farmhouse reflects its rich history. The 100 year old barn once restored will be an asset to the surrounding community. Being invited to explore the farm’s 200 acres was fantastic! Visiting the goats, cows, ducks, and horse an animal lover’s treat. The listing is accurate, safe, worthy of your consideration. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hunter's stay was really perfect for me and my two large dogs. The price was right on and we were just in town for the night. It had a nice trail for me to run the dogs! Though the house is right by a road there are not many cars and its really peaceful sitting by the stream! The bed was really comfortable and I found everything I needed for my short stay. Hunter is so sweet and works very hard, she is doing a great job managing her family farm."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very easy to check-in with a personalized lock so we were able to arrive at any time. The house was very spacious, cozy, and clean, and the farm animals were very friendly. I only wish I had brought carrots for the cows. I highly recommend staying here for any trips or longterm stays in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rental is a quaint old farmhouse with all the implied eccentricities and charm, and Hunter is a fabulous host. Adorable farm animals with personality!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was more than we could have hoped it would be. Despite the circumstances of needing to be back in town, Hunter provided such a warm welcoming atmosphere and went above and beyond doing a farm tour with our 1 and 2 year old. I was so grateful to show them a piece of how I grew up. The next time we are in town we will be looking here first. 5 for 5 would recommend to anyone visiting Owego and surrounding areas. We truly couldn’t be more pleased with our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hunter's farm was quiet, beautiful and so fun with all the animals close by. It was super easy go get to town and only a short 15 minute drive there. The house was clean and with plenty of space. Would definitely recommend visiting!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great 5 nights with our family of 4 and dog. Loved walking the trail on the property, fog, sun, rain and all of it. Came end of august and wildflowers and goldfinches by the thousands! The farm tour the first day was so much fun, we all really enjoyed it. The host was very friendly and patient with my little one. The kids got to bring out Mabel the sweet goat and feed her carrots. The house had plenty of room; loved the guest entry mud room and rain boots as it did rain a few days we were there. The kitchen had all we needed and was surprised by a welcome basket of wine, marshmallows for roasting, toiletries and a brownie mix!
Great driving distance for day trips to Corning Glass museum, Ithaca and the Cornell campus, hiking, a cattle auction, and thrift store shopping. We hope to be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farm experience was exactly as described. We loved helping to feed the animals and learn about the farm. The stay was peaceful and house fit our family of four perfectly. We found everything we needed in the kitchen for our three night stay and loved driving into Owego for delicious meals. Such a cute town! Thanks for letting us explore your trails and farm, Hunter! We appreciated the welcome basket and hospitality."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hunter's place is amazing. Her communication was spot on and quick. The ranch and home is lovely filled with antiques inside and so many cool amenities like a fire pit (wood and tikis included) and a grill (thanks for the charcoal!), and with central A/C, two pianos and a one-of a kind shower, it was very pleasant. And the hundreds of acres of land all over was lovely for my dog to visit and just walk around in the morning and breathe some fresh air. Hunter also provided us with a lovely welcome basket with wine and other goodies. She also gave us a tour of her animals nearby (cows, ducks, etc.) and her horsey Prada who was beautiful. She was super friendly and so chill with us. Made us feel very comfy. It was an amazing experience, hope to come again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super peaceful farmhouse retreat with a beautiful country view.
Stargazing at night was wonderful and it was only a short drive from town.
Had a great weekend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent host would highly rcommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Hunter's family farm! She is so warm and welcoming, and her family's farm and property are just full of charm. We felt right at home with everything we needed. We love historic homes and really enjoyed being surrounded by all of the built in features of Hunter's home, as well as her lovely and interesting antique furnishings. She even let our son get his piano practice in on one of her antique uprights. Communications with her were a breeze. She let us know ahead of time that cel. service is spotty as you near her property so we came prepared with screenshots of the check in instructions/door access code/WiFi - that was a huge help. Our 11 year old son loved playing in the creek every morning, I went for some great runs on the logging road on her property, and Hunter gave our whole family (including my parents whom we were in town to visit) a hands-on tour of the farm complete with opportunities to feed the animals and check out the old barn. Upon our arrival there was a huge gift basket filled with local treats, bath supplies, snacks and other goodies. That was a really nice touch that we appreciated and found really helpful. It was a very pleasant and easy drive into the town of Owego. We enjoyed it so much we will definitely stay there again on future visits, and my parents are going to recommend Hunter's place to other visiting family and friends. We also want to come back to hear about how Hunter's creative plans are going - she's quite the entrepreneurial, creative, Rennaissance women! If you're looking for a charming country place to stay in the area, look no further!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely quiet property with a really fantastic host. Location was great for visiting family and friends in Binghamton and Ithaca. My toddler LOVED feeding the animals. House was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay, Hunter is fabulous"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love the antiques in the place, and has everything you would need for an extended stay. Hunter also set out a great care package. I bet this place is even more scenic in the Fall, but there's so much greenery in the Summer that you don't mind the short drive to Ithaca or Owego."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love the location and how small yet spacious the house is. Also, our dogs loved the small canal/ lake."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was wonderful. Perfect place for weekend getaway at village side . The host Hunter is excellent and she took us around the farm for a tour and explained us everything politely and also showed us the animals . Highly recommend this place .

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful visit at this awesome little farm in NY! The house is very comfortable, with all the amenities you could want or need. My visit was in March, and it snowed off an on the whole time I was there, but the accommodations were warm and cozy throughout. I'm sure the property is absolutely gorgeous in the spring and autumn as well!
The host was present to greet me when I arrived to answer any questions, and they were available if I had any issues during my stay. Otherwise, they gave me the space that I needed to enjoy my visit, and were respectful of my privacy.
The listing has tons of pictures, and I can say that the pictures are accurate. If you like what you see in the photos then you will not be disappointed when you arrive.
This bnb will be my first choice any time I am visiting in the area!"

We hope to stay here in the future if we’re in the area again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was really special for my family to return to Hunter’s Legacy Ranch. We loved seeing how she expanded her family of animals, adding on chickens, ducks, a horse and baby cows. When arrived fridge was filled with delicious fresh eggs from her adorable chickens. We enjoyed visiting the barn and feeding the animals in the mornings and evenings. Hunter thoughtfully shared her knowledge about animal care and farm life. We look forward to returning and creating more special memories."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hunter did a great job making us feel welcome. We were treated like family and not strangers. The fresh eggs were a welcome breakfast, the house was clean and warm, we had no complaints. We really enjoyed seeing the farm and meeting all of the animals. We will be booking again in the future and look forward to see everyone again soon! Thanks Hunter for an awesome stay!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place to stay. My husband and I stayed for several days and loved it. The property is beautiful and had a great view. Hunter was a lovely hostess and provided fresh eggs. The shower is a little small but has a jacuzzi! All in all a great little place to stay.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect get away for a cold weekend! Hunter is a great host and the farm is a unique treasured place. Would happily go back! Thank you again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a fantastic stay! Went here from nyc to celebrate some birthdays in the family. The place was clean, organized and felt like home with lovely antique touches.

This was a great winter trip to relax and enjoy the outdoors. I would highly recommend it!!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at Hunters farm house was a pleasure. The house was clean, spacious, well stocked with amenities, and all the views your eyes can take in.
Although we were there at a time of year where we couldn't explore the property, Hunter still offered to show us around. I may just take her up on that at a later stay. I would definitely stay there again.
Thank you Hunter for being such a good host....Hans"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy rural getaway! Hunter was a wonderful accommodating host who showed us the beautiful property and introduced us to the animals. Highly recommend

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had great time during our stay! The farm is beautiful and we were able to do hikes on the grounds. We loved the farm tour and meeting all the cows and Prada, the horse. We were also given farm fresh eggs which were a nice touch. Would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Firstly, Hunter is a superb host! After booking her place, I revived a greeting message followed by some literature on nearby activities. Upon arrival, she gave my family and me a tour of her remarkable space. The interior was pristine, roomy, and cozy. The area surrounding her home is nothing short of magical, with a beautiful brook, green pastures, charming cows, and a magnificent horse. It was dreamlike, but the dream was real. Thank you again for the lovely experience, Hunter!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an old farm house in a lovely country setting. There is lots of room and everything was clean and well stocked. This would be a great spot for a family and a dog, there are games and plenty of things to explore. We had a private entrance and the host was friendly and helpful and a good communicator. We enjoyed hiking up to the top of the hayfields and watching the creek below the house."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunters place was exactly what we needed for a get-together with my brother and his family. One of the perks is that they allow dogs, since we have a couple. The location was about 17 min from Owego, which was a comfortable distance from the house. We had a fun day sitting by the stream and going on a walk. Keep in mind though that full 200 acres isn’t accessible unless you put on your boots and do some trailblazing of your own. Thanks for a great time and the packed welcome basket. We hope to return someday!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful host, place , experience. Views at every turn, plenty to explore on and off the property . Hunter is a wonderful host , made us feel very at home. If your looking for a place that is beautiful, peaceful, yet very well located for area hiking , the farm is your place ."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter was the absolute best! We had to find a place for our Cornell University graduation in Ithaca and we chose Hunter’s farm house. This was the best decision!
She was such a lovely host and we received welcome gifts!! She also gave us a full tour of the farm. We met all the farm animals, Prada and the cows! There were so many small adventures near the house and absurd breathtaking views. Especially on the full moon night!
Every corner of the house was meticulously arranged with so many antiques. We felt cozy, warmed and loved in the vintage setting.
Thank you Hunter and we wish to be back soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, country retreat!
Host was very generous and kind.
If you are looking for a quiet country adventure with the sounds of a running creek, humming birds, and all that nature has to offer...this is the place. Antique furnishings inside and outdoor trails and fire pit. It was the perfect place!
I recommend it 100%."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From Hunter's welcome walkthrough of the property to her willingness to show you things you can do on the farm, it's clear from the beginning Hunter wants you to have a great time. We were looking for a quiet getaway from NYC and this property was perfect. We enjoyed watching the cows and meeting Prada the horse. The roomy rental is filled with unique antiques that all have a story. Hunter lives upstairs and works the farms, so she is usually never far away if you need anything. If you are looking for other things to do, the cute town of Owego is only 15min south and the bottom of the Finger Lakes are 30-45min north."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Hunter is a lovely hostess and was easy to stay in touch with. We loved the peace and beauty of the property and our pup Jack loved playing in the stream and watching the cows every day. The house had a lot of lovely personality and it felt like we stepped back to a more peaceful time. I highly recommend anyone who needs some quiet time to spend it here.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful farm that has been in Hunter's family for generations. We had a relaxing stay. Hunter was very friendly and a great host.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Clean, beautiful and great hospitality by Hunter!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hunter was a fantastic host and the place was cute and clean. The gift basket with s’mores and wine was a nice extra touch. We enjoyed the fire pit and the creek behind the house. It was a very quiet and relaxing visit. Hunter showed our kids the horse and cows and also helped us go down the creek to see some little waterfalls (the kids were occupied for hours by this)! I’d recommend bringing water shoes for anyone that would like to go in the creek. The town of Owego is 20 minutes away and looked cute for shopping and dining. We’d definitely stay there again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hunter’s farmhouse is wonderful! We were extremely impressed with the size of the rooms, the cleanliness, the decor, the supplies, and her hospitality.
We visited some of the parks in the finger lakes area and this was a convenient drive away. Highly recommend if you are looking for a place in the area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter was a terrific host, and this was a really fantastic place to stay. One would be hard pressed to find a more picturesque place to stay, with so much comfort and such great amenities. This is a great place to unwind and relax, and enjoy life!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The temperature was unexpected, it was hot during the day but a little chill at night time. Host turn on full heat to warm us up. The groceries basket has everything we needed. from a shower soap to a bottle red wines, menu for the restaurant, she concerns about what we might need during the stay and everything is well prepared. She knows how to take good care of her guests."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Hunters house was great and on a beautiful property. Very close to the finger lakes area. Would highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hunter is an amazing lady with great hospitality. Amazing farm house for long weekend getaway stay. Beautiful wild field. Great value for the price.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came for my daughter's graduation from Cornell. Everything was outrageously priced and/or sold out in Ithaca. It was a 40 minute drive to the university. However, the place is lovely, which big spacious rooms and gorgeous setting. Two thumbs up."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had the perfect stay! Hunter was very accommodating. The place was very cute and clean. The farm is beautiful and so peaceful with a creek behind the house. I can't wait to go back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter was a tremendous host. The ambiance surrounding the outside of the house is tranquil with the rolling creek, bird feeders, cows, and mountain views. The inside was very comfortable with several antiques throughout. If you are looking for a retreat-like setting this is the place."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing find! The house is spacious & so cozy. Tucked away from the hustle & bustle of life, this is a great place for a get away weekend. Incredibly clean & well stocked with the basics needed for your stay. Host is incredibly welcoming, thoughtful, and ready to help with any questions you have during your stay. Will definitely be visiting this spot again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse was a wonderful place for us to rest and relax after day hiking the Finger Lakes Trail. The most important feature: pet friendly. The dogs settled right in and loved exploring the smells, sounds, and sights outside. We found a fully stocked kitchen to make our meals, excellent drinking water to fill our packs, washer & dryer, and beautiful views. I especially loved the view from the kitchen sink - spring birds at the feeders and the glistening creek beyond. It was homey, quaint, and serene. It's a perfect place to unwind, relax, and get back to nature. The welcome basket is a classy touch - thoughtful with promoting local products and vendors."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter was welcoming and the house was a nice get-away from the city. We stayed and relaxed, met the cows and horses, but also used the house as a home base for hiking, exploring Ithaca, and wineries on the lakes. If your just looking for a quite escape, this place is it."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We just spent an amazing week at Hunter’s family farm. The house was very comfortable and filled with antique furniture. The property is peacefully set alongside a stream and beside their sweet cows. Hunter was by far the most attentive and kindest Airbnb host we have had. She greeted us when we arrived. She also had a gift basket filled with local products and supplies for s’mores. Hunter introduced the kids to the cows and taught us so much about farming. We had a surprise April 1 snow fall and Hunter brought over a sled for the kids. The town of Owego is really charming with great restaurants with outdoor dining. We had a truly special week.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hunter was a fantastic host. She was very easy to communicate with, and her place was clean and just a great place to be in. Watching the sunset from the top of the hill in front of her house and watching the cows eating and mooing is an experience that is hard to find anywhere else!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse retreat was a real nice change of pace! Sounds of the stream running behind the house and the cows mooing were very relaxing. 200 acres of property to explore and hike, I wish we had come more prepared with footwear and warmer clothes to really get out there.
Very nice touches inside the home. Looking forward to returning!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter and his family's farm were quite the treat for a Upstate NY trip. Right on a stream, plenty of space, and nice touches throughout. Come here for a great stay for sure."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hunter responded to my inquires almost immediately and her kitchen had everything I needed to prepare and cook my own meals.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I had a lovely long weekend at this magical space. It was beautifully decorated with interesting antiques, the beds were comfy, and the spacious kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals while there. It was so dark and quiet at night, too. Truly an escape. We will be back!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can’t say enough good things about Hunter‘s place. First, as a host, she is so nice. Greeted us at the property. Gave us a tour. Always quick responses to questions during our stay. Second, she left us a very nice gift basket including wine and marshmallows for the fire pit. Plus the fridge was stocked with goodies including pancake mix and gourmet syrup. Third, the house is great. Quiet location (an occasional moo from the cows next door), there is plenty of land on which to roam, and it is by a pleasant stream with a small waterfall. The antique furniture in the house was neat to see. All beds comfy, the kitchen has everything you need, and wireless is good because there is no cell services in the area. You won’t be disappointed if you stay with Hunter."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location! This home is in a peaceful and lovey country location. The extra special touches in decorations in this lovey home really made it homey. Antiques in every room, nice touches in the basket left for visitors, and the sun room with birds off the deck and cows in view was so nice. Cannot wait to visit here again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,A lovely place.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Hunter was very communicative and the place was lovely. She was extremely friendly and left nice little gift basket upon arrival. There were cows across which was absolutely lovely. Will definitely go back in the summer time!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend this beautiful country retreat with cows, walking paths and a babbling brook. Hunter and her mom were lovely and made sure we were taken care of, even with welcome wine and goodies! Place was very comfortable, cozy, and warm - good spot to get away during the coming tough winter. You'll be glad you did!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sally & Andrew's place is on a very large parcel of land that their children and Grand children also live in.
The house was clean, had air conditioner that helped keep us cool in the already hot month of May, a large pond, and everything else one might need for their home away from home.
We had friendly visits from the owners dogs who live next door, and they got along very well with my dogs. It was a good trip and hope to be back again."

If you are looking for a quiet getaway or a place for your kids and dog to play freely in fresh air, this is your spot! My kids loved playing in the pond and enjoyed trying out the peddle boat! They added a nice touch of providing cookie dough and their delicious maple syrup in the fridge for us to enjoy. We’ll certainly be returning!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely love the place couldn’t say more positive things about it. The kids loved that they were able to fish. My wife and I took a nice long walk. The place was immaculately clean totally peaceful, setting highly recommended. We can’t wait to come back again!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I celebrated our 13 yr anniversary up at Tucked Inn and it was the most peaceful and refreshing place yet. We live in the city so it was definitely ""tucked"" away and a perfect gateway. We made the cookies right when we got there, and pancakes the next day with the maple sugar provided. We also bought beef there and it was fantastic!!! Nothing like the taste. We even took some home. Our dog also loved it and very pet friendly. Even though the outdoor gas fire place was a bit touchy with staying on - we were overall very satisfied, and will be back. Great job Andy and Sally 👏."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay at Tucked Inn! Booked the place very last minute and Andrew was quick to approve and help us with our trip. It is a very comfortable place with great couches, a sauna, and full kitchen."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! So much to do on the farm. There are hiking trails with maps, a private pond, and a beautiful sauna. There was cookie dough waiting for us for fresh cookies and fresh maple syrup! Tucker and Annabelle are the local dogs and we’re so so sweet. Sally and Andrew were remarkable hosts, very responsive and flexible. Can’t wait to be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"what a lovely place for my family. the 4 of us and our 3 pets really enjoyed the lake, sauna, and the homemade cookies ready to be baked were the best touch! would happily stay here for a week!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful getaway. Loved this spacious home, peaceful environment, and the beautiful kitchen with all the amenities you need and more. What a sweet touch to have cookie dough in the fridge. The pond was great for fishing. Hope to come again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great. We had an amazing experience, literally just relaxing away from everything. Sally made it all the best with a tour of his barn and maple syrup operation and the woods and more. It is winter time and we’re already planning a trip for the summer. Thank you for an unforgettable experience."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place. Has it all!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great hosts. Friendly, welcoming. The cookies were a really nice touch. There was even maple syrup from the hosts farm. Great stay. Would stay again. Can’t say enough good things about this place."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second stay, and it was just as nice as the first. The house is clean and cozy, with a fully stocked kitchen if you want to cook - complete with cookie dough in the fridge. My dog loved being able to hike in the woods. Thanks Sally!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was very comfortable and just as described. House was well stocked and very homey. We loved that they decorated for Christmas as our young grandchildren were able to come downstairs in the morning with gifts under the tree. Us adults enjoyed the fireplace and large screen television for movie watching when kids went to bed. Owners go above and beyond leaving you eggs, milk, syrup, pancake mix and cookie dough. Would definitely recommend!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Tucked Inn. The airbnb was cozy with a lot of warm, adorable touches. Great kitchen, comfy living room and the sun room with the sauna was a very nice addition. Sally & Andrew left us some eggs, milk, maple syrup & cookie dough in the fridge which was very much appreciated. They have a beef cattle farm so we were also able to buy some grass-fed steaks. We accepted their offer for a farm tour and that was fun. It rained but that didn't stop Andy from giving us a look around his 500 acre land. Will definitely be coming back. Thanks, Andy & Sally!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Me, my husband and pup had a wonderful time. We relaxed and mostly fished in the pond and caught a ton of fish. The home and property is very nice and the chocolate chip cookie dough is a very sweet touch. We definitely will be back in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay at Tucked Inn! Beautiful property! Sally communicated everything clearly and proactively! It is rare that you find a place that has more flexibility with what you can do than rules about what you can’t do. Binder in the home with lots of info and recommendations as well as suggestions on what to explore on the property. We felt right at home! We were in town for a wedding and wish we had more time to explore and spend time on the property. We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful peaceful location. Very clean, enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We (me, my wife, and our puppy) loved staying at Tucked Inn over the Labor Day weekend, it was so peaceful, quiet, and relaxing. Our puppy loved jumping in the pond and swimming in it, the water was clear and clean. We also enjoyed a campfire the last night with some local friends.
We also got a tour of the property from Andrew, it was so cool to learn the history and their story.
There was a bunch of stuff in the fridge like eggs, milk, sauces, coffee, a coffee machine in the kitchen, cookie dough (so delicious), and tons of firewood for us to use."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!!! The host was amazing. On a farm local grass fed steaks. Homemade cookie dough in the refrigerator. Along with the best syrup. House was spotless with all the amenities. The pond and paddle boat was amazing. Truely a wonderful place to stay!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! House is clean and beds are very comfortable. We really enjoyed the sauna and firepit. The scenery can't be beat! Our kids had a great time swimming and boating! Sally is accommodating and quick to respond. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at Tucked Inn. We absolutely love it. It's a peaceful getaway when visiting friends and family in the area.
My son's favorite things were swimming in the pond and of course visits from Tucker and Annabelle. He's hoping the dogs will come visit us in Boston some day :)
Thank you so much for the relaxing week away. We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying at Tucked Inn and it was better than the first. The dredged pond is now a great space to spend time at. The kids spent most free daytime in or on the water. The house is still great. Very clean and the hosts are very hospitable, leaving nice basic treats in the fridge. Everyone enjoys their time there. We look forward to staying again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We could not have asked for a more peaceful stay! From the lovely pond, to coffee in the sunroom, to homemade chocolate chip cookie dough, waiting for us in the fridge! This place was everything and more. We left, feeling incredibly relaxed and refreshed. We will absolutely be booking this the next time we are in town!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great (although short!) stay at the Tucked Inn. The hosts truly went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable with thoughtful touches and well-thought out instructions and supplies. The pond is beautiful, especially at night with a sky full of stars! Thank you Andrew and Sally!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew & Sally are SUPERHOSTS, anything we could want they were able to either provide or point us in the right direction. Their Maple Syrup is fabulous. They are so incredibly nice that you almost feel like family. Our dogs had a wonderful time. I spent some time fishing, a nibble or a catch with each cast. It was by far one of my most relaxing moments in more than a year. Every tool you’d need to bake, cook, grill, or toast marshmallows was there ready to use.
They left milk, eggs, syrup, cookie dough ready to bake, many condiments on the fridge, with pancake mix, oil, and no stuck sprays in the cabinet. Decaf and regular k-cups were ready for anytime.
The beds and couches were very comfortable. The chairs on the deck, off the sunroom were amazing, as we watched the sunsets and sunrises.
The pond looks spectacular,at night with the lights all around and better yet there weren’t any mosquitoes, considering how wet it’s been. We can’t wait for next year.
5 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ & 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a fantastic house. If we are in the area again we would stay here without a hesitation.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Tucked Inn and it was as great as the first time! The home is clean, spacious and is equipped with all the amenities you would need. The large pond was wonderful and we enjoyed swimming and kayaking. We visited with friends and family around the fire pit and campfire. The porches were used often and were so relaxing. It was fun early mornings listening to the birds. Our dogs loved walking on the trails and swimming in the pond. The hosts are friendly and truly make you feel at home and provide you with fresh eggs, maple syrup and cookie dough.
This is definitely a 5 Star hotel in the beautiful country! We have our next trip planned!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing stay. From the moment we pulled in, the property is beautiful. The home is very welcoming and the kitchen has everything you need from coffee machines to a crock pot. We had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners and their 2 awesome pups Tucker and his sister Annabelle, both so loving and friendly. The sauna now makes me want to have one, what a great bonus. Our boys loved the space to run around and hang out by the fire pit. Thank you for having us. Wonderful memories created."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most amazing Airbnb experience I’ve had to date! The views and pond are so refreshing the sauna is super nice to be able to access the house is so clean comfortable and well maintained and the hosts were super friendly and easy to talk to and very accommodating! Stayed here for a week! Didn’t want to leave ! Don’t miss out on staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will stay again! Peaceful property, great value."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed here with three Co workers while working nearby. Everyone was comfortable in the house. Beds were comfy. Host was very friendly and accommodating. House is a beautiful home with private pond. The sauna and fire table were nice touches after a long day of work. Would highly recommend
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful location with lots of great amenities. Wonderful place to bring a family with pets. Not a whole lot to do in the area immediately surrounding but it's a quick drive to the towns in New York
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at a great place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for an Airbnb for a quiet weekend and Tucked Inn totally delivered! The home sits on a working farm with pasture and woodlands. Immediately behind the house are walking trails that the owners have created. They even provided a hand drawn map displaying the points of interest. We were so intrigued to see the taps in the maple trees and the network of hoses to collect the sap.
The weather was not the greatest the weekend we came. We brought food with us to prepare. You never know how equipped a kitchen in an Airbnb is going to be. This kitchen was the best equipped kitchen I’ve stayed in. There’s a 5 burner Samsung range that was up to the challenge. The hosts provided Viking cookware. There were plenty of mixing bowls, utensils, virtually anything you could possible need, even a Cuisinart stand mixer. Outside there is a Cuisinart 6 burner gas grill that was clean and easy to use. Comfy recliners in the living room and comfy bedding and thick towels. Highly recommend"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second time here and definitely plan on going back. My wife and I love the peaceful seclusion and the hospitality is top notch. My two dogs also love to run around and explore the beautiful land.Thanks for the fresh syrup, milk, eggs and cookie dough!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew and Sally were wonderful hosts! They were communicative and flexible during check-in and throughout our trip. The grounds are peaceful and totally open to explore (though weather kept us inside most of our trip) This was the perfect place for a getaway weekend and we will absolutely look to return in the future to do more exploring!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We (mom, dad, pre teen, 2 dogs) stayed in the cabin for 3 days. We were greeted with homemade cookie dough, a beautiful fireplace and nature views that are to live for! The owners were most friendly and gave us a tour of the trails in the woods. Ms Sally even sent hats and blankets for the cold weather that we unexpectedly experienced but having the tour while snowing, was an absolutely enchanting experience.
The cabin was pristine, with all that you might need during your stay.
If you are looking for a cozy but open environment, this home provides it well.
If you look outside at night, you’ll be sure to see many stars, a view that is rare in the city.
The land truly is stunning and great for hiking, even the dogs were amazed by such a beauty.
We cant not wait to visit again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying! Will be back again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked Inn was exactly what my husband and I wanted, peace and tranquility. The home was peaceful, and the property was lovely. Sally and Andrew's had everything that we needed. Great place to stay!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I stayed at Andrew and Sally's place and had a fantastic stay. The kitchen is loaded with amenities and the space is very homey with beautiful surroundings. I was very thankful that I was able to bring my 2 well-mannered dogs. I had a great stay and all around great experience at this AirBnb.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was snug and warm for our December visit, with comfortable seating in the main room and plush blankets to add that bit of extra cozy feeling. The gas fireplace was easy to operate with clear instructions. We found a hand-drawn map of trails in the woods out back which were lovely to walk along with our dogs after dark. The place is peaceful and quiet, and the hills around are fantastic. I'd choose this place over a posh hotel room in Manhattan any day."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew and Sally went out of their way to make this stay a memorable one for our family. This visit will be a wonderful memory for each of us. Thank you for the extra details you did for our stay. You were an amazing host and hostess and saying thank you doesn't seem enough. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really lovely stay! Very responsive host, both during and after our stay when we followed up about something. Incredibly sweet couple (who make really great maple syrup) - they even offered to take us on a tour of the farm next time!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second trip here, and it was as great as the previous trip. The fall foliage was beautiful, but by far the best part of the trip was the drive through Andy and Sally’s farm and how kind they were to us. We’re already planning our next trip here!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,What an incredible stay. Andrew and Sally have a real gem tucked away in a beautiful setting. Tucked Inn is a great quiet place to rest and recharge.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality and amazing place to stay. 10/10 recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I rented this cottage so that my son and his family had a quiet place to retreat to amidst a busy weekend surprising multiple family members who had no idea they were coming to town. The experience from booking through check-in and check-out was smooth and welcoming. Before finalizing booking, I was notified of some ongoing work on the pond at the property. This allowed us to make an informed decision about the stay with no surprises. If you're looking for a lovely place to retreat to in the area, the space is inviting and well-equipped. Lots of quiet to enjoy and the fall views are spectacular. Our son and his family also enjoyed the special touch of chocolate chip cookie dough ready to bake. Really great hosts and location!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tucked Inn is a beautiful, comfy place in a country setting. It was very clean and well stocked for anything you could possibly need.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tucked Inn was THE place to unwind and spend time for my parent's retirement party with a small group of family. Highly recommended the fatm tour. Ammentities were out of this world! The homes, animals, and crops on the property are stunning and a testament to the engineering and agricultural skills this hardworking family possesses. Faith, family, freedom. Many thanks Andy and Sally"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Tucked Inn is a WONDERFUL place to stay! We appreciated all of the amenities! It is a comfortable, peaceful and cozy place. Enjoyed the eggs, pancake mix, syrup and cookie dough. We also enjoyed a campfire with friends.

Sally and Andrew were extremely generous hosts and made us feel beyond welcome. We enjoyed ourself very much, and will certainly be back in the future."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much to our generous hosts! We didnt get to take advantage of many of the wonderful amenities of this house, but that’s only because there was such a surprising amount to see and do. Not to mention the friendly communication, clean and well stocked house, and serenity of the location. Would recommend to anyone, younger, older, kids, single, etc - you’ll love it."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"By far, one of the best places we’ve stayed! Great location, and a better house still! Andy and Sally were away when we stayed. Delphine helped us out while we stayed, and she was super responsive and very gracious throughout our stay. We’d love to come back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Hands down this is one of the best Airbnbs that we have stayed in. It was so peaceful here and we appreciated all the numerous extra touches that makes this place extra special. Hopefully we will be able to return again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've stayed in AirBnB's in many state, over many year, and this place stands out. It's clean, quiet, modern, and comes with everything you could want for a fun and relaxing stay. I slept so soundly that my friends knocked on my bedroom door in the morning to see if I was still alive! This place gets my vote for Best! - Jim"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is amazing. So clean and cozy, it felt like home away from home. Sally and Andrew are amazing hosts and you can tell they put a lot of thought into their place to make sure guests have a nice time. The views from the deck are incredible and we enjoyed watching sunrise and sunset. My dog loved exploring the property and swimming in the pond. We found it a bit difficult to find things to do in the area but we were able to find amazing sights by driving a bit farther. It was just my girlfriend and I with our dog but this place would be great for families as well! The bed was also very comfortable. Definitely recommend coming here to get away from a busy life and just relax."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing

The countryside is gorgeous and restful. Andrew and Sally are fabulous hosts and very kind. This is an easy 5-star review in every way."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our business-related stay at Andy and Sally's was one of the best stays I've ever had at an Airbnb. Space and facilities are better than described and worth the small extra effort to get there. My only question is when can I get back there for a trip with my family.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend Tucked Inn. Beautiful home and property. You won’t find a better experience. Sally and Andy take great pride in everything they do and it shows.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked inn is a beautiful home I would recommend to family friends or anyone in general asking for a amazing spot to stay. Me and my partner came here for our five year anniversary and everything about the place was perfect, from the location being one of the most peaceful we have ever stayed, to the woods being amazing and fun to hike in with a loved one, there isn’t one bad thing I have to say about this place. The hosts are amazing kind people who if you do visit this location please get some of they’re meat it is delicious, but the overall trip was better than anything we could have imagined thank you again Sally and Andrew!!"

Such a difference from what's sold in the stores. The area is such a breath of fresh air. It was an amazing and unforgettable experience! Thank you so much!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent property, as advertised. If it’s winter, bring a humidifier to balance the dry air. Tap water has sulfur odor, would suggest bringing the fragranced shower packets to make bathing more pleasant. Everything else was 10/10. Would go again!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My mom and I decided to escape to the peace and tranquility of the Tucked Inn from our apartment in the big city, and for eight glorious days, it did not disappoint. Upon arrival, we loved the chalkboard sign that welcomed us, as well as the refrigerator that was stocked with fresh home-made chocolate chip cookie dough, farm fresh eggs, milk and pure maple syrup produced on the farm that is owned by our fantastic hosts, Andrew and Sally. They are located down the road from Tucked Inn and readily available to assist with any questions or concerns. We loved the RTV tour that they offer of their property, and the sweeping views of hills of Bradford & Susquehanna Counties. And as rural as the area is, the Tri-Cities (Binghamton-Johnson City-Endicott) of New York's Southern Tier are only 30-35 minutes away. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay.
Beautiful scenery.
A great setup.
Quick communication.
Would stay again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of those airbnb experiences where you can tell the owners put a lot of thought into making one's stay really comfortable. Besides that, the setting is so peaceful and beautiful.
A+++"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is the best! So many thoughtful above and beyond touches. There was cookie dough in the fridge for us and lots of blankets to make it very cozy. The trails in the back are fantastic and make it so you don’t have to leave the property to go for a hike. Our puppy loved it as well! The porches are SO LOVELY. And there’s a great reading nook sun/sauna room. It’s the perfect place to disconnect and relax. Thank you again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House rests on a beautiful stretch of land complete with a pond and a hiking trail! If you have concerns about it being on a cattle farm like I did, don be! There were no signs of it on the site. House is in a rural setting with easy and quick access to the triple cities...the best of both worlds!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful stay and highly recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful relaxing get away out of the city! Sally and Andrew were wonderful and quick responding to text if have any questions
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Tucked Inn was perfection! From the beautiful pond, woods, and view to the cozy decor and sleeping accommodations, we had a wonderful weekend. We are looking forward to coming back and we already miss our new canine friends, Tucker and Annabelle. Plus, to die for chocolate chip cookies. Thank you Andrew and Sally!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here. Sally and Andrew are perfect hosts and made sure that our stay was comfortable. We will definitely be returning.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Clean and has everything you could ask for and more. Would happily recommend to anyone looking for a place to get away.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Sally’s property is everything the reviews say and more. Great for a group of friends or family.
They are the kindest hosts and the location is truly gorgeous.
We didn’t have the time to explore the grounds this time around. But we plan to come back again soon and take full advantage of all the Tucked Inn has to offer.
After reading the many positive reviews there’s really not much I can say that hasn’t already been said. If you’re looking to retreat in the Warren Center/ Little Meadows area this is the place."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Sallys Tucked Inn is simply an absolute pleasure and rare lifetime experience.
The privacy, area and home itself is amazing. Definitely telling all my friends and family and highly recommend to any and everyone."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can not express how amazing this stay was!
I could sit and right a lengthy review raving about how wonderful it was, but I'll save you the time... If you want the perfect getaway location for a weekend or longer, this is the place you need. Accomodations, location, and personalized touches are a high bar that will be near impossible to beat by anyone else."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked Inn was great for us and our dog. The dog enjoyed the yard and his freedom to explore. Everything worked for us. The place was well stocked with everything we needed and the large TV was great. We spent allot of time on the front porch enjoying the view. The trails were great to walk just out the back. Seen lots of deer. Can't forget how much we enjoyed the maple syrup, pancake mix, brown eggs, cookie dough and milk that was left there for us by the host."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great and outstanding place. We’ll surely be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Andrew and Sally have a wonderful place with great amenities. The house provides enough privacy and has everything one might need. We were able to hike, fish and swim. Our kids enjoyed it as much as we did. Fully recommended!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Expect peace and quiet at Tucked Inn. Alot of amenities await within the kitchen, and the sunroom is ready for you to enjoy a mountain view. The property is gorgeous and the surrounding countryside and farms are beautiful."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Tucked Inn was a wonderful retreat to get away from it all. The house and property are well cared for. We spent lots of time on all 3 porches, preparing our meals and doing lots of baking in the great kitchen. The farm fresh goodies left in the fridge, including the chocolate chip cookie dough were savored. They even planted some cucumbers and tomatoes for guests to pick fresh. Sally and Andy are great hosts and we enjoyed a tour of the farm and getting to know them a bit. Clear instructions on how to use everything in the house. Great hiking right outside the back door. Stores for the staples a few miles down the road. I could go on and on. If you are looking for somewhere to just get away and relax with the world's sweetest hosts, Tucked Inn is the place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We cannot thank Andrew and Sally enough. They are absolutely amazing , accommodating and sweethearts!
We enjoyed our stay and will definitely come again, planning on it already.
We highly recommend trying this peaceful home at least once!! It’s a great experience."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our time at Tucked Inn. One of our best AirBNB experiences. Andrew and Sally were so friendly and attentive if we had an issue.
Having all the land to run around on was so great for kids. Our friends’ and family’s kids who came and visited didn’t want to leave when it was time to go home. A great gathering place.
The house is beautiful and clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed.
And a special shout out to Abigail and Tucker, two dogs from next door who visited us each day. They’re a bit excited at first, but they became a real highlight of our stay. Such friendly dogs!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were all very satisfied with this house. While structurally it is older, they have done a great job modernizing the interior making it a welcoming place to bring your family. It is in a rural part of northern PA just south of the border with NY and only 10 minutes from local conveniences in Apalachin. The property is nice, surrounded by trees and on a hill with a great view. The house has plenty of seating and sleeping options, a large TV and fireplace to provide entertainment and sauna (didn't get to try that out). Access was a breeze and the hosts were extremely responsive via communication in the app, which was great. The kids and adults enjoyed it alike."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An outstanding vacation spot! From fresh eggs, blueberries and homemade cookie dough this is truly a home away from home. Our favorite spots were the front porch and sunroom where you could sit and get lost in the beautiful view of the trees, hills and pond. No matter rain or shine (we had a lot of rain on our visit) we still were able to do absolutely everything we wanted to do and had the best 5 days. Not to mention the Family is very welcoming and the dogs are very friendly and will accompany you on hikes in the woods!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect the best in the home, in all of the nuances within the home, to the perfect hosts; you will be pleased in all things. Highly recommend this place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can’t go wrong with this rental!!! Everything was as advertised, and better!! The sunroom was delightful for me to relax and read while the mister enjoyed watching the biggest tv screen ever! The sheets were silky soft. We were enthralled with all extra touches. Hiking trails, cookie dough, maple syrup... and more!! Book it for yourself to find out how delightful this property is!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Very secluded with amazing thoughtful touches. Highly recommend!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great place to stay and the people were very helpful and friendly.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew and Sally were the best hosts ever. Words can't describe how much fun we had. We definitely will be back.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Sally’s Tucked Inn is beautiful, both the house and its surrounding area. From the detailed description on how to use everything in the house (including the sauna) to the maple syrup they make and bottle at their nearby farm, everything was great. I stayed at the house with my girlfriend as a getaway, one of the only times I get to see her while she’s at college, and it was well worth choosing Tucked Inn"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place amazing cookies has everything you need and more thought of it all
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, quiet retreat. The home is welcoming, clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Being able to hop into the sauna before bed was an especially lovely touch, as was the tub of cookie dough and maple syrup from their farm!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy getaway with everything you could want for a relaxing weekend to unwind and get outside. The fresh maple syrup was especially delicious! We would love to come back in summer and sit out under the stars and fish in the pond. A truly great place to stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect stop over for us and our two dogs. The space is roomy, comfortable, and wonderfully clean. It has all the amenities you could possibly want for an extended stay - new appliances, comfy places to sit, and lovely outdoor spaces. Even with the rapidly melting snow we were able to hike around the property. Our two dogs had plenty of space to run and lounge. Be sure to download the directions before arrival as cell service is limited in the area."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Tucked Inn!! The house was beautiful and cozy and the hosts are incredibly responsive and helpful. The fireplace makes the house so cozy and toasty we never wanted to leave. Also I just can't get over how sweet it was that the hosts asked us what kind of milk we preferred, stocked the fridge with farm fresh eggs, milk, syrup and homemade cookie dough with directions. I cannot recommend this place enough! Also if you like to cook the kitchen has all the accessories you will need which was extremely appreciated. Thank you Sally and Andrew for providing such nice experience!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tucked Inn. The house was warm, welcoming and clean. We brought our four-legged friends along and really enjoyed the groomed trails on the property; it was great to be able to just head out the door and off onto the trails. Everything was just as we were told it would be, and the hospitality that we received from the hosts was top-notch!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sally is an amazing hostess. She’s very responsive and available to address any issues. The cookie dough and fresh milk was a nice touch and very comforting after a long drive. And she even provides us with fresh eggs and Maple syrup. The house is very spacious and cozy. It has everything to help you relax. Everything in the house is new and clean. We had an amazing time celebrating Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are debating The Tucked Inn just book it! From the Maple Syrup to the absolutely stunning view, it simply can't be beat! The Inn was perfect for us to get away and relax!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trying to find the right word to describe Sally and Andy’s amazing Tucked Inn paradise... Immaculate...Cozy...Welcoming... All of these words fit - and together, they describe what was a wonderful weekend getaway. From the warm communications with the owners, to the lovely touches of the kind of milk I liked stocked in the fridge with farm fresh eggs, coffee creamer, pure maple syrup from their farm, and homemade chocolate chip cookie dough in a container with instructions on the temp/time to bake them...Sally and Andy’s hospitality cannot be beat. This place has everything one could ever wish for and more. It snowed every day and the hikes around the property were lovely. Lots of deer and you could hear the wind through the pine trees. I can’t wait to return and thank Sally and Andy for being such wonderful hosts!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly lovely place with incredible and communicative hosts. We arrived to fresh eggs, local milk and Pennsylvania syrup. The living room was extremely comfortable and the place had all the amenities we needed. Look forward to returning in the future"

Book and enjoy!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was by far our best Airbnb experience ever. Tucked Inn is stylish- with a cabin meets modern feel. All the appliances are so updated. The sauna was amazing. The hosts were so friendly. And our city dogs loved being country dogs for the weekend and running leash-free laps around the house. Best weekend getaway!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Tucked Inn was such a beautiful place to stay especially during the fall! The house was so cozy and the trails in the back of the house we're so enjoyable for a nice walk. Andy and Sally were incredible hosts and very hospitable. I would definitely stay there again!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tucked Inn was a wonderful bnb and we were happy to find this place! The owners put lots of love in the touches throughout the home for their guests that exceeded my expectations. The large property was a huge amenity and we were so happy it was dog-friendly. We spend the nights by the campfire and were lucky to be able to walk the hiking path behind the home. We will definitely be back and have family members that will utilize this bnb as well! Thank you Andrew and Sally for the great hospitality.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful time at the Inn. I remember having a lot of fun during summer months at my grandparents' back in the days and I am happy that my kids got very similar experience this time. Among many things we enjoyed were hiking, fishing, swimming, kayaking, watching the wildlife... It was great to have waffles with fresh blueberries and local maple syrup for breakfast and warm cookies during the day. Andy and Sally are great hosts and we are really thankful for their hospitality."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wished we could have stayed longer! Sally and Andy were helpful from the beginning of we needed anything and always quick to respond.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much for the amazing night in this beautiful place! We loved hiking through the woods out back. We encountered a deer, chipmunks, and a red fox while exploring. Waffles with maple syrup and the cookies were delightful surprises. We hope to return when we can spend more time."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here. Our dog loved sniffing around and listening to the frogs at night. They left cookie dough in the fridge for us, which was a very thoughtful and unexpected touch. All of the outdoor spaces were gorgeous, and at night fireflies were abundant. The entire place was clean, well-furnished, and lovely. Thanks for a great stay!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5/5 stars highly recommend.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked Inn is a wonderful space in a beautiful part of Bradford County. Andy and Sally were a delight to work with, and keep their place in great condition. Beautiful kitchen, great hiking right out the back door, sauna, you really can't beat it. Already planning a return visit."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a great time. Beautiful house! Sally and Andrew were gracious hosts - we were welcomed with fresh eggs, cookie dough and their yummy fresh syrup! We also took a tour of the property. We left buying so much syrup - it was delicious! We enjoyed our stay and it was much needed quiet time for us both. Thank you again for sharing such a beautiful home to rent!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time. Andy and Sally really make you feel like family. They have fast responses and make sure you have EVERYTHING you need. The kitchen was well stocked for any cooking you want to do, all paper products, dishes, firewood and propane were provided. The house is great! Spacious, a.c. works great and has lots of cozy touches. They give great directions for everything in the house, and even hiking tips. The pond is awesome for paddle boating and fishing. They even provided us with milk, eggs and maple syrup during our stay. We will definitely stay again."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts and extremely comfortable stay. Highly recommended host
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Andrew and Sally’s place! They were excellent with communication and flexible with our check in time so we would have extra time at the property to explore. They have a wonderful family that lives on the property with great dogs Tucker and Annabelle. We had unfortunate weather (snow in May) but Sally and her family more than made up for it! The house is beautifully done, stocked with all the amenities you’ll need, and felt just like home. We hiked and explored the property a couple days and loved the lake. The sauna was a perfect way to unwind after a chilly hike. We cannot wait to come back for more farm fresh eggs and home made cookie dough!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,I stay here repeatedly for a reason. what a fantastic host
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed with Jessica multiple times and I come back because it's a fantastic experience. Great all around.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Will be back for sure.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet apartment, right above the attorney’s office and next to the credit Union. Convenient location and would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was worth the price. Nothing fancy, just the bare basics. It worked for what I needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a week, and then booked this for two weeks for my father. The location is perfectly located in downtown Sayre, within walking distance of restaurants, a movie theater, and the Guthrie Clinic. I would have booked for longer but the dates were not available. Jessica was a wonderful host and responded quickly to any questions I had."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our host was very accommodating, always responding quickly to any questions. The house is comfortable and offers a lovely view of the mountains to the west. Pool, hot tub, fire ring, and grill make this an ideal place in the summer."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is rustic with a log cabin feel. Lots of exposed beams and big game on the walls. It is spacious well laid out, comfortably furnished, and has all the amenities, even WiFi and a game area in the garage. We loved the open plan kitchen/dining/living/loft area; it’s perfect for a family gathering. It sleeps 9 adults comfortably, making it well worth the cost. It is also very private, on top of a hill with nice views of fields, woods, and Sayre in the distance. Weather didn’t allow us to use the pool or hot tub, but they looked inviting.
The recommended road is a bit of a challenge, especially in bad weather or in the dark, though there is a better road once you know where to go (but you must watch for the kamikaze dogs!)
JoAnn is a perfect host: friendly and helpful when needed and invisible otherwise, even though she seems to live very close by.
Everyone in our group was very pleased and we would definitely return."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a girls’ weekend at JoAnn’s. The kitchen and living room set up was perfect for hanging out and we enjoyed walking the property and visiting with the dogs that live down the hill. JoAnn was very responsive when we had questions.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was incredible with many amenities . JoAnn was a very accommodating and communitive host. Highly recommended with 5 stars across the board! Thanks JoAnn!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was spacious and beautiful. The sunset was the best! Joann was very responsive and even had a fire lit for us.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came back to the area for a family event and absolutely loved staying here! Everything was spotless when we arrived and JoAnn gave us great directions. The views are amazing and it’s just such a peaceful, spacious home."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"JoAnn’s place was beautiful! We went there for a weekend for my brothers 21st birthday party. It was the perfect size for our large group of 7! This place was private and it was even more beautiful with the snow. The drive up and down the road from the place was a little tricky with the snow, but other than that this place was perfect! Will definitely consider staying here in the near future! And JoAnn was quick to all of my questions! If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway, with a hot tub too, this place is the place to be!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want a private, beautiful getaway JoAnn's place is for you. I can't say enough. It is gorgeous and clean from the basement to the bathrooms. The bed sheets smelled so good. The home has everything you need. The view OMG you feel the sunset on your face as it rises from the master bedroom. You can also enjoy it from the deck. The bomb fire you can make is ridiculously awesome! My dogs were living their best life here too. So very private. We couldn't use the pool because of the weather but it is a decent size pool so I can imagine the summer here! JoAnn's respinse time is immediate. I highly recommend this home! My family loved it. The decor- chef's kiss. Just rent it lol"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful well kept house in a great location. Would definitely visit again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and awesome property. We hope to visit again.

2023-10-01,4,Group trip,Loved the place and the view it was just a little different to get there pretty muddy road
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is 100 times better than the pictures! We got married and was looking for a place to stay the day before and after! The hot tub was amazing! The view was absolutely beautiful! We had a nice big fire and used the fireplace inside… if we had more time we would have had so much fun! Shortly after we checked in we were outside and got to meet Joann and her husband they were very friendly and said if we needed anything at all do not hesitate to ask! We plan on coming back and staying for longer next time and bringing more friends! 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone looking for a rustic style cabin to sit back relax and enjoy!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second stay, and it’s becoming an annual tradition! The home is an absolute hidden gem, perfect for a relaxing weekend with family or friends."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun place, nice views. Private cabin with plenty of space."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Awesome Place
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic place to stay. It is so quiet and peaceful. The view is amazing. Pictures were exactly how it was. Kitchen was stocked with kitchenware so we could stay in and cook. The RTV was a great amenity being able to grab extra firewood and even go around the property. The pool was amazing especially on the warmer days. Fully stocked with games which we all had so much fun playing. If you are looking to be right around the corner from stores, etc. this is not the place for you. But we wanted a secluded location and we got just that. Home was beautiful and plenty big enough for 8 people. We will definitely be coming back!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We booked for a cousins weekend getaway. It was just what we wanted, private with views. JoAnn was easy to communicate with. We loved the cabin-in-the-woods feel and it had everything we needed. The home and linens were clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Always a great time here. Whenever we come back there's always thoughtful updates to enhance the stay (laundry baskets, pool floaties for the kids, games, books, etc.). The view never gets old. Had some spectacular sunsets. I'm sure we will be back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most WONDERFUL stay! The house was even better than advertised, there was plenty of everything we needed - linens, towels, paper products, laundry detergent - as well as tons to do! The ping pong and fooseball in the garage was so much fun. Pool and hot tub were pristine, kitchen was well stocked, and JoAnn was super responsive whenever we had a question. Run don’t walk to book here—we’re already planning our next trip back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,The view was absolutely breath taking. The home was beautiful and very comfortable. Plenty of outdoor seating. The pool and hot tub were very nice. And the fire pit was amazing. Perfect if you’re staying with a large party. Thank you so much 😊
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I got to spend well needed time together. the surroundings are absolutely beautiful. The home is very cozy ! Stunning art all the way through! I wouldn’t change a thing and definitely worth the cost. Looking forward to booking again
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Peacefully nestled in the woods. Great pool and hot tub. Had an awesome weekend away. Thanks.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"PERFECT! Could not have asked for a better place to vacation and relax. We had such an amazing experience and will without a doubt return!
JoAnn and her brothers Scott and Steve were all wonderful and so friendly. We picked blueberries, watched some beautiful sunsets, went exploring and 4 wheeling through the woods while seeing some cool wildlife. Met some super sweet pups, played in the pool and relaxed in the hot tub. Giant bon fires, good food and family.
It seems the Beemans have thought of just about everything to make your vacation at their family home a fun and memorable experience.
Eight of us visited including kids ages 2, 6 & 8 and nana, 75, and we ALL had an equally wonderful time. Cannot say enough great things about this place, we will all recommend to anybody willing to listen. Driving home and the whole car is already asking to go back!
If you’re looking for a place to get away from the craziness and everyday hustle and bustle, this is your place."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"JoAnn's idyllic house sits at the top of a hill and has breathtaking sunsets.
We spent the week there for a family gathering and we had a lovely time. The kids had a blast using the pool and foosball table.
A very kind neighbor brought us freshly picked blueberries and the host was very responsive- including when we locked ourselves out of the house!
It's a place to relax and disconnect. If you need to stay digitally connected- as I had to due to some work related loose ends-  you may have to rely on your hotspot as Wifi connection is pretty intermittent. (there is reliable cable TV if you just need entertainment).
However if your plan is to disconnect from the hustle and bustle then the place is ideal to relax and soak up the pastoral landscape. "
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,the house was great! Jo Ann was very responsive. our families had a great time on the property.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a wonderful stay on the hill. Peaceful, serene and relaxing. This is one of our favorite places to stay and a beautiful space to gather with family. We look forward to staying again soon. Thank you JoAnn and family for your hospitality."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed that peacefulness of the property! We were able to relax on the porch, in the hot tub or anywhere in the comfortable home. We were there for our son's graduation so we didn't get to enjoy the space as much as we would've liked but this is definitely a place to come back to for a relaxing get away!! Everything was gorgeous!!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"It was a beautiful house on a hilltop. Great views! Charming and private .Well kept.
We wish we had more time to spend there."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The spacious log cabin was on a gorgeous setting that takes your breath away! Sunrise on front of house and beautiful sunset at back porch! Kitchen was huge and fully equipped for entertaining. Th hot tub was clean and fit our entire family! We really enjoyed the lovely log cabin and will be back for a longer stay!!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place has a magical view and retains the charm of a large family home that was well planned and beautifully decorated. Pool and hot tub are great for kids and relaxing. Fully stocked bon fire big enough for a tribe to sit around. Loft with 3 bedrooms on 2nd floor and master suite on 1st. 3 bathrooms helpful with big group. Lots of amenities—full of coffee pods, a case of water, even alcohol under the bar. Joann stopped by with her two dogs and we enjoyed meeting them. Biggest thing to know is the drive up the hill to the home is long and steep and narrow…road is a dirt road. So first time get there in daylight."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time visiting with a group of friends. We love coming here! It’s so peaceful, the area is beautiful and the home is amazing. It rained during our trip but we were able to enjoy board games, the ping pong table and of course the hot tub and the scenery was still gorgeous to view under the covered patio. We already have another group of friends looking to visit later this year because of how much we love it here and we will be back again next year!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,House is beautiful and hot tub was a hit! The view is also amazing. House did have a musty/stuffy smell but with some candles it went away. Host is very responsive and kind.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"first and foremost the description is truthful the driveway is intense. I arrived at night in a minivan and was a little freaked out climbing this huge off road mountain path through the woods and no civilization, I had aniexty... until I pulled up to the cabin and realized YOUR ON TOP OF THE VALLEY. it's absolutely gorgeous, literally took my breath away it was so beautiful. The house is placed perfectly with a gorgeous back drop view of the valley. IF YOU WANT SECLUSION THIS IS THE PLACE! Checked myself in with a key pad and went exploring. This house screams hosting family and that's exactly what I used it for. Myself and my adult sisters enjoyed the space so much. we actually live nearby but wanted a neutral space for a ""stay-cation"" this house was perfect. I'll rent again when the pool is open (stayed in April) there is a hot tub though which we loved and used but be mindful I stepped back to far at the hot tub deck as there wasnt a railing (also was a little tipsy) and fell."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our trip was to visit family members, so we were familiar with the surroundings. The home was the best part of the trip. My husband and I were able to enjoy quiet time with our kids and grand child, which was well worth our time and money well spent. Thank you Beeman family for a beautiful place to relax."

We hope to come back soon as this a great place to relax."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an absolute amazing oasis! from the views, pool, house itself, all around spectacular.
we came for a girls wkend away and had a weekend to remember. we spent so much time sitting at the end of the field, taking in the sky and sunsets. the pool was great for a super hot weekend. joann was great to work with as a house and so accommodating and quick to answer any questions.
we definitely plan on returning for another visit as this place was beautiful and unforgettable!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect reunion weekend! Fully stocked kitchen, lovely pool, super comfy. Can’t wait to come back! Like others said, the dirt road takes forever but worth it for the view alone. JoAnn is super responsive and ask to meet the dogs!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"our family had an amazing stay here. The view from the cabin is absolutely gorgeous looking over the mountains, the sunsets were beautiful. The cabin itself is also beautiful, the pictures don't do it justice. The hosts are very kind and have thought of everything to make for a comfortablle and enjoyable vacation for their guests. The guys enjoyed the use of the kaboda to ride the trails and gather wood for their bonfires at night, the firepit is huge! Also, the stargazing was amazing up there as well! We had some 90 degree days and really enjoyed using the pool those days. We had such a nice time we wish we could've stayed longer. It was the peaceful relaxation we were looking for and we would definately stay again! Thank you Joann, Steve and Scott for your kind hospitality!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay. Spacious and peaceful.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This home has everything you need and so much more. Beautiful and peaceful setting, enough room for the 8 person limit and more. Plenty of games and entertainment if the outdoors doesn't beckon you to explore. More than fully equipped kitchen. We found it to be our best experience yet.
JoAnn was very communicative and thoughtful."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This is our 2nd stay here and every time we go we wind up bringing more and more people with us and still have a ton of room left over the house is big enough to host well over 50 people comfortably inside and outside you can have a 500 party easy That's how big it is this Is a 300 acre property with about I don't even know how many trails . they let you borrow the koboda I forget exactly what it's called But I think that's the name and We had a 20' fire. they Redid the garage added a ping pong table and Official foosball table (when We last stayed we were the 3rd person to actually stay there It's nice to see what was added and rearranged). the basement has some big arcade machine That Has pacman and galactica I think there's maybe 5 different games in there there's karaoke and a bunch of other stuff . They have 2 separate bars they have ample amounts of room. the Jacuzzi is off the wall. We had fun barbecuing all nights. Joanne and Steve are super friendly Scott helped us fix the heater for the poo.l We had so much fun and they are super nice. the property is amazing the views are breathtaking you can see at least 10 mountains from their hill, they have a restaurant where you can eat at if you would like . is it awesome They was an ice cream shop right there a great antique shop there's so much to do and see they have wild Life right up to the house We saw a frog rabbit hummingbird deer. The kids had a lot of fun as well And weren't bored at all. The dog had fun running around the property. Absolutely love all of the beds they were so comfortable and the new Carpet. There is also a hidden gem right over the hill and let me tell you it is amazing you can barbecue there they have swings there they have a bad swing they have a huge ponds where you can kayak you can fish so make sure you grab some Arsenals because they also have another pet actually and about the pond over the hill you will not be disappointed. You can walk it or you can just take the kobota right over. My friends want to rebook and my boyfriend and I would love to rebook in the fall as well."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,House is great- many small details and comfortable- great place to hang with friends and family. We had a great time. JoAnn was attentive and great communicator.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing house and property! The road up the mountain is long so don’t turn back! Just keep following the cute signs on the trees! Steven and JoAnn were great hosts, and were right there if we needed anything! They kept the fire pit full of wood and let us use the Kubota to explore the property! The Pool was opened for us and as it was a hot weekend we were able to cool off too! The Home is very well stocked and has so much space, and many games to keep you busy. You could not ask for more with this place! Beautiful views to boot!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House and property both amazing. Very relaxing and peaceful. Hosts were great with communication everything was great. Would definitely recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This location and home are amazing! It was the perfect place to get away with friends and unwind for the weekend. Before we even left we were planning the next time we could all come back to stay again. I cannot say enough good things about what a wonderful time we were able to have thanks to Joann and the family!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy and peaceful mountain retreat
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a long road to get to the top of hill , so look at signs that are posted on the trees . The home is beautiful and peaceful. Great for family gatherings and weddings"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing and comfortable place to share with family! Joanne is a wonderful host, and our family time was just perfect in this beautiful log lodge. The kitchen is stocked to prepare meals, and the grandchildren loved the basement game room and the games in the garage. They had a great time. We will return and would recommend it for anyone!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is absolutely amazing! The pictures don’t do it justice because there’s so much more. It had everything we needed for a fun weekend getaway. It’s a beautiful house with an amazing view! We will definitely be back in the summer. Hosts were also great and easy to contact :)
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for your beautiful house . We had amazing time
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A perfect getaway. We loved our movie weekend at Beeman's house on the hill. The inside was beautiful and the view was spectacular. We will definitely visit again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing ! Beautiful home, beautiful view ! Excellent communication with Joann, she was an amazing host! I would definitely recommend this stay to all of my family and friends ! 🥰"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay and the hospitality is like no other!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This unexpected delight will be a place you’ll never forget. A little bit off the beaten path onto land that has been in this person’s family for a very long time. They were so great and how the check in process went, how our stay was going with regular communication and the check out was a breeze."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful log home was both spacious and comfortable for a get away with our son's family. As we drove up the long mountain dirt lane, surrounded by forest, we knew it was the perfect place for us. JoAnn was a super host who quickly responded to any questions we had. She even left us a welcome basket of fresh baked muffins that were tasty with morning coffee and tea. The furnishings were comfortable and the kitchen was equipped with most everything we needed to prepare family meals for our 3 night vacation. We enjoyed our evenings around the beautiful stone hearth wood stove with a glass front to watch the flickering flames. The hot tub was so nice. We enjoyed making gingerbread houses in the large dining area with the grandchildren. And walks on the property held beautiful views. We hope to return in warm weather to enjoy the pool and longer hikes with more of our family. And we look forward to time around the huge fire pit come warmer weather. We highly recommend this beautiful home for a quiet country stay with friends and family. Thankyou to the Beeman family for sharing your home!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property tucked away from the hustle and bustle. This home is a gem situated on the hilltop, offering gorgeous views. Joann is responsive and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. This place is beyond 5 stars. We wished we had booked a longer stay! We hope to return soon. Thank you Beeman family for such wonderful hospitality."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The photos don’t do this house justice. We spent Thanksgiving with family here. The kitchen was so large, we had so much room to cook our feast. This is a beautiful log cabin home on top of the mountain. The sunsets are amazing. Cold nights enjoying the hot tub and fire pit. The Beeman family was very hospitable. We walked into the the house to find a basket of homemade muffins and a welcome note. Joann was so quick with responses. Steve set up the fire pit. Plenty of wood for the indoor fireplace. Kept the home warm and cozy. Bob the resident cat was so friendly and sneaky. He loved to run in the house and hang out any chance he got! We are definitely coming back."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"The owner of the home is great to communicate with. The home is amazing, clean, and the setting is beautiful. From the moment you walk in the door you will be amazed at how perfect this house is. We are already looking forward to going back next year."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin at the top of the mountain. The directions JoAnn provided got us right there. The road up to the cabin is a little intimidating especially if arriving at night, but if you just take it easy you’ll be fine. The ride up the mountain is totally worth it. Check in was a breeze. We were greeted by the Beeman family welcoming committee (a very sweet orange and white cat named Bob). Bob was a welcome visitor for the duration of our stay. We were provided with everything we needed for our stay and then some. Thank you Beemans for the delicious muffins!!! A great place to stay and a great value. We have family in the area and will most certainly look to book this listing again in the future."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great girls weekend getaway! The house is beautiful with a fantastic view. Just what we needed.
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,Great place to stay
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful place! Can’t wait to go back!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was great. Lots of room, great views, beautiful home. We felt very welcome there. Very comfortable."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This log cabin home is beautiful inside and out. Has an amazing view at the top of the hill. The gravel driveway/ road is quite long driving up, but you can see why once you get up there. It feels like you are in the middle of no where, since you kinda are, which makes it perfect mountain get away! Deer were in the backyard grazing. There's plenty of room inside to hang out."
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful home! Way up in the mountains but a lovely view
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"My daughters, my mom & I stayed at this beautiful house to get ready for our oldest daughters wedding. A perfect retreat for the girls!
The only thing I would mention is be prepared for that very long country driveway; keep going it is worth the drive :)"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb is outstanding. Great host, a amazing home and so many stunning views"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property is absolutely stunning and the hospitality is truly felt throughout our stay. Love the log house and and amenities it came with. somebody was always close by to come and help when needed at the property. I stayed there for a 3 day weekends with my family and honestly we will come again for a longer stay. the authentic log house decor, big kitchen, hot tub, firepit, swimming pool, games. tables tennis, foosball, many reasons to stay here! my favorite was sipping coffee in the morning sitting by the picnic table overlooking the view! thank you JoAnn for having us over!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a wonderful place to unwind and relax. I could see a family or group of friends having a fantastic time here. The house is so big that my partner and I only used the first floor, but coming from Brooklyn it was so nice to have so much room. The sunsets are picture perfect over the mountains."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,This is the perfect weekend get away if you are looking for a nice well kept secluded home. Joann and Steven are the best hosts! From the welcome card and cookies down to the nice message the day of checkout they really made you feel like their special guests. We enjoyed meeting the dogs and hanging with Bob the cat the whole weekend. Thank you again for a great weekend away. We will definitely be back again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is spectacular. The views and the privacy are amazing. The owner is a wonderful host and our family had a great vacation. Can’t wait to come back next year!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time. The place was beautiful and welcoming. JoAnn and Steve were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to everyone!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second time here! This is everything you need in a back-to-nature family vacation. Refreshing pool, rustic but immaculate accomodations, amazing views, gorgeous sunsets, and more. Our favorite part was the bonfire, which Steve set up for us a couple times. My kids loved chasing Bob the cat around the vast property. You can tell a lot of love was put into this house. Can't wait to return!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most magical stay at Joanne’s home. This was the perfect place to come and unwind for the week with our dog. We loved the hikes and the breathtaking scenery. Joann and her family are just so hospitable. We arrived to fresh baked cookies and a hand written card, and the experience only improved from there. Each element of the home felt designed to improve the experience as much as possible- from the outdoor dining and rocking chair set up, to the roofing choice that let just the right amount of light in when you are enjoying your outdoor hot tub experience. When we had trouble getting the fan to work, the family was super responsive, and talked us through fixing the problem. It’s clear that a lot of love and time have been poured into this place, and we were so lucky to be able to experience it.
Some things I don’t think have been mentioned before we came- the beds are super comfortable. We stayed in the downstairs king bed, which was a tempurpedic. We saw tons of wild life, including deer and even an eagle! There were blackberry bushes scattered along the trails, and the berries were in season! Stuck inside on a rainy day? There are tons of dvds and board games. The garage is a game room complete with a ping pong table and Mrs. Pac-Man set up!
I could probably also dedicate an entire paragraph to Bob, the resident cat. Bob seems to live in the garage, but will sneak insight the main house if you leave the door open (a welcome companion). I don’t think I have ever met a nicer, more gentle cat in my whole life. My puppy just loved him and Bob... well Bob was shockingly tolerant of his antics!
Just a few things to mention that were not cons, but things to consider. The wifi set up is actually a verizon jet pack hotspot, with a monthly data limit. We arrived on the 26th of the month, and there was no data available. We were able to use data on our phones, but it was spotty. Honestly, this was a great way to disconnect for me (and what a beautiful place to do it) but this amazing stay might not be your first pick if you need to -say- work remotely with internet access. One other small thing to note is that the grill could use a deep cleaning. We did what we could, but I’d recommend you keep an eye out to make sure none of the grease catches fire during use.
In all I’d rate our stay a 20/10. We (and our pup) can’t wait to go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay! The views were amazing and the house is beautiful! Very private. We loved having Bob the cat around and all the go.e touches! Can't wait tonstay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great family vacation at the Beeman House. The place was tastefully decorated, perfectly clean and chock full of amenities. The view was very scenic and there were multiple decks and porches to experience it from. We enjoyed using the outdoor pool and finishing up with the jacuzzi which were both private. Having a pet cat on premises to adopt for a few days was a delightful added bonus. We would highly recommend a stay at this home."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"JoAnn is a wonderful host and her home was perfect for our weekend family getaway. The view from the backyard was beautiful, and the location was very secluded. We really enjoyed the pool, hot tub, and various games provided, and we used the grill every day. The house was incredibly spacious and was more than enough for 7 adults. JoAnn was very quick to get back to us with our questions. The weekend went so fast, but we are very thankful to have stayed in this incredible home!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This was one of the best places I have stayed at. JoAnn and Steven were incredible. The house has everything you would need. JoAnn was great at communicating and we enjoyed going blueberry picking with her. There is a lovely cat there named Bob. We went with our dog and there was absolutely no issues. The cat was adorable and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for a family get together. Looking forward to staying there again!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This place was the best. Hope we can come back some time soon
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful retreat in the rolling hills. Lots to do and plenty of space to spread out. Great sunsets. We plan to visit again it’s that good!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place! Everything we had hoped for and more. The pics do not do it justice.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect place for a nice quiet get away. It was better than we had expected!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great secluded house on the hill. Lots of privacy, nature, and relaxation. communication was great and the place was exactly as advertise. The family and I had a great time. Thanks again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was in a beautiful location and had stunning views. Totally worth going up that hill! The owners hospitality was excellent. Steve took the boys on an ATV ride and they haven't stopped talking about it since. He also made sure we had plenty of wood for the bon fire. The dogs and the cat (Bob) became welcomed celebrities. The beds were comfortable, the home was spotless and the foosball table in the garage got our competitive side going. Ok...I'm going to stop talking about how amazing this place was, because I want to rent it again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location pool, hot tub, hiking, gorgeous views!! Very enjoyable"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"These were great host! The response time was immaculate. The log cabin was amazing. the amenities were great. Especially the thoughtfulness of fresh baked cookies, the wood for the bonfire, and use of the pool and hot tub. It was so much fun. The log cabin was so clean and the master bed was very comfy. The water was hot for showers. The kitchen had some spices and seasoning, which was nice for cleaning."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend Joanns house ... amazing house, great location with lots of nature around the house, lots of open spaces for any outdoor activity"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at JoAnn’s was perfect for a family trip. So spacious and the views can’t be beat. Joann and her family were responsive to any needs or concerns we had. So much fun and would highly recommend for a relaxing get away.
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,This was a great spot for a weekend getaway. Tremendous value and amenities. We really enjoyed the hot tub and the kitchen/dining space.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend staying at this beautiful location!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I’m hesitant to write my review because I wish I could hide this amazing home so that we can book it again and again but then I would be robbing other families of the opportunity to stay at the absolute best Airbnb! From the minute we arrived at the house we felt welcome and at home by fresh baked cookies chocolates and a hand written note from JoAnn followed by a big hello from Steve who was already working on the biggest firepit we have ever seen! The house was huge but cozy and the pictures don’t do it justice at all! From the huge bedrooms to the wet bar and balcony and patios it was an endless space for the kiddies to stretch out. It was well equipped for everything and anything with fully stocked cabinets of more pots pans utensils and gadgets than I have in my own home. Plenty of towels blankets washer dryer board games and movies galore! The hot tub was amazing and huge! Plenty of privacy but JoAnn Steve and Wendy were just a call or holler away if need anything but there was nothing to be needed. Getting a private atv tour from Steve of their massive property on the mountain was the highlight of our trip! A pond a creek tons of walking and riding trails and plenty of dogs to pet and even a cat that loves hugs made this place better than any stay at a resort. The Beemans are lucky and blessed to be able to have this place and give others the opportunity to make memories with families and friends. There is nothing they could have done to make our stay better and I just hope they decide to keep their home on Airbnb for many years to come because we will be a repeat visitor for sure and could see this being our family’s goto place for as long as they will let us!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Upon our arrival, how pleasantly surprised we were to receive a lovely note and home made cookies to welcome us. The house is lovely and comfortable and we had a delightful time enjoying the great outdoors. How wonderful it was to be greeted by nature every day!!!. Our weekend stay gave us many memories to cherish. The house has many modern appliances and fully equipped to fulfill everyone’s needs. Sayre is a great place to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. Would love to go back in the nearby future."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so fantastic! We really didn’t have anywhere specific we wanted to go. We were looking for private home, in nature with peaceful views and a hot tub. JoAnn’s home was amazing. The home is cozy, yet so spacious. The hilltops view from the large front porch was just breathtaking. Our boys loved the game room garage."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Lovely place with an awesome view. Hot tub was well taken care of. Host responded quickly to any of our inquiries. Would definitely consider returning. The cool cat was a plus!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The views are amazing. Being able to watch the sunset was such a wonderful surprise. Our puppy got to run around free with all the space. We all had such a great time! :)
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoAnn’s home exceeded our expectations. The home is set on 16 acres and feels very private. The drive up the dirt driveway to the top of the hill is marked with little white signs to keep you motivated and let you know you’re on the right track. The exposed beams on the inside definitely give the home a rustic cabin vibe. The home is comfortable, the views stretch for miles, and the jacuzzi is quite relaxing. We would recommend driving the hour to nearby Seneca Lake to try some of the local vineyards."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice and cozy house with beautiful views. The hot tub was amazing, and there were many movies to watch too!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"You will not regret your stay in this beautiful home. We loved everything about the place and look forward to planning another time where we can spend a week here. Bob the cat was a hit, and he received his fair share of love, pets, and snuggles. Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay. The house looked better than what we expected. Beautiful view, highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful cabin on the hill. The views are amazing, the photos listed online don’t do this home justice. We stayed in the winter and was not sure our family would keep busy but with so many activities at the house and property we ran out of time to do everything. We ended up packing some snowshoes and spent hours exploring the large property. The Beeman family is one of the most welcoming and friendliest families you will ever meet. So happy we found this posting, we would love to visit again."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,Such an amazing stay! Our group went in the winter but we definitely want to come back in the summer. Bob the house cat was a hit amongst our group! Everything was super clean and the whole house had a nice personal touch. Would definitely recommend!!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 absolutely loved our stay! JoAnn and Steve were both incredibly responsive and welcoming hosts. The home is beautiful and well-appointed. (I think it’s helpful to note that the 4th bedroom is a loft open to the main living space below). The beds were incredibly comfortable and we enjoyed making meals in the well-stocked kitchen.
The property is absolutely gorgeous. We had so much fun playing in the snow, relaxing in the hot tub, and riding in the Kaboda! We never even turned on the TV, enjoying games at the kitchen table every night. It was a much-needed reprieve from screens, and family time we wouldn’t trade for anything.
Thanks JoAnn and Steve!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely spectacular. Cozy, cute and very well appointed. I couldn't be happier with the experience. JoAnn's excellent communication made everything happen incredibly smoothly and the property was absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommended."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"JoAnn, Wendy, & Steven were great host’s ! The cabin was very nice && spacious, everything was nice & clean, and everything in the house was very easy to find ! The hot tub,the 4 wheeler, & the ping pong table was deff our favorite part ! We’re looking forward to renting it during the summer time ."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!!!
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house is huge and has an amazing view! JoAnn was very easy to get in contact with. They started the wood stove for us before we arrived and kept the firewood stocked. The drive up the hill was a bit of a challenge in the snow, but JoAnn was giving updates about weather so we knew what the conditions were like."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m starting off by saying we are already looking at booking this house for July.
Such a friendly family, JoAnn was super communicative and Steven was so helpful and nice. We enjoyed talking to him and meeting his amazing dogs.
The house itself was perfect for our needs, sparklying clean, spacious, large open kitchen, beautiful firewood stove, plenty of space to relax, comfortable beds and bedrooms, all the linens and towels were fresh and clean. The house was equipped with EVERYTHING you may need.
We really enjoyed cooking and talking at the same time since the open and large kitchen is very conducive to this.
We LOVED the hut tub, which was already warm when we got there (so was the fire), after a warm hot tub hangout, make your way to the fireplace for a cozy nightcap, and in the morning enjoy the beautiful view off the kitchen while sipping some tea/coffee.
Steve also built a huge bonfire and we were able to get it going on our last full day, so much fun.
Our dogs really enjoyed exploring the woods and running around the open field with all the snow.
We had a beautiful and relaxing time in your wonderful property and are super excited to come back in the future.
Thank you JoAnn and Steven for sharing your family home with us. Thank you again for a wonderful time, we will be back!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time staying at the house! We loved the indoor fireplace and the hot tub (in snow). The WiFi was finicky and very slow when we got there, but got much faster after the monthly cycle got renewed. I'd double check if people are planning to work from the house. All in all, it was one of the best getaway vacations we took!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My partner and I are so grateful to JoAnn and her family for the opportunity to stay at their idyllic family cabin. As a fellow next-generation-family-home trustee, I really appreciate the fact that the Beeman siblings are doing all they can to keep the property in their family's name - and that we got to benefit from it. The property and the cabin are incredibly spacious. Visiting during the pandemic, it was a perfect place to get away from the city. Despite the fact that we only left the cabin to pick up provisions before a snow storm, we still felt like we had novelty in our experience every day. The wood burning stove was a particular highlight of our cozy stay, as well as the hot tub, which we got to enjoy as the snow fell around us. We were also so grateful to be able to bring our dogs with us for our stay. Living in a city, we need to be vigilant the second we walk out our door, with cars, people, and other dogs. Being able to let them outside and run freely immediately - I don't know that I have ever seen them so happy! Our puppy also got to experience his first snow at the cabin, which is a memory we will always cherish. We are very hopeful to return to the cabin in the future - and hope that as the pandemic ends we'll be able to bring some friends with us next time. Thank you for all of your assistance in facilitating a much-needed and very relaxing week away!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A spacious cabin that is perfect for a small group or family getaway. There’s a well equipped kitchen for those who want to cook, as well as a grill outside and good size bonfire. Deer graze the field in front of the house and the woods a great for walks.
Really enjoyed our break and would highly recommend this home if you are looking to get away."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoAnn’s home is so beautiful. It is way bigger than the pictures make it out to be. Sitting by the warm fire watching tv, walking outside to the extraordinary view, to sitting in the hot tub. The town is very cute with shops and there’s a Walmart nearby. There were pots and pans and all the cooking gear you’ll need. We didn’t want to leave! Our dog loved it and the cat in the garage was the sweetest boy ever!! He was nothing but love. We saw deer and lots of birds. Would love to come back."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Excellent location with everything you could need for a getaway in the Pennsylvanian mountains. The kind of place you would want to come back and stay again.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"JoAnn’s home is incredible. A hidden gem, with everything our group of 6 could have wanted or needed. We made incredible memories. The views are amazing and the hot tub at night was the perfect way to end the night. We can’t wait to come back!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"JoAnn's place was amazing! From the signs on driveway telling us to ""keep going"" to Steven helping us with the fireplace, everything we encountered was as thoughtful as it was delightful! The house was clean and there was plenty of space for 5 adults and a dog. The views were amazing. The house is larger than it appears in the photos. JoAnn was very communicative and all of our questions were answered. I would highly recommend this place, and we'll definitely be back if JoAnn will have us!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a a amazing place! A perfect getaway when you want to unplug and relax. The views, the hot tub, the kitchen and the fire pit were amazing. We were a little disappointed with the cleaning job which is super important to us in the covid era. If I knew it would be better attended to in the future I would definitely return."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place for a peaceful getaway with a picturesque view. We had a great time. The host was fantastic!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. The pictures do not do it justice. The atv rides the trails and pond. The house was alot bigger then the pictures and the loft was amazing all the lights worked and they had evvvwryrhing a house will need. And theres a cute cat in the garage a orange n white furry friend. The fire pit was the highwst ive ever seen. Joann gave us great tips and travel info very friendly and steve down the hill is hilarious and amazing. His dogs r so sweet and he accommodated our every need. We went to the town owego and you have to check out the early oswego antique store and the strip its on has amazing little eateries and cute shops...a real cute town feel... The salt jacuzzi was out of this world and so relaxing.. Worth the 4 and a half our drive from brooklyn ny . we celedlbrated our 2 year anniversary there n our 2 beat friends came n had an amazing time as well. House was warm n cozy... Loved late night game nights and fires loved the biiiiggg open field and loved the signs on the left side of the trees on the way up the mountain they were funny. By far one of the best trips and experiences.. Ty again.. We will book again...its so worth it!!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time at JoAnn’s beautiful hidden gem this past weekend. The views from the house were stunning, specially with the fall foliage colors. The drive leading up to the house can be a little scary at first as it’s a bit steep but quickly got used to it and It was great coming back from a day of hiking and relaxing in the tub. Also the pup loved running around in the open field. It’s a huge piece of property up in the mountains, it can’t get more peaceful than that
Oh and there’s the sweetest cat that lives in the garage that we absolutely fell in love with.
Highly recommend JoAnn’s place."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful setting....loved the view!!!
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to enjoy nature. Quintessential log cabin experience in a house that accommodated a group of 6 people perfectly. We would definitely come again as it seems like a beautiful place to see the during the fall when the leaves start changing. Lots of taxidermy in the house which can be a little unsettling if you’re not used to it. The place has amazing amenities like a camp fire, pool, and hot tub. The cutest cat lives here that adores being petted too. Highly recommend this place!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,JoAnns house is beautiful and equipped with all the essentials and more. watching the stars by the fire pit was amazing. Everything in the house was great and I’m definitely coming back
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"JoAnn and her family were incredible hosts! And what a house!
We had so much fun exploring the trails and hanging in the pool. And JoAnn gave great tips for day trips in neighboring areas. And, one of the best parts was grilling and eating outside with incredible views every night."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,This mountain home was a perfect space for a socially distanced relaxed vacation! If you are looking to grocery shop and then stay put this is it! The private pool and hot tub were fabulous! Family was friendly and super helpful. The only thing missing is a bug zapper to keep bugs out when going in and out of the house. Even comes with its own house visitor cat!
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Huge property... great hospitality nice for long walks. Great for families with a pool and jacuzzi for hot days and relaxation.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want a private vacation or a short getaway from busy city, this place is perfect. During the hot day, you can spend time near the pool. And those chilly nights near the fire pit."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing time at Joann's property. Awesome views, incredible sunsets, great time around the firepit (the owners set it up for us several times during our stay), and a great outdoor space including a grill and a private pool. The house itself is cozy and inviting, with amazing woodworking details. Joann was responsive to any requests we had and a great host! We also got to tour the expansive property with Steven and his friendly dogs on his ATV. Don't hesitate to book this property, it has everything you can think of and more!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house is beautiful with lots of room and an incredible view. Nature walks at the doorstep. JoAnn and her family went above and beyond to make us welcome. We can’t wait to come back and enjoy the house again.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. The pictures don’t do it justice. Highly recommend to future guests
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Very friendly & welcoming
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoAnn’s place exceeded our expectations! The home is very cozy and has everything you need, and JoAnn is quick at responding with any questions you may have. We enjoyed everything about our weekend and what the location has to offer - the privacy, cooking meals and watching movies, discovering local hiking trails, running around in the yard with the dogs, enjoying some drinks and watching the sunset, melting in the hot tub, and our personal favorite, a 4 wheel excursion with Steven and his dogs! It was the perfect weekend getaway and we’d gladly return."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of the best airbnb vacations ever! Great place, warm hospitality, and great communicators. Highly recommended."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,JoAnn’s place was so beautiful. The views are incredible and she was a wonderful host.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Hi folks! We had a lovely evening at this very private Pennsylvania cabin. It’s high on the hill overlooking Beemans restaurant area. An extra 5 mi up from there (the dead end of Case rd). The cabin is clean and nice. There are only two things I wished I had known....If you have any sensitivities to scented detergents I recommend that you pack your own bedding....(the sheets were clean but they did smell heavy of “floral scent” softener). Also bring drinking water with you. Other than those two things it was fine and I highly recommend a stay here!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property was absolutely stunning - clean, private and confortable. The house was huge but very cozy with a wood stove to keep it warm. The jacuzzi was large and very clean. The house is up on a tall hill with an amazing view. The address is not on a map but was easy to find. Lots of land for hiking. Would love to come back and stay again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and site are beautiful. If you like a comfortable cabin with an amazing view, a hot tub and a fireplace.. this is the place for you! We Absolutely loved it and the host is great as well. Thank you!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is rustic but beautiful set high a top the hills with stunning views. The house is fully equipped and very nicely decorated and welcoming. We had a wonderful stay and would do it again and time of the year.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing, huge but really cozy and comfortable house! It’s on the top of the hill - very quite and the view is gorgeous.
Sit around a giant fire pit, relax in a hot tub, swim in a pool or hike in a forest. Everything you can hope for!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had everything we needed and then some! Great location to spend time with family or go out for a leisurely walk. Very relaxing and beautiful place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Keith was the perfect host. Responsive. Helpful. The space was a perfect place for us to stay for a week to visit family and enjoy the area. Highly recommend!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Keith and family were extremely helpful during the stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very very good price to stay and location. Thank you so much! We love your house!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay and very friendly atmosphere
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have stayed in several BnBs and this was at the top of the list. Jana was ""the hostess with the mostest"". The air bnb was so pretty and decorated in a delightful way. So many small touches that made it relaxing and welcoming. There were treats on the counter and in the fridge! We didn't want to leave and definitely will be back! As we told Jana , we felt like we have a new friend! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic stay! Such a peaceful setting, very relaxing. Jana was so friendly and welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Couldn’t ask for more! Can’t wait to come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jana was so fantastic! She greeted us upon arrival, walked us to where we would be staying, showed us the ropes, and had fantastic communication. She even had little treats and drinks in the fridge, which was nice after the long journey there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana's place is great -- a beautiful setting and Jana takes great care with her guests. I would love to stay again !!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They are exceptional hosts who are highly responsive and made us feel at home. We were pleasantly surprised by the snacks they provided, especially since we didn't always have time to go grocery shopping after a busy day of activities. It was a slightly longer drive than we would have preferred to some of the parks we visited (we knew that going into it). However, it was great to be able to end the day outside by the fire. Definitely would recommend it!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like home away from home! All the extra little touches Jana provided made our stay so convenient, cozy and relaxing! We hope to return soon!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here! The place is very cozy and comfortable. One of the best Airbnbs I have stayed at. The host was so nice, made sure we had everything we could need, plus more. Thanks Jana!!:)
It’s outside of the city area, if that’s what you are looking for, but also just a 30 mins drive from all the tourist attractions. Perfect for a romantic getaway! :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely amazing experience. it's a beautiful space with so much attention to the little things. everytime something came up, it was just there at my fingertips. we were really blown away by this experience and I will definitely be booking again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was mine and my boyfriends first timing staying at a BNB. It was the best BNB experience we ever have. The host were so kind and sweet, and also very good with communicating. The home was very clean and the decor was beautiful! We can't wait to go back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy country retreat was the post wedding retreat location my wife and I took right after our wedding, and it truly did not disappoint! Jana has cultivated a bird oasis right outside of the Airbnb unit (through the use of many flowers and birdhouses), and as lovers of all things outdoors, my wife and I were drawn to the many up-close avian visitors (house finches, golden finches, and hummingbirds!). In the mornings, we ate breakfast outside with the birds. In the evening, we put a fire on in the firepit (supplies provided) and sipped champagne that Jana gave to us! Jana also made a unique windowpane art piece in the outdoor space that commemorated our wedding day! At every turn, each and every little detail in the Airbnb unit was addressed by Jana, and our experience was simply delightful because of it. Truly a hidden gem.
(My wife and I also drove to downtown Owego to do the riverfront walk after getting dinner at Jackpot Ritchie's Chicken BBQ - definitely recommend!)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite air bnb. Beautiful, relaxing, and fully accommodating!! We look forward to returning."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about this charming AirBnB was exquisite... hands down one of the best we've experienced. Exactly the relaxing retreat my husband and I needed to get away from it all. Lots of extras... snacks, breakfast items, and beverages. Picturesque views of the countryside from the patio, where we enjoyed an evening by the fire pit (a basket of s'mores ingredients awaited us). All areas were tastefully and artfully decorated, and the property is beautifully maintained. Jana and George are delightful hosts. We didn't want leave!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and comfortable location! Host was very nice and accommodating. Appreciated the stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the prettiest, coziest stay my partner and I have ever had! The personal touches were the cherry on top of an already breathtaking view, comfy bed, and kind hosts. 10/10 will be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jana and George are amazing hosts! Jana texted ahead and asked what snacks my daughter and I like. They were both very easy to communicate with. They had so many little things that made it easy to stay there like a lighted parking spot that said “guest parking”, lights that make it so you can see to walk to the outside door, little welcoming signs, a binder of ideas for the area, throw blankets to use while watching tv, orange juice, eggs, and milk in the fridge, and even homemade soap that smelled wonderful!
The property is BEAUTIFUL! and very peaceful. The bed was comfortable. They have 2 recliners to relax in, which was perfect for my daughter and I.
My favorite was their chairs on the back patio where you can sit and look at their beautiful view, either in the sun or the shade.
I don’t know if I’ll ever get to go back to New York but if I do, I’d definitely want to go there again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING! The house was absolutely gorgeous. They are so sweet and came out to car to help us with our stuff because it was starting to rain. They went above and beyond to make it feel like a home away from home. They had stocked a variety of coffee, snacks and beverages including a bottle of wine! They also provided everything for a bon fire including a smores kit. The place was so cozy and perfect for 2 people. Also provided a detailed book of anything you could want to do in the area! We went on a few hikes and ate a restaurant listed and both were fantastic! Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone and personally would love to go back. It was absolutely perfect for a little weekend getaway trip!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The photos are nice but go there and you will see that the place is far better than any of the pictures. Our visit was pure joy. We loved the stay and you will too. I won't ruin the surprise-go outside at night. We plan to go back. The hosts did a spectacular job making their guests feel spoiled.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana and George are wonderful hosts. This is an incredible place to stay. We will be returning!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a lovely and peaceful rural retreat! The patio area and fire pit were a rare treat. The hosts are friendly and available, yet still give you plenty of privacy. The snacks and drinks were a thoughtful extra touch. You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into maintaining and decorating the property and it is well worth it. This place is wonderful!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana and George provide a wonderful retreat. This was our second time staying, and I expect not the last! Incredibly well-equipped kitchen with all sorts of thoughtful touches. A real gem."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jana's place is gorgeous! It have everything you could possible need and is in a beautiful location with amazing views.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely adorable little place! Very private! Jana was extremely responsive to any questions and very accommodating! Even though we had rain much of our stay we were still able to drink coffee in the mornings outside under the deck. Tons of birds chirping and hummingbirds and the view is incredible! Will definitely book here again when I’m in the area!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb is located in a very cute and quiet area in Owego, there are also many great restaurant (Owego kitchen is a must!) and places for grocery. The kitchen is fantastically stocked with everything you might need for a trip, we stayed there for about 3 nights and are very very happy! It is a easy drive distance to Watkins glen, Ithaca and Finger Lakes. Highly recommended for anyone if you are visiting. Jana and George are amazing host, super friendly and sweet. We couldn't have asked for a better experience for our 4th of July vacation."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is great. Wonderful secluded location, very peaceful. Jana is an excellent host; great communication and service. Would love to book again! Great experience overall."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana's place is even better than how it looks in the photos. We had a wonderful time enjoying the outdoors. All the amenities were great and the place felt like home. A really nice warm home! Jana was very welcoming and helpful. We look forward to going back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! We have stayed in many air bnb locations and this is the best! Fantastic location, tastefully decorated and landscaped, wonderful extras including local beers and wine, snack basket and homemade soap. Anywhere else that we stay is going to be a let down! We’ll be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for the ideal place to get away and relax, this is it. The apartment is absolutely beautiful, and the grounds are a place of serenity. Jana is a superb host who is very accommodating with excellent communication. It is the special touches she does for her guests that you will probably not find anywhere else. This was my first experience with Airbnb, and it was a 10 plus. I will be hard pressed to find another place as wonderful as this :-)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here! This was such an amazing airb&b experience. Everything, from the layout to the location to the treats, was fantastic. Jana was kind, welcoming, and available if we needed anything. The property is gorgeous and not too far from the downtown area. We felt so at home while staying here and you will too!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,ATTENTION: This place is truly a 5 Star stay! There's nothing that this place didn't offer. The cleanliness was perfect and the accommodations spectacular. I highly recommend Jana as a host.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana was a phenomenal host, and the space is so comfortable and lovely! The house is situated on a gorgeous grassy hill, and we felt so relaxed with nature surrounding us and lots of light coming in through the windows to create a warm glow throughout the home. Jana thought ahead to every detail of our stay, providing snacks, bread, butter, wine, and even her homemade soaps! This is the perfect place to have a calm, cozy getaway. We can’t wait to come back in the summer!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are in need of a place in the Owego area, look no further. The property is absolutely gorgeous. The inside is spacious yet cozy and the bed was very comfortable, which is definitely hit or miss when it comes to Airbnbs. We only stayed for one night so we didn't get to enjoy some of the amenities, like the firepit, but we plan on coming back again in the future!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely place and location! I stayed at Jana's place for a one-night layover and wish I had had more time here. The apartment is super cute and has a nice outdoor seating area --perfect for relaxing and checking out the view. And Jana couldn't have been nicer. I highly recommend this spot for a weekend getaway or longer-term stay.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Jana and George’s place! Jana was great at communicating before and during our stay, and we could really tell how passionate they are about making sure their guests have a great stay. There were so many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment, and we loved doing s’mores by the fire pit at night while looking at the stars. About an hour drive or less to some very beautiful hikes, and coming back to the house after a day in nature was a truly relaxing treat! Thank you!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing place with incredible stars! You can see the Milky Way and take awesome star pictures if you're into. The location was remote and private and just what we were looking for to escape the city.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Outstanding experience. Truly beautiful space and such great hospitality. Will be staying again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jana’s place was a great find. She was very welcoming and communicative. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures truly do not do this lovely place justice - it could not have been a more thoughtfully appointed private oasis. Jana and George, thank you so much for your kind hospitality! The wine and s’mores were a delight in the evenings and we had a wonderful time touring the Finger Lakes (vineyards, kayaking, hiking) during the day. Would love to return and recommend to anyone looking to relax."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jana's place felt like absolute luxury! There were so many touches that helped make the place feel welcoming and special, especially the snacks & drinks we enjoyed by the fire late at night. The recliners and bed are extremely comfortable, making the place feel like a peaceful and calming retreat. The kitchen is also fully stocked for cooking at home, and convenience stories & restaurants are a quick drive away if you need anything. We're definitely hoping to come back! Thank you for such an amazing stay - this is my favorite Airbnb!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place! I enjoyed the firepit and Jana was very kind to have an assortment of snacks. It was an easy drive ~35-45 mins to some great state parks. If I'm back in the area, I would definitely come back. Thanks so much for a lovely vacation spot."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful and absolutely lovely! We had a great time at jana’s place. Loved the small touches here and there and truly felt welcomed . She would respond very quickly to our texts and she had wonderful tips on places to go and see. We had a fantastic time, highly recommended staying here."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana's place is even more beautiful than photos suggest. She is a welcoming host, and there were so many thoughtful touches. If you are in this part of NY, do consider staying here as it's a truly lovely space."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really cannot recommend Jana's place enough. It was the perfect getaway for two in a cozy place that made us feel at home right away. The drive from Finger Lakes to Jana's place is beautiful with windy roads that overlook New York's nature (about 45-75 minutes away from the most famous parks around Finger Lakes!), and her patio has a great view, too. Jana also included so many amazing amenities that made it so simple to use the full kitchen (fully stocked with utensils and yummy snacks and local drinks to try!) and the stylish little bathroom (with shampoo, towels, and homemade soap!). She sent us local recommendations while we were there and was ready to answer any questions we had. I'm already planning my next trip to New York!! Jana, we can't thank you enough!!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Serene location. Cozy apartment. Simply lovely!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oh my goodness! I am a seasoned traveler who also worked in the field of hospitality for over 30 years. This was by fast the best experience I have ever had. If you are looking for a great place to relax and refresh... this could not be more perfect. Top notch.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana's place is the absolutely best AirBnb we've ever visited! From the guests' outdoor patio and the lovely landscaping to the charming, immaculately clean apartment, this is a 5 star place! It's a comfortable, quiet and restful retreat. Jana provides the same welcoming amenities - snacks, breakfast goodies, fruit , coffees - as many full service
B & Bs. I can't say enough good things about Jana, and her lovely place. We hope to return!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana and George were great hosts. I got lost on the way there, and she was late for an appointment so she could come get me and lead me to her gorgeous home on the hilltop.
The space is so homey and folled with personal touches. My daughter loved having s'mores from the firepit in our private garden. I enjoyed birdwatching and the amazing sunrises while sipping my coffee.
One of my best airbnb stays."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home and host are wonderful. Jana was so attentive and quick to respond to our requests. But the extra touches, (like the variety of snacks and specific things that she knew we would like) made us feel like we were right at home. Not to mention, the nicely decorated home with beautiful landscape and gardens... i think she may have ordered the dear and hummingbirds just for us. I look forward to going back Jana... Hugs,"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana's place exceeded our expectations and from the minute we arrived, we felt right at home. The amenities and extra touches that Jana provides are very thoughtful which made our experience that much more enjoyable. We also loved the views, fire pit and privacy of the entire space. It is about a 40 minute drive (beautiful country roads) to the Ithaca area where we did a lot of hiking. Jana is an excellent host and we cannot recommend her place enough!"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The Cozy Country retreat went above and beyond our expectations. My only complaint was that we were not able to take advantage of the firepit and smores! Wish we could have stayed longer. Great hosts and location!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana was so hospitable and welcoming. My boyfriend and I loved the space and all the little extra touches that truly made the experience that much more enjoyable!

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay for a relaxing weekend. Awesome patio area with a fire pit overlooking the country side while eating smores was an added bonus. George and Jana do a great job taking care of their resident friends, I say friends, because that how we felt! We will be going back!!!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane's place was cozy and perfect for a weekend away! She left us a few local craft beers and wine, as well as things for breakfast and snacks for the day. Everything was so carefully thought about and selected. She greeted us with a warm welcome, offered suggestions for us to go do things, and was overall an excellent host! We highly recommend, and already plan on staying here anytime we visit Owego in the future!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana's home is a true retreat from the workaday world. She has filled her home with special touches from welcoming food and wine! to homemade soaps. The space is immaculate and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have had in an airbnb. A cup of tea on the patio with a good book was a wonderful way to start the day and just one of the many options the apartment offers.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful private space, Jana and George make it very comfortable and welcoming! Highly recommended!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful, almost dream like escape that made our entire trip extra special. So thankful to have stayed with Jana who was an exceptional host and makes great soap!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana and George go out of their way to ensure that you have everything that you want and need away from home. The apartment was clean and tidy, the decor was very nice. Shampoo and conditioner were provided, along with some of Jana's home made soaps! There was a fridge full of drinks and necessities, fresh fruit and chocolate, and a keurig coffee maker. It really was like a home away from home."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The accomodation is top notch. Jana & George were very welcoming. Check in was easy, the cozy country retreat has everything you could possibly need on a get away or business trip. Great views from the porch and a very stylish interior and exterior. Looking forward to staying here again! Highly recommended."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a top-notch place to stay! You will be pleasantly surprised!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Jana's for three days. She was there when we arrived and was available for our questions and needs during our stay. Jana is also a very discreet and respectful host. The site is beautiful, the house is located high up, which gives a beautiful view. The interior is absolutely beautiful, charming and tastefully decorated. The bed is comfortable and easy to sleep because no noise. The outdoor terrace is large and offers many possibilities to enjoy the view, hares,deer, gardens and many birds. We particularly enjoyed being able to cook our meals on the barbecue and eat outside away from the rain surrounded by flowers and country decorations. The price is more than reasonable given the many facilities as well as all the attentions. Truly an excellent choice."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Highly recommend for a relaxing get away.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In short, wonderful place to stay. More details:
- Nearly 10 mins from downtown Owego and 40 mins south from downtown Ithaca. So plan your trip accordingly.
- Jana is a great host: she responds quickly to texts, maintains her place very well, and is always ready to help. We had reached around 11:30 PM on the first day and had no issues checking in.
- Place has everything you need: well stocked kitchen, TV, patio to relax, etc.
Thank you Jana. We had a great time in Ithaca area."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cozy country retreat exceeded expectations, a beautifully well-kept country home in hilly Owego. The quiet apartment was full of sweet touches and our host, Jana and her family were the icing on the cake - from genuinely warm greetings, hand-written notes to thoughtful recommendations on where to grab a bite. Perhaps most importantly, the bed was incredibly comfortable - the equivalent of a warm hug. Thank you for having us, I’ve already recommended the cozy country retreat to friends!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing to find soul quietness!! Thumbs up!!!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful retreat hidden in the greenery. Our stay, even though short, was perfect in every way.
A real enchantment.
Ben"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A Fantastic place to stay! Exceeded all of our expectations. Apartment is just as described and pictured. Beautiful..clean..charming... So many extra touches. Beautiful views and privacy. Excellent communication. We stayed on a particularly hot weekend...apartment did not have ac so we asked if we could bring some fans. Earlier in the day I received a message that Jana had installed an air conditioner before we arrived. Such thoughtfulness. Our only regret was That we could not stay longer...we are looking forward to visiting again!!!!!!!!!!!!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful stay. Would absolutely recommend.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly the relaxing spot I was looking for. Jana was very communicative prior to arrival and flexible with our check-in time. The snacks/drinks provided (especially the s’mores!) were a welcome and unexpected addition. I would highly recommend this location to anyone staying in the area.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want to stay in a comfortable, quiet, scenic, country apartment, this one is amazing! The host, Jana, has thought of everything to make your stay a lovely experience. We highly recommend!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jana’s place was very beautiful and it was the perfect spot for a stopover in the Southern Finger Lakes region. We stayed one night and wished we stayed longer because the hospitality from Jana matched with a beautiful home and property, made us feel right at home. Even though she was coming back from a trip herself, she was very quick to respond and able to setup everything in such a way that I couldn’t believe it all came together so perfectly."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Some places have the scenery, others great amenities and hospitality, but the Cozy Country Retreat is the total package - by far the most delightful, serene, and scenic getaway of our traveling experience. Attention to detail and beautiful touches were everywhere: original paintings, stained glass, small vases of yellow daisies, objets d’art on shelves, homemade soap in the bathroom. A lot of love went into creating this inviting place. The spacious kitchen was stocked with baskets of snacks, fixings for s’mores, and wine. The patio overlooking a lush green valley and surrounding hills was also thoughtfully arranged, with a fire pit, plentiful seating, fountain, and rustic yard decor like old wagon wheels that sparkled with fairy lights at night. The bird watching was phenomenal. As beautiful and comfortable as the apartment was, I was continually drawn to the patio. Jana and George were consummate hosts, just the right combination of checking on us for our needs, respecting our privacy, and offering suggestions for sightseeing and a special restaurant for our anniversary."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great accomodations! Everything you could could ever want or need is supplied, from bedding to entertainment to a fully stocked kitchen. Jana was flexible with our schedule as well. We would definitely stay here again. Lovely place, lovely views!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana's place was the best Airbnb we have ever visited. This was an above and beyond experience for us! Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by Jana and shown around. This cozy country retreat was exactly as described, but even more beautiful and peaceful in person. Jana provided a big basket of yummy snacks and left us stocked with a variety of drinks, including beer, in the fridge. She was very thoughtful with every amenity she provided. We will definitely be back to visit again, hopefully soon!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jana is an amazing host. Her countryside place is perfect for escaping Manhattan. Views of rolling hills and farmlands, even equipped with a fire pit! I really appreciated Jana's thoughtful touches. She even left snacks! Her and and her husband were very sweet and I definitely would consider coming back again. Thank you!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are considering visiting the Finger Lakes area look no further than Jana’s “Cozy Country Retreat”
Jana is an outstanding host for whom nothing is too much, her warm welcome made us feel so comfortable and along with her husband George, they were so attentive to any of our needs or questions.
The property is furnished to the highest standard, a most comfortable bed, a great TV, two leather recliners, all the kitchen equipment you will need whether cooking in or just having breakfast.
The outside area is well equipped including access to homegrown tomatoes on the vine!! There is a fire pit with wood provided and very comfy chairs and loungers for outdoor eating and drinking.
The township of Owego is only 10minutes drive away where you will find a fine grocery store ( Price Chopper) and loads of restaurants. If you play golf make sure you go to En-Joie golf course in Endicott about 30 minutes drive.
Jana’s property cannot be over praised, it does not get any better than this, a true 5 star AirBnB.
Book this property you will not be disappointed."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jana's place is beautiful and secluded, exactly what we are looking for as a weekend escape from NYC. The view from the patio is spectacular especially at night, when you can build a fire, make some s'mores and stargaze to your heart's content. The 1-br has a separate entrance from the main house and a private kitchen and bathroom. The bed is also very comfortable. There is tons of privacy but Jana also made sure to check in to know we have everything we need. She and her husband are such thoughtful hosts! The kitchen is stocked with snacks/ breakfast/ wine/ drinks for guests to enjoy. Jana even offered us her home grown tomatoes! Thank you so much and we will definitely be back!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jana and her family were super host for sure. They were great with communication and accommodations and all. The place was beautiful inside and out. It was quite amazing to see a different part of New York since we are readjusting to the city life. It felt so homey and relaxing. We absolutely loved it and would recommend this stay to everyone! We cant wait to go back again.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Driving up Jana and George's driveway, you will immediately be in awe of their beautiful home, and upon turning around, you are greeted by a great view. This view can be enjoyed from the patio (with the added perk of a fire pit). Regardless of what you have planned during your trip, ensure you set aside time for a breakfast on the patio, and an evening of smores on the firepit...even if this means extending your stay for a day!
Jana and George truly go above and beyond to ensure their guests are comfortable and all needs are met. The welcome basket and cold beverages were greatly appreciated after a long drive and allowed us to unwind on the patio for a bit, rather than immediately heading to the grocery store.
Their place is cozy and homey, but modern and with some luxuries. Perfect combination to feel like you're at a home away from home while also feeling pampered!
Lastly, not only are Jana and George great hosts, but they are also great people. Conversation is easy, they are very thoughtful and considerate, and you can't help but feel like you're chatting with a family friend. They even sent us off with some fresh goodies from the garden!
If you are looking to stay near Owego, this is THE place to stay....highly recommended!"
2017-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place with excellent view, gracious host, and many extras. Easy access to Owego and Tioga Center. Great place to return to after busy days."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a constant AirBnb user & I have stayed in many beautiful places but I must say that the absolute best. Aside from it's cozy & welcoming feel, it has a such a positive energy to it. A great atmosphere in which I was able to actually here myself think. My fiancé & I were here to get away from the noisy, busy, & crowded city like & that's exactly what we were able to do. We woke up to a beautiful view; full of greenery, clear blue skies, & the sound of the birds singing their daily tune. Jana was a magnificent host. She was always available upon request & tended our every need or concern. She made accommodations for us & made us feel totally comfortable. The house was in immaculate condition & she had provided snacks for us to enjoy including ingredients to make smores by the fire right outside! If Jana would have us again, we definitely want to come back!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jana's home is perfect if you need a quick getaway. She's put a lot of thought in making her guests feel at home. She provided snacks, drinks, and even s'mores to make on their fire pit while you can watch the stars at night! She made sure we had everything we needed upon our arrival and her husband, George even set up the BBQ grill and fire pit for us. You will truly enjoy the space she has created!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you get a chance to stay at the Cozy Cottage, snap it up! The setting on the top of a gentle hill provides a lovely view from the private patio complete with a fire pit. Morning coffee on the patio was accompanied by birds singing and a hummingbird. The apartment has a roomy open concept living room/ kitchen. The kitchen is fully equipped in case you want do some cooking. The queen size bed is comfortable but a little high if you are especially short. There is a well appointed bathroom with a shower and granite topped vanity. Everything is very comfortable and lovingly decorated.
The Cozy Cottage is located 10-15 minutes from Owego where you can find both fast food and nice restaurants, drug stores, etc. Ithaca, located on Cayuga Lake and the home of Cornell University, is within easy driving distance.
The host, Jana, and her family, including the family pets, were vey friendly and welcoming. They all are dedicated to making sure guests have a wonderful experience. I fully intend to go back."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is immaculate and tastefully furnished with a private entry leading out to a large patio area with views overlooking the rolling hills. We were there in the spring and the views were spectacular. Hopefully we can make it back this fall when the leaves are in full color. This is a great, quiet space away from city noise and light but it is well situated, close to Owego and a short drive to Ithica. Jana and her family went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. Jana provided recommendations, snacks and beverages, and even some firewood for the fire pit out front. She thought of every detail and checked in to make sure we were comfortable on several occasions. We loved getting to know Jana and her husband and look forward to our next stay."

We had a great time even fished the pond. We would definitely book again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a beautiful and clean space! We stayed here for a wedding we attended nearby and this totally beat staying in a hotel room. With it being rainy and cold the heat was turned on for us when we got there which made it SO cozy! We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cabin with some great views. Exactly what I was looking for!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this stay! We were in town for an event in Sayre & wanted a place to stay that was a bit removed from the hustle & bustle. This was perfect! The views were nothing short of stunning. Waking up here was completely unreal. My only regret is that I wish I spent an additional night here to further enjoy the space & have a fire. We will be back!

It was cozy and comfortable and having a full size fridge was very helpful. A/C was useful too. YAY.

We were not disappointed in the least with this stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laurie was really helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we have a good experience. The location was perfect. I’ve never seen a clean airbnb like this. Overall, one of the best experiences I had in here."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with spectacular views. The cabin does lack a few amenities that might make the stay more comfortable, but it does have all your basic needs covered. Before you pack to head out here, make sure you review what the cabin does and does not have so that you're sure to bring what you need along with you."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Was working in the area for a month. You just can’t beat the view at the end of the day.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay at Cabin in the Clouds! The cabin has all the essentials. We brought a small propane camp stove which we found to be incredibly helpful to cook outside. A sharp knife and a couple of cooking utensils were of help to bring as well.
The double bed was extremely comfortable. And we were more than cozy with the space heaters. The complimentary firewood was a lovely addition. We found ourselves outside around the fire most nights. In the mornings and afternoons we got to watch the bluebirds
Even though the cabin is closer to the road, we rarely saw cars or people. It was a very private stay. We had pretty okay cell phone reception -- definitely enough to send and receive messages and make calls in case of emergency, even enough to stream some music.
For fun we traveled about an hour to hike Rickett's Glen, which was well worth the drive. Tons of amazing waterfalls. But go on the early side, as it gets crowded fast. If you're looking for the most simple perfect stay, this is it. We couldn't be happier with our experience!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute space and amazing view! Shot a student film here and it was perfect. Laurie responded quickly and was an amazing host.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Breathtaking views! I love open fields and dirt roads and this is exactly what this little cabin in the clouds offered. We saw a deer run across the field, my husband caught a bass in the nearby pond, and watching the sunset from the little porch is exactly what we needed on our little getaway. So quiet and peaceful...great for the soul."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh, what a wonderful stay! The cabin is charming and immaculately kept, the area is beautiful, and Laurieann is a gracious, kind host. She communicated very well with us, and even stopped by one evening to say hello and share information regarding a few local stops of interest.
The area is lovely as well -- so peaceful and relaxing. Perfect way to unwind and get away. Our favorite part of each evening was sitting out by the campfire, enjoying the sounds of nature and the company of each other. We truly enjoyed every moment of our stay, and we've already discussed returning for another long weekend."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing weekend getaway! We caught some fish in the pond, which was great! The setting was perfectly in the middle of nowhere, yet had great cell reception. It was a very relaxing and peaceful weekend."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin was wonderful. There's a great firepit and the host left some logs for us. It was the perfect qhiet retreat we were looking for.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description says it as it is. The view to the south is fantastic. This is a great little getaway spot. The hosts are very helpful and friendly.
While located away from the hustle and bustle, plenty of local flavors can be found north or south about 20 min drive through beautiful countryside. Was a perfect spot for our motorcycle adventures with miles of scenic curvy roads to adventure on in nearly any direction. We will definitely be back when out this direction."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd time staying here and we really enjoyed our time fishing and relaxing by the fire. The house is a rustic hunting cabin, so definitely not for those expecting something new and modern, but it was perfect for us! We will be back again next year!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is on a beautiful piece of land with great places to hike with dogs.
The cabin itself is rustic and not updated so you would not stay there for the amenities, but it is a great location and has lots of space for a group of hunters, fishermen, etc.
The hosts were incredibly friendly and met us at a nearby gas station to lead us to the cabin so that we would not get lost."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful relaxing stay at a beautiful piece of property in the woods. Quiet and serene, exactly what we needed. Very responsive and friendly hosts, very accommodating the cabin had everything we needed. Would definitely come back again with another couple to enjoy a weekend in nature and to share the beauty of this place."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay! Can’t say enough good things about the property and hosts. AAA+
Thank you for sharing your retreat with us!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place if you are looking for silence in a very secluded area. The pond was great for a little fishing, super quiet location. Dogs loved running around on the open field. Be sure to bring bug spray if you sit outside! The recreation room was a nice addition!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice and remote hunting cabin. Host was kind and helpful. Great views, walking, and fishing at the ponds on the property. Kids had a blast catching sunfish."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family and especially our German Shepard had a wonderful time in such a pastoral and serene setting. Good fishing in the ponds, caught a handful of bass pushing 2 pounds and lots of bluegills and smaller bass. Gulp minnows on a float and a weedless frog imitation were the hot baits. Spotted numerous wild turkey and deer and many other types of wildlife. Would highly recommend, especially for those with canine friends."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to spend time with friends and family. I booked this place to celebrate my birthday with friends. The place is private and has easy access to nearby sightseeing. The nearest Walmart is 15 mins away, don't worry if you forgot any stuff the Walmart has everything. Finger Lake is around 40-50 mins from this place."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quite, peaceful , nice wildlife, good fishing ponds"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful place to stay"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hello Sean,

Best wishes
Jimmy Puthumana & family"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great cabin for families - it is comfortable and in a beautiful location. The game room would probably be great for larger groups. Wr brought our dogs and they loved looking at all the deer and turkeys through the big window!

They loved all the space to run around and was great to just have a fire and relax. We hope to come back again soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were so pleased with our stay, everything exceeded our expectations exponentially. Jan and Alan were very friendly and wonderful with our children upon arrival, making us feel very much welcome and at home. Accommodations were absolutely fantastic, and the views were stunning as well. Out of all of our stays with Airbnb, this is by far the best place we have stayed. Although we were there for a wedding, it was almost hard to leave the house. We very much look forward to booking with you in the future, in hopes that you’ll have us again. Thank you"

We’re from an overpopulated city in Jersey, so coming up here to the peace and quiet and stunning views that this place offered was perfect. We needed this. Pictures don’t do it justice. I’m a photographer so I found a lot of photo opportunities here that I didn’t expect to see. We loved barbecuing here, doing a bonfire at night and playing games in the rec room. We loved this cabin. The hosts were hospitable, gave us a lot of suggestions to do in the area and showed us the amenities. Thank you for your kindness, Allen and Jan. We’ll be back soon!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place for a quiet getaway. Private land to walk, fish, or just sit and enjoy a fire. The boys set up a tent in the yard, while the adults enjoyed not having to sleep outside. The only thing I would do differently is bring my own pillow."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin with a million dollar view. The cabin had everything we needed.
There were plenty of towels, blankets, and linens. The area was very peaceful and remote.

Sean was quick to respond and helped us get to the cabin as we were arriving in the evening. The views from the cabin are unbelievable and the sunrises are some of the magical I’ve ever seen. It’s worth it to wake up for the sunrise or to stay up for it!
We hope to visit again soon, I’m sure it’s gorgeous in all seasons."

The property was great with all the wildlife and land to explore. We walked the trails, fished, sat by the fire and even took 2 day trips to the finger lakes area. Our pup loved being able to roam the property. I highly recommend a stay here....You won't regret it. My husband is already trying to find another long weekend to return."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking to get away from it all, this is a wonderful, peaceful and relaxing spot! We enjoyed sitting outside under the shady trees having coffee or a meal and the fire pit was a wonderful way to spend the evening with a sky full of stars overhead. There are a few good restaurants a short drive away in Sayre if you don’t want to cook in the cabin or grill on the deck. It’s also an easy drive to the PA Grand Canyon, Watkins Glen or other popular outdoor destinations."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway, wonderful secluded location yet not too far from town if you need something. Kind hosts, easy check in and out. Really beautiful views, we enjoyed the fire pit and just being in nature. Well supplied cabin, everything you need. Highly recommend."

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"I dont think anything can beat a summer evening with meals outside overlooking this beautiful property landscape. We had a great time with clear skies, watching stars and lightning bugs we couldn’t count. So if you wanna a quiet city scape in a true secluded cabin, this is the place to go. The cabin is cozy and kitchen was equipped with all we needed to cook our own meals there. Sean was quick to reply and also gave us great local tips. We checked vineyards on the east side of seneca lake too. We’ll be back and wish we had a longer stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most peaceful tranquil and relaxing vacation. Amazing views, deer, turkey, hummingbirds and fishing for entertainment. We didn’t want to leave."

We enjoyed going for walks and at night we went spotlighting and seen many deer. We also made s’mores over the campfire. Thank you!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful. Peaceful. Relaxing. Secluded, but not too far from civilization. Beautiful views. Cozy and comfotable. We wished we could have stayed even longer. Definately would (and hope to) go back in the future.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away. Deer all over the place. Hit and miss cell service but did not care about that. Sean was an excellent host and always responded immediately.
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful, peaceful location to stay surrounded by nature."
2019-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great but could be reached more easily with better sign. It is a hunting lodge, but a few touches could improve comfort. However, Sean and is brother-in-law Allan were very helpful and the stay, although brief, was pleasant."

This is the perfect place to get away and enjoy nature."

2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sean and his family are very accommadating, they personally bring you to the camp so you do not go the wrong way. the view and the scenery are breath taking.

The lodging is comfy and cozy fit our family perfectly! if your an outdoorsy person I totally recommend this camp!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, rustic, unplugged!
We enjoyed the beautiful views and active wildlife.

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have had a. Etter stay. The cabin was on a very private lot. Occasionsl traffic came through but that was MAYBE like 3 card the entire weekend which wasn't even bad. It's the perfect blend of being somewhat close to society if you need to get something but still secluded for the perfect mix. The property I'd gorgeous, pictures didn't do this justice and they provided just about everything we could have needed except for food. (They had water, towels, soap, seasonings for food, a grill, everything!) We're strongly considering booking again and I'd recommend it easily!"
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was nicely appointed with kitchen needs (things like pots and pans) and the grounds were kept nicely. It was a little tight for 5 guys since there were only three rooms with beds, but we managed by sleeping on couches and the floor. Overall it was a great place to stay and we'd recommend it to anyone looking to get away back in the woods."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super helpful and responsive owners- the area is beautiful. Cute little cabin - nice bathroom- TV- sitting area. The views are fantastic. Thank you!!

2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I discovered this hidden gem and loved the tranquil surroundings. The cabin is cozy and well supplied by the hosts. The views are stunning and the fall colors were showing their glory. Lots to do in the area and see. A beautiful and out of the way location. The perfect weekend.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 5 yr old daughter and I found Sean's cabin while attending a dog show nearby in Apalachin. And I wish I could give more than 5 stars for the location along with other things!! The views were STUNNING... it was hard to take my eyes off the sweeping landscape, regardless of time of day! The cabin has ample and comfortable space for a family. And everything is there that you could possibly need (and the owners provide water which is such a nice and unexpected added touch!). The bathroom appears to have been renovated recently and was updated and clean. The space was just what we needed for a weekend of dog show activities during the day, and cooking out, roasting marshmallows and reading books at night. The hosts were very kind and the entire process was effortless. As the other guests mentioned, Sean met us nearby to show us the best way to the house and made sure we had everything we needed."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay. We loved how far away we felt without being too far from stores or restaurants. It's a beautiful piece of property.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jean is an excellent host. Great place to stay. Highly recommended. Will be back again!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sean's place is breathtaking, beautiful views, away from any noise. Birds sing their beautiful songs. House is located on the hill, with amazing views. Easy to get to, close enough to all finger lake wineries and national parks. Place very clean and packed with everything you need. Perfect stay."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sean s cabin is located with some of the finest views one can get!! It is as beautiful as one can see in postcards. Sean and his family were waiting for us near the freeway exit to guide us to the cabin. Cabin is as shown in the photos. Cabin has a fully equipped kitchen. Rooms are not very big, but are comfortable for the stay as shown in the listing. Sean and Alan helped us till we settled down. we had only two issues during our stay - smell with hot water inside the kitchen and dampness odor inside the house. Another important note is to be careful at the corners of the cabin corners. It is a family friendly place and has all the facility away from all the hustle and bustle of city life. Thanks Sean and Alan for being the wonderful host and your place is just too good."
2017-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sean was an excellent host- he knew we would have trouble relying strictly upon GPS and advised us to meet him and follow him up to the cabin. He also provided us with loads of information about nearby state parks with hiking, breweries, vineyards, and restaurants. The cabin was cozy and perfect for my group. The beds were a little older and squeaky, but we were so tired by the end of the day that it didn't stop any of us from sleeping well. The fridge was stocked with bottled water just in case we didn't want to drink the well water and we had full access to an outdoor grill and patio and even a chimnea. All in all, this rustic cabin holds a solid place between camping and staying at a hotel."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer was always quick to reply and kind. The house is larger than we needed but a much more comfortable arrangement than 2-queen hotel room with 2 adults and a kid. Felt really clean, safe, and cozy with very high ceilings, pretty chandeliers, nice linens and condiments in the fridge. Having a health practice and bakery right next door made it feel ""downtown"" in a charming part of Waverly."

Otherwise my family enjoyed our stay here for the home vibes."

Each room had an A/C unit, the kitchen had a good collection of utensils and appliances, the beds were comfortable and the closets offered extra pillows, blankets and towels. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

The apt was spacious with 3 bedrooms and 1 1/2 bath. It had a full kitchen equipped with whatever you’d need. It was the thoughtful touches that Jennifer did that was nice such as the organic eggs from her flock, and our fav creamer for our coffee. My kids made themselves right at home. For your convenience, there is a gas station literally right behind the apt and a Dandy Mini mart in case you’d need groceries etc. Also we went to Watkins Glen Falls which is 45 minutes from this apt."
