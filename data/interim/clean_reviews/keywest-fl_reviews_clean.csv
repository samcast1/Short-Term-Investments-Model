2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is amazing. From the start the process was amazing. The instructions for getting into the condo were easy to follow. Words cannot describe the beauty of this location. Private yet close to plenty of restaurants, bars, stores, coffee shops. The inside is decorated beautifully and was spotless. You have access to several pools at two different resorts. If you are looking for a great place in Key West to stay this is the best."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the absolute best place to stay! Have never had a better Airbnb! Everything you read in the description and other reviews is exactly what you get. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful water views! Private sandy beach in backyard. Great balconies. Loved having hotel pool next door as an additional benefit.
Shower is not for the tall, approximately 6-foot high shower head. If watching TV is a must, caution as TVs are very small."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The location is beautiful, and the condo is spotless! We can't wait to return someday!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We love hidden Beach!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is truly heaven! There is so much character to the place and the location can‚Äôt be beat. The decks are amazing and we love the rooftop space to take in the sunrises and sunsets!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Looking for the best place to stay a couple of days in Key West? Then come to Hidden Beach. We loved our duplex with all the great amenities directly next to the ocean for spectacular views and sunsets. Just relax on property or simply walk to enjoy the nightlife a couple of streets away. ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¥
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Hidden Beach is a gem! Fabulous, super clean, and well-appointed retreat in an outstanding beach front location close to everything with highly attentive hosts! Would definitely return!üèùÔ∏è"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the quintessential as advertised Airbnb! We absolutely loved the location and the space was absolutely perfect for my wife and I! Loved being able to utilize the pool and beach at The Reach Resort right next door!
I unit was clean and had everything we needed; very communicative and helpful!
Will definitely recommend this spot to anyone coming into Key West!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful condo in great location. Nice to have the balance between the peace and scenic beach views at the condo, with the convenience of the hotel pool next door and the nearby activities in Key West. Condo was well stocked and clean. 2 story layout in dark wood with the outdoor balconies provides for a Caribbean vibe. There is also a rooftop deck.
David and Lisa responded quickly prior to and during the stay and provided excellent recommendations.
We rented a car and parking at the dedicated spaces was ideal - that said, we ended up using the rental bikes much more than the car -
There is convenient bike stand at the condo.
There was some sargasso seaweed on the beach by the property when we were there - David provided a heads up before we departed. Authorities clear up most of it on daily basis and we weren‚Äôt bothered by it.
Overall location is great. Right next door to Louie‚Äôs backyard (great for lunch and dinner). Easy walk or cycle to old town.
We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had the most relaxing and incredible time at Hidden Beach. A private getaway in a truly special location, right on the beach with access to Casa Marina and the Reach facilities. Easy walk to Duval Street and all the sights but far enough away to feel secluded. We loved dining at Louie‚Äôs next door, fabulous food and bar. I would not hesitate to book this special place. A couple of things to keep in mind, the resorts can be quite loud over the weekends and large amounts seaweed was a shame over our time there which meant swimming and using the beach because of the smell was challenging. We will definitely return to this paradise."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a week over the holidays and loved every minute of it. Seeing and hearing the ocean from bed was a particular highlight. We loved the ambiance of the place and especially appreciated the local artwork throughout. Highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre searching for an idyllic spot on the beaches of Key West with easy access to nightlife, entertainment, interesting tours, and great food, look no further.
This location is absolutely gorgeous, utterly clean and pristine, and the hosts are kind, responsive, and wonderful.
Cannot recommend this listing enough. I fully plan to return. Best ever experience for my first time in Key West."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This stay is absolutely wonderful! It was all I had hoped and more. I had read all the reviews prior, and they are all true. This is such a great spot. I felt very safe here. You can hear the waves, it is clean, private, the communication is wonderful, BOOK IT!!!! You will not regret it one bit. I found the pillows and bed very comfortable. The decor was welcoming and the perfect for Key West. We rented bicycles and toured around the island, but you can walk anywhere from here as well."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. By far one of the best places I have booked. Came down for a 5 day break and loved all of the views!!! 3 separate decks to view the Atlantic and the night sky!! The place was spotless and Lisa made everything very easy to check in and check out. No crazy cleaning requirements on our end as we were leaving at 6am. There are plenty of supplies in the kitchen and bathrooms, bed was nice, and access to Duval street and the southern most point is all walkable. We even walked to Mallory Square twice and did the Hemingway tour, little white house tour, and butterfly tour all within walking distance. Not to mention all of the restaurants along the way. If you want to do the trolley tour, also easy access. The Reach Resort and Casa Marina access was also super convient!
Love having a pool day!! The parking was also easy if you require that! I cannot recommend this place enough. I already am missing all the balcony views!! All of the luxuries were greatly enjoyed, but the ease to talk to Lisa throughout your stay is also greatly appreciated!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is amazing! Access to the reach next doors pool and ocean is worth a stay here. Loved the outdoor patios and stunning views.
The place itself is cozy but needs to be updated with a king bed and comfortable pillows. Me and my husband are petite people and found the bed so uncomfortable and the pillows left my neck sore our entire stay.
Overall a lovely stay with brilliant views and close to wonderful amenities."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time stay at the Hidden Beach, this time we had the chance to take full advantage of the resort rights at the ‚ÄòReach‚Äô a Hilton Property; for me this pushed it over the TOP! Bravo!! Immaculate property, incredible amenities on a secluded portion of Key West, walking distance to some local attractions and close enough to the ‚Äúcraziness and wild side of Duval‚Äù.
Hidden Beach has never disappointed for us, it won‚Äôt for you either!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and very stylish. The views were breathtaking and surreal. Waking up to the sound of the ocean is something I hope everyone gets to experience. The hosts responded almost immediately if and when we needed something. Looking forward to being able to plan another trip back in the future.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, well appointed, spacious and convenient."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10 year anniversary. We absolutely loved it! The photos and description were accurate. The views from each deck exceeded expectations! The location was perfect! And the access to The Reach beach and pool was EVERYTHING. We enjoyed walking to Ana‚Äôs caf√© each morning for Cuban coffee before we got our day started. We walked and used Uber throughout our stay, but the parking access was right outside if you need it. I highly recommend staying at Hidden Beach. We will definitely be back again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay here! The view is even better in person than in the pictures, the host is responsive and helpful, there are two private decks that come with this unit, and there is an additional shared rooftop space. It's a relaxing getaway with lovely touches (the towels are so fluffy!) and I highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, lovely home right near the beach. Ability to use the nearby private beach was the best.
Would definitely recommend."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden beach is truly heaven on Earth! You will be pinching yourself on a daily basis that you are lucky enough to call this place ‚Äúhome‚Äù for a bit! The views from both floors are spectacular and the crows nest is perfect for watching sunrises, sunsets, and even stargazing! The living space is beautiful and super clean. Lastly the hosts are fabulous!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Hidden Beach is the most amazing place, absolutely perfect for our stay in Key West. The views from the balconies were spectacular, with front-row seats to gorgeous sunrises and pelican diving shows. The location was perfect, walking/biking distance to everything you want to do in Old Town, yet removed from the madness. You can go wherever you want to go on the island then retire to your own peace and quiet. I‚Äôd recommend HB wholeheartedly and will definitely look to stay there again next time we visit Key West."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with my wife for our first trip to Key West and it really made the whole trip. Clean, plenty of space, amazing views, right on the water, sandy beaches, close to Duval street ‚Ä¶ would highly recommend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Much better than the pics show. You really feel at home. Close to everything yet far enough from all the chaos. Right next to Southernmost spot. Comfortable and relaxing.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our 20th anniversary. It was everything that you could imagine & then some. The unit was spotless, communication was great & the location was perfect. Everything that you would need was there, from toilet paper, hand soap, laundry detergent to K-cups & hot tea! Thank you kindly for sharing your beautiful home!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is stunning! It‚Äôs absolutely the best place in Key West! My husband & I stayed here for our honeymoon and it was outstanding! The views are beautiful! And it‚Äôs a close walk to all the excitement on Duval! We will be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Beach is a true gem!! We can‚Äôt imagine a better home or location on the island! The style was very ‚ÄúHemingway‚Äú, the home was clean and had everything we needed! The true star of the property is the view‚Ä¶ or should I say views! The beautiful ocean view is on full display from both floors. The bonus is the rooftop deck! We went up every morning to watch the sunrise! Wow is all I can say! Last, but not least is the amazing manager Lisa. She answered every question and gave great suggestions! Loved the Lazy Dog recommendation for the mangrove kayak tour! Also if you do stay here, do yourself a favor and book a dinner next door at Louie‚Äôs Backyard! We can only hope to be back to Hidden Beach soon!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful unit! The unit is loaded with charm, well-equipped and very spacious. Communication with Lisa was outstanding and she was kind enough to send us a charger we left behind. The views, beach and outdoor amenities were great and the location was ideal. Louie‚Äôs Backyard is right next door and our favorite restaurant on the island. - everything else is just a short walk away. The only potential downside is the small shower, which could be a challenge for taller guests, but there is a large tub if needed. Highly recommend David‚Äôs unit and great support team!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible stay! Hidden Beach is absolutely beautiful and I do agree that it is the most beautiful place in Key West. I stayed in Unit #4 and loved it. Having access to multiple porches and the crow's nest to watch sunsets was a major bonus. Listening to the ocean waves at night is so comforting. I have an autoimmune condition and always worried about staying comfortable. This place was so comfortable and I slept so well that it felt just like home! Having access to two resorts was great too - love the pools on a hot day! Lisa was such a responsive, welcoming, and kind host. She also gave me some great recommendations. I corresponded with David during my booking and he was very responsive and friendly too. 10/10! Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay on Key West! Hidden Beach blew away our expectations. The Host were incredible and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view! Very clean accommodations & very communicative. Follow their recommendations as they are superb. The hotel next door allows you to use a beach/ pool pass, or you‚Äôll be able to hang right in the back in the enclosed beach on the property itself."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit is spacious (2 floors) and the view was gorgeous. Access to the resort beach next door really made this a unique place to stay in Key West. Check in instructions were clear and easy. The unit was clean and had everything you need. It is about 3 blocks to Duval street and 1 mile to Mallory square. It is quiet and private.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Book this place! It is AMAZING! Stunning location. Great communication. Private but still close to everything. Lisa and Kat are WONDERFUL! We were here for a week, did not want to leave. We rented #4 and our relatives rented #2. Will absolutely be back! üíú"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was perfect for our 7 day honeymoon in Key West! Quiet and tucked away with a beautiful ocean view, but also a short walking distance away from all of the action. We also really enjoyed access to the pool!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Its rare to find a place that actually lives up to its rave reviews, Hidden beach does. The views and quietness are so relaxing we almost didn't want to leave. The wild side of key west was only a short walk away. I don't believe any place is a 10, but this place is 9.9999."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wife and I had an amazing stay in #4!!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Hidden Beach is such a rare and beautiful gem. My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it was nothing short of perfect, accompanied by beautiful views of the ocean. We were within walking distance to everything on Key West to include excursions, food, and historical attractions. I definitely recommend David and Lisa as they are wonderful hosts with an amazing property!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The perfect place for rest and relaxation. Beautiful views, the sound of the waves, well curated amenities, make for an absolutely lovely stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in this ideal spot over Thanksgiving. The location is perfect, with a nice beach right outside your doorstep and some of Key West's best attractions steps away. We also loved having the bar at Louie's Backyard next door. The place itself is very well-equipped (we were able to make a full Thanksgiving meal) and spacious ‚Äî and we loved the decor and art. The best part though are the two porches looking out onto the ocean. We'd love to stay again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,An astounding property. Right on the beach. They even have their own little private beach. The ocean view and the apartment are beautiful.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely beautiful and clean place with magnificent views located in perhaps the best (yet also quiet) location in Key West. The details, furnishings, appliances etc were perfect. I have used ARB&B many times and this is by far the best. If you are thinking about going to Key West, I would strongly recommend you stay here!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely incredible place to stay in Key West. Staying at David and Lisa‚Äôs property ‚ÄúHidden Beach‚Äù made our honeymoon simply unforgettable! We will most certainly be back.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed in Unit #4 at Hidden Beach for a 6 day get away in October. Everything about his unit is spectacular: the views; the multiple decks; the comfort of furniture; the access to The Reach and Casa Marina and the proximity to the hustle and bustle of Duval Street. Dining and shopping are an easy walk or Uber Drive and there is a nearby grocer as well. We did some cooking in the unit and found everything we needed. This is an absolutely perfect location in a relatively quiet area but with excellent access to all that Key West has to offer. And did I mention the view? Absolutely unbeatable! David and Lisa were excellent hosts - available quickly when we reached out and very accommodating. Thanks for a great stay and we will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay with beach, kayak and jet-ski access. It is also an easy walk to Duval St.
The condo was very nice, roomy and clean. We enjoyed daily access to The Reach's beach, pool and bar. The view from our bedroom window of the moon at night and the water during the day was awesome."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Once you stay here, no other place in Key West will do. The incredible views, the access to the private beach, the location, the wonderful staff, this place has it all. We spent our honeymoon here and it‚Äôll be a week we‚Äôll never forget."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely stunning views. Would definitely come back again. Great walking access to restaurants.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Beach is an oasis. This was where we started our honeymoon in the keys, and I can not imagine a better place for it! Truly the best stay we've had, and we've stayed some very nice places. We were in unit 4, an upstairs unit with three levels of decks, including the rooftop crows nest. The place was clean and the furnishings were beautiful. The grounds were lovely as well and we enjoyed watching the sunset from the boardwalk. Could not have asked for more. Kitchen was fully stocked with a full sized fridge, copious coffee, oven, range, etc. Lisa who met us for check in was so kind and friendly and gave us the lay of the land. Thank you so much!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Beach is a hidden gem in Key West. We looked at other AirBnBs and hotels but nothing came close to the relaxing atmosphere of this location. The pictures are accurate and you're located right on the water near the end of Duvall street. This is the quiet end which is what we wanted. There was a parking space provided which was great for our rental car and made it really easy to pop in and out as we visited the keys. There is a washer/dryer in the unit which is helpful when you're staying for a week and want to keep luggage to a carry on bag. The kitchen had all the gear we needed to make meals and watch the water from the porches. WiFi and Cable were nice if you wanted to stay connected or just turn everything off and enjoy the view from the deck as a storm rolls by on the water. Our host, Lisa, kept in touch via text to make sure we had everything we needed and we appreciated someone close by in case we needed anything."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We stayed at Hidden Beach for 8 days. Sat on the deck looking at the ocean drinking coffee Every morning! This place is awesome!! When we go back to Key West we Will stay Here or we won't go. It's Quiet but Mins. away from Duval or anything else Key West has to offer. The hosts are prompt and thoughtful. First Airbnb experience was a trip to remember Thanks to The hosts and the beautiful Hidden Beach!!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I honeymooned here. These were great hosts, gave advice on things to see, beautiful views. Truly the best location for your buck. Right around the corner from the southernmost point. We stayed in the unit where we had the 2nd and 3rd floors.
Having access to the Waldorf resorts was a lot of fun too. Awesome pool with wait staff. Great experience."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can‚Äôt put into words how amazing this unit is. Location is just far enough from the hustle of Duval St but close enough to walk to everything. Inside your find everything you need to feel right at home, relax in the AM drinking coffee on any one of the 3 decks with water view. You‚Äôll have access to the Reach resorts beach/pool with chairs provide. Walk to all the night life Duval St has to offer. Then night caps back on the deck. David and Lisa are wonderful hosts!! Thanks for an amazing trip!!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We took a 10 minute Uber ride from airport and were greeted by Lisa whom let us in and showed us around. Excellent views of the water from any of the 3 decks! Very clean and cozy spot thats close to food and shopping, but quiet since its off the main Duval strip just far enough. If your hungry or looking for a drink Louie‚Äôs Backyard is a 30 second walk. We would highly recommend Hidden Beach."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect location. Perfect! Close enough to the fun Key West yet in the heart of the calm Key West. I would stay here again and again and again. 2nd floor units are awesome. Great view. Go for those if you can. Sat on the porch most of the time. The hotel next door was a bonus. Decor is dynamite. Great communication throughout.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect...it's the quiet side of Duval but still close enough to walk to everything. Having guest access to the resorts next door was an extra bonus. The house was spacious enough yet still cozy. We appreciated the antique pieces throughout the unit. Best part was the 3rd floor balcony at night feeling the ocean breeze. We hope to stay again.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,üëç
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words won't really do this place justice but, what the hell, worth a shot. The duplex is simply amazing. Anyone looking for an escape from the real world will find whatever it is they are looking for at Hidden Beach. Location, views, comfort...the list goes on and on about its beauty and convenience. Take advantage of the resort access! Louie's Backyard >>>> Duval. Book here if you can, you 110% would not regret it. I will certainly be returning here on any and all future Key West visits. Hidden Beach isn't just setting the bar, it IS the bar. Cheers!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can‚Äôt beat the location and style of this place. We couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased with our stay! Thank you!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Key West. It was perfect!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect vacation at the perfect location.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I literally don't think there's a better place to stay in Key West. The location is absolutely perfect and the condo is extremely comfortable and well done. Thanks!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely space. We had a really relaxing time. Really nice touches.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Beach Duplex had everything we could have wanted and more. David and Lisa were a great resource and quick to respond when we had a question. Great location, 3 blocks to the Duval Loop stop #11. (which is a free bus), and easy walk to Duval and Whitehead shops and restaurants. It is at the quiet end of town which was great when we wanted to relax. It was so nice to have a full refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, washer and dryer. We are missing our breakfast and evening drinks on the deck overlooking the ocean! It was terrific to have access to the neighboring resorts. That gave us access to their beach, pool and other amenities. We would definitely stay here again!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!!!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place made our first trip to Key West such a special one! It was beautiful, private, quiet, and wonderfully located next to a world class restaurant! David provides a list of recommended restaurants which we believe helped us to avoid the tourist traps - we like to eat where the locals eat! If you are extra tall like my husband, you have to watch your head at the outside door and duck a little in the shower, but you are probably used to that when traveling. :-) There was so much more to do in Key West than we expected so we will definitely have to make a return trip. We are also considering inviting our adult children along for the next visit to David's - they will enjoy the lookout deck from the top of the house."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If David‚Äôs place is available, BOOK IT.
When I was considering reserving this place, I was struck by how many testimonials raved about it. I have to say they were all right.
David was a true honor and pleasure to work with. He was extremely responsive to messages and very conscientious and caring.
I‚Äôm an extensive traveler and this place has been one of the most beautiful locations I‚Äôve ever stayed in. It is comfortable, it is clean, it‚Äôs on a natural beach, the landscaping is lush and private, the amenities abound. It‚Äôs a quick walk to the madness of Duval Street, but it also serves as a private and quiet oasis when the madness gets to be a bit much.
The pictures simply don‚Äôt do it justice. Check it out for yourself and see how wonderful these digs are."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Come and experience this remarkable retreat and oceanfront sanctuary with its private courtyard, gorgeous views including spectacular sunrises and sunsets, swaying palm trees and breathtaking scenery. Relax and unwind amid an uncompromisingly eclectic country space, designed with antique furniture, massive area rugs, and rich hardwood floors. You'll quickly appreciate the original artwork and the shelves lined with literature from renowned writers. The host and owners haven't missed a thing - we enjoyed fresh flowers, a full rack of Kuerig coffees, a modern kitchen, bath, and appliances - all to cover our daily necessities. You'll swing open the massive French doors to be immersed with incredible ocean breezes, sounds of crashing waves, and the entertainment from diving pelicans. Once outside you might spot the crow's nest - so take the short climb onto their spectacular rooftop deck for stunning panoramic views from above.
Much can be said about the amazing location, the views, the space. However the greatest beauty is its connection with nature, indoors and out. They are not trying to be perfect, modern, or crisply contemporary. This isn't a hotel, it's a relaxing retreat all furnished in a tranquil home setting. And, unlike a hotel, we never wanted to leave.
Our compliments to our host David, his staff, and the owners. We were fortunate to find this listing, and chose to spend a little more for our special occasion. What we discovered was an oasis of far greater value than was reflected in the cost. I suspect the owners don't need to provide such comforts, they simply choose to share what they've personally crafted. And by sharing what cannot be given, they have given what cannot be forgotten."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place exceeded our expectations in every single way!
We couldn‚Äôt have imagined a more perfect location & view. Five stars all around! Listening to the sound of the waves was so incredible, we didn‚Äôt want to leave! Firm mattress but otherwise extremely comfortable with lots of personal touches & a view that will knock your socks off! The bonus of being able to access the two resorts on each side was a wonderful touch."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"THE BEST OF EVERYTHING
Unit: This duplex unit puts even the best hotel suites to shame. We were very comfortable and felt right at home from the moment we arrived. It is warmly furnished and very spacious with two levels, two nicely furnished balconies featuring spectacular views, 1 1/2 baths and a very well stocked kitchen. They even supplied us with tea and coffee pods for the Keurig.
Location: We have been to Key West 3 times and have stayed on the furthest north end, the middle on Duval St and now this unit on the far south end. It is always referred to as the quiet end and yet we could walk everywhere we wanted to including restaurants, entertainment and shopping. If you do not like walking, you can always rent a bike or even one of those golf carts. You do not need a car.
Communication: David was always quick to respond and provided some nice recommendations. We did not meet David but his welcoming team was very helpful and pleasant.
Extras: Having the Reach Resort beach right next store was a real plus.
Extras: Having the beach right next store"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to enjoy the beach and also be within easy walking distance of everything you want to see while in Key West. We didn‚Äôt need to use our car once. The house is impeccable and a very relaxing retreat.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place was spectacular! It almost felt like I was on a big yacht because when your sitting on the sofa or lying in bed, you are looking at the ocean right out the door! The beautiful varnished wood floors also gave you the feeling of being on a yacht. You have your own private sandy beach to lay out on with palm trees to offer shade. The Reach Resort is right next door, and although it was a nice benefit to have access to the pool and beach toys, I never wanted to leave this place. I am spoiled now because I can‚Äôt ever imagine staying anywhere else.
Thank you for sharing your beautiful piece of paradise‚ù§Ô∏èüå¥‚òÄÔ∏è"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is the best. We will be back for sure. And then, the interior and apartment itself was also more than we ever imagined. We loved this place."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay in Key West. We really felt we were the luckiest people in all of Key West.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at Hidden Beach was beyond our greatest expectations.. All and every need or luxury were well planned in advance by our host David and Tim. The ‚ÄúHidden Beach‚Äù is truly a hidden gem of elite vacation accomadations.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough about this slice of Heaven. This is the first time that my husband ventured out and didn‚Äôt chose to stay at a resort. Hands down the best decision we ever made. The pictures don‚Äôt even give the house justice. The views are amazing. The house immediately makes you feel like home. It has everything that you could ever want. Thank you David for sharing your slice of Heaven. I cannot imagine ever finding a more perfect place to spend a week away from home. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place and the location. The bonus is access to both Waldorf Astoria locations for the pool and bar. Perfect spot, great views, quiet end of town. The two decks and the rooftop widow walk were perfect for hanging out and listening to the ocean. We'll be back for sure!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If this place is available book it! Trust me. It‚Äôs an amazing experience.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Neither words nor the pictures can describe how truly amazing this location is! We found our personal piece of paradise nestled in the corner at the end of Vernon Avenue. Hidden Beach is more than a place, it‚Äôs a lifestyle and a state of mind. If you‚Äôre anxious, it brings you peace. If the world had numbed you, it awakens your senses. You will not find a finer retreat anywhere else on the island. The hospitality is also beyond compare. We recommend renting a scooter for ease of travel and to catch a breeze. Hidden Beach is a walk or ride away from all the best local flare Key West has to offer. Also, the amenities include an amazing view, great local artwork and the only private natural beach in Key West. If in doubt, book this place!!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Beach is beautiful! The space is decorated with colors so much more relaxing and unique than typical tropical colors and themes. The breeze on the deck is amazing, and the view can‚Äôt be beat. So.much.space! It rained almost every day of our trip at some point, but the space was so comfy I didn‚Äôt really mind staying inside! Fabulous location as well. You can‚Äôt go wrong here."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay exceeded all expectations. The pictures hereon Airbnb are great but almost don‚Äôt do the real view justice!! The view was stunning, the place was spacious, well decorated and extremely clean, and the amenities were awesome. How cool is it to have your own private beach in front of the house!!! We loved the sliding doors which allowed the breeze in all day and night, and not one but TWO beautiful private balconies! It was so great to have access to the resort facilities next door as well. We recommend the drinks at both the resort and the ocean-front bar on the other side! Take advantage of the great kitchen and grill to make your own meals, and buy a couple pool inflatables at the resort next door to float on the ocean all afternoon with drinks. It was also fun to watch dogs splashing around with the dog beach next door. We will be back FOR SURE! Overall, we were unbelievably lucky to snag such a great place to stay for the week!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôm happy I booked this apartment! Everything was great and clean! It had a full kitchen, the sofa was big and comfortable so the bed, so soft and comfy !! And I loved the balcony.. really pretty , I would definitely come back here! Thanks Bill! ‚≠êÔ∏è"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was beautiful. The pool was nice. The room was clean and as advertised. The neighborhood was walkable and right where we wanted to be. It‚Äôs the perfect place to be in Key West
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cigar house is well maintained, clean and within a great location - in the heart of Key West. It was perfect for our group of (4) with access to the pool area and bikes available for use (at a fee).
The patio was a nice touch to sip our coffee on in the morning. Had the best AC and shower pressure. ; )
We would certainly be back again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill was great , had a couple questions and was very quick to reply."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Bills a couple days. Great spot! Beautiful grounds, helpful staff at the hotel. We rented bikes and explored the island. It‚Äôs close to many attractions, clean and comfortable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location! close to everything yet far enough away to be quiet in the evenings. the entire property is beautiful and the rental was exactly as described.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Easy walk to Duval. Perfect little getaway
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Bill was very helpful. Pan was missing from the kitchen and he replaced immediately. I accidentally damaged some porch furniture and he didn‚Äôt charge me because the chair was noticeably weathered. I really appreciated that.
Great host 5 stars"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is what you pay for here. Close to where we like to play yet very quiet and peaceful. It's a great place and as with other reviews we saw, being on the 3rd floor means a fair amount of steps. The surroundings are awesome with plenty of areas in the tropical courtyard to hang out, a short walk to good coffee, and short walks to great food and drink. Pool was always clean and heated. The place could use a bit of maintenance and maybe a new mattress, but everything worked just fine."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location and amenities were great.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is BEAUTIFUL! Such a wonderful spot for a vacation. Would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Bill was an amazing host and responded very quickly to any questions. Will definitely stay here again in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fantastic 2-night stay at Bill‚Äôs place in April 2024. Very good instructions to get in, easy to find, and we found parking a few blocks away. (Recommend packing light since you‚Äôre climbing 2 flights of stairs!)
I would call the place quirky, historic and fun with a great location a few blocks from all the fun hot spots on Duval. The balcony was our favorite spot at night, so peaceful and beautiful with all the huge very healthy palm trees. Great time. Would stay here again. Thank you Bill!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay in Key West.
Walking distance to everything, and the garage parking lot was easy to find and very close to the hotel.
The pool and surroundings of the hotel was so beautiful and relaxing.
Would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very central location!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations were as advertised. Easy to find and beautiful grounds. Large, sunny pool area (not adult-only). Comfortable bed, plenty of linens and overall very clean.
Private deck was sadly unremarkable- Composite chair (brown) was broken and other 2 chairs were unstable green plastic Adirondack chairs. Hard to enjoy sitting with coffee or evening drinks in the space.
To note: Condo is only accessible from outdoor, narrow staircase with a very small landing at top. Awkward carrying suitcases in. Stairs are in the pool area, get wet, and are dark at night. Condo entrance opens directly into bedroom vs. living space. Also, bathroom is tight with no storage/shelf at sink. You have to put toiletries on shelves above toilet away from sink.
Only inconvenience we experienced while there was out of owner‚Äôs control. There is a home being built directly next to condo and there was construction noise every day (incl. weekend) from 8am-6pm. Sawing, drilling, hammering, music‚Ä¶"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I wish we could have spent more time to take advantage of the pool amenity and outdoor lounge area!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bill‚Äôs place was excellent! Close to everything Key West had to offer yet very private and quiet. Perfect location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly as advertised. Rooms were clean, amenities worked and with Bill‚Äôs instructions it was easy to locate, park and find our room. Location is walkable to all things on Duvall St., but a couple blocks away to make it quiet at night. Would not think twice about recommending this unit or Bill to a friend. Thanks for the stay Bill."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing stay!!! Such a beautiful hideaway right next to the going‚Äôs on. Quiet and extremely private. Comfy bed, high ceilings, private balcony. Beautiful view, easy to use code entry. Highly recommend. Quick response and helpful for scooter parking information. Toiletries provided, coffee, water, snacks. Better than a hotel. Do it!! Suite 12 top floor was the best! Thank you"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Just what we expected.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Clean. Walkable. Comfortable bed. Landscaping was lush/mature. Bill‚Äôs place was a unit within a larger hotel. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel desk when we arrived before checkout and left after checkout. We did not really use the hotel amenities, but could have. There is an ice and water machine along the paths on the hotel grounds. We discovered them on our last day."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bill was an excellent host. Place as described. Perfect location!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Parking was a challenge but there is a 15 minute drop off parking spot. Good idea to only bring up what you really need as you have to go through two gates in the pool area and up two flights of stairs. (we combined to one suitcase). Great breakfast spots near by and fun to get take out food at Eaton‚Äôs fish market in the beautiful gardens on the hotel property. Easy fun walk to Mallory square and Duval street as well as Yankee Freedom if you are headed to Dry Tortuga‚Äôs. Lot‚Äôs of great space and cute balcony.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to downtown. Plenty of things to do/see within walking distance.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little hidden gem for 2 people to relax at to escape Duval craziness. Walking distance or short bike ride to everything. The property grounds were surrounded by lush green plants and running water features making it super tranquil. The steps getting to the room could be a little difficult for older people, but it was very private. Bill did communicate that to us and left perfect instructions for locating the unit and entering. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Place was neat and clean. Loved the heated pool. Construction going on next door, not the best to wake up to in the morning. Bed was comfortable, which is always a plus. Nice private balcony to enjoy the morning or evening. Thought the kitchen could of had things to cook with such as spices and cooking oil. Maybe cookie sheet or pizza pan. Overall a nice place to stay. Expensive but what's not in Key West. Would stay again but hopefully prices all around will go down sometime soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view and right by the pool.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our time at Bills Air BnB. The staff at the hotel were also extremely accommodating. Over all this was a 10/10. We have already highly recommended this Airbnb to our friends and family
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,So easy to check in. Pool area could have been cleaner. Construction next door not optimal. But suite was clean and very inviting. Easy to walk to everything! Thank you Bill!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill's place was a location and close to restaurants and bars, while still being very residential and quiet at night. He proactively reached out a few days before our stay and gave clear instructions on how to get into the place. No complaints."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay near Duval Street in the heart of Key West entertainment district. Loved having the accommodations with the pool. Would stay here on my next trip. 10/10.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very cool place. great that we were able to leave our bags at the front desk.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location close to Duval street. Walking distance to restaurants.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here. It‚Äôs very beautiful with lot of plants and decorations around. We enjoyed a swim in the warm pool as well. Short walk to restaurants too. Parking is by the roadside, but we were able to find a spot 1min walk away. Would definitely recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was so close to everything. The whole hotel was so charming, felt very private."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place and good location.
Stayed in early Jan. so heated pool was a nice bonus.
We were a family of four and having the kids sleep on the pull-out sofa worked fine.
The interior doors (bedroom and bathroom) are not solid but have sort of angled slats. I assume this is to help with air circulation, but they did not provide much in the way of sound isolation.
Overall good place and stay."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pool was the best part. It‚Äôs heated to over 80 degrees, at least in the winter, and it was glorious. I wish this was a thing at more places. The apartment is fine. It was clean and everything works. We had no real issues. It is a bit cramped and awkwardly laid out, but it‚Äôs a densely populated area and you can expect everywhere to be a bit compressed. I slept on the fold-out sofa and although it is new as described, it definitely was not comfortable. I would not recommend spending more than two nights with that bar in your back. This place was very expensive, but I think that was mainly a factor of the location and it being new years and not the fault of the host."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The warm pool was a hit with our family, and we loved how easy it was to walk downtown!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a place to stay in Key West! Our family of 5 fitted well, kids loved the pool and we loved that everything was walkable. Very private and romantic place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We all loved the space here! We easily walked to everything on the island that we wanted to see. Having a small kitchen was nice because we had leftovers from meals that we could reheat and save a little money. Our kids loved having the pool (it was much warmer than the ocean) and it was in a quiet, back area. Parking was pretty easy, if you catch it right."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and amenities.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great vacation.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. Very close to Duval St. Clean and matched the pictures online. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant and private even though it was a multiple suite AirBNB. We enjoyed the on site office, available bicycle rentals, and lovely, well-cared for grounds. Our rooms looked just like the photos. When we had a question, Bill responded right away - both before our stay and upon arrival."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, secluded condo. Close to so many things you can walk to. Wonderful area, nice having the pool so close. People at the hotel were very nice and helpful. Will definitely come back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and suited my plans for my business travel. Close to the action on Duval, not a bad walk. Private."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay and walkable to everything. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time we‚Äôve stayed here. Just as great as the first time. Very walkable to all the major spots while still being quiet and secluded so you can rest when you need to.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice Place, Private, and a comfy spot to lay your head."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. Love the location, private balcony, roomy living room, and tranquil feel. Only drawbacks for us was slight lack of storage space for belongings and no bathroom counter space since it had a pedestal sink."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location in Key West. Clean and private. Easy walk to all the fun!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful and the apartment is very well maintained and located.
A real moment of rest and pleasure."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked Bill's place along with a friend of ours for a weekend we were in town for a wedding. It was absolutely perfect for our stay! We got in early, but were able to leave our luggage in the hotel office until our room was available for check in. We were able to do the same thing after we checked out since our flight was late at night. We were 10 min or less walk from Duval street which was amazing. Close enough to do things during the day, but far enough away to not be disturbed by the nightlife noise. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone coming to visit Key West!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property presented better in person than photos.
Loved the views from the windows and balcony.
Awesome location. Walkable to the marina, restaurants and all that key west has to offer.
If mobility is an issue, probably not the best choice due to it being on the 3rd floor and the stairs.
Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place in key west. Close enough to Duval but not too close to hear the loudness! The house was super clean and was very cold which was great after being in the heat all day. Would def recommend staying here !
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really is a truly historic 1888 building complex with peaceful fully landscaped property that takes you back in time to the old Key West days.
Perfect location that‚Äôs so easy to walk around the historic seaport area and the old town.
The property was perfect for me (solo traveler) with a nice living room area with a private deck to enjoy sitting in. The kitchen was great with a full fridge and all the amenities you need (tip here is there is a seafood market across the street - great fresh dips and spreads make perfect snacks for the home here to enjoy). The bedroom and bed was super comfortable too. The bathroom was clean and a nice shower tub to utilize.
I‚Äôd stay here again and again.
Thanks Bill !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is in a great & walkable location. Cant beat it as far as location goes. We would return!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you Bill for the wonderful night in Key West well worth it
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My first experience with Airbnb and it could not have been better. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment was very clean and private. The balcony overlooks the pool in a very tranquil setting. Bill was also great in working with us as we had to delay our trip due to a storm. Hghly recommend staying with him.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home in a great neighborhood. Short walk from the Ferry Terminal.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill was a great host. He was helpful and responsive to my questions. It was my first time at the keys and the listing location was at the center of all attractions. You have a queen bedroom as soon as you enter with a dresser table and then a living room with a pull out sofa with a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. It was good for my party of 4. Kitchen had everything you needed for a quick meal. I recommend and will stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bill accommodated us at very short notice. The apartment was wonderful and very good value.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved, loved, loved!
Bill‚Äôs place was very convenient and comfortable, super quiet and we wished we could have stayed longer! Had everything we needed and more, had morning coffee overlooking the pool on the rooftop.. Such peaceful gardens!
Great location! It was our first time in the Keys and totally on a whim, we‚Äôll come back and Bill‚Äôs place will be where we‚Äôll stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bill was super nice and friendly, will definitely come back!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is a fantastic location and the host is extremely responsive and helpful. Space is very pretty , outdoor garden space and pool was phenomenal. Within 5 min of entering space, I killed a gigantic cockroach, but never saw anymore.
Maybe my only criticism is the airbnb is inside a hotel, but it was inconvenient to go thru the hotel office to get anything we needed, such as towels and coffee cups etc. Also just not the most streamlined process to take your bags of trash across property to empty etc. Overall still a fantastic stay, easily walkable everywhere."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ideal for a family of 4 - great space & location
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill was very responsive and the place was as described. The pool is very secluded even though it is shared with the hotel, never over crowded. Roof top clothing optional deck is nice for the adventurous. Air conditioning worked great which is a must in Key West during August. The staff at the front desk were nice and accommodating, allowing us to safely leave our bags before and after checkout so we were able to take early and late flights to enjoy the most time we could on the island. We would def stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Air Bnb was an amazing find! My friend and I absolutely loved it and had no complaints whatsoever. August is an extremely hot time to come to The Keys, but we were prepared for that! The AC in the unit kept up with the hot weather which was great. It is well communicated that the unit is on the third floor and there are no elevators so try to pack light! It was a tough trek with the heat! WiFi didn't work on our phones for some reason, but we didn't complain about that because the smart TV and streaming worked and we both had data on our phones. I'm positive the owners will help you if that were to happen though! Thanks Bill for the great place!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy walk to lots of places, grounds around unit are beautiful and tropical. Overlooks pretty pool but be aware pool shared with LOTS of other guests and usually congested/sometimes noisy. The unit is ok for two guests, but a challenge for more as sleeping arrangements are very uncomfortable for 3rd/4th guests. as fold out couch was not conducive to good night's sleep (should have read more of the comments before booking as this has been noted several times). The couch itself is stained (another thing noted in previous comments that I didn't see before booking). Decor has African/safari theme which is rather odd in such a beachy/tropical place and furnishings not favorable to spending much time in unit--the one extra chair is antique wood design that is very rigid and the two dining chairs at the small table make it awkward to have a snack for more than 2. Also, entry door is in bedroom so 3rd or 4th guests have to go through there to come/go. Owner was nice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location! Bill was very responsive and very helpful. Would definitely go back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good spot.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a cute little hideaway with a pool and everything was walkable. would definitely recommend!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Room 12 was a very nice place to stay. It‚Äôs on the third floor and the steps are a bit narrow so I would be careful if you have decreased mobility. Parking can be tricky and I wouldn‚Äôt plan to park on the street right next to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location for privacy away from the craziness of Duval Street. Easy walking around the island from this location.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The hotel the unit is located in in absolutely beautiful. Its clean, the staff are very polite and helpful, and its close enough to everything/the main strip. All in all, I‚Äôd recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,location was great. grounds were beautiful. pool was a nice addition for the kids. walkable to everywhere. Parking can be difficult. thats true in general in Key West. our advice is park once and walk the whole time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very nice. The location was ideal for us.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great location, great stay!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It's possible no one else has had this issue and I take responsibility for misreading, but for any other guests, just be certain you realize you're renting a space inside the cigar house next to the pool, not the hotel (main image). [My mistake, but still disappointing, and I think having the hotel as the main image is a bit misleading.] If you're clear about that, however, the space is overall a good one, and the location in Key West is great. Bill was very easy to communicate with, which I appreciated. A few issues though: Overall, apt was very clean, but the couch is pretty stained, the bedroom AC vent is covered in mold or mildew, the closet door is missing (odd), and (ugh) we had to kill several roaches. It's Florida, I get it, but not so great. (Been to FL many times; first time w/ roaches.) There were also no instructions in the apt about where to take trash (ours filled up), and we had to buy our own dishwasher detergent. Not huge deals, but prob would try elsewhere next time."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We loved the location and the view from the balcony was beautiful. Easy check in and perfect spot for us to spend the night in key west.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a great location, yet very private. Bill‚Äôs space was very comfy and a good value for they stay. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A truly fantastic place to stay in perfect location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cigar House was a wonderful place to spend part of our Honeymoon. The grounds, the environment, the people, made our stay one to be remembered for a lifetime. We can't wait to come back again! Bill was a gracious host, answering any questions that I had regarding the hotel or about the island."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Great pool. Very nice location. I'd love to come back
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved that most places were walkable for us. This was our first time to Key West and everything was so easy and relaxing! We would definitely stay at Bill‚Äôs place again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The grounds were beautiful, it really took the place up a notch and felt lush and tropical. Great location, far enough away from the chaos but close enough to enjoy. The steep stairs make loading in and out a workout, and with two little kids it added an extra wrinkle but we made it work - just a fair warning if stairs are an issue for you this isn‚Äôt your place. Would book again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a stay on key-west, this is absolutely unbeatable. If you enter the location via eatonstreet or williams st, you are immediately a fantastic little tropical oasis, fantastic courtyard garden with opportunity to isolate yourself in the garden for a book or just enjoy the tranquility. Furthermore, you will come by the pool with adjoining studio complex furnished in an earlier cigar house. The studio on the second floor is beautifully decorated, spacious and equipped with all accessories. Everything tidy and sparkling clean. View of the pool from the balcony.
The location is just ideal, one block from Duval street, 8 minute walk to ‚Äúthe boathouse‚Äù with the best ‚ÄúHappy hour‚Äù ever !
Hence to Mallory square, 5 min walk,, and the evening ending in the sunset pier with live music, cocktails and of course the sunset.
Fantastic communication with the host, can't be better!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our brief stay at the Island City House Hotel and will def stay here when we return to Key West. The Cigar house and pool area with very nice neighbors felt straight out of Tales of the City. The location was convenient and easy to get to and around the area. Bill was very responsive if I had questions.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Visited with my daughter to celebrate her college graduation and had a great stay. Location is perfect as it was peaceful yet easy access to all the activities on and around Duval Street. Look forward to staying at this property on our next trip to Key West.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Best thing was definitely location. Really close to Duval street, Sunset Pier, the harbor for the Dry Tortugas ferry.
Also really enjoyed the setting. Lots of charming trees/landscaping; the hotel feels very secluded and private.
Bike rental was really cheap/easy through the lobby too!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. If you have ANY problems with stairs I do not recommend. Other than that it was a GREAT place to stay. Loved the area!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was exactly as advertised and even lovelier than we expected. Perfectly sized space for a couple or small family. Great location, and the owner was s extremely responsive. Would definitely stay here again if we come back!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is very nice. Close to the center. Good pool and very nice garden at the hotel. Maintenance of the apartment is a bit less. The stairs to the room were under bird droppings and did not seem to be cleaned. In a single spot on the ceiling, the paint peeled off. Or that's because the room does not belong to the hotel but is from a private person I do not know."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was perfectly clean and well located. The environment was beautiful. The only 2 issues was :
Keurig coffee machine didn‚Äôt detect the glass so we couldn‚Äôt make a coffee and sleeping in a sofa it isn‚Äôt the best because the mattress is very thin but overall we loved it. We will definitely come back and we recommend bill place ."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was the best part of this place! Super close to the yankee freedom dock to dry tortugas and a short walk to Duval. Only thing that wasn‚Äôt desirable is the steps to the unit are super steep and short. Which was highlighted in his listing ahead of time so I appreciate the transparency! Unit was clean and had all the essentials. Great place to stay would stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hotel was in the middle of everything. Great location. Loved all the foliage around the property. The pool area was just big enough. The property was well kept and the staff was super nice. One thing I didn‚Äôt love... Because it‚Äôs an Airbnb room within a hotel, you don‚Äôt get the daily cleaning on your room or the stairs to enter. And they don‚Äôt have supplies (like a broom) in the room for you to do it yourself like you would get in a normal Airbnb. We accidentally got a little sand in the room on the first day and realized we would just have to deal with that the whole time we were there. The stairs leading up to the room were covered in leaves and bird poop from the beautiful surroundings. Not a big deal, but would have been nice to be able to clean those off. I also prefer when a property has an additional lock for when you are in the room. This didn‚Äôt. We had no issues the whole week, but it just makes me uneasy when I‚Äôm sleeping. Overall I loved it and would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Cigar House was just what we needed! A quiet retreat tucked away in a beautiful location but close to all the activities. This is a great unit for couples or a small family. Bill was helpful and responsive with any questions that we had. We hope to visit his little slice of paradise again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bills space was absolutely perfect. Far enough that it was quiet and peaceful but close enough that you can walk to everything! The apartment was clean and spacious!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall successful stay with three people. Tolles Ambiente. Gute Lage. Pool sounds unfortunately partly until late in the evening. Kitchen equipment needs improvement, no toaster. Capsule machine for coffee only. Not enough dishes for dishwasher."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was by far the most beautiful Airbnb I've stayed in, wow. It looked beautiful in the listing, but oh my god, it was even more beautiful in real life. Thr neighborhood is full of old, beautiful houses, incredible tropical plants everywhere, super quiet and peaceful. The building is surrounded by an incredible, huge garden with winding paths, seating areas, alcoves. The unit is on the top floor so very quiet and private. Incredible balcony, beautiful interior. Clean, beautifully decorated, spacious. Well stocked kitchen with teas, coffee with Keurig, granola bars. Well stocked bathroom with hotel soaps, clean soft towels, etc. Sleeper sofa wasn't very comfortable very thin so you could feel the springs, but it did the job. Friends had the main bed and said it was very comfortable. Pool outside as well was really nice. 10/10, would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved this spot and the gardens/pool. if I'm in key west again I'll decibel stay here

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wish we would have had more time, the place was lovely. A bit pricey, but that‚Äôs key west. I loved the decor in the Airbnb, very cozy. Not a huge deal, but there wasn‚Äôt hand soap in the bathroom or next to kitchen sink. The lock on the patio door didn‚Äôt seem to work either, which did make me a little nervous. Overall, highly recommend. Bill was an exceptional host."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill's unit in the Cigar House was exactly as described! Just what my wife and I needed for a 5-night winter escape to Key West. The walk leading to the unit through all the tropical foliage was beatiful. Being a third floor condo helped it feel secluded. The only items I'd recommend ""improving"" would be updating some of the furniture and perhaps brightening the decor with some pops of color. Other than this, we would happily return! Thank you, Bill, for a great stay."

Pool area and gardens were so relaxing, hotel staff was nice and we even rented bikes one day ($15 a person). the cooking equipment is limited (it is a vacation rental) but we made do and enjoyed some breakfast and re-heated leftovers with ease. The stairs are steep but we're young so it did not bother us. Our parents would not be able to make them though. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill‚Äôs place is perfect. Location super close to Duvall but far enough to be quiet. Third floor kept us safe during the hurricane.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Bill‚Äôs place in Key West was great. Everything is as described and seen in the photos, no surprises! Very clean, well appointed, comfortable beds, nice touches in the kitchenette with a variety of hot drink options, cereal bars and a bottle of cold Perrier! The location is perfect for exploring the old town and, if you don‚Äôt want to drive or rent bikes/golf carts, the free Duval Loop shuttle stops only one block away. The hotel (where the suite is located) has a very nice staff that will help you book activities and there‚Äôs also bike rentals on site. We didn‚Äôt use the pool, so I can‚Äôt comment on that. All in all, highly recommended"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything works just fine
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location, comfy stay... very spacious and the front desk (possibly property manager) was so sweet!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and this place was everything we wanted for our stay in Key West. Location is excellent; Close enough to walk to the fun on Duval St. and far enough away to enjoy having drinks on the balcony quietly watching the stars. Kitchen was perfect for making breakfast in the morning and more if you want. Carlos at the front desk was incredibly helpful with suggestions on where to eat and excursions to take. Bike available to rent on premises . The place was clean, spacious, well appointed and the A/C worked incredibly well (I work in the hvac industry:). We didn't use it but having a pool private to the complex is really a cool option to have. Last but not least Bill was an excellent host. We've been using Air Bnb for a few years now and I can say, without hesitation, that Bill is the most responsive host we have ever rented from. Bill also had great suggestions for us on dinners and happy hours, etc. We are definitely going to book here again when we return next year!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay was great. There's a pool, public shower, and public bathroom near the office. Useful when done with the checkout but you still need access.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is awesome. Private and central. All of the main attractions in Key West are like a 5 minute walk. In fact we found a parking spot right in front of the hotel and didn‚Äôt use our car for four days. The staff at the hotel were amazing. The pool was great. I loved being on the top floor. It‚Äôs true that there is no elevator. But we knew that going into the reservation and it wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. Highly recommend this place. Bill was great to communicate with.

The office was able supply anything we ran out of, and Bill was an excellent host and a great communicator. There is no on site parking and there is a spot to park in for unloading and loading. The guests and staff were all so friendly. We definitely can‚Äôt wait to stay there again!!"

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is in a great location for seeing all the old town sights. We rented the bikes a couple of days to get around and the pool felt great after the hot afternoons. Bill immediately responded to a squeaky door request and even brought us ice. We later learned ice is available at the hotel office. Carlos, in the office, was a wealth of plant knowledge. He also helped us get a golf cart one day and arranged a 5AM cab ride to the airport. Overall a great trip for my sister and me."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a week or weekend trip to the keys! Everything is within walking distance.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cozy place is a pocket of calm and comfort just steps away from the party that is Key West. You could spend a lazy day lounging by the pool or pop out to explore nearby restaurants and nightlife. Outstanding location, easy access to parks, beaches and entertainment. Wake up or end your day on the charming lanai listening to the bird songs. This will definitely be our go to for Key West adventures."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location. Loved the deck. We liked that it was gated. It had all we needed to make breakfast. This was our first time in Key West, we will be back and would rent here again."

Amazing location and the bikes make it extremely easy to navigate the island with no issue. Plenty of equipment for the beaches as well. The apartment was comfortable and the patio was amazing. We would definitely love to come back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! Close to walk to so much but far enough away you didn‚Äôt hear the music and loud people on the strip. The bed was comfortable! Having the bikes was nice when we went a little further away. We only used our car to go to the grocery store and to Bahia Honda state park. I would totally recommend going there it is worth the drive. We took a lunch and the chair and umbrella and had a great day! Having the beach stuff and towels was a bonus so I didn‚Äôt have to pack extra towels. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family!! Thanks for a wonderful stay!!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay at Christina's condo. We found it to be exactly as in the pictures and is perfect for a couple. The kitchen had everything we needed and we found the bed to be quite comfy.
The location is steps away from the excitement of Duval, Truman Waterfront Park and the Southern Most Point. Great food at Blue Heaven and drinks at the infamous Green Parrot are just a couple of blocks away. It is also close to 2 stops for the Duval Loop free bus. When you are ready to relax and kick back, the deck is the place to be. Although there are many homes/units close, it was quiet. Christina is an awesome host and responds quickly to any questions. We look forward to our next Key West visit and would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cannot start to explain how amazing your place is. We are already talking about coming back to your place. Thank you for everything. It was just absolutely beautifulü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Second time staying in her place! Love the Shipyards!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We decided this has to be the cleanest and most well taken care of property we have ever rented. Christine has gone above and beyond to make this the perfect home for her guests while they are in Key West. In addition, the property is in a beautiful and friendly neighborhood as you come and go and in the absolute best location to easily access and enjoy the Duval Street area, Fort Zachary Taylor State Park, and the Southernmost Point just to name a few. The bikes that are available were great as well for those slightly longer trips on the island. We will definitely be returning to Key West in the future and want Christina‚Äôs property to be our home during the visit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great stay we had in Christina‚Äôs condo. Shipyard, the location, is convenient to everything you may want on your trip to Key West- Duval st, local bars & restaurants & the best yet- a close ride to the beach. The condo provides two bikes for use- the best perk ever. Everything we needed inside as well, a comfortable bed, all linens, pot/pans if you‚Äôre cooking, coffee maker.. Our favorite part was the large outdoor deck off the living area with a covered over hang. We spent a lot of time there reading & napping when days were extra hot in the 2 full size lounge chairs. Would love to return üå¥üíïü¶ã"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great location to walk to all the great sites in Key West. Top floor condo was ideal for the two of us.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thanks so much for sharing your space with us. Your condo is the perfect place to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù to after a day of exploring Key West. Clean and cozy. So nice to sit on the porch in the morning and listen to the roosters crow. The location is perfect, walkable to Duval but quiet. The pool was refreshing. Having bikes available was also a big plus. This was our first time there but we are already planning to return."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location, Location, Location!!! Christina was a joy to work with, and was always super responsive to our text messages in a very quick and timely manner. The bikes were also a game changer and made getting around town even easier and enjoyable. The amenities that separated her place from others was the location, bikes, pool and the ceiling fans on the deck allowing us to sit outside even in the summer. Thanks for everything Christina!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location was excellent. Walking distance or an easy bike ride (bicycles provided) to places on our to-do list. A manual was provided with extensive information on restaurants, attractions and house rules - it was all there! House was well stocked with everything you could need. Should we visit Key West again, we will most certainly stay at Christina‚Äôs. We just loved it!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"210 Southard was a wonderful place. Christina is both: responsive and accommodating. We've stayed in KW many times and many places, and this is definitely a favorite. Thanks, again!!

The bed is relaxing, bathroom is very nice and I can't tell you how convenient it was to have the large commercial washer and dryer!
Thank-you, Christina, for making our second trip to Key West so pleasant! We look forward to coming back for a third visit soon..."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Two blocks from Duval makes this place easily accessible to all of the entertainment and sites!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Christina‚Äôs placed is perfectly located. You can walk or bike to all the restaurants and attractions.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Christina‚Äôs condo! The location was perfect we didn‚Äôt even need a car. The pool was an added bonus for a relaxing day. I would 100% recommend this spot as it was right in the heart of Key West!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our second time visiting Christina‚Äôs place in KW. Great value, location and extremely comfortable! We especially appreciate having the washer/ dryer, bikes (used them every day!) and the nice big deck. Truman Annex is an extremely safe and mostly quiet area- highly recommend. We will definitely return in the future. Thanks!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location! Area was very safe and clean. Condo had everything we needed. Communication was excellent. Thanks for everything!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The apartment was exactly as described. It is central to Duval street and the beach. It functions well and is a very comfortable place to stay even for a long stay much better than a hotel.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It is the most perfect place to stay. It offers privacy and you feel secluded because it‚Äôs an end unit with trees around the balcony. The unit is super clean, bright and airy. It‚Äôs perfectly decorated Key West style with a sense of home. We used the bikes to get around easily. We hope to stay again! By far our favorite place to stay in Key West! THANK YOU!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the place to stay !! everything stated was true close to beaches,restaurants stores and the bikes were fantastic just a wonderful trip I would continue to plan my trips at Christine‚Äôs home she was a great host ! We cant wait to come back

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed our stay, the condo is roomy. The deck was great to enjoy a glass of wine on in the evening or just read there is always a cool breeze. Walking distance to Mallory Square and Duval Street all attractions. I'm ready to go back again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything you could possibly need and more you'll find in this ultimate KW condo quietly tucked away only footsteps to the heart of the island. The 2 bicycles, parking spot and state of the art W/D are invaluable on a KW vacation. But the tastefully decorated rooms along with the spacious, private deck provide a restful reprieve from the excitement of downtown KW. I have stayed in many places on KW over the years. But this is by far the best condo I have ever stayed in. It just has it all and I can't wait to return!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This unit is beautiful and has everything you need to enjoy a great time in Key West. The location is superb and within walking distance to the action but also you can enjoy peace and quiet. The parking was convenient. The neighbors are nice people and the area is safe. Don‚Äôt hesitate to stay here for a short or long term. You will have everything you need to enjoy the area. This is a rare find and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with our stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location. This is an awesome value for Key West. I have been here many times and this was the best stay ever! Great place to come home to after visiting all there is to see in Key West! Host was incredible!!!!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was amazing! Super close to the action but tucked in the beautiful Truman Annex off a quiet street.
The deck and pool were great bonuses, but the beach supplies were so helpful!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great Airbnb. The location was fantastic. We were within walking distance to Duvall, Mallory Square etc. we even was able to walk to Southernmost point. The bicycles were handy and we enjoyed riding them to Fausto grocery store to purchase some groceries.
There were beach chairs and umbrellas provided for those days at the beach. Fort Zachary is right around the corner and so pretty. No need to take snacks as there is a cute little cafe that has a nice assortment for lunch.
Christina was quick to respond to the one issue we had with cable tv. She got it resolved quickly. She was always just a text away.
We can‚Äôt wait to return as this place was perfect!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the perfect place to stay while exploring Key West. We were able to walk everywhere It was also wonderful to have two bikes to use while there. Key west is great for biking. The condo is so clean and well equipped we felt so at home. we loved having coffee on the beautiful, quiet balcony. thank you so much. we will be back"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful condo, beautiful area, great location!! We could not have picked a more perfect condo within a walk or a short bike ride everywhere! The condo was very clean and had everything you could need. We enjoyed coffee on the deck, biking to Ft. Zachary Taylor Beach, walking to Duval St for shopping and food. The provided bikes, beach chairs, beach towels, and cooler were so useful. We had an amazing time!! Highly recommend!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything about this condo is great. First, the location is amazing. It‚Äôs quiet, but close to everything. We enjoyed the large deck space. Having bikes to explore was great. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking. The condo was super clean. We had a great time and hope to be back soon."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What an absolutely great time we had at Chris's place! Convenient, safe, clean, cozy, great patio with view of tropical tree/plants. Having two bikes available was so handy and they were in great condition and we rode them all over Key West.
Beach/park was right in her back yard so to speak and it was beautiful! The bed was super comfy and the check in and out process so easy!
Chris had great suggestions on restaurants and fun places to go- she was very accommodating and quick to respond. I would DEFINITELY rent from Chris again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a fabulous place to stay. The condo is actually larger than I expected from the pictures. We ordered groceries from the local grocery store to be delivered and cooked all but 3 meals at the condo. The bicycles would have been great but I have a bad knee. We ended up renting scooters for most of our stay. The kitchen was well equipped with everything that you could need. The washer and dryer were so handy. I hadn't really thought about the temperature of tap water until staying here. It wasn't cold. But the water tastes good and the fridge has an ice maker. No need to buy bottles of water for use at the condo. The cooler and beach chairs were also very nice touch. Thank you Christina!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Christina's place is the perfect place for a Key West getaway. Close to everything yet secluded and quiet, Christina also provides the extra touches that make her place one of a kind. Beach chairs, umbrella, cooler and noodles made our beach trips truly special, as did the bicycles. Meals and drinks shared on the large patio were always special, and the kitchen was equipped with everything needed to make those meals. We will be returning to Christina's place whenever we return to Key West."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"5 stars! Location, location, location! We had a wonderful time and everything was as portrayed. Relax on the large balcony and centrally located to everything! The two bikes were the perfect touch (we even rode them to Publix). The beach chairs, cooler, and pool noodles (we forgot how wonderful it is to float!) we‚Äôre the cherries on top. Clean pool and every amenity you would need in a condo. We cannot wait to come again! Thanks for everything!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great stay at a great location. The bikes and the beach gear is a very nice touch. The back deck is huge and a great space. Very central to everything on the Island.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an absolutely amazing time at Christina‚Äôs condo. It is perfectly located to all the best spots, easy to access, quiet and safe. We so enjoyed the bikes and used them every day. Coffee on the deck daily was a perfect start to the day. We will re-book with Christina, no question. Everything you would need is at the condo, including beach supplies. Kitchen tools well stocked, ample towels, extra sheets, blankets, etc. Parking spot, if you‚Äôd drive or get a rental, is RIGHT in front of the unit.
If you‚Äôre new to key west be sure to check out KAYA, Hanks, sunset and farmers market (Thursday‚Äôs) at Truman Square, offshore fishing (we used Compass Rose Charters), happy hour at Half Shell, Banana Cafe and Fritas.
Christina is the most communicative host we have ever stayed with! Book this condo, you WILL NOT regret it ‚òÄÔ∏èüòé"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a great stay in Key West within walking distance to most activities, bars, shops, and restaurants look no further! This condo also includes everything you need for a day at the beach, All you need to bring is yourself and a change of clothes. The host was very friendly and made sure we knew she was only a text away! Would definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A lovely condo! The bikes left were amazing, the location is perfect, and the balcony is awesome. We definitely plan to come back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"AMAZING! I can‚Äôt even begin to express how awesome Christina‚Äôs place is to stay in. This was my husband and I‚Äôs first time visiting the Keys and everything was perfect. Her home is located right in the heart of everything. We were able to walk everywhere and explore and ride the bikes she provided which made our stay there that much better. Riding to the beach with the awesome chairs she left us and having baskets on the bikes made it absolutely perfect. And to think we thought of renting a car- don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt need it.
The patio was our favorite spot to sit and have coffee in the morning and overall spend most of our time when we were back at home. The view is gorgeous and we enjoyed all of the beautiful flowers and trees on the property.
The house was SO comfortable, we had everything we needed. Everyone we met on the property was so friendly! And Christina was so helpful via text if we needed anything.
This was truly one of the best vacations we have ever had together and I cant express enough how much our stay here made our trip. We will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location amazing! We enjoyed the bikes, pool and of course the location. We didn‚Äôt drive once while in KW. This condo has everything you could possibly need. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Christina was an excellent host! When any questions came up, her communication back was ASAP. The amenities she supplied for your stay were fabulous. If you were to fly or drive there was no need to worry about anything. Beach chairs, umbrella, ice packs & yes one day we even were thankful for umbrellas providedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Anything you could think of‚Ä¶it was provided. Please know her place was immaculate & close to everything. I was new to renting on Airbnb & she walked me through everything. You will not be disappointed staying at Christina‚Äôs home in Key Westüòé I can‚Äôt wait for a return visit! Thank you‚Ä¶"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stay stay stay! I highly recommend this location. We stayed in this condo for a week and was the best decision we made. Duvall street is about a 2 short blocks away . The food was fantastic (Foghertys) was our favorite. We loved the kitchen and being able to make some breakfast and lunch so we could spend the extra for drinks at dinner. The bedroom was a great size, very comfortable bed and such cute decor (and had a small tv). The closet was helpful with towels and space to hang a few items and the fans in all the rooms were great and quiet! The pool is fantastic for the days you don't wanna get down and dirty in the sand. a short minute walk around the corner the complex has tanning chairs and a nice4ft- 6ft pool. The single car parking spot was extremely helpful for us (new to key west) we were off lot and behind the gate so it felt safe to leave the car and was in front of the condo to make it easy to bring our bags in (even in the heat!). This is a 10 min walk to the Fort zachary beach or a five min drive if u have a few people open until sunset. The museums are equal distant days left and right from this condo to so you could truly circle the duval street area. The washer and dryer came in handy for washing our wet clothes from beach, pool or rain. we also used the pull out couch as an additional bed for one of us and they had a good night on it all week. I highly recommend trying the 2 bikes that are on property to take a ride about the area, and the rental bikes for more riders is a short walk away and worth it. If you made it this far- i would love to mention christina has been amazing with keeping us updated, staying in contact, and also had sent us pdf packets for all the local tidbits like bars, happy hours, museums and condo amenities and rules. We loved it and helped us navigate a truly wonderful vacation. I could not be more happy and i suggest you give this play a stay in key west!!!!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved staying at this condo! Very clean and comfortable. The deck is so peaceful and relaxing. The location is perfect and it was really nice to be within walking distance of so many great restaurants and things to do. Fort Zachary Taylor beach is beautiful and the beach chairs provided at the condo are very nice. We had a great time exploring Key West and then coming back to the condo at the end of the day and relaxing on the deck. Christina was super accommodating and helpful when we had any questions. Would definitely recommend this condo to anyone looking to stay in Key West!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I read all of the great reviews so I was really excited for our Key West stay at Christina's. What you can't express in the review is the feeling you get sitting on the deck with a cold rum drink and a breeze, hearing roosters crow, riding bikes to Fausto's Market for supplies...it's really whatever you make it. We had slow days walking through gardens, crazy afternoons in Sloppy Joe's and everything in between. Christina's home is in the heart of everything, and yet very quiet and peaceful. The bikes, beach chairs, fully stocked kitchen and all of the other touches including her quick replies and tips just really take her property to another level. My husband had never been to KW and I had never spent more than a day there. We started planning our return trip on Day 2. If you're a couple looking to get away for a Key West adventure, this is your home base."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is awesome. I highly recommend it. It is located in the perfect place of Key West. Christina was amazing, she answered all of my questions and helped with other needs."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful one-bedroom in a great location in Key West. The large deck looks out over beautiful vegetation to other back decks. The condo property, Shipyard Condos, is an award-winning design.
5 to 8 minute bike ride to Fort Zachary Taylor Beach, gorgeous. Very nicely appointed apartment. Excellent communication and great attitude. We would definitely stay there again."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The location was perfect especially for having my pup along.  It was in a quiet section and easy walk to the grassy areas for him, the pool, and to the waterfront park. Upon my arrival, the guard at the gate provided a map and directions of the complex which was very helpful.
Kristina is a wonderful Host, and I can't wait to return!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Christina's condo is cozy and comfortable - it had everything I needed for my stay and more, including bicycles and beach supplies - perfect! The deck was a lovely and quiet place to sit in the morning and enjoy the warm breezes. It is a great location for walking to the downtown area, Mallory square, local beaches and all of the tourist sites (Hemmingway House house and Mel Fischer's museum are both a few blocks away. Great eating places nearby as well. I love it!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful getaway for 2 people. Enjoyed the large patio and short walk to the pool. Great location to walk to beach at Zachary Taylor State Park and to Duval street.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo is located in great location. Two blocks off of Duval Street and 5 minutes from Mallory Square. The condo was very clean and had a large balcony, very quite and private. Condo was close to the best restaurants, all within walking distance."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Christina's place was in a great location. We walked everywhere! There were 2 bikes we could have used but everything we wanted to do was less then a mile. The place was really clean and had all the amenities we needed. The parking space was nice as it is hard to find parking in Key West for a week. Christina communicated quickly with all our questions and concerns. Would definitely recommend and return if we came back to Key West.
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"great location. bike or walk anywhere. super close to the best beach. the bed is a full sized bed and not a queen sized bed as it says in the listing. also the address on the listing was incorrect leading to missed shipped items, confusion during check in."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful place and a wonderful host. Thanks Christina, for making our stay a fantastic one!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing and our host responds very quickly, she also let us check in early we will definitely be back definitely pack light everything you need is there!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo is in a very convenient location to activities on Key West. We walked most everywhere although our hostess has two bicycles available to use. We weren‚Äôt expecting that. She also provided beach umbrellas and pool noodles for water fun. She even thought to provide two rain umbrellas. The weather was wonderful so they weren‚Äôt used. A complete surprise was the insulated backpack and ice packs. We made use of it for picnic lunches at the beach and waterfront. The bed is soft and comfy with two Serra Perfect Sleeper pillows. There were plenty of linens. It was wonderful to have access to the washer and dryer. Our visit was the week after Key West opened from COVID-19. We made a leisurely drive through the Keys to the condo. Traffic was much heavier the weekend we left. My husband and I agreed it is not a drive we want to make again on a weekend after the island has fully opened. It was disappointing, but expected, that several businesses we wanted to frequent were still closed so we weren‚Äôt as busy as expected. We had plenty of time to relax and did so in the cool refreshing water at the pool. We would love to stay again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great apartment in perfect location -- only two blocks off Duval Street in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood. Christina is an ideal host. Absolutely no complaints. Will probably stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,House was just like the photos. Accommodated 10 guests perfectly
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I am also an Airbnb host so I have a particular critical eye when it comes to this industry!
This was absolutely the best experience at an Airbnb and I have stayed at many. Our host Alison was available and immediately responsive and helpful from before we booked and up to checkout. The house was wonderful plenty of room for my .entire family. The place was perfectly clean and I am fussy about that! Plenty of towels Beds were comfy and the location was A++
Highly recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great historic mansion, half block off Duval. Private pool and parking. It was awesome!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect stay in paradise! This bnb is a gem! It was super clean and beautiful! This is our 4th time in the keys and my husband and I loveddd that it was private but at the same time walkable to everything on duval! To make it better there is a scooter/golf cart rental place right at the corner of the street that we used for the whole weekend! We particularly loved the 2 private pools on property, all of the staff including daily housekeeping! The beautiful flowers and plants throughout the grounds, the really comfortable bed and the double shower head was awesome! Naomi is fantastic and we will absolutely be renting from her again when we come back next year! I highly recommend! :)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was lovely! We loved the porch
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our long weekend in Key West! Super close to Duval and tons of restaurants and bars. We didn‚Äôt have to use our vehicle once. LOVED how they saved us a parking space upon arrival as well! We came down to see a concert at the amphitheater and we were able to walk to and from the show in about 15-20 minutes. The jacuzzi was a wonderful and peaceful way to unwind after being out and about all day. Would definitely recommend this place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location just a block from all the action. Naomi‚Äôs place was very clean and had everything we needed. The pool was also secluded and very nice. Would definitely return!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"So sorry we didn‚Äôt discover this place sooner. Absolutely perfect stay. The place is wonderful, staff great. If we didn‚Äôt have another commitment for March would love to have extended our stay. Thank you"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect location! Cose to shops and restaurants but very quiet. The gardens and grounds are immaculately maintained and very lush. The staff was very friendly. We were pleasantly surprised that it was only a few blocks from our favorite restaurant, Moondog Cafe. We will definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was ideal; close to Duval, great restaurants, bars, beach, etc. Harrison House was immaculate and contained anything/everything you would need for a wonderful stay. We also enjoyed having our own private hot tub. Would highly recommend to anyone and we are already planning on a return next year."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect place to stay! Loved the private courtyard and hot tub. The space was pristine and so comfortable. The grounds were beautifully decorated with Christmas lights on all the gorgeous greenery. Truly a hidden gem.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another fantastic stay in Key West! Naomi was extremely responsive and helpful before and during our stay. The location is fantastic (just off Duval, but very peaceful). We really enjoyed the community pool, privacy of the home, and the amazing service from the staff! I highly recommend staying at one of Naomi‚Äôs properties!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Center Court. You can‚Äôt beat the location - right in the heart of it all yet somehow quiet. Adults-only pool is large with plenty of lounge chairs for guests, though we rarely saw other guests taking advantage of it. The private courtyard with mini hot tub accompanying our suite is a lovely perk. Daily housekeeping meant fresh towels. Kitchen was stocked with all the basics - including coffee, sugar, and cream. Love the details of an Amazon Alexa and Bose speaker in the room to play music via Bluetooth. The location can‚Äôt be beat, I don‚Äôt know how it can be so close to Duval Street and be so quiet, but it is. We will come back and stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fabulous. So glad we found it and booked it. Cant wait to return.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The grounds are so well maintained and beautiful! We loved having the peace of this quaint place, enjoying our patio and the pools. And also then being able to easily walk or bike to the restaurants and night life on Duval, the beaches and marina. This place is perfect. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in key west!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing week my wife and I had at Harrison‚Äôs Hideaway! An amazing property that is so well taken care of by the amazing friendly staff! Being just a block off of Duval street you are so near all of the attractions and amazing food, but you would never know it with how quiet the area is! We cannot wait for our next trip to Key West and will make sure we book with Naomi again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just a little piece of Heaven. One street parallel to Duval and it was so quiet it was hard to believe that Duval was only one street over. Got a golf cart to tool around Key West in and gave very late notice to Naomi who responded right away that we could park it in front of the house. Just a great time and great location overall.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best bnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Bed was incredibly comfortable, location was perfect, space was so clean and every detail was meticulously thought out. Hot tub was super clean and very hot. Thank you for your amazing hospitality!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will just say I will never stay anywhere else in KW. First time and my wife and I fell in love w Naomi‚Äôs place. Not too mention how responsive she was. Totally seamless, wonderful, beautiful, quaint bungalow !! Total 5 star!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very very nice place. Maintained better than any hotel.
Beautiful flowers and landscaping
Super clean jacuzzi and pools.
Refrigerator died and a gentleman showed up in less than an hour with a brand new one. The staff is super helpful. Would definitely stay here again. No need for a car or golf cart
You can walk to everything"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harrisons hideaway was the perfect house for our stay. I love the privacy especially the hot tub on our front yard (every morning) The house is perfect, updated, roomy, clean, with everything you need. Lush, tropical grounds lead to the shared family pool with the adult pool just across the quiet residential street. Both are very nice and enjoyable after a warm day. Maintenance staff lead by Jesus was always there working the plants, cleaning, and ready to do anything for you. Upon check out, they kept our luggage in a locked room, as we had 5 hours till we headed to the airport.
Location is perfect. Free public bus is within 2 blocks, and the furthest walk to any of the major shopping, eating, and drinking, gathering places is less than a mile. The main road, Duval, is one block. Lyft/Uber are everywhere and get to you in one minute.
Your host, Naomi always replies quickly and has made this property a very nice place for your Key West getaway. Enjoy it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Harrison‚Äôs Hideaway was just a pictured! Super location! Well serviced! Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect getaway weekend for a couple of local Floridians.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi was extremely responsive to messages! The kitchen was very well stocked, I was very happy with the kitchen! A lady came by every day and asked if we needed new towels or anything else - I didn't expect that and it was a nice bonus! I didn't care for the smell of whatever cleaner they used, but my daughter liked it. The shower had body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and the bathroom had hand soap, shower caps, plastic cups, and lotion. The lotion smelled like cinnamon and I really liked it! We never used the hot tub because it was so hot in September."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our Key West adventure. It‚Äôs in walking distance to Duvall Street, making it doable to hit all of the locations on your too do list. A&M scooters is at the end of the street that makes it even more convenient to have transportation to explore the island. The cottage was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. Naomi is very responsive and accommodating. The staff was also super friendly and available when needed. I highly recommend Center Court Cottages."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay! Not only was the cottage tasteful and clean, but had everything essential to a comfortable stay. The bed was very comfy, the kitchen was well stocked (which was super helpful with our baby in tow), and the bathroom was relaxing. The cottage also has a private patio that my wife and I used every night to relax with some drinks and food.
The other highlight to this was the location right off Duval, with on-site parking! Shops and restaurants were right out the door and all the main attractions of Key West were no more than 15-20 minute walk away.
The stay offered a lot more amenities we didn‚Äôt have the chance to take advantage of, but the pool looks great and the roof top decks would be excellent for a sunset. Would 100% stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy! Great location and super host!
However, it was very expensive compared to we were only looking for 3 nights."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was beautiful and inviting! Location was absolutely perfect, we had no problem riding our bikes everywhere. Only used our car once for a late night taco bell run but we were able to save our parking spot. Also Jesus the maintenance man was so friendly and quick to help if we needed anything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it here. Nice shower and bed was comfortable. Everyone liked it too.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, we recommend this logement. Very good location, you can do a lot by walk or rent bicycles. Very calm and the adult pool is super !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was perfect for my needs/ wants. We will be back next year!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay in key west!!! Thank you!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to everything, very safe and secure, absolutely loved the free, close parking!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described, we enjoyed the room. It was within walking distance to the popular attractions which made the trip more enjoyable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location in center of Key West. Place is very clean and perfect for couples. Easy instructions for check-in.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time! Location very convenient to all main attractions in Key West. Clean and tidy upon arrival and attentive service throughout stay. Recommend for any stay in Key West if you want to stay close to old town. Thanks, Naomi!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay!! The place was just as described and the staff was friendly and flexible!! I absolutely would stay here again!‚Ä¶ Thanks Naomi!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just wonderful! Stayed two days here for part of my husbands 30th birthday trip. Everything was perfect. Super clean, great private outdoor area with private jacuzzi(which was such a highlight) and so close to Duval street. Place does come with parking which was great but you won‚Äôt need to move you car at all when you‚Äôre staying here bc it is such a walkable central area. 10/10 would recommend, hope to be back soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"OMG.. this place is a gem, right in the middle of all the Key West action. We didn't even rent a car when we were here; so much to do within walking distance. The private hot tub was super private, and the community pool was clean, refreshing and we were the only people using it. We could have spent several more days there and been very happy!
ps... the little Cuban restaurant on the corner was amazing for an affordable, delicious dinner!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very nice place to stay. Would come back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi‚Äôs place was cute and clean. It was an excellent location within walking distance to Duval. Also, right across the street from the bike rental, CVS and a coffee shop. The pool was really nice too with lounge chairs and a really nice collection of orchids."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time
Jesus was great as were the cleaning girls
The pool and jacuzzi were clean
I was glad for the washing machine and dryer
We had to place one of our luggage‚Äôs on top of two stools ( we both had carry ons ) we are in our 60‚Äùs and bending down to get into our bags was a bit tough after a day or two
Other then that we loved Harrison‚Äôs Hideaway and everything was as advertised"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect weekend hideaway in the heart of Key West nightlife
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our visit. The location was perfect. The foliage was beautiful. It was very clean and kitchen was stocked. The shower for two is a nice touch. Very small bathroom. Only thing keeping us from rating a 5 was the very small refrigerator (diff to set climate control) and storage for clothes. No big deal really because I was with two men. Three gals would have a problem. It‚Äôs a Perfect spot for a romantic getaway for TWO. We will def be back for one of the larger cottages. THANKS SO MUCH!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Close to everything! I would definitely come back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi was great! She was able to accommodate our stay based on our needs and was easy to communicate with. The place is perfect for a couple - it is small but functional with everything you need for a short stay. The hot tub is a major bonus. The location was ideal - walking distance to just about everywhere in Key West. If you're looking for a short romantic getaway to Key West, Harrison's Hideaway is worth booking!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Naomi's place, Harrison's Hideaway, was super cute, convenient and very clean!!! Very walkable and the hot tub was a nice bonus! Had everything we needed for our quick getaway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Naomi is an excellent host! Everything was very clean. We especially appreciated the fenced in Patio with private Jacuzzi. The air conditioning worked really well and kept us comfortable even during the hot days. The location is amazing right near the corner of Duval Street. I also likes that the management company was very helpful when we interacted with them. On one occasion, they offered to move a Work truck so that we could park. One thing I would keep in mind is that it is not a full height refrigerator. It didn‚Äôt bother us very much because we didn‚Äôt need to store a lot of drinks, but I can imagine if you‚Äôre a reveler, you may want more space for beer. If you want to be close to Duval Street, where all the action is, this is a nice cozy place for a couple to stay. Thank you very much Naomi."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Super clean and the bed was so comfy. It was super easy to get around to all the great Historic area spots!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay at the Harrison Hide away! It was just perfect and exactly what my husband and I were looking for. Nestled behind Duval street you would think it would be loud at night but it wasn't. Everything was so comfortable and convenient. House keeping was always there if you needed anything... they were all so warm and friendly. Not one glitch ... Naomi has everything down pat.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Naomis. Harrison‚Äôs hideaway was exactly as pictured. The location is quiet but very walkable to all you‚Äôd want to do. Jesus was great, he had a parking space ready for us when we got there and gave us some recommendations. Beautiful weather certainly helped too."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, perfectly clean and with all the amenities you could need. Beautiful exterior and cozy and welcoming inside. Naomi is super responsive and the whole staff is great. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing! It was beyond perfect and I would recommend to anyone. Great location, beautiful space, nothing less than perfect for us."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Omg this was the absolute cutest place! Super private and cozy with every amenity you could need. Naomi was a great host and I can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi was an excellent host. Harrison's Hideaway was great for the two of us, just the right size in an easily accessible location. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous time. Perfect location. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Easy check in and check out. Perfect location. Private. Has everything you need. Kind staff. A dream!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my 6th time going to key west and this home has been by far my favorite. Nice pool and hot tub. Accessible to duval st but also far enough away to not here the noise. Loved the little Beetles touches in the decor. Highly Recommended. Very comfy bed
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was perfect for walking around to local attractions. The hot tub was amazing to use at night after a long day, and in the morning to get the back flexible. The bed was perfect! No squeaking, comfortable, when either of us moved the other couldn‚Äôt tell. Having a kitchen and small fridge was fabulous. Cleaning crew came each day around Noon. All in all, a great place to stay in the heart of Key West, but off the beaten path enough to be away from too much noise."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely come back. Everything was just perfect. Very clean. Great location, very quiet but only one block from Duval Street. Jacuzzi and the swimming pool were also very clean and you could relax after long walks. I travel a lot and I‚Äôve seen lots of nice places but Naomi‚Äôs place is one of my favorite. Great communication with the host!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was perfect. Great location and wonderful maintenance and housekeeping staff. When we come back to Key West this will be our first choice.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning views from the moment you open the door. The condo was clean, well stocked and comfortable. Great bed, pillows and shower.
The landscaping was beautiful. The pools were clean and welcoming. Some maintenance going on but they tried to be discrete.
It was nice having a washer/dryer in the unit.
Very minor quibbles: Some of the stove dials are worn, so using the stovetop was a tricky at first. The tv picture wasn't great, but we only used it to watch a playoff game. Who needs tv when you have a balcony with those views and a front row seat to listen to the waves. We figured out the sunrise view is better from the pool area. Sunset was better from the other side of the island.
There's a bike path just outside the gate which made it easy to explore. Uber was always 1-2 minutes away and about $13 to get to Mallory Sqaure.
Initially, I was unsure if I would regret not staying closer to the action but this was the perfect, peaceful retreat and I would not hesitate to come back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, super quiet. I recommend renting a bicycle because Eve tho g is about 1 mile away. Amazing price and place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenna‚Äôs listing is beautiful & she‚Äôs easy to communicate with!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our first trip to Key West and we feel lucky we got to stay in this beautiful condo. Everything the reviews say about this place are spot on. Our favorite things were the views (that balcony!), the two heated pools (one is great for lap swimming or sunning, the other is as warm as a hot tub or a therapy pool), the extremely peaceful, private environment, and the little touches that add comfort (like the throw blankets). We like to be active on vacation, so we really appreciated the workout room, pool, and ease of walking from the condo to all the main sites of Key West. The space felt like a refuge after a day out exploring, or like a spa if we wanted to stay in. Wonderful property!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jenna‚Äôs place was beautiful and very updated! The ocean view off of the huge terrace is breathtaking. Location is convenient to the airport and the main downtown area. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Key West!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our last family vacation for a while. And after a hectic holiday season it was just what we needed. Beautiful and relaxing. Easy to get around to everything. We had a golf cart but enjoyed biking and walking instead. Quiet and safe. Beautiful views every morning and evening. Enjoyed cooking in the kitchen. Using gym and pool. And walking to pier to fish. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The waterfront property was fabulous and Jenna was an amazing host with great communication.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PLACE YOU COULD EVER STAY IN YHE KEYS. CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT , RESTAURANTS, QUIETEST LOCATION . DEFINITELY REBOOKING"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was absolutely beautiful. Could not have asked for better, everything was clean, well taken care of and maintained. Jenna explained everything in detail for our checkin, stay, and checkout. I accidentally locked us out with my phone with all of our info inside and she answered the first try from my boyfriends phone number and helped me get back in. Hands down one of the nicest places I‚Äôve stayed in FL, I would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, sons and DIL stayed here in 2020 and raved about it. For my wife‚Äôs birthday, we all planned a trip back. It was just as they described. The view was incredible, the place was modern and well appointed. We enjoyed the pool after days on the beach. It was perfect. Jenn was very responsive throughout the whole process. We hope to return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stunning condo! Great views, beautiful interior, and quiet complex. It‚Äôs not in the busyness of Duval St. so it‚Äôs a nice place to come back to relax. We would definitely rent here again if given the opportunity."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing hidden gem and look forward to staying here next time we come to the Keys
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home and its location was the highlight of our stay in Key West. Quiet, serene, comfortable. It had everything we could possibly need. Bathrooms were great. Incredibly closet space, so we were able to unpack and truly feel at home. The beds and pillows were comfortable. (The master bedroom has a black out shade, but the second room does not and lets a lot of light in - prepare accordingly!) The living room had comfy seating and the smart tv had all the options you could want. The patio was just perfection with the most wonderful view. We loved the proximity to the condo pool and used it daily. It was never too loud. We were able to park the golf cart we rented in the covered garage and drive anywhere we needed to go. But walking or riding a bike is also totally possible. Possibly my favorite vacation home I've ever stayed in."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything was amazing
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jenna‚Äôs place was beautiful and exactly what we were looking for‚Äîthe view was better than pictured and the location was perfect for a relaxing stay! Additionally, Jenna was a fantastic host! 10/10 will be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice condo. Had everything we needed. The pool area was terrific. We rented a golf cart for transportation and felt that was the best option. Bike would be fine for younger guest but it‚Äôs a mile or two to most locations.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenna is a great hostess, the place is spacious, very clean, in a perfect and private location, and has a very beautiful ocean view. Never used the car, it was fun to be able to bike everywhere. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a condo that faced the water and had the option to have coffee and relax there. Jenna‚Äôs place more than met our expectations- the deck is incredible, spacious, and amazing. It was protected from sun and wind and had sunrise views! The rest of the condo is exactly as described and luxurious - we planned to cook some meals and the kitchen could not have been better and fully appointed. Jenna was extremely helpful and responsive. Would highly recommend this condo."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was an amazing place to stay. It‚Äôs very expensive and draining to eat out every meal; so we drove to store and stocked up on food and ate at the condo. Everything we needed for cooking was there. We bought alcohol and ended every evening out on the patio drinking. Beds were very comfortable. Showers were refreshing after a long day of walking. Liked having parking in garage spot. We cooked steak on grill and everything was so clean. If we ever go back, I would stay at Jenna‚Äôs."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I would love to stay here again. Thank you for making our experience an amazing one!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved this condo. It was beautiful and immaculately clean.
Jenna was an awesome host and responded immediately to any questions. The location was perfect with gorgeous views overlooking the ocean and pool.
There was only one problem. We didn‚Äôt want to leave!!!!
We will definitely be back! Thank You so much!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Awesome
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The pictures just don‚Äôt do it justice !! Breathtaking the moment you walk in! Definitely a must stay !! Literally within 5-8 minutes of everything! The beds were so comfy! We absolutely love the kitchen set up and bathrooms !! The patio is so peaceful !! Thank you so much Jenna !! We loved your place !!
Jeff & Tracie"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Jenna‚Äôs place! Beautiful condo with a beautiful view. The pools were clean and everyone we talked to there was friendly. Just far enough away from the excitement of Duval street, but close enough for a quick scooter ride."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most splendid place you can stay at.
Thoughtful little details and warm touches make your stay cozy.
Ice cold a/c, convenient parking, ultimate view, comfortable bedding, fast wifi, made our stay enjoyable.
The location is close to a gentle swimmable beach! Highly recommended. The superhost was helpful in accommodating my requests. Cannot be any happier- thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our fourth time staying at the condo in five years. It was great, as always. The condo is clean, nicely appointed, and comfortable. It has great views of the ocean from the living room and primary bedroom, and a huge balcony. Located in a secure and quiet area, and only minutes to town on a moped or bike. Fast, reliable wi-fi and smart TV with cable. Newly renovated pool area. Clean fitness center has an ocean view and is equipped with two treadmills, one ellipitical, stationary bike, free weights and cable machine. Jenna is always friendly, helpful and responsive. Always a pleasure."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jenna is a fantastic host and the property looks just like it does in the photos. This is a very beautiful condo, with updated finishes and a fantastic ocean view from almost every room. Covered balcony was a lot larger than we expected and overlooks the pool. There were a lot of unexpected extras provided like pool towels and beach toys that were super nice and made our trip even better. You will have everything you need to make this your home away from home. Check in instructions are extremely detailed and easy to follow, and we really appreciated the free covered parking."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing space. The view as soon as you walk through the door is breathtaking! The layout of the condo is airy and spacious and well decorated. Comfy beds, amazing kitchen and large deck overlooking the Atlantic.
Location was great as well. Away from the craziness but close enough to reach everything easily.
The only downfall, and not Jenna‚Äôs fault, is that there was a heavy accumulation of sea grass on the shores outside the cabin. It washes up and dies, creating a really bad smell.
Overall would highly recommend"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenna always responded quickly! There was a nice pool area and lots to do close by. Beach access in walking distance. Key West is a great place to visit since everything is close and near by.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was clean, open, and had a welcoming environment. Jenna was easy to communicate with and all instructions were clear. I would consider staying here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was just simply amazing!!! Beautiful inside and out. We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to enjoy boat excursions, shopping, and eats. Rent a car for certain, garage is a bonus. Place is secure. Pool is nice, but missed having a hot tub. Loved the large covered deck to enjoy views of the Atlantic, bug spray was provided and needed. There are no spices; if you are a cook, prepare accordingly. The large washer and dryer allows you to pack light. Bring lots of 50 block sun screen. The condo is clean with nice showers, and plenty of linens. We enjoyed our stay to Key West made extra special with this wonderful retreat after a day of play."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We absolutely loved staying at this condo! It was far away from all the tourists and noise of Duval St. You can wake up every morning and take a walk on the beach which is empty most of the time due to a dead end further down from the condo. The condo is just like the pictures. Jenny is super responsive and accommodating.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo is spacious and has a great view of the ocean. We enjoyed eating dinner on the patio every night and waking up to the sun coming up over the water.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful condo. The location is right on the ocean. Views are spectacular!! Condo has everything you need. Very comfortable bedding. We rented bikes & pretty much bikes all over Key West. Also rented Kayaks & paddle boards & enjoyed a number of hours paddling right in front of the condo area. Jenna was a wonderful host, we hope to return & rent this condo again in the future."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a dynamic place to stay, close to the center of the activities, then this is it. The views from the condo are straight out of a movie. I would also like to add that it is very easy to Uber around and we never waited more than 2 minutes for a pick-up."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Paradise! Wonderful location.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say much more than has already been stated. The condo is as advertised. We had two couples and were very comfortable at the condo and enjoyed our stay. This is a first-floor condo withing steps to a small sandy beach and the pool area. The beach area is a bit rocky, but from what i experienced, most of the Key beaches are that way. We had a rental car and found not issue driving into town and finding a parking place even on New Year's Eve. The location is nice since it's a short drive into town, yet far enough away to enjoy some quiet time. I would highly recommend staying at this location.
Jenna was a great host providing ample communication and quick responses."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great view and great condo!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Super comfy condo with great view of the Atlantic! Check-in and out was effortless. Will definitely stay here again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,WOW!! Jenna‚Äôs place is amazing! You will not be disappointed. Gorgeous views of the sunrise and sunset. Loved that we were so close to the pool and ocean. In walking distance to the pier and a great restaurant on the beach. Jenna was quick to respond and helpful with all of my inquiries. We would stay here again in heartbeat.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. The ocean view from the balcony is top notch. Far enough away from Duval so that you can relax, but close enough that you're not far from the party. Pictures match the space perfectly. Had some scaffolding up behind the unit because the complex was doing some work on the roof, but even with that still a beautiful ocean view. Jenna gave us fair warning about the scaffolding blocking a little of our view and the option to cancel, but we YOLO'd and we're glad we did."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great condo in a great location. About a 45min walk to downtown but very doable. Host has bikes to rent if needed. Has everything you need for a nice vacation. We did not use the pool but they were cleaning it every day and it was not crowded. Can‚Äôt beat the view. Will stay there again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place to stay, quiet but close to all the attractions. It was a great place to stay, would definitely visit again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Accommodations were exactly expected.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jenna‚Äôs place. She was so welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Whenever we had questions or needed suggestions for places to eat, Jenna was so quick to help!
The condo is beautiful, spacious, and quiet! We enjoyed having the pool and unobstructed water views! Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I have stayed here several times, and it is now our go-to place in Key West. Good location just minutes from the center of town but not in the middle of all the noise and crowds. Large deck to enjoy the amazing view of the water. Upgraded amenities, comfortable bed and very clean."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start? This was my first Airbnb experience and Wow! What an amazing experience. The condo looks just as good , if not better, than the pictures. Jenna was amazing. She reached out before during and after our trip! We will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great condo. The pictures don‚Äôt do it or the view justice. We would stay again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The views of the ocean from the deck are postcard-perfect. We had the pool area to ourselves most of the time, and were able to walk right out onto the sandbar. Very close to everything we wanted to do whether by foot, bike, or car. Jenna provides quick and clear communication, and we are so happy with our stay in Key West!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location on the ocean. The views are amazing and the balcony is large and was awesome to sit and watch the sunrise or look at the stars at night. The area was quiet and the pool is right near by and was not busy our entire stay. The condo is as it looks in the pictures and felt very private. Would definitely stay again!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is gorgeous and has amazing views. It's located on a quieter part of the island, which was a welcomed oasis after a day on the Duval crawl."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The condo was very clean and spacious, with beautiful views of the water. The complex was fairly quiet and well-maintained. Definitely would recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious waterfront condo. Although it‚Äôs a first floor unit, the garage is under the condo, so you have a nice elevated view of the water. The beach is a bit rocky, but once you get past a few feet of rocks, you have beautiful sand and clear water (unless there is seaweed out). It‚Äôs a great condo for two couples because the bedrooms and adjoining bathrooms are separated by the living space. And the master bedroom has a beautiful ocean view. The inside of the condo looks exactly like the photos posted online. The pool was very quiet while we were there and very clean and clear. Really positive experience, overall!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If anything I would say that the description of this condo is understated. Everything about the condo is so wonderful. The view is exactly what it looks like in the pics, Simply beautiful. So close to the action but yet far enough away to where it is nice and quiet and peaceful on the beach at the condo and at the complex. Stay here and you will not regret it. My wife and I came down for our wedding and we was not disappointed about one thing other than we had to come back to Oklahoma. We will defiantly stay here if and when we go back to Key West."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great condo ! Loved waking up to the ocean view! And also having the pool as an option.Condo was spacious and has everything you need! Checking in and out with Jenna was quick and easy. Would definitely love to stay here again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jenna‚Äôs place was very clean and exactly as described. We loved having the gulf lap gently twenty feet away from the large, comfortable balcony. We enjoyed being so close to the White St pier, the premier spot for watching the sunrise, and an easy walk to the beautiful botanical garden at the Martello tower. The quiet location on the water was perfect for us, and within a short drive or bike ride to the bustle of downtown. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome location, we have never been so close to the ocean. Beautiful view from the balcony. Very close to the pool also. The condo is wonderful and has amazing amenities. Very clean and had everything we needed during our wedding week. Jenna was also very helpful and answered any questions we had. When we come back to Key West we will definitely stay here again. Would 100% recommend."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful! Very spacious, great amenities, located close to the pool which is nice, close to all the things to do and places to eat, and the views are incredible!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jennas condo is laid out in a very comfortable floor plan. The kitchen is very nicely updated and the huge island and counter areas make it feel like more than enough space even for our group of 5. The kitchen flows into the family/dining area which also extends out to the large patio providing plenty of hang out space for a group. The ocean view out the patio/master/family room is heavenly. The sound of the waves all week was the most relaxing background noise. The bedding and mattresses were very comfortable and the closet and drawer space is more than enough for a group of 5. The condo is next to a very nice private pool that is quiet and easily accessible. The beach was a short bike ride down Atlantic where we rode daily to rent our chairs and umbrella, parasail, paddle board, etc. We never had a bad meal during our stay. The Prime steakhouse, Moondog Cafe, and New York Pasta co were some of our favorites. Check in and out were so easy and all directions were clear and well communicated. We cant think of a thing we would recommend changing! It was an amazing week in Key West and the weather was perfection to boot!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stunning views! Pictures were not deceiving. Generally my husband and I go out a lot, but the porch was so perfect, we found ourselves staying in and enjoying the place. Definitely would come back and recommend to friends."
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is amazing place and location. Breathtaking views of Atlantic. You can see sunrise from balcony. We loved the pool and beach. I would go back.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, near beaches and a quieter side of key west. Highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After visiting key west many times per year (both for business and pleasure) I can say that Jenna‚Äôs place will be my go-to for all future accommodations in the area! Convenient to the airport, a short walk down to Duval or any other local restaurant/grocery, as well as the Atlantic waters! It was the perfect place for balancing work (great wifi and a quiet place) with some R&R as I practiced daily meditation watching the sun rise every morning from the balcony. As a host, Jenna was quick to respond and accommodating to our requests. She provided a simple and easy check in! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place for a getaway to Key West. Jenna was truly a ""Superhost"" with great communication. Her condo is wonderfully laid out, spacious, and immaculate. The views are unbeatable, and having a beach just steps from your bedroom is amazing. Can't wait to return!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just fabulous! Every day I told my family ""I'm never leaving here."" The view is absolutely stunning and the gentle sound of the ocean waves is intoxicating. The unit is as clean and beautiful as it looks in the photos - and that shower in the main bathroom is over the top! We really enjoyed the overall property, too. Very quiet. The pool area is perfecto and we had it completely to ourselves most days. Sparkling clean and heated and right on the ocean! I cannot wait to go back!"
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a Key West getaway. It‚Äôs steps from the water, providing amazing ocean views and sounds. Very soft beds. It‚Äôs a quick bike ride away from crowded streets and restaurants but otherwise quiet beachside with big comfy terrace. Not too many kitchen accessories but who wants to cook with so many great restaurants around! Among the favorites are One Duval and Seven Fish for dinner, Green Pineapple fantastic coffee and snacks."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and view
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location and accommodations...would recommend to anyone.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed here for the week before Thanksgiving. It is a spacious and nicely Decorated condominium. Spacious elegant kitchen, very nice living room with comfortable couches and throw blankets, and a comfortable master bed. It overlooks the ocean but we had to walk ten minutes down the sidewalk to get to the beach. There was almost no one in the pool area. So while it was very private. One wall was all mirror so it made a spacious feel even more spacious. It felt very safe there.
Favorite lunch restaurants were the lobster shack, and there‚Äôs a place on the beach about a 15 minute walk from the condo that had great Stone crab claws and and a fresh raw tuna salad that were delicious. Can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name, but it starts with an S.
Our very favorite dinner place was Prime Steakhouse. We ended up going there twice and had probably the best bone in filets that we have ever had and we are international and world travelers. Also good were Louie‚Äôs backyard and A
and B lobster House."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenna's condo is beautiful and has amazing views of the water from the balcony! Jenna was very responsive and helpful. This condo is a great place for a peaceful and fun vacation!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view and spacious condo! We had the most wonderful stay! It‚Äôs close to all the must visit key west spots but far enough from the Duval street‚Äôs loud music and chaos. We will def come back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with a great view!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Even better than described. Perfect home base for our key west exploration. Can access the entire island via bicycle from this place!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is spacious, well appointed and updated, and is super clean. It is located a bit off the beaten path, but a very short drive from Duval. The beds are very comfortable. It has a very nice, roomy balcony with an unobstructed view of the ocean. We didn‚Äôt use the pool, and the fitness center was closed due to an impending storm, so can‚Äôt comment on those amenities."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I recently visited Key West and stayed in Jennas Airbnb and it definitely did not disappoint. This is such a beautiful property right on the beach with a pool located right next to it that was empty pretty much the entire time we were there. The patio was our favorite part where we spent most of our time watching the sunset on the ocean . The master bedroom leads out to the patio which was also amazing to wake up to the ocean everyday!
The location of this property could not be more convenient. It was approximately 2 miles away from the airport and very easy to get to. The property is secured with a gate which was nice made us feel safe inside of the property.
The condo inside feels very high end with an amazing kitchen! We felt at home for the 10 days we were there and she is very responsive even let us extend our stay! We would highly recommend anyone wanting to visit Key West to stay here!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous. The panoramic view of the ocean from the huge balcony is breathtaking. The condo is sparkling clean, with plenty of cooking and party glasses. The pool area is a great area to hang out after a day at the beach and grill out."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenna‚Äôs place is very comfortable and a great space. We enjoyed the view from our balcony very much and would absolutely stay there again!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!! Waking up each morning to the sound of the Ocean was the best! The kitchen was well stocked with all of the essentials, the showers were spa-like and the bed was insane! If I could‚Äôve fit the bed in my suitcase I would‚Äôve took it back home with me! Lol. Do yourself a favor and book Jenna‚Äôs condo, you will not be disappointed."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view was spectacular as was the accommodations and location. My family and I were very pleased to say the least and Jenna was very attentive making sure everything went as expected. Great vacation!
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spectacular amenities and a million dollar ocean view were among two of the great features of Jennas condo. She was quick to respond to questions. Felt very comfortable for this family of five. Comfortable beds and furniture, beautiful, modern kitchen, great condo pool and tennis courts. Would stay again in a heart beat!!"
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to see the ocean then you can not beat this place. It‚Äôs a large apartment with two very good sized bedrooms. It‚Äôs a gated community and the pools are wonderful as well as the views.
We had no major problems. There were a few issues with lighting, but Jenna worked quickly to fix the main ones. Overall, we thought it was a great stay and would recommend."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just returned from a 6 day vacation in Key West. Jenna's condo was even better than pictured! The modern, open design was perfect for 2 couples. The 2.5 bathrooms were great to have and quite luxurious. The absolute best feature was the ocean view!! The layout of the condo allows a spectacular view from almost every room. The large balcony is a great place to enjoy morning coffee or drinks- the sea gulls and pelicans provided great entertainment, and it was all so relaxing.
The location of the condo was very nice if you don't want the hustle and bustle of downtown. There is a great pier, a small beach and beautiful tropical gardens set in ruins from a civil war tower within an easy walk. Downtown is a quick Uber ride.
Jenna was very responsive to a small plumbing problem that we encountered and was a gracious host. The directions for check-in and out were very clear and couldn't have been easier. We highly recommend this condo!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Jenna. Your place was clean, organized and perfect for a vacation."

Best place we‚Äôve stayed in Key West by far.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location. Generous space and spectacular jenna service
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice. It was totally awesome and well worth the price. We never started the car until we left, three of us road our bikes everywhere (nothing is more than 1.5 miles away), and the third (lazy) person rented a scooter, (he said it was a blast). The amenities are very convenient and well kept. I highly recommend it to any one."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home has great amenities. Such beautiful updates in this home. And you can beat watching the sunrise every morning from the large balcony !
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This unit is beautiful.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenna‚Äôs condo is gorgeous. It has unbeatable views of the ocean from the master bedroom and open living/dining/kitchen area. It is immaculately clean, well appointed and has all the necessities including silverware, dishes, bottle openers, etc. She even had a chest full of books if you‚Äôre looking to chill out on the porch or by the pool.
The king bed in the master was very comfortable, and the sheets were super soft. She even had different types of pillows for us to choose from.
A parking space was provided, which was very convenient to either the elevator or the stairs to the condo. The pool and bbq area is right next to the condo. We were worried it may get loud, but it never did. The fitness center was small but had a tv and all the machines one would need for a good workout, whether it be cardio or weight training. It also faced the ocean - a great view always makes a workout better. It would be crowded if there were more than 2 people though. I was the only one there every time I went.
Overall, we had an excellent experience staying at Jenna‚Äôs condo. She was communicative, highly responsive and accessible. We will try to book her condo from now on when we‚Äôre in Key West. Every time."

The pool is also great and very close and easy to get to. The place was very clean and updated with anything you may need. If you may need anything Jenna responds within minutes and is always helpful. The location is great and gives you the option to stay in a quiet area and visit all the nightlife just a mile away. We would definitely stay here again!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Condo was one of the best parts of our trip. Jenna was friendly and helpful getting the stay set up. Very nice clean place. Downtown Key West in general was not super kid friendly but we did okay in July.

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great apartment. The view is absolutely stunning and the two beaches close to the apartments were really nice.

2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay in Key West! It was quiet and relaxing with great amenities of two pools and access to the fitness center. There was a parking space but we didn‚Äôt rent a car, just bikes so no need for it. The condo itself is well equipped and modern. The beds, especially the master bed, was so comfortable-I wanted to take it home with me! The location right on the running/biking/walking path was great for both exercise (I ran every morning and my dad and husband took bike rides) and for quick access to Duval street, bars, restaurants, and pretty much anything else. Jenna was very communicative and helpful and was really easy to work with. I will definitely rent this place again if in key west!"

Jenna was very pleasant to work with. Highly recommended."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing, loved the kitchen supplies, the furniture, the best view and so quiet and peaceful....right on the bike trail....10 out of 10! Would stay there every time."

The balcony of John's apartment was golden in the morning for the coffee:)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A must stay in Key West! The host was very helpful and the property was beautiful and had a ton of amenities and within walking distance to all of the local businesses and attractions.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at John‚Äôs condo. We traveled with our little kids, and the home was set up perfect. Located on second floor so we opted to just keep the stroller in the car. His place is super clean, ample towels, bed sheets clean, two balconies which is amazing, almost brand new washer / dryer, and all the necessities for the kitchen. We walked to Duval St every night, very short walk. We even walked down to Mallory Square. Located walking distance to a splash park for the kids, which was fun breaking up with the pool. Fort Zachary beach very close too, but prob worth the drive. Pictures are just as the condo looks. Thank you for a great day! Would stay again and recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our first trip to Key West. John's place was everything that we needed. Super convenient location, felt safe the entire time and had access to everything we needed to have an awesome vacation."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Highly recommend. Only two blocks from Duval. Truman Annex and Shipyard have been the place I have stayed for the past six years.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John's place was perfect for our family of four! It was an exceptionally clean and comfortable home, with a superb location close to all of the things! Could not have asked for more from our stay. Can't wait to come back to Key West!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is perfect with an easy walk through a beautiful neighborhood to a park, to see a sunset, or go to the beach. The home is very clean and nicely decorated. The air conditioning is amazing. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John‚Äôs beautiful condo in the Truman Annex gated community was an absolute sanctuary for us and we felt right at home. The unit is squeaky clean with very comfortable furnishings and we loved the beach motif. We rented bikes the entire week and literally biked everywhere from John‚Äôs condo, the safe and quiet location could not have been any better! John‚Äôs recommendations for activities and restaurants were spot on as we enjoyed it all! The swimming pool was great too for our kids at the end of the day. The condo balconies were enjoyable and we even got to see the local iguanas eat from the trees! Everything was perfect! Thank you to John for being an amazing and knowledgeable host of the area! :)"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had such a wonderful time! It is in a great location for walking to many fun and iconic places. We felt very safe and super comfortable. This condo is perfect for 2 people and has everything you need. We use Airbnb often, and this was one of our best experiences. John is quick to respond, friendly, and has stocked his condo with all the essentials and more. Plus, he and his wife provide a list of local recommendations that are very helpful. I highly recommend it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. So happy with my booking. John was great, quick to respond with answers to any of my questions. Unit was clean, spacious, quiet and even had some of the ""essentials"" that other places I've stayed didnt provide (coffee, dishwasher soap, laundry soap, beach towels, shampoo, etc). Location was just a couple blocks from Duval street where its ""all happening"" which made for an easy walk, yet far enough not to be disturbed at night = perfect distance. I would definitely book again next time I am back in the Keys."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John and Joan are great hosts. They are very kind, responsive and hospitable. We really liked the location of the condo, walkable to evrhthing in Key West.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit. This home is quiet, but close to everything we wanted to do while in Key West. I suggest rending bikes and exploring and visiting the beach at Fort Zachary state park. We had a restful week on the island."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice sunny spot! We enjoyed John's really nice place, comfy beds, great complex, daily visit to the nice community pool! Yes, John's place is quite convenient to Duval Shops, Bars & Restaurants & several other restaurants that would pop up on our way to Duval. Be sure to visit Fort Zach Beach, it surely was close & a true pleasure. We chose to drive, since we had chairs, snorkel gear, etc. They also rent chairs & umbrellas there. Enjoy your stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Condo was a cute, clean and well furnished. Pictures reflected it well. So close to Duval St so we could walk everywhere. Well stocked with whatever you need. Was a pleasant and easy stay. The pool area was cute."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, our two kids and I had a fantastic stay at John‚Äôs place. The location was perfect! We were within walking distance to all of the main attractions, restaurants, stores and beaches. Parking was easy and convenient and easy to come and go if you need to drive anywhere although we mostly walked.

We really enjoyed the two porches! John is very friendly and quick to respond if you need anything. We would definitely stay here again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John's place was absolutely perfect for our stay. We were staying in Key West to go to a small wedding that was in a boutique hotel off of Duval, so location wise John's condo was perfect. We were able to rent bikes close by and had the best time walking and biking around the island. The location is so close to Zachary Taylor state park/beach that it made it perfect for a shorter vacation as we were able to get so many things done in one day, purely with biking and walking. Great place and a great stay. John was very communicative and responsive, but with his directions we had no trouble at all getting to the place. Highly recommend."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is beautiful, clean, and functional. The location is excellent - easy to walk to multiple beaches, restaurants, and all of the other fun things in Key West. We did a day trip to Dry Tortugas - 100% recommend it!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, only a short walk to Duval Street. The condo was lovely and located in a nice, gated community. John checked in several times to ensure our stay was going well. Would definitely stay again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful first time in Key West. The apartment was very situated and had everything we could have expected and more. Definitely lots of amenities. It was great to have our own parking spot and enjoy the tranquility of a gated community. Our kids really enjoyed the splash pad just a few steps away. Definitely great location.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place to really get away! A very secluded boat house with amazing views. The owners are very responsive and super friendly. This was an awesome out of the box experience!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don't hesitate to visit! Amazing experience.
Liam was super accommodating for our last minute trip, keeping in touch before we got there and then helping us to get a kayak rental sorted as well as giving us real freedom with our timings. Really friendly and lovely chap.
The boat is fantastic, a blissful place to be. It's been on the water a few years and has some signs of wear but they didn't detract from how awesome the feel of our stay was.
We hired a kayak and took a paddle through the mangroves and out towards the open water- well worth it!
Thanks so much Liam (and Troy!) for our night in the Keys- a totally unforgettable experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liam was an amazing host. He was very respectful and responsive when we had issues or concerns. He really saved us when an issue came up. I would stay at any of Liam‚Äôs rental properties.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was once in a lifetime experience, the kind you will tell your grandkids about. Beautiful views, very peaceful. I must say, I read all the reviews and honestly, everything is listed as it is in the description, you just have to read. For us it wasn't too hot and there weren't any bugs at night, so you can sleep with your windows open and enjoy the breeze, and there's also a small fan. You can charge your phones with USB cable, paper towel was provided, as well as bathroom tissue; there's a cooler so you can buy ice and have water and drinks there. I advice reading the description carefully and decide if it's for you or not.
Overall the experience was amazing for us, we really enjoyed it and will definitely recommend to come and have a great, unique weekend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very good host
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My grandma and I enjoyed this airbnb so much!
Liam picked us up on time, the airbnb was clean, as described and beautiful. This was one of the coolest experiences we have ever had & affordable. We stayed for two days & played cards, snorkeled and rented kayaks from kyak kings. There is also a mat to lay out in the water, which was a nice add on.
Keep in mind this is a boat, minimal outlets,a few bugs at night. This didn‚Äôt bother us however I think the negative reviews just did not read the detailed description or don‚Äôt camp.
I would recommend this airbnb to everyone! Don‚Äôt forget ice and some lunch meat(: We kayaked about 20 minutes to a cafe for lunch & saw nurse sharks, jelly fish, stone crabs & multiple fish. We sat out on the deck and played music for hours and watched the water/sunset & sunrise. I used my hotspot and brought my laptop for a movie at the end of the night. What a perfect getaway!
Checkout was a smooth easy process. Liam & his wife were kind and accomodating"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasure staying here, and the house boat was exactly as pictured. Liam was incredibly friendly and responsive, and his directions/description in the listing were very accurate. We got engaged at this property, which was incredibly exciting! Bring snorkel gear if you want to check out the marine life, and make sure to bring water! Looking forward to the next stay here."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a one of a kind stay that I truly believe everyone should do at least once. We were there in early May and although it only got down to 75 the night we stayed, it was still cool enough to sleep through the night with the windows open. It was very peaceful and I truly enjoyed my time out there. The hosts are both incredibly responsive and great people! Will be coming back"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful stay at paradise! Amazing hosts. Hope to come back again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The boat is awesome. All of the people leaving negative reviews clearly did NOT read the description and/or just don‚Äôt know how to handle being on a boat. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great experience with this Airbnb boat house , would definitely come back another time ,very peaceful and perfect for a couple getaway ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great experience. great weather! rhe most relaxing weekend ever!! definitely would rebook again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liam‚Äôs place was so peaceful and relaxing! We rented a kayak and came back and forth with it to the marinas. His description is precise, we loved it and would definitely come back again if we get lucky enough! Thank you Liam for an incredible and unexpected adventure!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this airbnb for a night when visiting the Keys. If you are looking for a peaceful, once in a lifetime experience, this is your spot!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs fantastic place for a romantic trip. Thank you for your hosting!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay and would definitely book again. We especially enjoyed having kayaks out there. The kayaking in the area was great, and we saw a few Eagle Rays right by the house boat and it was also a great spot for seeing birds."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time. Liam and his wife were responsive and helped us get some kayaks delivered to the boat. The picked us up on time and the instructions were good. Brought us out to the boat where are rented kayaks were already ready and waiting. We hung out and enjoyed the scenery and took the kayaks out for some of the evening. The next morning we had asked to be picked up at 8am and Liam was there exactly on time. We will be back. Thanks!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay on Liam's boat! Exactly as described. We kayaked into the mangroves and saw eagle rays and jellyfish. Thank you for the memories!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's obviously very cool and unique to stay on a houseboat, but there are better and easier options than this one in Key West. The day of our check in, the place we had to rent kayaks from was closed due to inclement weather, so there weren't other option provided and although the host brought us out, we were stranded out on the boat without a way back to land until the next day when the kayak rental guy ferried them out to us. The boat does not have warm water for a shower, no cooking possibilities, only a cooler for food but no ice was provided until requested on the second day. There wasn't enough TP, so that was also brought out to us later as an afterthought. No curtains on the boat so it's quite bright and hot in the morning, I'd bring a sleeping mask. It was in an area that is very quiet and peaceful at night, but in the morning a lot of jet skiiers go by and cause a lot of rocking. I would be very nervous to stay out here during a storm. Buyer beware."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Out of this world incredible experience‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre looking at these reviews you‚Äôre at least thinking about it so you gotta just do this !
Ran the idea by my girl (who absolutely detests camping!) for our last night in KW & was getting this kinda over water villa vibes.. i was trying to sell it, it just looked too wild an experience to pass on. She went for it, we filled one of those big styrofoam coolers packed FULL of ice, plus sushi, charcuterie & beers stuffed into every bag we were lugging with us to roll up with as much ice as possible. This was one of the absolute coolest experiences & a killer way to spend our last night. Just serenity floating about out there, skinny dipping, soaking in the sunset & then the sunrise on the opposite side at the break of dawn. It was so rad.
Bed was super comfortable, toilet an adventure, there‚Äôs USB ports (!) Leah & Liam were SUPER cool‚Ä¶ met at the marina & they zip you there & back on their little motor boat, also a nice cruise !
DO THIS !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Liam's house boat. It looks exactly like the pictures. The marine toilet took a bit getting used to and was a bit of a tight fit but otherwise incredible space. Water depth around boat was 5-6 feet. Gorgeous sunset and sunrise as well. Would recommend to a friend; a fun experience to say the least.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so cool. Like, tell my grandkids about. Unplug and experience life! Thank you, Liam! What a cool way to see key west!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,plan to bring glasses for your beverages and your plate food etc if you dine on the boat the sunset and sunrise was beautiful ü§ôüíô
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the highlight of our trip to the keys it was such a beautiful escape from reality
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here. Very different type of airbnb but very every penny. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a quiet night away and felt right at home, enjoying the beautiful view including the sunrise. Kayaks are available too and the location was perfect for a great day swimming, sunbathing and relaxing in a private environment. Restaurants are within kayaking distance. Both hosts (Liam and Leah) have been extremely welcoming and made our stay comfortable. Definitely highly recommend this place! We will definitely be staying here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was the best thing I could have done to immerse myself in the people and culture of Key West. It was an incredible experience and I would recommend to anyone this beautiful house boat!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check-in was smooth. Liam was very responsive. We just picked the wrong day, the weather was abysmal during the night. Lot of noise if it‚Äôs gonna be a heavy rain night. The place could be more clean, we felt, but overall, a unique experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was great, and very accommodating! Highly suggest"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liam was great and so was his boat!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I spent Valentine's Day on the floating boat and it was one of the most romantic things I could have planned and done, the only tip I would give is to take a charger with a car ashtray port"
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There is so much potential in Liam‚Äòs place. He was an excellent communicator, and gave great recommendations for renting kayaks, which I think is really essential, regardless, if you‚Äôre choosing to leave the premise. The place itself is really cute, yet simple. The location Has a beautiful sunset and great mangroves to explore nearby, but is also within viewing distance of the main thoroughfare, airport, and two boats that look shipwrecked in the water. The place also could‚Äôve used more thorough clean. Definitely an experience.!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great communication, amazing experience."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Liam‚Äôs houseboat anchored out in the water was such a lovely stay on our honeymoon trip! We loved the whole experience of taking a water taxi out to the houseboat and just laying in the sun all day. 10 out of 10 recommend!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The boat is peaceful, rustic, and exactly as described! Liam communicated well and was very responsive."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great experience for our honeymoon. Only minor complaint was figuring out the water taxi. It would help to have an ahead of time schedule for when someone will be available for the week of the guests stay just to make it easier to plan trips to shore.
This was definitely way better than booking a resort and would highly recommend. We went mid January so our weather wasn't the greatest for swimming, I did jump in once and had a hard time warming up the rest of the day. The sea life was still very present, plenty of sea turtles, fish, an otter i think, and our very last day had a manatee swim right under our boat.
Thank you Liam and team for our stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liam's houseboat was an excellent place to stay! It was a unique experience to sleep on the water, kayaking to and from the house boat. Liam was also a really helpful host: not only was he very responsive, but also he helped us set up a fishing charter during our stay. If we're ever back in Key West, we'd love to stay on his houseboat again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent. Well worth it
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,absolutely loved the experience! everything was great!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely a unique experience and wonderful to stay on the water. The house boat is adorable and was perfect for a night of hanging out under the stars, listening to music, and chilling out. Definitely bring supplies: in addition to food/drinks, bring dishes and cutlery. We rented kayaks, which was a great way to adventure around the mangroves."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This boat is amazing. It was exactly what we were looking for. Peace, quiet, relaxing! We rented the kayaks, paddled around at sunset and watched the dolphins swim by us. Even the storm that came through was great, some of the best sleep. Liam was helpful, very responsive, and had some great stories. We will definitely keep this spot on our return list."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liam was very responsive about any questions I had about my stay. Was very clear about items needed to make sure me and my wife enjoyed our experience. Definitely would recommend and looking forward to coming back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow this was an awesome experience. Liam so nice and flexible with our check in and out time. The place it self is to die! We‚Äôre in the middle of the water with great breeze ( best time to come is in December) . We would‚Äôve love to have a great swim but the water was too cold for our liking. I would definitely recommend this experience to couples as it‚Äôs a very inmate place to be. I can‚Äôt when to come back and stay here again.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The boat was a little smaller than expected but we enjoyed it. It was like camping, which we like to do. We brought kayaks and paddled around a bit and ended up paddling back through the mangroves in the morning which was fun! Liam was great about communicating and getting us out to the boat with our stuff. It‚Äôs definitely an experience -no frills but away from the crowds of Key West. There was a bit of airport noise when planes took off over us-fortunately they didn‚Äôt have many flights and none past 10:30ish. If you want to be away from the crowds and enjoy the ocean being your front door, this is the place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most incredible experiences ever! The houseboat was peaceful and private, and with lots of character. The breeze at night or early morning was unforgettable. We will be back for a longer stay. Thank you Liam!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This houseboat was a cute & romantic getaway! I spent one night with my boyfriend in December and it was the perfect to kick-off our Key West stay. We checked in around 4:30pm and were able to catch a stunning sunset on the water. The boat is located in a calm cove near the marina which is short dingy ride away. There are some other boats around but distant enough that you are unbothered and feel private. The bed was very comfortable & there are USB chargers.
I would recommend doing this in the winter months since there is no AC, but December was perfect bc of the breeze and cool temperatures. It looks exactly as advertised, if anything a tad bigger.
Some things to note: You have to bring all things you‚Äôll need (this includes drinking water, cups, plates, napkins, ice, shampoo, conditioner, etc.), Liam does have a cooler, hand soap, toilet paper, and a wine opener. I highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a romantic glamping adventure and are ok with a pump marine toilet situation!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful spot!
The morning sunrise & sunset are a must!
Its deff in my plans to visit again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice getaway from all the chaos but still close enough to join in on it! Thanks Liam, we had a great experience at ur cute tiny houseboat üòä"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I wish we could‚Äôve stayed an extra day.
Very calm at night, quiet.
You could hear the little waves hitting the boathouse which created a very peaceful environment.
If you want to stay there don‚Äôt expect a 5 star Four Season experience, it‚Äôs a boathouse not a presidential suite.
Just you and your partner in a boat all alone.
I definitely recommend to stay there if you are looking for a quiet night away from the chaotic city.
Thank you Liam."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow wow this was an amazing stay! The experience was just amazing. The views were breath taking sunset and sunrise panoramic views. Enjoyed swimming in the water and seeing fish! Highly recommend you will not regret it! Bring a usb charger as there are no outlets. There is lights on the boat and a cooler ! What a unique trip this was we loved it!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay was amazing.
2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Nice airbnb but the host kept us waiting an hour to check in and was a half hour late checking us out.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay .. highly recommend
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This experience was nothing short of amazing! For a tiny boat house it was spacious! Although closer to the road than we imagined it didn‚Äôt bother us at all during our stay! Captain Rory was fantastic as well, he even made an extra trip to bring us more ice."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liam and his brother Rory were nice guys and made sure we were taxied to the boat on time. They told us where to get liquor, ice, and dinner. IMO, you want to rent kayaks from Kayak Kings so that you can go to and from the boat as you please and also explore the mangroves, but if not, they‚Äôll ferry you back and forth for an extra $20 a ride. Call Kayak Kings to arrange a rental, park at the marina to meet Liam, bring your stuff to the boat with him and get settled, and then go back with him to shore. Drive to get the kayaks (park on the street there) and kayak back to the rental‚Äîall before sunset because it‚Äôs definitely harder in the dark when your kinda stoned lol. If you haven‚Äôt woken up only to see crystal blue water in every direction, what are you even doing dude? Do you really want to end your night in a hotel room watching Lovers Island? Nah. You want to sip chilled rum and listen to Chet Baker as you read your lover poetry under the stars on a floating island."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best and most unique Airbnb experiences we've had! Wish we'd stayed longer.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it was a super fun place to stay, very beautiful. if you're the kind of person that wants to get up early and see the sunrise over the Atlantic, and go to bed with the sunset over the gulf, then you should stay here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Liam was an awesome host! He made sure we were taken care of. We can‚Äôt recommend his little slice of paradise enough. We love snorkeling and being able to just wake up and jump off the boat was the best experience. I definitely recommend renting kayaks from kayak Kings to have over night so you can explore the mangroves nearby. We had a great experience and would do it again! Thank you Liam!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is nothing short of a slice of paradise. Why rent a hotel room when you can enjoy everything Key West offers and then retreat to a peaceful, private, and romantic luxury such as this?"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My and my man had an extremely great and peaceful time. It was absolutely beautiful we had absolutely no complaints. Liam was very responsive and extremely flexible with check-in and check-out time. We will be back several times over I miss it already!!!!!!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Liam was very responsive and the location of the houseboat was in a perfect location for a beautiful sunrise and sunset!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Liam was a great host and made sure we were happy the entire time. We would stay with Liam again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is definitely a slice of paradise.Crystal clear water,beautiful sun set and raise. Liem was very helpful and attentive.We will definitely be back"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Other reviews describe the place perfectly. It is primitive but private. We had a great time bringing our paddleboards and exploring. We brought snorkel gear as well but the water is shallow so we didn't end up using it. The place was very unique and fun. It was perfect for one night. Checking in and out was easy and Captain Connor was great!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The houseboat was very fun, and the water was beautiful. Check-in was easy, and Captain Rory is great."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a blast. Only recommendation would be to bring a girl that is cool. Not one that‚Äôs boring.
Besides my girlfriend. I personally had a blast. Thank god they have a awesome staff to get my boring girlfriend back and forth to the marina safe. I‚Äôm glad the marina had free parking and let her stay in the rental car for the night alone. Because, the water and music were spectacular without her there.
Highly recommend this place. No doubt."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool little spot on the water! Captain Rory was great and gave really good recommendations of the local spots to see!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our stay on the house boat. From start to finish, it was an amazing experience.
On check-in day, Capitan Rory was extremely communicative and helpful getting us to and from the boat (even making two trips since we had a lot of fishing gear!). The boat itself was tranquil. We went in early September and the water was warm and very clear. We came to the keys for fishing and were able to find many unique species just around the boat. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and with windows open and the fan there was a great breeze at night to keep us cool.
It‚Äôs about a 20-30 paddle ride to the marina we went to, but we enjoyed the ride in.
On check out day, Capitan Rory was right on time (evening offering us coffees) and offered to take back the kayaks for us. Seamless and easy check out.
Overall, amazing experience and we were thankful for Capitan Rory‚Äôs help, recommendations, and friendliness. We will 100% stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything is real!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,super cool spot! Quite the experience. it definitely not just a place to crash. unbelievable sunrise and sunset. surrounded by the relaxing water and sea creatures all around. the marina you meet at has tons of cool tours and a good restaurant. it was a great time. 5 stars would Definitely repeat.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We felt so blessed to experience this airbnb. Strongly recommend it. We are so happy with Liam‚Äôs guidance; he made everything clear, easy and it was a beautiful experience. The place was beyond gorgeous and we had a delightful, unforgettable time. We‚Äôll be booking with him again in the future for sure!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything worked out fine, they where so nice"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liam was so awesome. very helpful and very communicative!!! I highly recommend and will stay again if in the area!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liam was an amazing host and I‚Äôd highly recommend him to anyone coming down to the keys for a few days! We only stayed for one night, but we did a late check in at 7 and he was super responsive and had no problem with it. He also was able to do a little later check out the following morning. The boat was clean and the little bay the boat is anchored at is very smooth. It‚Äôs shallow enough to touch as well. It was super private, there‚Äôs one other boat around 50 yards away but we barely even saw them, and didn‚Äôt hear them either. It was seriously amazing. Thanks so much Liam! Will be sending the link for this airbnb to all my friends."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Liam was very nice and explained everything. It is important that you eat beforehand or take something there with you because you are only driven back and forth once.
Found the stay very nice and unique! Would do it again in any case."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed the stay, while the listing states that the house is private I found there are other houses near, while this is not a issue for me, it probably should be stated, I really enjoyed the time and found the surrounding neighborhoods to be nice! There should also be some other things listed in the property description such as no wall plugins to charge your phone, however there are usb plug ins provided. Check in was flawless and Liam and his wife went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time! With these little description changes I feel that this house boat will be perfectly described! Great views, great snorkeling, and overall a great stay! Thanks for the hospitality Liam!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Liam and his girlfriend were very friendly and always available!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Liam, he was very kind, he was good at explaining the specifications about the stay, the place was quite comfortable, there are two mini fans but we would remember to put in a drawer air or a large fan, since we were a little hotter on these summer dates, we couldn't use the bathroom because the people who rented it previously damaged, unfortunately we couldn't get into bathing in the sea because there was a lot of dirt on waste,but above all things nothing compares the view of the sunset and at sunrise, thank you very much Liam for welcoming us"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience. Good location in a peaceful area with beautiful surroundings. Short kayak ride to shore, restaurants, mangroves-- definitely want to rent a kayak. Gorgeous sunsets while relaxing on the deck! Like camping on the water.üòç"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came for our anniversary. Nice get away. Definitely worth it. Liam was great at responding when I messaged him. Hi girlfriend Leah was very helpful checking in. Felt safe. We brought our own water raft which I am glad we did. Just tied ourselves to the boat. Bring your snorkeling gear as you can see all the fish. Very comfortable bed . Slept like a baby. Very peaceful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our short stay on the little house boat. Saw fish, manatee and a sting ray. Looked just like the description and especially loved the outdoor shower."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really beautiful place. Perfect getaway for a relaxing, peaceful experience. Texture of sand and plants outside of the boat was more mushy than expected, recommend taking water shoes if you have some! We forgot our floats which would have been perfect for this experience. Great host, great vibes, will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was awesome!! The water was shallow enough to swim in, especially during low tide, and we saw plenty of cool fish and other life in the water. We kayaked around the area and hopped in at another spot as well and it was a nice break from the heat. I will say, this is Florida, in the summer, so it's hot and sticky. We slept fine at night, but it was definitely still hot and I took a nice dip in the morning. Bugs were not a problem at all. Only complaint I have is that it wasn't as secluded as shown in the pictures and wasn't in the location as shown in the pictures. It was right off of a channel that was infrequently used and there were a number of other houseboats surrounding us. They didn't necessarily disturb us and we still really enjoyed it and were able to have plenty of peace and quiet. Also, when we got to the marina, we didn't have very clear instructions on where to meet.
Thanks Liam and Leah!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! As long as you‚Äôre okay with ‚Äúglamping‚Äù its a perfect vacation spot!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liam was extremely resistive and helpful with every. Wonderful experience, tranquil and beautiful. Basic necessities for the night. Beautiful views. Boat was pleasant to sleep in and no motion was felt whatsoever. It‚Äôs bring your own everything so don‚Äôt forget the little things. Very special place. Would definitely come back"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfy bed and boat platform is very stable. Windows on side open and make it breezy and cozy to sleep. Sunset and sunrise from this location are AMAZING! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic experience, great communication we got a ride earlier than usual and it wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. very friendly. just make sure to bring supplies like food, water and ice. good to go, great experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liam was very responsive of all of my questions I had before checking in. The meet up was easy and he even helped me unload my car. We took a short boat ride to the boathouse where he gave a short tour and was on his way. This was my first solo vacation and it couldn‚Äôt have gone better. The neighboring boats had all nice people so that made me feel safe. The boat also has great sun exposure where you can watch the sunrise and set on each deck. The water is super clear and doesn‚Äôt really get past the depths where you can‚Äôt touch. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place if you‚Äôre looking to relax in peace.
Cons: you are pretty close to a active canal which makes the boat rock hard from the waves of the people riding by but the people watching makes up for it. üòÇ
Thanks Liam & GF"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best air bnb host I have ever had! was a lovely experience and I will for sure be booking this gem again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect weekend we had with hubby! Awesome spot! So grateful ü§ç
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my boyfriend and I loved this little spot. it was so cool to be on the water like that for a few days! Liam and Leah were very responsive whenever we needed anything, which was super helpful!
We got to use the new mattress they recently bought, and it was very comfortable to sleep on! i know there are some old reviews that mention it, but we had no problem on their bed (and we are not a small couple, lol)
the only headsup I would have is the lack of AC made it WARM to say the least.. even with a cloudy coverage and nice breeze, it was warm. Leah did ask us about that and mentioned theyre looking into ideas tho so they definitely care about providing options for guests.
also I didnt expect as many other house boats to be near by, everyone was respectfuland minded their own business but I did think wed be a little more secluded than we were, but like said no one really bothers anyone else youre just sharing the area with about 10 to 15 other boats.
But overall this was GREAT!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with a great experience. Beautiful sunsets and sunrises with a cool breeze! I would definitely recommend this to anyone just for the experience.
Liam was a great host too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the best experience for my husband and I for our impromptu honey moon. Liam was really helpful and friendly. It was a perfect getaway from the party scene of key west. Also we learned that if you don‚Äôt get a kayak or a paddle board you can make it to shore w just a small inflatable boat (at sandals for 29.99) and a paddle. Was worth every dime
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liam was super helpful, the place is gorgeous. Definitely have to bring the boat next time to travel around more, but it‚Äôs super peaceful and the scenery is great. You can swim around (water‚Äôs not too deep either). Just make sure to bring your own drinking water."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible experience, would recommend to anyone. Beautiful views. Brought our own boat and it was only about a 10 minute ride to the marina, which has great food. Water is super clear. We fished and snorkeled just about everyday. Loved the sound of the rain on the tin roof. I would recommend bringing a boat or kayak if you want the freedom to go on and off the boat to shore when you want. Only complaint would be the bed. Its not too comfortable but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be considering it‚Äôs a houseboat. The boat also rocks quite a bit when large boats pass by so be cautious if you get motion sickness easily. It didn‚Äôt bother us though. There was also another house boat nearby that seemed to be an Airbnb but it didn‚Äôt bother us at all because the boat rotates directions with the current so we still had good privacy. We hung out on the back of the boat the most and sun bathed on the large floating matt that was included. We had an amazing time. Such a unique experience. Book it!!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"An exceptionally beautiful accommodation. If you want to experience something else, this is definitely the place to be. Sunrise & Sunset are beautiful and unique.
We had the place for two nights and what is not quite clear from the description is that really only one way to check in and another trip back to checkout is included. Each additional trip is for money. Since we were there for two nights we assumed that several trips would be included for the money.
Furthermore, the mattress was unfortunately somewhat uncomfortable.
But all in all it was beautiful and we can only recommend the place for people looking for something special. jumping into the clear water in the üòç morning incredibly beautiful."
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Unfortunately we were very freaked out by the homeless people living on the abandoned boats nearby. Literally a swim away we‚Äôre multiple abandoned boats with shanty roofs and connecting ropes holding multiple vessels together. People had generators and transportation to these abandoned broken vessels. It was just creepy. As far as the actual Airbnb goes we enjoyed the boat but the bed was a piece of plywood over the motor with a mattress pad on it. If you rolled to the middle of the bed the outside would bow up so you had to keep your weight distributed on the bed. Checkin was pretty messy. We were told to meet at the parking lot of the marina without clear instructions so we just stood their waiting for Leah to get here. We had to carry all of our belongings for the two nights including a kayak through the muddy boat storage area where guys were carrying boats with fork lifts literally over our heads. It was just a messy checkin process.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The houseboat was even more beautiful than expected. We felt right at home. Of course you have to read the description. There are no kitchen utensils and kitchen. But we had everything with us and had a great day there. Only the bed could use a better mattress and a slatted base.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend the house boat! It was a rustic but comfortable experience (it had lights, USB charging, and hot water)!!! We enjoyed snorkeling right off the boat and even saw a couple of harmless nurse sharks and baby seargent majors!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fun time paddle boarding to the bars from the houseboat and back as we timed it with the tides so we were always going with the flow. Everything worked. Bring your own drinking water. There is an international airport and military base close by so there was intermittent plane noise but otherwise very peaceful and serene.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay at Liam‚Äôs. Beautiful nature of Key west can be explored by this way is amazing.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unfortunately circumstances didn't allow us to make it but Liam was very accommodating in trying to help us out and very fast to respond to messages.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely experience here. We rented a kayak so we could come and go from the boat; it is about a 20 minute paddle from hurricane Hole's dock but you want to be in pretty decent shape in case you need to fight a rough current. The stars were incredible and it was so quiet, peaceful and romantic. It is a tight space with no kitchen, so you really should think of it just like camping. We loved it!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Wild Time! Very Primitive but fun! Thanks, Liam!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying on the boat was a really unique experience. We loved it. Liam and Leah were really helpful, and responded quickly to every question we had. They were really punctual and accommodating.
The ride out to the boat was less than 10 minutes. Parking is completely free for 24h at the Hurricane Hole Marina, where Liam and Leah met us. (The restaurant there is delicious btw.) I saw some comments where people mentioned paying for a water taxi. We didn‚Äôt go on and off the boat much, but we didn‚Äôt pay for a taxi at any point.
The boat itself is as pictured in the photos. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs nice and everything works. Overall, it‚Äôs a pretty relaxing place to stay. There is solar power for charging devices, cell service, the shower has hot water and there is a cooler for storing food.
If you‚Äôre looking for a standard hotel room, you might want to look elsewhere, but if you‚Äôd like a unique experience, I highly recommend this place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an amazing/unique experience! More for people looking for a low-key, one of a kind, getaway stay. Liam and Leah were great hosts! 100% recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome quite place to get away, liam was great and always responded in a timely manner, only things is make sure you have a back up battery for your phone because there is minimal outlets because your on a floating house and bring some sort of transportation unless you want to pay for an water a
Taxi but liam will take you at least once a day free of charge"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great 2 night stay. Liam was extremely helpful and always quick to respond to questions. The boat house is adorable and very clean. You will need to take your own food/water, ice, toiletries, etc., but that was stated in the description. As long as you are aware that you will rely on someone else getting you off/on the boat, then you'll have a great time. I would definitely recommend staying here as it was a unique experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks so much Liam and Leah. It was quite the fun one night adventure!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!! definitely a unique experience. will come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was adorable and definitely was a memorable experience, Liam is very nice and friendly, but there was more people around than we expected to have which is ok, the only bad part was the mattress being paper thin, made quite hard to sleep at night, if we go back it would be good to have an air mattress or something like that. Very nice place overall, if you‚Äôre thinking about it just go, watching the sunrise and sunset there was magical"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect spot for our relaxing honeymoon weekend!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great and unique place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience. Wish we had stayed longer.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was one of the most beautiful and unique Airbnb experiences I have had to date! Liam is the absolute sweetest. Would book again!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely getaway near Key West. The boat was as pictured and as described. It was in a location where it was protected from the ocean. Just realize that also means close to land and other boats. The water was about 1.7 - 3 feet deep and was crystal clear. We enjoyed the peace the boat and location provided, as well as the beauty of the water and watching the sunset, moonrise, and sunrise.
The water taxi ride to the boat was lovely and was about 15 minutes. I recommend the host make it clear in the description whether you get a taxi ride there and back each day of your stay or only once each way for the whole stay. Although we really liked the water taxi captain, he proved to be unreliable and caused us to miss our flight home."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Just as described a clean fun getaway. Parking and scheduling a water taxi was a bit cumbersome and expensive and unclear but the boat was awesome.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I am definitely going to have to come back. Liam was a great host and picked us up when the water taxi wasn‚Äôt available. A piece of advice I‚Äôd give, though, is to plan any excursions way ahead of time to ensure you have transportation to and from the Airbnb (and to communicate those plans)."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renter be aware!! This is a beautiful and amazing place except for a few crucial details missing from the description. #1 you only get one ride in and one ride out. Period. Not per day. So you are effectively trapped, with no kitchen to make food or coffee. You can schedule extra water taxi rides for 27 per person per ride + tip. For two people, that was over $120 extra per day. #2 the water taxi ride is roughly a 30 minute ride each way (not 10-15). So it‚Äôs a bit of a commute- at least the ride was beautiful! #3 the water taxis end at 8 PM, so don‚Äôt plan on going out in Key West. #4 there are no utensils or drinking water on the boat. So be sure to plan ahead if you plan to drink, brush your teeth, or eat The water taxi said the last person who stayed there ate his takeout with his hands. You do get 3 cups, and a corkscrew/bottle opener. Other than these details it was lovely. It‚Äôs really prefect for one night, but it could be amazing for many nights if these wrinkles are ironed out."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely LOVED this experience!! Would definitely recommend as a honeymoon stay!! üôå we saw lots of wildlife in the water too! So cool!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liam's place is a great option for your stay. It's peaceful and a good value compared to other places in the area. The boat was as described, be sure to bring your own ice and water. We would have planned differently if we had more info up front but are still happy with the stay. Here are some tips based on my experience:
- Parking in KW is expensive and the pick up location isn't the same as the address listed in the posting. Be sure to confirm where you'll be picked up and expect to spend $30+ for overnight parking.
- There is a roundtrip water taxi ride included in the Airbnb payment but you will need to pay for another ride if you forget anything or want to go into town, the price quoted (which might change) was $27pp each way. The taxi crew was great!
- We looked into renting kayaks which would have been ideal but the local rental places charged $80pp+. If you have kayaks or can find a cheaper rental, I would recommend that -- it's easy to get to from Hurricane Hole"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The boat was beautiful and peaceful! Sleeping with the windows open was so soothing.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liam is a great guy and the boat is super cute. We had a wonderful night ‚ò∫Ô∏èüåÖ
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is as described, it is anchored off shore in a wide channel. If you are into camping or have a sense of adventure you will love this place, if you are a person that needs a ton of amenities you'll likely have a bad time.
Pro's:
Beautiful setting, crystal clear swimmable water.
No neighbors for 150ft.
No bugs, we slept with the windows open every night!
The boat has everything you need except for drinking water, don't forget to bring that.
Great responsive hosts that reply almost immediately.
Cons:
It was perfect for us but if you are expecting a boutique hotel you would probably be disappointed.
You must have the physical capability to board/unboard small watercraft, I wouldn't recommend to the obese or people with limited physical capability.
The mattress is thin like in a camper, was fine for us but if you need to sleep on a soft mattress you may want to bring an inflatable mattress to supplement.
We would stay again without question!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,At least a once in a lifetime ‚Äòmust do‚Äô!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Relaxing and unique way to experience Key West! The space is clean, well kept and simple but well thought out with great details. Liam was excellent to work with from booking through departure! Both he & his girlfriend cleared their schedules and transported us to and from the boat themselves when the water taxi wasn‚Äôt available for our stay. They are very knowledgeable and made sure we had everything we needed and explained how everything works on the boat. Just pack your sense of adventure and soak in the sunset!!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really cool little boat house! The place was clean and all amenities worked well and we had a very comfortable stay.
Some things to note:
- not quite as private as we had expected. There were other house boats moored ~40ft away and some kayakers going close by
- the taxi service that was arranged by the owner was an hour and a half late to pick us up in the morning
Overall it was a very cute little spot and we enjoyed our stay! Would recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host communicates very well.
Definitely different experiences! If you love simple life and get away for quite Appt, this is just right for you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was beautiful! Definitely great for just being in nature and wanting to get away. Great place for couples to go and honestly probably a great honeymoon experience as well.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best experiences I‚Äôve had in a while. Liam and the water taxi folk (brandy and Nick) were amazing .. highly recommend üòç
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You have found the perfect getaway in Key West. Seriously‚Ä¶STAY HERE. Peaceful, private, clean. Pat, our boat taxi guy, was super responsive and friendly and went above and beyond. Slept with all the windows open and was lulled to sleep by the gentle rocking of the boat. Some tips: take a photo of the parking kiosk number where you park. We decided to stay past 8am (free parking is midnight to 8am) and was nervous we were going to get ticketed. Luckily we did not, BUT if you have the kiosk number, you can add time electronically. Also, I overlooked the fact that there are not any regular US outlets on a boat ü§£ they have a USB to plug in phones but wasn‚Äôt able to do my hair post shower. Luckily the humidity and sea air made for a good beach wave. üôåüèª"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very different experience- it was the greatest and scariest (rain storm- windy) night. I really recommend it but you must be adventurous. Liam has a water taxi driver that will contact you about check-in. He was great and basically help us figure everything out.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what we wanted (maybe needed). A very different experience than typical AB$B but wonderful. So private, pretty. Water taxi to land was fun and not too expensive. Liam was great"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time . The house boat was all we had anticipated and comfortable .. a great experience . Liam is a wonderful host
and the water taxi crew we also used was terrific !"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful place to watch sunrise and sunset!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place for a romantic night with no electronics bothering. It was a beautiful experience and we loved it
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All was good staff was friendly room was clean and quiet
Pool area was chill and relaxing üòé"
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived on Sunday, check in was fine and only took a couple minutes but the elevator was broke so I had to carry all our bags up 4 flights of stairs. The elevator did not get repaired until Tue around noon. The room is smaller than an average hotel room, you walk in with the bed being directly in front of you, there‚Äôs a small mini fridge on the floor to the right and that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no microwave so bringing leftovers back was pointless. The maids closet with the washer and dryer is directly across from the room so your woken up to the sound of the door slamming shut very early and it happens all day long. This happened Monday and Tuesday. There was only one roll of tp in the room, when we needed more you have to use the app to communicate with the hotel, so we asked for more and over an hour later we got a response that said would you like for us to have a maid bring it up? By that point we had already left to go youse the restroom somewhere else. Overall we would not come back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly responsive and supportive host. I had trouble finding the lobby but our host waited for me outside the lobby talking to me over the phone and guided me all along until she saw my car. Place was very clean and easy to access. I definitely recommend this place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the place!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the price paid $700, I expected at least the cleaning of the room and at least one bottle of water as a courtesy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The entire experience was five stars. My booking was a last minute lucky find- so if it‚Äôs available, just say yes. It‚Äôs a resort- check out the nighttime kayak adventure in lit glass bottom boats, use the amazing concierge to make your stay unforgettable, eat at the restaurant, ask the awesome staff for help with recommendations, take the free shuttle! This place can‚Äôt be topped."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful and the staff was very nice!

The room is much bigger than pictured! Bed was extremely comfortable and pillows were too!!
We booked a sandbar cruise on site and it was the highlight of our trip!
Captain Ashleigh and John Wayne were by far some of the best employees I have ever seen!
We used the complimentary shuttle to downtown as well. Another great feature!!
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place!!! I will definitely be back!!!
Thank you for an amazing stay!!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay! Would stay again! Pool with bar was a nice touch as well :-)
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a nice location, a bit over priced. Was told after we had been there a few days that they did not clean out room unless we specifically asked. Since it didn't cost any more to clean it, not sure why they just didn't do it. Had problems with the fridge but they addressed it right away. Asked to have room cleaned but they must have forgotten. Had to ask again the next day. Overall, still a nice place to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at beachside. It felt like a beautiful resort for an Airbnb.
Can‚Äôt say anything negative because it met all of our needs and was close to everything. Their restaurant was better than the other restaurants we visited on key west. Highly recommend! We will be back."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near and walkable to everything. Host provided restaurant recommendations in walking distance. All were excellent.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The garden and pool was the main attraction of the rental it was not too far from where you want to be and Joe was always available!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had another lovely stay at Joe's Place. Joe and Geri are gracious hosts and I always enjoy chatting with them. Geri, Joe, or their designated hosts are responsive and available as needed while respecting privacy. The room and the deck/pool area is literally an oasis. As a solo traveler I always feel safe and enjoy the tranquility. Already looking forward to my next visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Joe‚Äôs place, easy walk to everything, I traveled in my open slingshot and felt safe to leave it parked on road , and had very nice conversations with Joe also!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This guest house was the perfect place to stay while I celebrated my birthday. The hosts were great: friendly, helpful, kind, etc. I plan to be back in Key West again within a couple months and will hopefully be able to stay there again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice authentic place with a beautiful garden. Perfectly located in walking distance from the center.
We enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs a private room with its own bathroom located behind the main house and below another room upstairs. No noise or disturbance was heard from either the main house or upstairs. The room had direct access to a pool and deck area. Nice little oasis.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thinking there would be a TV but No
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always love staying at Joes place. Far enough away that it‚Äôs private and quiet although close enough to have everything you want to do!!! Thanks again Joe
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was cozy and hidden. Felt separate from the house itself and was a nice getaway for a night!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot! The space is clean, quiet, and perfectly located for walking to everything. And you can't beat how lovely it is to sit by the pool in the morning with a cup of coffee or in the evening with dessert. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have visited Key West on many occasions, but we have never loved Key West as much as on this visit! Joe‚Äôs place provided a peaceful cool oasis. Kelsey, the on property host was also very helpfully, friendly and communicative.
We rode our bikes everywhere as this AIRBNB was perfectly located near beaches, fabulous restaurants and bars.
We stayed in Apt. 1 and had full access to the pool.; which I was in every moment that I had.
We look forward to visiting Joes home again one day soon.- we hope! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüèä"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I think that this is the 4th time I have stayed at Joe‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs perfect for a solo traveler like me. I will be coming back next year.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great space! Perfect place for a quiet couple's retreat.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Joe's place
The place is idyllic, very good garden
The room is quite small but very comfortable
We were very well hosted kelsey and the neighbors are lovely
Here's some info , this isn't a review, it's to best plan your stay
During our stay it rained it made life outside complicated because the fridge and coffee maker are outside
There are no dishes
I highly recommend"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay here. Everything was as described and as expected, no surprises. The room was neat and clean, and the pool/garden space right outside the bedroom door was amazingly peaceful and quiet for the middle of Key West.
The room felt private enough, but the pool/garden area is shared with the main house as well as a renter that lives upstairs. We had no problems or inconveniences, just don't expect privacy except in your room."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe was an absolutely amazing host! Very welcoming and helpful.
The place was as described and had everything we needed in the days we stayed there.
I recommend Joe with all my heart! Here you won't be scammed or disappointed.
THANK YOU for borrowing your lovely home and hospitality.
Best wishes,
Jacob & Christine"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, clean and peaceful. Very walkable to all the great spots of KW! We will be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"- Very comfortable bed, quiet location, perfect for sleeping
- Incredibly clean
- Room is small but has a lovely private pool and outdoor garden space which served us well as our sitting area
- A 3 block walk to the free Duval Loop bus providing easy access to tourist destinations and restaurants
- We brought wine glasses and mugs as these aren‚Äôt provided (other than disposable paper coffee cups)
- Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joe‚Äôs place is beautiful and peaceful. We were able to walk or ride bikes to all the major attractions and restaurants in Key West. Wish we had stayed longer. I would recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location convenient to Duval but far enough away to provide a peaceful atmosphere. Good place for 1-2 people. Enjoyed the tranquility but for us we would have preferred having a television to watch. Overall a great stay and the communication and recommendations were on point.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great and Joe was very responsive and provided great local recommendations. The interior was clean and well kept, though a bit cramped. It was a good place to sleep in while we spent most of the day out. The walk to the entrance was a bit challenging for a blind person to navigate with some tight spaces and trees."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a peaceful spot during a nice getaway. Needed somewhere to get away from the noise of the busy streets and this was a perfect spot! Everything was walkable and they had a lot of recommendations for everything.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the peace and tranquility that we found there!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôll just list the pros and cons.
Pros:
Location! The unit is in a great location in Key West. The place also has a pool and some lounge chairs to use. Coffee, water refill, mini fridge are also provided. Shower pressure and hot water are great. You can just park your car on the street and walk to all places - coffee, restaurants, attractions, Dry Tortugas Ferry/seaplane.
Cons:
The suite itself is rather small. The closet had cleaning supplies, which didn‚Äôt leave a lot of room for us except a few clothes hangers. Since our trip in Florida was long, we had travel bags with us. Having them in the bedroom didn‚Äôt leave a lot of usable space for us. No microwave is offered in case you want to heat up food. Shower head is vertical. Guests need to carry shower caps to take quick showers. No WD provided (these are useful since there are lots of water activities nearby). These cons aren‚Äôt really any miscommunication from the host, but just something that the guests should be prepared for."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place is just what you need when visiting Key West. It is 10 minutes from the beach, restaurants, and night life. The back yard space is beautiful and very private. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed the coffee. The cats the roamed the back yard were very cute. We would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect spot for a couple who wants to explore Key West‚Äôs Old Town. Joe‚Äôs place is as advertised. The pool and deck are beautiful, though we only swam briefly because the weather was mild. We found the hosts to be responsive and helpful; they provided plenty of recommendations for things to do and places to eat. While the area is walkable, renting a bike is the way to go. Everything is within a few minutes on a bike. We had a great time and certainly recommend this listing for couples looking for a Key West getaway."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"we absolutely loved this location. The area is very walkable (10-15 minutes from Duval St) and lots of restaurants in the area. I will say the room is very tiny and if you are over 6' tall you may have an issue sleeping in the bed. The space is a bed and a bathroom; not a problem for a quick stay but you could quickly outgrow it if you stayed longer. The bathroom is beautiful and squeaky clean. There is free street parking and we were able to leave our car all 3 days. The weather was not so nice during our stay but the backyard is lovely and peaceful. We saw several kitties, butterflies, and little geckos in the backyard which was cool. Kelsey was extremely responsive! thanks so much. Overall we would stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a most welcome, peaceful haven within easy walking distance of both the town centre and the waterside attractions. We were very well looked after, coffee and milk was replenished daily so we could enjoy it by the great little pool which we also used daily. We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to return! Many thank again, Paul and Susanne"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodating, kind, and a beautiful space"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely return!!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it and would definitely stay again! All you need for a great stay in key west with many great recommendations from Joe!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was just as described. Super peaceful, relaxing and close to everything. Communication with Joe was great and loved the recommendations. We will definitely return in the future. I highly recommend staying here!‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for 1 or 2 people. Location was great, short walk to Duval. Fantastic communication."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 2 nights at Joe's place, a real little paradise! The bedroom is small but this is compensated by access to the outdoors: adorable garden and pool! The bathroom is large and nice. We found a lot of charm in the accommodation and more than anything, the location was perfect! A stone's throw from Duval Street, we didn't have to take the car for our entire stay. Finally, thank you to Joe for the communication and very clear instructions, and to Kelsey who was sure to give us a little friendly hello when we met her. We'd love to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not recommend staying here more! The location was perfect, we only paid for an Uber to/from the airport and then opted to walk everywhere. It was close to Duval street, and Whitehead St, and even a nice public beach, so we got to enjoy the best that Key West had to offer. Joe sent us a list of activities and his favorite spots before we even arrived, and we enjoyed a wonderful sunset cruise on our last night. The apartment was the perfect size, just a single room and bathroom. It was surprisingly private, we ran into their neighborhood once, and the small pool was perfect to cool down before we got dressed up to put for the night after a long day out in the sun. The place was clean, and calm and if we go back we wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location and very peaceful and quiet. Joegave great recommendations and the list was huge! can't wait to come back again sometime!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love the place and was close to everything and joe had great recommendations.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. There is places within walking and driving distance! Porch access was great.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little piece of paradise! I felt like I was at my own resort. The room and pool area were gorgeous, private and peaceful. Very much enjoyed my stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect spot for a relaxing and private stay. The backyard oasis is very calming and quiet. The neighborhood was friendly. Clean bathroom. I loved the fact that there was a nice little AC unit that we could adjust to our preferred temperature (I‚Äôm big about not enjoying sleeping in hot spaces so this was a plus). The host had water cold water in the mini fridge, and a mini coffee bar. It was perfect for my husband and I‚Äôs, two-night stay in Key West."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place was wonderful. The neighborhood is extremely quiet but within easy walking or biking distance to just about everything on the island. Traveling as a solo female I felt extremely safe. The room is clean and private, perfect for a single person or couple. The tenant upstairs was wonderful, said hello and made sure I knew she was available if I needed anything, but not at all intrusive. The pool and garden area is definitely the creme de la creme of this rental. The little pool was so clean and surrounded by beautiful mature tropical gardens and a deck/patio area with several seating options. Definitely would recommend!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The facility is very clean and the shower is amazing! The backyard with the beautiful pool is peaceful and relaxing! A short 15 minute walk to Duval St makes this an excellent location!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome tranquil peaceful stay. Very Clean & Nature right outside your room. Pond/Landscape & Pool are beautiful. Highly recommended
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy room with almost-exclusive deck and pool set in a beautiful garden in a calm residential area. Still Duval St. & a public beach were in easy walking distance. Communication with Joe and Kelsey was effortless, everything worked smoothly. Spent a comfortable three nights there, would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely private, quiet spot - we especially enjoyed the pool and garden. So happy that we stayed here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,LOVED everything about this rental. My favorite thing was that the bathroom was very clean .
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Small but exactly what you need. Close to everything. Nice to have access to pool and such a beautiful outdoor space. Joe‚Äôs communication was great and Kelsey was was just a pleasure. Will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot. Would recommend. Everything is within walking distance.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time at this tropical paradise. Quite, clean, location and overall vibe it simply wonderful. Outside cafe area is perfect and a nice touch. Will be back! Cheers!üç∑"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are so blessed to get the opportunity to stay at Joe‚Äôs place - just do it. It‚Äôs a dream. A serene and quiet oasis on key west. Joe was the most knowledgeable Airbnb host I‚Äôve ever had. Quick to respond and offer the best local recommendations. The pool was glorious and the unique atmosphere at Joe‚Äôs is unrivaled. Short distance to Duval and all the nightlife. Just make sure you rent a bike or some way to get around other than a car!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic. The place is beautiful and the location is is even better. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Why we didn‚Äôt meet Joe and his wife, their neighbor Kelsey assisted us. Through the booking process, Joe immediately responded and contacted me. He then gave me a list of personal favorite restaurants. The room had shelves and lots of storage space accompanied with maps, things to do and books if you want to read. The room was clean, cozy and relaxing. the added pool with deck and chairs made our stay wonderful. Joe‚Äôs place is what every couple needs to get away!! The beautiful decor, lush trees and quiet neighborhood was amazing. Kelsey was helpful in assisting us as well and made us feel right at home. We usually love the beach, but with the pool it was an amazing way to relax and get cool after the hot, sunny days. We will be coming again for sure!! Highly recommend! It was hard to leave this great stay. A slice of paradise!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jo and his minions made our quick stay stress free!!! Over and above normal service! We needed to drop our luggage early and leave luggage late, very accommodating!!! BTW coffee k cups in the fridge under the coffee maker.... great stay!!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property‚Äôs courtyard with pool and spotless accommodations were amazing. It was perfectly located in Old Town Key West. Our hosts were responsive and provided everything we needed for a comfortable week in paradise.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only regret was not booking a longer trip here. Excellent location just far enough from the action, and close enough for a quick, safe, beautiful residential walk.
Favorite part of the unit was the spotless and nicely decorated bathroom. I didn‚Äôt use the private pool, but the backyard is a treasure. This was the perfect spot to get caught up on sleep and be rejuvenated for busy Key West days."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing little tropical hideaway!! Super quiet!!! I have stayed close to Duval last time and was woken up continuously by the party and revelers so we really appreciated being able to come away and actually sleep!! The bed was comfortable. Host was so accommodating and super responsive and nice. The actual room is smaller but I have to say I twas perfect even so! The whole yard is so welcoming and made us feel special. also the extended pool area was so nice that we were rarely in our room. The room was nicely laid out and decorated and the shower/bath was so upgraded and comfortable with attention to the details. Most things were well thought out for a comfortable stay. The one thing I would pass on to others is to bring your own glass for wine and your mug for coffee as the 2 provided paper cups got super icky and old by the end of our stay! No biggie and don't pass this place up due to that just bring it and you'll be glad you did.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while you‚Äôre in Key West!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will return to this blissful haven! It‚Äôs the perfect peaceful place to unwind and the perfect location to explore Key West. The pool is a wonderful bonus!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were some really lovely things about Joe's place. It was peaceful and beautiful, and at night and in the morning, you can hear the frogs and the birds. The flowers and plants all around the place are lovely and beautiful, and the pool was nice and refreshing when the afternoons got hot (in June)
Kelsey, the caretaker, couldn't have been sweeter or more accommodating to us. She did everything to make us as comfortable and happy as she possibly could. The place was clean and lovely, and she helped us in many ways while we were there.
The only very small details that were less than ideal were that the air conditioning was just barely sufficient, but of course, we were there in June and it was really hot. Also it did not have a TV and since my laptop's screen failed on this trip (because of course it would), we couldn't watch Netflix or Philo for entertainment. But, that just forced us to enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings, and this place really had that."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little oasis. Loved our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been at a loss for words to accurately describe my stay without sounding like I'm making it up. I've stayed in many many airbnbs including 4 or 5 in Key West. The stay at Joe's is among my top 5 for sure. There's a peaceful vibe, thoughtful touches, tasteful artwork. My visit was less to party and more to relax, but both would have been possible, with Duval close by but not a peep could be heard at the house (ok, maybe a peep from a rooster or two!) I don't plan to stay anywhere else whenever visiting KW"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a hidden gem for our few days in Key West! We enjoyed the location and the patio and pool were just what we needed at the end of the day. Joe was very friendly and helpful with our stay. We highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy check in and great communication! Would definitely recommend for your weekend trip to Key West!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb. Great Location, great recommendations. I would stay here again! Great hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe's place was great. He was very responsive and sent a bunch of his local recommendations. The pool was a very nice touch to come home to after hot muggy days out downtown. The pool is in a very calm relaxing environment and it's very cool and shaded so it's a nice contrast to much of the rest of the keys.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So fun! Thank you.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hosts were so nice and hospitable! loved the backyard/pool area. Bathroom is really nice and had an great shower! Everything was very clean and we enjoyed our stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs Place is a lovely little oasis. I look forward to visiting again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful peaceful zen yard
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This room was wonderful! We were walking around Old Town all day and relaxed by the pool afterwards, before going out in the evenings. The secluded backyard and the stunning landscaping got me trying to figure out how I could talk the hosts into letting me live out there! It's the perfect mix of cozy, romantic and relaxing.
The room was spotless and exactly as they described. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size.
The hosts were extremely kind. This is where we're staying next time, for sure!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a comfortable stay. The back yard pool was nice even though the shaded area under the deck was roped off and not available for use. The room was very small but nice and clean. Coffee, water and slow wifi are the extent of the amenities."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location, room very comfy and i really like the bathroom. The little swimming pool was good ! Love this stay"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay in Old Town Key West in residential neighborhood within walking distance to family restaurants , Mon n Pop markets and beach
A relaxing time in Joe‚Äôs house and backyard when taking a break from exploring Key West
You couldn‚Äôt find a better place"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough good about both the place and the hosts themselves. First, the place is breathtakingly beautiful and even better in person. It is very conveniently located to nearly everything on the island. The mosaic in the shower gives a luxe feel to your stay. The pool and garden are beautifully maintained. It is a very quiet and relaxing retreat. Now to the hosts. Joe, and his wife Geri are quite possibly some of the best people we have ever met. Joe is very responsive and quick to make great suggestions should you need them throughout your stay. Geri is so kind and was very attentive to our needs. They both went above and beyond; they really blew us away. This was our second stay at this air b&b and it was even better the second time around. If you don‚Äôt book this place, you are missing out."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was amazing. Gerri let us check in a few minutes early, and was so kind throughout our stay. The private pool with the peaceful pond was exactly what we needed to wind down after dancing the night away at Sloppy Joes. The room was clean and tidy (thank you Yana!), and the bathroom was gorgeous. Joe and Gerri gave great recommendations and were always quick to respond. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nicer than expected with the backyard . The pool was accessible along with beach towels and a very cozy room.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! The photos do not do it justice. The private bedroom and bathroom were so very nice, and very clean. The pool and backyard were amazing! Very relaxing! I cannot say enough about the entire place. Location was very close to Duval on the southern end. Easy to find free parking-right in front of the house usually. Joe and Geri were so welcoming and helpful. Great hosts. They are so knowledgeable about everything at Key West. My only complaint was that my husband and I could not stay longer! It was difficult to force ourselves to leave that gorgeous backyard and pool. We will definitely be back. Thank you Joe and Geri for everything."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay with Joe. We love it. Close enough to go out and enjoy yourself yet far away enough to relax and feel like you‚Äôre miles away from the action. Perfect little space for a couple trying to get away for some alone/free time. You won‚Äôt regret staying here!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts and very welcoming. My husband and I arrived about an hour early and they were kind enough to let us check into our room. We were given several great recommendations for places to eat. We had the pool area to ourselves and rarely saw the owners or upstair‚Äôs tenant. Although, we spent very little time at the house, it was the perfect place to rest our heads at night."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a comfortable stay and loved the surrounding trees and tropical flowers.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and his wife were extremely friendly hosts. Their place was a beautiful private stay and had everything one would need for a nice trip to Key West. It was conveniently located to a ton of activities. I will 100% be booking again in the future.
Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint and quite place to escape. This was just what we needed. Nice part of Old Town Key West and very quiet. The back yard around the pool is beautiful. Room was clean and a very nice place. Close to Duval, beaches, and everything Key West."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place was the perfect little piece of paradise to stay for a couple of nights in Key West! The location is close to Duval street and many other main attractions. We enjoyed the pool with the lush landscape surrounding it, the coffee, clean space and privacy that this location provided. The host was especially kind and welcoming. We received great recommendations on where to eat and visit! Everything was great!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joe communicated great! worked with us on dropping off our luggage, as we had taken the Key West Express and didn't want to carry our luggage."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When you visit a place for the first time, you rely somewhat on the host. Joe and Geri sent us information well before the check~in to allow us time to look through the suggestions to fit our needs. They quickly responded to any inquiries. Upon arrival, we were so enthralled by their welcome and kindness. Throughout our stay we used their suggestions for things to do and places to eat. Each one more spectacular than the previous. All along they were available for questions and inquiries sharing their interests and historical knowledge enhancing our experience. Thank you Joe and Geri!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For a quick weekend in key west, this was perfect. Joe and Gerri were super helpful in getting everything sorted, and we‚Äôre super flexible with us on our check in. Highly recommend"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is my 3rd time at Joe‚Äôs place. I am pretty sure that there is going to be a 4th visit. It‚Äôs perfect for me. Exactly what I require. Book early it fills up fast!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Geri were great hosts and responded immediately to any questions. The room is exactly as described... cozy w a great bathroom and good AC. The outdoor space was incredible....private spotless pool, private green surroundings and yes, entertaining cats. Enjoyed coffee each morning outside on the deck. This is a great location.... walkable to anywhere in old town key west. We rented bikes for our stay which were easy to store and access in the yard. We walked to Higgs Beach nightly for sunset. Great visit"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place, exactly as described. Joe was a responsive host. Outside pool area is cute. The Key West roosters wake you up, no need for an alarm clock. :)"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great little space for our short getaway. The hosts were very proactive with their communication and recommendations, as well as responsive to our inquiries. The quaint room was ideal for our stay and being so close to Duval St. activities made for an easy walk to many of our weekend activities. The only minor drawback was the cats on the premises. We had a great stay and we will certainly be making a return visit to the Conch Republic!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay if you are in Key West short term. Convenient to the Duvall Loop, free transportation around the area. The room was cozy and the bed inviting after a long day of fun in town!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is amazing, you‚Äôre on a quiet street but still easily walkable to all the fun stuff in Key West. It was great to have a quiet spot to return to in the middle of sightseeing for a break. There were several kitties hanging out in the backyard as well as comfy chairs and shade."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs place was lovely and conveniently located within walking distance of lots of what Key West has to offer.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in Key West!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. We spent a lot of time outside and around the area so the amenities were reasonable and we were able to store enough for a few days. The location was amazing and walkable to nearly all places.
The hosts gave great local recommendations. We would definitely recommend staying here for the location."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall Joe&Geri‚Äôs room was comfortable, clean and in a peaceful location. Highly recommend it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Claire was our host during our stay and made us feel right at home. She left us a beautiful gift to help us celebrate and took care of the minor issue we had. It had a beautiful backyard and wish it wasn't so cold on our trip so that we could have enjoyed it!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place was very clean, pretty and at a convenient location. Almost everything was only ~15 min of walkable distance. Joe also gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants, things to do and contacts for making water sports reservations. They also have a beautiful indoor pool and it looks exactly like the pictures.
The 2-3 cats on the property kind of surprised me. I'm not sure if that was mentioned in the listing. They were just harmlessly walking around but a heads up would have been nice.
I also found the kitchen arrangement a bit hacky and underwhelming. It's just a minimal coffee counter on top of a mini fridge outside the bedroom, where the cats generally walked around. At this price point, I would appreciate slightly more amenities in the kitchen like some utensils and a microwave."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were fortunate to book Joe's place last minute. It was exactly as described. Perfect place for a couple. It was cozy, clean and quiet. Located in a nice residential neighborhood that felt safe at all times. Street parking was easy to find right in front. Located just a few blocks from Southernmost Hotel, on the quiet end of Duval St. Many restaurants/coffee shops within walking distance. We especially enjoyed the peaceful backyard. It was so nice to have it all to ourselves. The plumbing worked great. Loved the showerhead in the walk-in shower. We really appreciated the restaurant & activity recommendations sent to us before our arrival. Excellent communication with both Joe & his assistant Claire. My only caveat would be if you're tall or big, this place may feel a little too confining."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay at this cottage! The room was comfortable and had all of the amenities you could ask for in a small place. We spent a lot of time outside by the pool relaxing in the peaceful backyard. The location was amazing, just over a mile to the opposite end of Duval so we were able to walk or bike everywhere. The hosts were very responsive, gave local recommendations, and made our late night check in easy. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a smashing place. Beautifully situated, ideal location to walk to Duval street, absolutely spotless and super responsive and helpful host with great recommendations for everything from restaurants to bike hire. Thanks for having us."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe is a fantastic host. Very communicative throughout the booking experience, location is fantastic, cute and comfortable lodgings. Would strongly recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place was everything that we needed and pictured accurately! The pool area with surrounding vegetation is so lovely. The room was comfortable and clean and the large walk in shower was nice at the end of a day biking around the island. Claire, our host, gave us many recommendations for restaurants and things to do and see. We appreciated her insight and chatting with her in general. Walking to Duvall St is about 20 minutes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a great way to check out the local area. We also rented bikes from We Bike and rode to Duval and the local beaches. You can‚Äôt beat the location. We would absolutely stay again! Thanks Joe!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and room. Great way to vacation.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This spot was absolutely perfect for my husband and I during our weekend stay for Fantasy Fest. The unit was impeccably clean and all the space we needed to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù and sleep. The outside area around the dunk pool was an absolute oasis! Communication with hosts was super easy and quick. We followed lots of their suggestions and was never disappointed! We were able to walk to everything from the house (except we did Uber to and from the airport). 10/10! Would definitely come back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described and easy. Loved the place. The pool area is secluded and beautiful. Outdoor shower was handy and privacy was great. Thank you. Definitely recommend
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts! Would stay again and again :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend to stay here if you‚Äôre traveling alone or with your significant other. The stay in general was amazing and the hosts, including Claire, were awesome! The area is safe, close to everything, and the place is super cozy; felt right at home. You can pretty much walk everywhere, but it can get really hot during the day. The pool was very relaxing and a nice addition for those really hot days. Thanks for everything!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay! So close to Duval street and all the action Key West has to offer! The pool was lovely and perfect for the two of us and the unit was quaint and clean. We will be back, thank you so much!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"While the place was sufficient, the pictures posted definitely had some photo magic. Probably should use some updated photos. The bed was okay until it broke. The host did have it fixed rather promptly, the fact that it happened was concerning. At First I thought the fridge and coffee maker being staged outside my room would be okay, after one day, not okay. The Host was very responsive and attentive, courteous and very helpful with local ideas and restaurants. I would say it was a solid 3 out of 5."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place. Will definitely use it when I visit the Keys again. It felt like a private unit to be honest, as opposed to a shared place. Entrance was directly out to the pool and the great ensuite bathroom and toilet was a bonus. No need to enter the main house at all. Very well kitted out as well.
Lastly ‚Ä¶ great location!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an awesome hidden gem. tucked away right next to duval street, this place was absolutely killer"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience. Great host, flexible and pleasant energy. Yes, It‚Äôs all the
about energy. It was very tranquil and therapeutic. I appreciate the care put into the property."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great stay. The area was perfect to get around the island. The space itself was was very comfortable and exactly what we needed. The outdoor garden and pool was exactly what we needed for morning coffee and cooling off in the afternoon! Our host was very helpful and responsive, even gave us some great recommendations!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of everything. It was close enough to walk to some things and close to the Duval Loop bus routes. We enjoyed the cats that were around Zorro and Two Socks. It was easy to check in and and out, and it helped to make our stay a very relaxing one. Everyone I showed pictures of the place were amazed and loved it."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing room with perfect pool back yard area. Close to everything but very quite and peaceful. Will be back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do not miss out on this place! If you are looking for a peaceful and relaxing place to stay- look no further. I spent 4 wonderful days soaking up the sun, admiring the lush gardens and lounging in the pool/poolside. Everything was perfect. The place is spotless, and has an amazing shower to boot! Close to everything , yet worlds away from the hustle of the city. I am already planning my next trip down."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Loved the pool and backyard.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was very clean and close to Duval St!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe's place was great! Location was in the mix and near everything. We loved having the pool for the evenings. Overall a great place to stay in Key West!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time here. The pool was really hard to leave behind - I think we swam three times each day we were there. The yard really felt like a little oasis. Location was good- just a short walk to most anywhere. We didn‚Äôt see our hosts or neighbors at all, though they were very communicative by text and kept the pool clean and coffee area stocked. I recommend bringing a small cooler if you like ice for drinks- there‚Äôs a small fridge but no access to freezer/ice."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming place with a great pool!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is not in the heart of Duvall, but close enough to ride a bike. We liked that it was away from all the action. The private pool was a nice feature to have on hot days. The host was hospitable! It made our trip that much better."
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My first trip to Key West was a awesome and memorable experience . But it was not all sunshine.
I am an average Joe.. This trip was my reward for my reaching my work milestones by June. I did not fly into Key West by private plane or drove in a chauffeur driven limousine. I drove all the way from Miami into Key West, dependent only on my cell phone for navigation like most of us.. An hour into Key West - my cell phone battery died and I could not bring it back with a charger that I carried...I lost all access to Airbnb - the check in instructions and all the good stuff... I did have the cell number of the Housekeeper and the address in my diary.... Stopping at a Marriott on the way, I made some frantic calls to her to show up at the address to let me in... This mix up resulted in a check in delay of 2 hours.
Claire the housekeeper was pleasant to deal with and I was able to check in finally.
The Airbnb rental costs were expensive to begin with... Every top tier Hotel Chain to the Local Innkeeper provides breakfast... There was only a Keurig Coffee Machine with Hot water and some tea bags.. In addition, washer and dryer were not available for use for guests... I did not get to meet with Joe or Geri - the owners... which I usually enjoy with all my previous stays across the US.. There were gaps in the hospitality experience that needs to be addressed...
It is a beautiful home in a pleasant neighborhood.. I would welcome any price adjustment that you could come up with, if possible.. I wish you both well... I do plan to return to Key West but will be looking at other options.... Namaste and Be Well..."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient to the old downtown area without the hassle of being too close and noisy. Beautiful well kept space and a wonderful relaxing pool to top it off. Great way to visit Key West in the heat of the summer.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay! Communication was awesome and this was a great little spot to be in. El Siboney was so close and a great spot to eat. Overall an awesome visit!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute little spot, has everything you need. It was Perfect for our stay. The garden in the back around the pool was so relaxing in the evenings. Host was amazing, check in/out was super easy. Great location! Definitely recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean room, clean bathroom, beautiful backyard. Very attentive and welcoming. Short walk to Duval St. Would stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, great location. backyard fantastic. host is so amazing. Joe is great owner providing restaurant and all kinds of information."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect an AMAZING experience, excellent service and clear communication."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful, cozy oasis in the hustle and bustle of Key West, this is the perfect place. Yet, it's still only a short walk or ride to all the Key West fun. I was staying by myself and felt very safe there. Joe provided excellent communication, as well as offered several great suggestions. Check in and out was super easy. I'm already looking forward to my next stay there."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect little room to come back to after a day out in Key West. The room is quite small, however the attached bathroom is very spacious and the shower is a dream. Joe and Geri have really created a charming and relaxing space. The bed is very comfortable, there are plently of beach and bath towels provided, and there are even guides and suggestions for Key West on the shelves. Overall, a wonderful experience!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was just perfect for us!! The space was small but it suited our needs perfectly - (it does have a large bathroom with an amazing shower). Everything was exceptionally clean (really, really clean!) The hair dryer was powerful. Plenty of towels and beach towels. I did offer a suggestion to the owner to provide some sort of a cooler for ice. The small fridge is very nice but it does not have a freezer compartment. Higgs Beach is very close by. We rented our bikes from the rental company Joe recommended. The bikes were there waiting for us - we paid online and they delivered and picked them up. (I do wish the bikes had a cup holder, but they were very good, sturdy bikes). That shower though!!!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs private entry room is located within walking distance to Duval St, the Southern Most Point and the beach.
We enjoyed our time in the room. The bedroom and bathroom are spotless, bed is comfortable, shower is great.
Communication was fluid-we had a small inconvenience with the refrigerator that was addressed and resolved in a timely manner."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing and peaceful experience with the host and their place. The communication was a breeze and they sent us recommendations before the trip. The hosts were out of town but their friend Claire helped us out with everything and was super understanding when we had to keep our bags before check in and after check out because of our flight schedules. Definitely recommend. Their private pool is great to come back and relax when it‚Äôs too hot outside.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very nice place
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's Place is a lovely Zen oasis. I enjoyed the small pool surrounded by the tropical garden. The small room is clean, well laid out, and comfy."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to everything but still quiet and calm! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, except the airport for the seaplane tour of Dry Tortugas (which you should definitely do) and that was a quick Uber ride away. The pool and backyard space is lovely. The hosts recommendations were really helpful. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an oasis in Key West, look no further. This was one of our all-time favorite trips and our stay here played a large part.
The room is lovely with beautiful artwork and a spa-like bathroom. The bed is so comfortable!
The backyard is tranquil with bubbling fountains, gorgeous plants, and the pool. We made sure to spend time here each day!
Every amenity is prepared by the lovely hosts. We had everything we needed for a perfect stay and never even had to ask for anything!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome experience at Joes place. Room is small but very cozy. A/C is very good and always felt like stepping into pure refreshment after a day of exploring. Bed is COMFY, must be memory foam or something because it‚Äôs dense but soft and we just passed out in it each day. Room is attached to their house but entirely private and with shades pulled it felt totally separate (one set of windows looks onto their shared deck area). They made recommendations about local attractions and bike rental places and it paid off as they directed us to the cheapest place. The pool outside is extremely small (you won‚Äôt be swimming laps) but it honestly is exactly what we wanted on a couple days when we were hot and tired, and they never used it to our knowledge so we had it to ourselves. Hard to imagine a better location in Key West!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As to describing the hospitality you can expect from Joe and Geri, superlatives fail me. Their home is in a quiet neighborhood and the guest room opens at the back to a deck and pool surrounded by a tropical zen-like garden. Relax in a lounge chair and if you're lucky, you might get the chance to ask about the cats and the mango tree!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place , just very small. Maybe 200 sq. ft. total including bath. Joe was very helpful in directing us to beaches, restaurants and other POI's. Plan on renting bikes, scooters or golf carts. Within walking distance of Duval St., but most of the action is is closer to town and walking would be unrealistic. And parking downtown is a hassle. We rented scooters and it was a blast. Not a true B&B as breakfast is not offered. Not a problem for us, but might be for others. I know many listings don't offer breakfast, but there should be a different category for those listings (maybe Air B no B?üòÑ) Over all a very pleasant stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Geri's place was a pleasant surprise for me and my wife. Communication was smooth and accurate. Early check-in was greatly appreciated. Their restaurant and bar recommendations were spot-on. Room and bath were clean and comfortable. Began and ended our days relaxing in lounge chairs on the backyard pool patio, surrounded by beautiful vegetation. Quiet, residential location, yet just short blocks from the bustle and vibe of Duval Street. Joe and Geri, thank you!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little bungalow! Perfect location and great communication!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Geri are great hosts with a hidden gem in Key West. The place is super clean and conveniently located between everything. Everything was as advertised and they had great recommendations for sightseeing, food and fun! My wife and I would highly recommend!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Very cozy and quiet. Joe and Geri were awesome hosts. Thanks again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, poolside room in a private garden. We enjoyed the visiting cats as well. Joe and Geri were attentive, accommodating, and helpful. Two thumbs up!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent service
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is my second time at Joe & Geri‚Äôs place. It is perfect for me, their place not only meets my needs but exceeds them as well. Joe & Geri are really nice, completely laid back. Their location is close to everything, the beaches, Duval St., Hemingway‚Äôs house, Mallory Square, wherever you want to go you can walk to it. Their pool is a great way to cool off after a long day. It‚Äôs just a great place to stay, pro tip; book early it fills up fast.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Geri were great hosts. They made check-in / check-out easy. Their recommendations were excellent. The place is as advertised - great location, cozy, clean, and comfortable. Perfect for a key west getaway."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Geri were delightful, really good people, terrific hosts. Room was perfect for me, four nights, a very good location, not far from Higgs Beach one direction, Duval at United in t'other direction. Easy walk to anywhere on Duval Street. I will return! Jeffrey"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was quiet clean and convenient. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Joe and Geri where friendly and helpful. Was a perfect spot for a few warm days.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, walkable to Duval St, Higgs Beach, etc. Safe, secure private entrance and a beautiful outdoor pool area. The room itself is quite small, wouldn't be great if you plan to spend a lot of time at home, but perfect if you are out and about exploring all that Key West has to offer!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place was fantastic! Near so many wonderful sights and restaurants! The space was just what we needed for our trip and everything was spotless. Communication was easy and quick! We would recommend this space to everyone!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location .. Place is cozy and welcoming
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at Key West and explore the old town. We thoroughly enjoyed it! Deck and pool are a great compliment to a cute little room. Very cozy and calm! Lots of fresh air and you have all the essentials. We definitely will be back!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! What an amazing find! Great location, with an easy walk to Duval and all the attractions. Very close to beaches. The property was super cute, and everything was as described. I will be staying again for sure!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has great personality with its cute pool and great location. I would certainly stay her again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely superb stay at this Key West AirBnB! Only a few blocks to Duval, a very comfortable room, beautiful location, and gorgeous outdoor pool area! The host was so attentive and responsive- she provided coffee, cream, and filtered water anytime it was needed. The bark yard oasis was so inviting and although, semi private; it was actually very private during our entire stay. We rental a golf cart to explore the island one day and were able to park on the street which was an added bonus. Thank you for such a perfect stay in Key West! We hope to come again soon!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, would recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a super sweet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of key west and yet it‚Äôs all so close by. What a charming setting (including the incredibly kind woman who lives upstairs and the caretaker in the other side of the home). It felt private and serene the entire time. The place is cozy and well cared for. The pool is a great way to cool down from the day.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Claire is an excellent hostess! Located on a quiet safe residential street, it is a great retreat from the noise of Duval Street. Yet still an easy walk to Duval Street.
The lush plants around the pool invite the hummingbirds to visit while you relax with a drink or read a book."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs place was excellent! We enjoyed our stay and would love to visit again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location on the quieter side of all the activity. We rented bikes which was great and you‚Äôre only a 5-10 minute bike ride from everything on the island. Claire was very accommodating. Room is a bit small but the outdoor area is nice for relaxing. We really only slept in the room so it was fine for us. Shower was very nice and roomy with a good pressure rain head. I would stay here again. Great outdoor bar Tipsy Rooster and great breakfast place Frenchys only a couple hundred feet away!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and good value
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely oasis with a great location! Even though the room is on the small side, it worked out perfectly.
I did miss watching TV, but it was good to just relax and enjoy nature of the patio area. There are shelves and a storage cabinet to place items. Nice value for Key West! We rented a golf cart and went to Smather‚Äôs Beach every day! The upstairs neighbor was so sweet, and very welcoming! Claire helped us when we had any issue. Fresh filtered water was provided for us and placed in the mini fridge daily. So convenient to not have to purchase bottled water! Thankful to have enjoyed such a lovely stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An easy 10-minute walk to Duval street and plenty of restaurants. Hosts provided restaurant & activity suggestions & were very responsive. Cozy & clean inside. The charming backyard oasis was a bonus.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts! Cozy location with everything you need. Beautiful pool area to relax. It‚Äôs an awesome place to stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and great experience !
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice central location between Duval St and the beach. Thanks
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice room but small. Good location
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such an amazing stay! The location is perfect. Walking or biking distance from pretty much everything. The space is very cute and cozy and the bed is super comfortable. It‚Äôs also really cool that you get to use the pool area and hang out back. The communication with the host is top notch and they provide a ton of recommendations around the area!! A must stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great spot!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very good option if you want to have a vacation in key west. Very recommended
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding little private hideaway. Loved the plunge pool. Walking distance to many things, biking distance from EVERYthing."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience! The tenants in the house were so welcoming and easy-going. It felt like we had our own personal pool and garden! Great location. I can‚Äôt wait to return!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a hidden gem! If you‚Äôre looking for a quaint little place not far off the beaten path with access to a private pool - this is the spot! We enjoyed many hours by the pool to cool off in between heading into town on bikes for meals and cold drinks. We can‚Äôt wait to return - best trip ever! Super clean and great communication!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Key West! The actual space is cozy, fine for one person or a couple. The yard and pool is the real star here though, we loved having access to the pool on the hot humid days, and the landscaping is beautiful. The hosts were out of town while we were there but Claire was super helpful in their place. Would 100% recommend booking this place for your visit!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a great time staying at Joe and Geri's. It's in a great location. We could get around just by walking or biking everywhere. The room was clean and quiet. The only thing is it is not as private as it sounds. The live-in host and others came and went as they pleased through the backyard to use the stairs to their upstairs room which made it feel much less private. But Claire was very helpful and pleasant throughout our stay and overall it was a small price to pay. I would definitely recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host is amazing. Location is amazing. House is amazing. Pool area is like meditating in a tropical oasis. Really close to town but far enough away to lose the city sounds. Room is super clean and comfy. I would recomend this stay to anyone going to Key West. Hands down made my Key West experience better by having this wonderful place to come back to every evening.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was super clean and the shower is really nice. It is small, but the backyard pool area is gorgeous and very inviting after a hot day in the sun. The area is quiet and safe. It is close to the southernmost point, the quieter end of duval, and to Higgs beach. We had bikes waiting for us and were able to bike all around the island during our stay! There are ssome great restaurants and coffee very close!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful visit in Key West! Joe‚Äôs property is amazing and we highly recommend staying there when traveling to Key West!
The property is very tranquil and relaxing from the pond when you enter to the beautiful landscape and private pool. My husband and I enjoyed using this private space a lot during our stay!
The room is just what you need! Very clean, the bed was comfy, and I loved the rain shower head.
We walked everywhere and we enjoyed that it was close to everything.
Joe provided us with great recommendations too, excursions and food! We definitely took advantage of both of those. We really enjoyed the sunset tour with Argo Navis!
We would love to stay there again one day! Thank you for having us."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The facility was wonderful! It is perfectly located within a quiet residential area but within 1 mile or less of everything on Key West. No need for a car. We walked and took Uber everywhere. Joe provided oodles of excellent suggestions for places to eat and thing to see and do. The pool was heaven, especially after a day of walking around Key West."
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just fyi, the pool is not private. It is shared with co-host Katherine. She uses the pool from time to time. The listing description says ‚Äúexclusive use‚Äù but which is false. When I questioned about it to Joe‚Äôs wife, Jerry, she said Katherine is allowed to use the pool, as if we were supposed to know when the description says private and exclusive. Hope it helps"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time! Katherine was so friendly, and everything was very clean! It was so conveniently located, and the pool was so refreshing! We would have loved to stay longer and hope to come back someday!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place,clean and close to everything we will definitely be staying again"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great host, great communication, super welcoming"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and we loved having a pool to cool off in!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a perfect stay. The room was clean and quiet. Pool was a perfect oasis away. Our host was a delight. Will stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was an awesome place to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised. Beautiful spot right in the middle of the action. Relaxing and peaceful but easy walking to lots of action. Would highly recommend staying here. Check in instructions were very clear. The staff was so pleasant and helpful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow is what I can give this place. A true airbnb find. Highly recommended and one of the nicest host I‚Äôve ever met. Thank you for everything. Safe travels on your adventures.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, great host, really great place. Nice to have the added touch of cleaning staff who would come daily. Staff on site were super nice and helpful. Host very responsive and easy to communicate with. Would absolutely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It is an awesome place with very well-maintained grounds, and amenities. You are right in the middle of all the area restaurants and bars. Quite walkable, but scooters are really fun. There was a little bit of construction next door that started earlier some days but not too bad. Attendants are very pleasant and responsive to guests."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Great location. Clean and very comfortable with everything we needed. You have the privacy of an Airbnb but with the conveniences of a hotel (daily change of towels and bed made) staff is on site and extremely helpful
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, walkable to everything, but fairly quiet at night. Also did not get the key west wake-up calls (couldn‚Äôt hear the roosters) which was welcomed!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is great, lovely room and a great location to get around. Great restaurants within walking distance."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I already did the survey once.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The residence itself is hands-down the best location I have ever stayed at in Key West. It is located right in the middle of EVERYTHING, but still manged to feel private and exclusive when in the bounds of the property. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and bikes were easy to pick up too. the local recommendations, cleaning service, and responsiveness were second to none and I would recommend this property to anyone. I will be staying here again in the future and would not recommend staying anywhere else!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location - 1 block off of Duval, just steps to CVS and KW Cuban Coffee. A peaceful, nicely landscaped grouping of cottages with a shared pool that we took advantage often. Daily housekeeping. The Romantic Retreat is cozy, just fine for two people with a private hot tub which was nice. Clean, bright, nicely decorated. The only negative was the A/C. There's a mini-split unit but it evidently wasn't working and was replaced with a window-mounted A/C which worked fine but was pretty noisy and breezy in such a small space. I assume this was a temporary fix given the towel tacked up to cover the window. Other than that, everything was great and we enjoyed our stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heaven on Earth!! Our first trip to Key West and Naomi's place (Romantic Retreat) was the perfect place to stay. It was even better than the pictures. Within walking distance of everything - At the end of the day it was awesome to return to lounge by the pool and relax in the hot tub. Had one little problem with a gate code but Naomi answered immediately and solved the issue. We will definitely be back!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are visiting Key West for the first time or the 81st time, you will not find a better place to stay than Center Courts. While the room itself could stand some minor updates, the amenities are never ending and perfectly executed. You want for absolutely nothing while at Center Courts. Between the pool, our private hot tub, sun deck, parking spot, stocked outdoor spaces, laundry on site, stocked kitchen, incredibly comfortable bed, and queued up Alexa speaker, you feel so taken care of that it‚Äôs easy to not even need to walk the one block to Duval street. However easy walking to all the hot spots, this is the quietest oasis at the end of the day. It was seamless and comfortable for our pooch to join us as well. The staff is SO friendly, competent, and helpful; truly the best service I have experienced in awhile. You can never have a bad time in Key West, but staying at Center Courts brings it to an entire new level of comfort, convenience, and fun. Can‚Äôt wait to come back. TY!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is a studio apartment with a comfortable bed. The front door is a few feet from a lovely pool. My daughter and son in-law stayed here in 2023 and recommended it. glad we stayed here.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Only stayed one night in between longer rentals but everything was perfect!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at 916 Center Street was relaxing, enjoyable and the perfect spot to walk too wherever we wanted to go in Old Town Key West. We are glad we did not rent a car. The atmosphere was engaging throughout the island but the staff at the Center Court Historic Inn and Cottages was awesome!!! Having our own hot tub was just another of many bright perks that was available during our stay!!! Great communication with Naomi and thanks for your suggestions.
Shout out to everyone for a great time and we can‚Äôt wait to come back!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our romantic get away was amazing! Our own private spa, cute perfect cottage, pristine spa and pool outside our doorsteps. Cleaning personnel so friendly and helpful - excellent!!! Will definitely come back! Naomi was quick to respond! 5 star all the way. Perfection! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our time spent at the cottage. It was peaceful, close to everything, well kept and beautiful grounds. We enjoyed breakfast, outdoor, at the pool. The bed was very comfortable and afforded a good night sleep; that was good as we were exhausted after walking all over the key. We picked a good time to visit, the Christmas light were phenomenal and very unique. We will be back and hope to enjoy this little paradise suite, again. Thank you Naomi"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved it. If we find our way back to Key West this would be our top choice. Clean, beautiful, peaceful, great location, very friendly staff. Can‚Äôt say enough!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Superb accommodation everything we had hoped for -clean and anything we asked for was catered for -would highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We find the cottages surrounding a pool work great and this was no exception! Naomi is a lovely host and her staff is excellent. We enjoyed chatting with our neighbors and you can really hit all the spots within a 30 min walk or 10 min bike ride. We love Tropical Christmas!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic property, this will be our go to when we return to KW !

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Romantic Retreat! It was a perfect location for our honeymoon. The public pool was busy with other tenants from other units so it was nice to have the private hot tub! The Romantic Retreat is a perfect location on Duval street! Not too far from all the action, but was peaceful away from the noise at night. The bike shop around the corner was perfect for rentals. We will definitely stay again and recommend to others visiting Key West!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will stay here again. The location is excellent. You can‚Äôt get any closer to Duval st. We stayed in the ‚ÄúRomantic Retreat ‚Äú unit and it was very nice and we had a Private hot tub just for us. The entire property is Very well maintained and the staff is very friendly. The pools are great. They have one just for adults. I was extremely pleased with this property. I have stayed in several places in Key West and this by far is my favorite. We will stay here again for sure.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Romantic Retreat is outstanding. Exceptionally well furnished and maintained. Sitting porch opposite pool. Private two person spa is wonderful. The unit is furnished and decorated tastefully. The art work is exceptional. Kitchenette is a plus. Location is terrific as short walk to Duval St. and many excellent restaurants. She has full time cleaning and maintenance staff that are very responsive. Naomi is an excellent owner and host. We will be back for sure. Highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was simply an amazing place to stay. Host a always very responsive. Room cleaned and made up daily. Better than hotel service. Close to everything food, shops, docks, beaches. I had the best time hanging out for the week relaxing and studying for open water certification. I was totally comfortable and felt like I was at home here. Will definitely stay here on my next visit to Key West!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and great location! Very comfortable and clean accommodations and loved the privacy of the pool area. We rented bicycles and were able to get everywhere we wanted to go with ease.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location location and a beautiful happy place to boot. Definitely would visit again. All you could want and need."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the Romantic Retreat, which is the smallest of the homes in the Center Court Key West boutique compound (small group of homes surrounding a central pool). This is a beautiful 1 BR cottage, with a beachy/Caribbean vibe. The pictures are very accurate. Upon entry, you are in a small kitchenette, which has a minifridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and basic dishes (I wouldn't plan on cooking any elaborate meals here, but that's not what you're in Key West for). To the right is the bedroom, with a very comfortable king bed. To the left is the bathroom, with combo tub/shower. It's more than adequate for a couple and feels more spacious than the actual SF. The location is perfect, basically one block off Duval and easy walk to most everything, but feels like your own private oasis. Naomi is a great host, who was immediately responsive and provided useful suggestions. I would definitely stay again if in Key West!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would absolutely recommend this place. It is so peaceful and quiet, and within walking distance of pretty much everything. 10/10"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Parking was a little complicated as the street is very crowded, but I also waited until 10 min before arriving to call and let Naomi know we were arriving. Fortunately you don‚Äôt need to use your car again because it‚Äôs a small island and everything (and I mean everything) is a 1 to 10 minute walk to.The place was very clean and had everything a hotel would have. The pool area is shared with other guests staying in the cottages but the spa area is private for the romantic cottage which was really nice to use at night. I was traveling with my bird and I was having an awful time finding a hotel that would accept birds so thank you Naomi!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and wonderful stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great gem Key West. Our host was amazing and answered all our questions promptly and even let us check in early. We will definitely be back.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish I could live here! It‚Äôs such a happy place with beautiful touches thoughtfully scattered around to find. Orchids hidden in the palms, games and chairs in the shade by the pool, serenity and beauty in each direction. Superb place of tranquility, peace, and beauty."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Key West! We were close to all the action, but it was our own little oasis away from the action too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely property and extremely well located.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to stay in Key West. Super cute and super comfy bed in the romantic retreat. We loved having the pool right outside our door and we were so close to everything Key West has to offer. Walking distance to a lot and there‚Äôs a scooter rental place just down the street. The staff was very attentive and cleaned the place every day. Someone‚Äôs always around if you need everything. Highly recommend this place for a couple‚Äôs visit to Key West.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect retreat. Super clean and great location, we‚Äôll be back!! Thank you Naomi!!!"

The private hot tub was great after a day of walking and the bed was so comfortable. The staff was very friendly and always working hard to make everything perfect. Michael the cat was also very friendly and entertaining. Would highly recommend if you want an ideal retreat. A+"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Romantic Retreat is the perfect location if you want access to everything in Old Town Key West. We parked when we got there and walked everywhere. Naomi‚Äôs description is accurate, the cottage was spotless, the bed absolutely the best we‚Äôve ever slept on. For future guests, it‚Äôs good to know that this unit is 1/2 block off Duval, so you can hear music from the nearby bars all night. Also, the pool is right outside your door and is available for families to use from many different properties. It‚Äôs a very small pool so the potential for many guests right outside your door exists. Everyone was very respectful, quiet after 10 pm. It also comes with its own private small hot tub. The weather was so warm during our visit that we never used it, but the set up is nice and very private. This is a great little space for guests who want to be right in the action of Key West. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay and relax! Near all the big items in Key West, but far enough to not feel like you're on top of things. Pool area is amazing!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Romantic Retreat! The staff was very helpful and friendly.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at this airbnb after our wedding & it was the perfect ‚ÄúRomantic Retreat.‚Äù Everything was exactly like the photos and we loved the extra space this rental has compared to a hotel room.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hesitate to say how wonderful it is, someplace so great you want to keep as a hidden gem. We went for NYE and my bestie's 50th celebration. Place is absolutely perfect and a fabulous location. We had a golfcart and it was great to stay less than a block a way for the quietness and yet go around the block and let the party begin! Room was super comfy - VERY clean, nothing more you can ask for. Jacuzzi was private and a really nice winddown after a crazy night. Honestly the perfect place to stay!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Romantic Retreat was as beautiful as it sounds, as we loved it‚Äôs charming design and location in the heart of Key West. One block off Duval Street it was the best of both worlds, providing quiet and peaceful nights in the private spa area that had amazing scenery, all while being only a few minutes walk from every great attraction in town. Additionally, the property manager was very kind and helpful, as was all the housekeeping staff. We can‚Äôt wait to book again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was clean and well maintained. Your staff was friendly and accommodating. All amenities that we needed was provided. The location was ideal for walking to all things we had on our agenda and 1/2 block of Duval Street. It was convenient to many restaurants, lighthouse, and other historic places. Michael, the resident cat, roamed freely around the property. We enjoyed the Fury-Catamaran Sunset Cruise also. We would very much like to return!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, beautiful property and outstanding staff!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING!! Hands down, I would go back and bring my kids, or not lol. We went to celebrate our anniversary and it was great to have the option of walking or biking but not actually needing to drive anywhere. The pool right in front of the unit was great during the day and the private hot tub was great in the evenings after the weather cooled off. We enjoyed our first trip to key West and had a relaxing Anniversary week. We definitely plan to return at some point!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10! The location is great and walking distance from everything we needed/wanted. Cleanliness was great as well. Naomi runs a great air bnb, and we are planning on returning"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the nicest AirBnB we have ever stayed in! The accommodations were exactly as described if not better. The grounds were gorgeous. We enjoyed sitting around the pool and visiting with the cat that would wander the grounds during the day. The location is the best! We walked everywhere and had no need for any taxis or a rental car. I would love to return sometime. We just left and I miss it already.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great stay! Clean, well run, and the housekeepers are super sweet! The house was a perfect size for what we needed and there is a bike rack right out front if you're renting bikes!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my favorite AirBnB's I've ever stayed at. The cottage was a lot bigger than what I was expecting. The private hot tub is a huge plus and very secluded. The grounds surrounding the house are incredibly well-maintained and makes you feel like you just walked into a tropical oasis. The cottage is centrally located and a stones throw away from Duval St. where all the shops and restaurants are located. Naomi is also incredibly responsive via messenger. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an amazing time and will definitely be back. Everything was so clean and the staff very friendly. We absolutely loved the secluded feeling all the landscaping offered, it was absolutely beautiful. Great location, we could walk to everything. Very enjoyable!"

Would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great time! The staff is so helpful and friendly. The Romantic Retreat was exactly as described. The prophet is beautiful. It does get a little crowded in the pool area but the adult pool across the street was always empty and quiet. The hot tub is a plus! You‚Äôd never know you are only a block off Duval although the bar that backs to property can be a little noisy but it‚Äôs not too bad!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super nice location and cozy place

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location Location Location!!! Pictures and description don't do this place justice. While this unit is a part of a complex you never know it because each individual unit is not attached to any others. There is also only 4 units per complex. This place is so private yet only a couple steps away from the quiter end of Duval St. Easy Walking distance to everything you could want. Naomi was so gracious and had her staff show me several other larger units while were there. Already planning a trip to bring back the whole family and to rent out an entire complex.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was romantic, you get this fenced area with a hot tub all to yourself.

We had an issue where we needed someone to hold onto our luggage before and after our stay and she helped with that too. 10/10!!!"

We had a great time and will be back for sure."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is extremely close to Duval street (where the bars are), walking distance to the ""90 miles to Cuba"" sign, extremely close and within walking distance to a ton of fabulous restaurants. You don't need a car here. The trolley and bus are a block away and it's super easy to use. This place has everything! You only need to bring your toothpaste, toothbrush and clothes. Everything is provided. Think hotel amenites with that home feeling. The staff are helpful, wonderful and absolutely amazing"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very nice, amazing location only a half block from Duval. You can basically walk to everything from this location. Both pools were nicely heated for the January temperatures and the hot tub was wonderful to have on the cooler evenings. The staff were friendly and available during the day for our request for extra towels. The overall upkeep of the common areas share with other guests was very nice and unique. It was definitely it‚Äôs own little oasis. We would definitely stay here again."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! We loved our stay at Naomis place, it is exactly as listed, If not better! The amenities are wonderful and it is set up so cute, the pool is awesome and we loved the kitties running around :) it is so close to downtown but tucked away nicely that it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs downtown. So close to everything! Stay here you won‚Äôt be sorry!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super sweet spot in the heart of Key West only a block away from the epicenter which is Duvall street. Small but very romantic, nice heated pool, super friendly staff and centrally located. This is the place to be if you want to really enjoy all that Key West has to offer. So close to all the shops and bars. Can get a little noisy at night but it calms down after a bit. The area is filled with music and fun. I would highly recommend."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to stay if you want quietness, comfort and privacy. Recommend all day long"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cool! First off, there were beautiful lights and Christmas decorations everywhere which was so pretty. Romantic Retreat is so secluded and special. It really felt like it was in the middle of nowhere despite being so close to Duval St. All the decorations, plants and other little touches were nice. It was super clean, housekeeping super responsive, and a charming perfect space."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay in the Romantic Retreat! Very clean, bright and airy. The amenities were well thought out and there's everything one would need.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can‚Äôt go wrong here. The location is perfect, and the space and grounds are beautiful! Naomi is the perfect host and responds to all questions asap. We will definitely be back!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is gorgeous and cozy at the same time, beautiful lush landscaping and cute colorful decor inside and out. We also love the location central to downtown with reserved parking, but also quiet and peaceful. A friendly gray cat greeted us on our porch area at the Romantic Retreat and came to visit often, at one point there was an identical cat with him/her and we thought we were seeing double! There were also super fun Halloween decorations all over the front lawn, it really is a spectacle and I love any holiday spirit. The pool is warm with some fun noodles, a lot of seating as pictured, games and sunscreen etc. Everything is well maintained and clean. Using Alexa inside is convenient and also a ton of tv channels. The only slight let-down was an absence of free happy hour on Wednesday as advertised, but maybe it was across the street at the adults pool? Or just off-peak season or not enough other guests there at the time. Great hospitality overall and we would love to come back sometime."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely adorable place close to everything, but still quiet and relaxing. Loved it!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everybody was so personal
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and a few blocks down from old town. Walking distance to all the action on Duval street. Naomi was VERY responsive and accommodating to our needs. It is a secluded paradise.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, and everything you need for an amazing vacation!!!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to stay in Key West if you want to have direct access to everything, without being impacted by the noise and craziness of sitting directly on Duval St. It's incredible that being half a block away from Duval can feel so secluded, but it really does.
The Romantic Retreat is small, but well laid out and comfortable. The daily housekeeping is a nice added bonus. The door of the apartment opens onto the pool, and it the whole complex has a hidden feel to it.
One note about parking -- Naomi makes sure you get a street space but it is tight. Once you've parked you really don't want to move your car. If you're looking for a spot where you can come and go as you please in your car you might want to chat with the host before booking. But assuming you plan to walk and Uber, you won't be disappointed with this spot."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi was always quick to respond, place was very clean and close to a lot
of great spots. Perfect for 2 people. Pool is right outside the door with a nice area to bbq, eat and relax.
Duvall St. was a few steps away with many bars and restaurants. CVS across the street open 24hrs. Coffee shop and breakfast place on the corner üëçüèª"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a great location and a true Key West vibe, this is the place to stay. The staff was amazing and promptly took care of anything we needed. From the decor to the amenities, everything was perfect!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place with a great staff. Perfect for couples who want to spend their time both on location and out on Duval.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations!. Central location. Be sure to check out the Duval Loop. This local free bus service gets you to everywhere you want to go in key west for free. And when you get on the bus make sure you get a route map. There is also a Web page called KW transit.com. Make sure you save this on your phone because it saves you lots of time. Two recommendations: Blue Heaven for breakfast and Irish Kevins for after hours.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! A wonderful spot! I wish we could have stayed an extra day to see the orchid beside our door bloom! It‚Äôs a beautiful property! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place at a great location in Key West. You can walk everywhere. It became our oasis between excursions. Jesus is on site and a valuable asset as your concierge. We run and worth it!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Close enough to everything but also tucked away for quiet evenings.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a half dozen stays at a couple of different Key West resorts we decided to try Naomi‚Äôs AirBnB, the Romantic Retreat. We are both so happy we did! The photos don‚Äôt do it justice, the grounds are even lovelier than depicted, and our little slice of paradise was the perfect spot for our most relaxing vacation in years! Close to, but far enough away from, the hustle and bustle of Duval Street, we were able to walk to everyplace we wanted to get to, including Old Port and Mallory Square. We‚Äôre trying to decide when we can come back, and will book with Naomi again when we do."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! We recommend! Better if you are planning to rent a bike or a scooter, we don't recommend using car after the arrival. The location is perfect."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the lush greenery and palm trees around the pools. The pools had some shade at different times of the day so you could avoid the sun or sit in dappled sunlight. The whole vibe was serene and relaxing, and yet we were only a block or two away from restaurants, Duval st., etc."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to call home in Key West! Central location with great amenities! Highly recommended!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect everything! We will ba back!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiki was very relaxing and comfortable. The appropriate amount of amenities kept us supplied for our 2 night stay. We did have an issue with the marine toilet, but the host was immediately responsive and offered several remedies and options to work through it. This experience isn‚Äôt for everyone, but if you like adventure, you will not be disappointed. We absolutely loved our stay! We hope to do it again one day!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,breathtaking!!
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"With cost of the stay, cleaning service, and taxes, I personally feel that for $1000 per night should have had stained free sheets, at least a couple waters provided like most hotels do as this is a secluded ABNB, keurig was low on water which was only a big deal because water we brought was so limited, and water leaking on our bed due to rainy weather(They did provide PROMPT maintenance to patch the ceiling, but no discount was provided for this inconvenience/interruption ). I understand things happen, but at that price rate there should be regular maintenance to prevent these events from happening. Apart from the interruptions, the stay was a wonderful get away for my boyfriend and I. I would just recommend anyone going to take plenty of snacks and water, and be prepared to spend additional $55 per trip to and from shore ( $27 each with provided discount; 2 person min trip).
I would only return if the cost was half of what I spent as I didn‚Äôt feel $1000 per night was justified."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredibly experience. I highly recommend it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough great things about this little slice of heaven out in the ocean. The actual houseboat is incredibly clean and cozy. Really gives you the chance to get off grid and enjoy nature. The owner was amazing and responsive. The sunsets are to die for. Bring plenty of food and alcohol, and sunscreen. The fridge is quite small so make sure you bring a big ice chest. There‚Äôs no microwave just a small Keurig so keep that in mind when planning out your meals. If you‚Äôre on the fence, go ahead and book it, you won‚Äôt regret it! Will definitely book again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best decision to take advantage of staying here! beyond beautiful & unique!! Ship2Shore was fantastic to work with and got us out there right away. you won't regret renting this place! daytime, nighttime all of it was beautiful & different! The bed was so comfortable- but did I mention the views!! Even with wind and some waves the Tiki House barely moved. The experience is worth it & I'd recommend it to everyone!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We can‚Äôt speak highly enough about this place, it made for an experience of a lifetime and we were absolutely blown away by the beauty here! We were in awe from beginning to end. The hosts were very communicative and proactive so I felt fully informed about what we‚Äôd be experiencing and how to get to and from the tiki suite. We loved watching the fish, the sunset and sunrise were magical, and the stars were incredible because of how dark the sky was out there! We are grateful to have jumped at the opportunity to book this place, we heard from many that it‚Äôs typically booked up (and we can see why!!!)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated my 40th birthday in the best possible place. This was a magical getaway for us! Thank you for providing such an amazing experience.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Grand Tiki! Incredibly beautiful and peaceful location with crystal clear water, privacy, sunrises and sunsets to blow your mind. Run, don‚Äôt walk to this piece of heaven."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Grand Tiki is everything you think it would be and more. What a magical place! From the views to the privacy, it couldn't get more romantic. My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights and though we didn't want to leave, I think that was the perfect amount of time to stay. Without a microwave and only a small fridge and cooler to work with, you're limited with what you can eat and bring on board. Honestly, it wasn't an issue for us and don't let that deter you from staying in this little slice of heaven. 10/10 highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BOOK THIS PLACE NOW! If you are looking for the review to make your decision, THIS IS IT! Hands down number, the number 1 best experience of my life!
Ship to shore was a breeze! And there is a coupon code. Stayed with the love of my life for 2 nights and we had an experience and a memory to last a lifetime! Amazing views! Unreal sunsets, the glowing fish, the stars!
The king side bed is very comfortable. We used the shower on checkout day and it was perfect. We traveled in with a cooler where we kept all our food for 2 nights plus ice and drinks! The fridge is really small and only held a large juice container.
We packed too many clothes. You really don‚Äôt need more than the clothes you ride in with!
Awesome experience - the owner is really cool and happy to support someone‚Äôs hard work! And dream!
Already thinking about next time!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay. Our weather was windy, so we didn‚Äôt get in the water or enjoy the paddle boards. The snorkel gear did not include fins. The bed was comfortable and the place was clean. The chairs on the deck were cozy, but if the hammock was up, the other guest couldn‚Äôt sit in the chairs. We turned the lights on under the deck and saw many fish. It was fun. Like others have said, a way to cook food, would be helpful. Knowing this, we planned accordingly. The fridge kept our food cold. The water for the shower did get hot, but was short lived. The biggest negatives of our stay was that the generator ran almost the entire time. We contacted the owner and he had a maintenance man call. He had my husband make adjustments to the compressor and it shut off after two hours, but by turning on one light, the generator was back on. The other issue was the smell of sewage. I am
Not sure if the tank had treatment, or how it was vented, but the smell was awful a large part of our stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nothing like it. Endless views. Doors opened on all sides of the bed. Hammock easy to setup and the ocean rocks you. Made great use of the snorkel! Will be back üòä
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Words can‚Äôt describe what we got to experience at the tiki suite. It was our anniversary bring in and we booked grand tiki. I was little skeptical at the beginning about the safety on the boat but it is an amazing experience. The sunset view was breath taking. We spent most of our time watching the sky and water. It felt so calm. The checkin process was also easy. We carried cold sub, protein bars and water bottles for the night. Make sure to stock up on food so that you don‚Äôt have to go to shore again and again as it is little expensive. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic and peaceful getaway."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing to say the least, it was a perfect get away and just relax. It had everything you need except for a microwave and utensils so you had to bring sandwiches and snacks which wasn‚Äôt the greatest but everything else was awesome"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at the Grand Tiki this past Feb. It was as delightful as expected. Starting with the boat ferry ride out to the Tiki by the fabulous captain Lisa. She was such a delight to ride with, several trips back and forth. Make sure to have her point out the iguanas in the mangrove trees along the inner marina area before heading out, or heading in, from the bay. The accommodations were exactly as described. Great selection of classic DVDs to watch if you want to after dark, can someone say ""The Goonies""! The water in the bay was chilly, so if you're going in Feb or perhaps into early spring plan for that or be brave. The wicker chairs on the patio are comfortable, and deep Ithey are nailed to the deck, so no moving them around). The one thing the Tiki could use is a throw blanket for chillier evenings this time of year, but that is a minor nit. The sunsets were 10+ and the most wonderful I've ever seen. Be on the lookout for dolphins. Simply amazing time."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the Grand Tiki Suite! We enjoyed the paddle boards and the hammock. I wish we had brought a bag of ice but we survived without it Ôøº The tiki suite turned about 300¬∞ while we were there which was cool because we had different views.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I will def be back! Make sure you catch the sunset üåÖ it was the most beautiful sunset I‚Äôve ever seen. Perfect place for couples and romanticntic get aways
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just stayed one night but wish we had stayed for two. It was a magical experience and worth every penny. We had high expectations from the promotional literature that we had read ahead of our trip, and were delighted to have our expectations surpassed. We felt totally immersed in nature, all the while enjoying the amenities of a first class suite."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Tiki Suites experience was truly fantastic. We were both left wishing we could have stayed longer. I cannot recommend this place enough.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical place. Absolutely perfect.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greatly enjoy our time at the tiki. View was beautiful and the host gave very good instructions to make the arrival smooth.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommended for a couple, which is something totally different, organic. Everyone should have an experience like this"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing experience! I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. The information provided was perfect and the location incredibly unique and peaceful. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once in a lifetime experience.
So glad I found it. Honeymoon heaven. Beautiful. Peaceful. Private."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb stay of a lifetime! The most relaxing, surreal, and awe-inspiring experience of our lives. The Grand Tiki Suite was everything we could have hoped for, and MORE!!! The Tiki Suite is exactly as it's portrayed in the description, and as equally as wonderful as all of the reviews! It's got all you could need for a getaway and the hosts are wonderful. I would recommend bringing a cooler with some ice for your beverages."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiki was amazing. I would stay there forever if I could. The communication with the boat service that taxis you out to the tiki can be a little stiff with their policy which was a bummer but for the most part, it was an all around great experience that I highly recommend to anyone wanting to be secluded in the keys!! Pro tip, schedule your water taxis well in advance and don‚Äôt expect to change your time under any circumstances."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible!!!! Highly recommended
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly the most incredible experience, it feels like you are at the edge of the earth with no one around! The Ship 2 Shore Captain, Sandy, started our trip off with some very helpful information as well as was on time and extremely personable. The experience from start to finish was great. The host was extremely helpful and gave us all the information we needed in order to enjoy the most of our stay. We booked this tiki for our honeymoon and we are already talking about coming back in a few years to reminisce on the amazing experience we had."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Grand Tiki provided The The Grand Tiki had stunning views. We stayed a couple of days and enjoyed swimming, paddle boarding, and snorkeling. The downside was not being able to have any hot food. A small microwave would have been helped tremendously. The refrigerator is very small and does not cool well, so you have to bring a cooler, resulting in an additional baggage fee. I assumed that by booking the reservation, the initial ride to the Tiki and back only would be included, but that is also an additional charge. The shower did not get warm, so we took cold showers, but the weather was hot, so it was very manageable. Overall, we loved it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our favorite thing we did in key west. The stay is absolutely amazing. We saw dolphins, TONS of fish, a sea turtle and even a hammerhead shark from a distance! My husband and I snorkeled around the tiki during the day, swam and laid out in the paddle boards. We sat up late with the underwater light on and saw hundreds of fish and listened to the tarpon jump all around us. The bed was really comfortable, the air was amazing. The views are absolutely breathtaking. We sat on the porch facing an empty ocean and watched the sunset and watched storms rolling past in the distant. Would do this again in a heartbeat, such an incredible experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed in the Grand Tiki Suite for my birthday. It was beautiful. The waves gently rocked us to sleep. It was so peaceful. We saw sting rays, schools of fish, snake birds, and dolphins. The Captains of the Ship to Shore boat shuttle were very friendly and kind. The ladder was a little tricky to use. The bed was so comfy. The tiki was so comfortable. I thought that it would be hot but it wasn't. I would recommend it to others. Great experience. Would definitely visit again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect privacy and perfect place ! There is no place to stay like that ! We loved it!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A truly unique experience! Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Must try!!!! I‚Äôve been to each before‚Äîthere is a reason it‚Äôs always booked
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked for our honeymoon! We absolutely loved the Tiki Suite. The host was very responsive with any concerns we had! Very private and very romantic!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was truly a cool experience.
The directions sent on how to use TV etc could be much better explained‚Ä¶. No big deal but the batteries dead in remote, just switched them out with another remote in the room. The Alexa did not work to turn lights off, but that no big deal either just as long as you scope out where the manual light are before dark.
Lol, I would suggest Ot to use the hammock‚Ä¶. It flips over‚Ä¶. I flipped and hit head on deck and into the water‚Ä¶.. I am sure it looked hilarious üòÇ‚Ä¶.. great addition, just know how to stabilize üòõ.
This place is extremely clean, the agency went thru for the Tiki are nice, the boat Taxi lady , Kelly with ship2shore was amazing‚Ä¶. I would love to go back, but during a Season it is not 800+ a night to only Ck in at 3:00 pm and out at 11:00 am
I would highly recommend if looking for a different experience!üòé
Over all I give a 5+!üòé"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! It's about a mile of shore, and the shuttle stops at 7pm.... you'll definitely want to stay a few days!"

The host was super helpful at all times"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fabulous stay! Was as described! Very comfortable. Got the best sunset ever! As a bonus, got an amazing front row seat of nature‚Äôs amazing fireworks (lightning) show far in the distance late at night. Loved the lighting under the deck, saw shrimps, crabs, a loggerhead, a multitude of fish, pelicans and other birds! A memorable experience! Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and communication. One issue that the host resolved quickly. Highly reccomend and great views if you want to getaway.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was the best experience of my life, a magical place to disconnect completely, meditate to meet yourself, share with a couple or friend is amazing. I recommend it 100% do not hesitate to choose this place. It has an impressive energy and I would definitely come back ü•πü•π‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

Most amazing sunset i've ever seen in my life."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a beautiful amazing place honestly. We loved it truly. It was romantic and cozy
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My only regret with this Airbnb is that I couldn‚Äôt stay longer. Absolutely a once in a lifetime experience, and was perfect for my best friend on his birthday. Tranquil, beautiful and a place that I will make sure I come back to. It was sparkling clean, very thorough instructions, and a very responsive host. I cannot wait to stay here again and stay for another night longer. :) don‚Äôt question it, book it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Also ship2shore was one of the most responsive and helpful companies I‚Äôve ever come across. So thank you to the host for suggesting them specifically!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely no regrets. My friend and I stayed at the ‚ÄúThe Grand Tiki Suite‚Äù, and the place was incredible amazing. This so far on of the best experiences that I l had. You will wake up with a beautiful sunrise and go to sleep watching a extraordinary sunset."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Take the drive down to the keys and save yourself a flight across the world. This place is spot on perfect. Peaceful. Amazing views. Perfect for you and your loved one to disconnect from the madness and reconnect with each other. Highly recommended.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place for a getaway
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easily the best Airbnb of all time. Great view, easy to find the dock, and the most peaceful and serene location I‚Äôve ever stayed. The bay was so calm and the fish were super active in the moonlight. If you are thinking of booking this, just do it. You will not regret it one bit. Worth every penny!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was magical.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this once in a lifetime type of stay!!! I have never felt so relaxed and peaceful after leaving a two day vacation at The Grand Tiki. I would come back in a heartbeat!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing! So, so peaceful!
Will definitely come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, private and gorgeous sunset views. Spent hours just sitting on the deck watching the water. A unique experience and will definitely try to get back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was amazing! We celebrated our anniversary and it was very private and relaxing and incredible! Lots of beautiful fish to see and amazing surroundings! Host was very responsive with any of my questions, will be booking again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot for sure! Great sunsets, private, completely surrounded by water. Watched fish at night, stars are amazing. Pack wisely, a trip to shore is $60 round trip per person and needs to be set up in advance. WiFi worked just fine, did not stream anything. Also FYI my husbands CPAP worked perfectly all night with electric that is provided.
Would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We could not have loved our stay at The Grande Tiki more! It was a unique, beautiful, and easy experience. We were very comfortable there and loved the privacy. We were able to see lots of interesting fish when we turned on the underwater lights at night. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we rented the tiki for the weekend to celebrate my husband's birthday, for such a short trip it is hands down one of our favorites we've been on! being able to keep the doors open and hearing the waves at night made me sleep like a baby! it's very private and intimate & allowed us to completely reset. we seen dolphins during the sunset the first night we arrived and the next day seen tons of fish, small fish, big fish, string rays, and even a gaint mantra!! the paddle boards and snorkels were a great touch & tons of fun! we will most definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this tiki as a Valentine‚Äôs Day gift to my husband!! It was very peaceful. The perfect place to connect, spend quality time, and rest."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is amazing. Breathtaking, unique. There truly is nothing like it. Being on the water, having no one around. It was good for the soul. Somethings to consider, you have to get a boating license (cost 10 dollars, 25 questions), have to schedule transport (to and from), and be very prepared with water/food/toiletries. Amazing stay. Loved it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing experience, everything way perfect & extremely serene. The fish were at least 4-5ft swimming up to the house at night with the ocean light on. It helps you realize how small we are on this big blessing we call earth! It was more than worth it & we will be back often when we need a break from humanity.‚ô•Ô∏èüåç"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our two night stay was awesome! The bed is super comfortable and the tv lifts out by remote control from the foot of the bed. We really didn‚Äôt watch it though we relaxed and watched the pelicans and dolphins. The shuttle service worked very well. To stay in a floating tiki suite was more than just memorable it was an over the top amazing experience! Thank you!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the most amazing place I‚Äôve been. I‚Äôll come back again for sure!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you enjoy peace, stillness, bird watching, diving/snorkeling and literally living on the ocean in basically solitude, this is your place. Got to spend a whole day with a manatee and watched some of the most beautiful sunsets and sunrises I‚Äôve ever seen. Highly recommend staying at least 2 nights. The host was also very friendly, and ship2shore which they recommend was also a great company."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay on the Tiki Suite, enjoyed the breeze and the gentle rocking of the boat! Definitely recommend this, was a great way to spend our 20th wedding anniversary!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Celebrated our 11th year anniversary here. Best decision ever. Only wish we had a microwave.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing and will definitely recommend and stay again!!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An experience that I highly recommend! It was magical. It's still a good thing you'd expect!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. I have never been so relaxed. I only wish it had a bigger and better ladder with handles to get in and out of the water. It was a very small ladder with no handles on the deck to help. They brought gas and water everyday for the tank and generator. Becareful not to use a lot of toilet paper, the toilet is hard to flush because the opening is so little."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely unique experience, beautiful sunsets, relaxing cool evenings and lovely sunrise. Will definite do it again. worth every penny ."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiki Grande is exactly as listed. It is a remote, luxurious, glamping-adjacent experience. We had a great time. Beautiful! Would recommend"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience! Highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So relaxing! A much needed escape from everything and everyone. Lol cold and choppy waters, as we picked the coldest days possible ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (totally still worth it). I will definitely do it again at a hot time."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice secluded get away in the water. Transportation is pricy though the people were very sweet. We enjoyed our short stay.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time celebrating her birthday in the Grand Tiki. The Grand Tiki is exactly what you would imagine- beautiful, secluded and peaceful. The instructions given by the host are spot on , making the trip logistics seamless if you follow them. As they mention, bring some soap and shampoo if you need, some plastic silverware and a couple yeti cups go a long way as well. We also brought a small Bluetooth speaker. This is such a unique experience and we had a wonderful time.
The second afternoon we stayed, there was some kind of issue with the septic tank which created a bit of a smell. After sending someone out immediately to check it, the issue was acknowledged and the host sent me a partial refund for the inconvenience. Although this was not an ideal way to end our trip, I thought it was handled professionally by the host. This is a unique experience that does the mind, body, and soul good. If you have the means, I highly recommend a stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a night, absolutely fabulous. Calm shallow ocean in mid December. We had a lot of fun using the two paddleboard and snorkeling gear to explore around. TV and blue ray reader were a great plus. Not too far from the short so light pollution exists. It's a must to stay, highly recommend for anniversary or proposal."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a unique find and will definitely do it again. We spent the days PaddleBoarding, Snorkeling, Playing games and just enjoying the beautiful views. Even though it‚Äôs open water you feel very private.
I would recommend to pack a lot of ice in a cooler. The refrigerator does not get very cold, even on the lowest setting.
Thanks Again Tiki Suites!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic experience overall. So relaxing and truly a great way to do nothing for a couple days.
The mini-fridge was not working when we got there and they fixed it the next day when they came by to refill the water. Also the toilet macerater stopped working and they needed to fix that as well which took an hour and smelled bad for a while.
Bring more ice than you think."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than advertised! Simple as that.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous Tiki, fantastic location, amazing views, and literally gets you away from everything & everyone so you can really enjoy the quiet, peaceful waves (& fish!) & the gorgeous sky. Whether you want a romantic getaway or just some solitude in a beautiful place, this is where to be!! Just need to bring drinks & food (that doesn‚Äôt need to be heated‚Ä¶we made sandwiches) & you‚Äôre all set. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a dream! We highly recommend this experience. The tiki was perfect, absolutely private, very quick response from the host when we had a question (though they did a great job outlining everything for you, eliminating the need for any questions).

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home. It was very relaxing, and I was surprised how comfortable the bed was. We had the doors open all day for a nice breeze, it‚Äôs nice that there are no mosquitoes out there. Perfect place for us to get away on our honeymoon."

I feel truly blessed to have been able to celebrate my 25th anniversary in absolute paradise for 3 days . Words cannot explain just how beautiful the Grand Tiki Suite is in person , truly breathtaking!! Everything was PERFECT! Worth every penny, maybe more !!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantasy Island is what I would call this place. Just private seductive beauty. Spent a week in key west and the sunsets here were by far the best. Our boat drifted directly into the west allowing us to lay in bed and watch the beauty unfold. BOOK THIS! You won't regret it.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are thinking about booking it, just do it amazing experience definitely will repeat"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiki suite‚Äôs was exactly what we were hoping for. I booked tikisuites for a friend of mine and myself for my birthday and we were not disappointed. The place is clean and everything you could NEED is there. The hosts respond immediately and are so gracious and helpful. While you‚Äôre staying onboard you need to use their transportation company which is the only negative thing I have to say. The price for a 3.5min boat ride they compare to the price of a plane ride on the website- and if you‚Äôre a decent person you should tip. We stayed for a few days and unfortunately my friend got sick and I had to go into town each day. I think it‚Äôs completely understandable to have to pay for any trip you make during the duration of your stay- plus tip for host operators- but I don‚Äôt love that you‚Äôre expected to pay for transportation to and from the dock on the days you check in and check out. We also waited until noon for our ship to shore shuttle the day we left after being told we had to depart by 11 and there was no late check out. We were packed and fully clothed on the deck for an hour. All said and done the small hiccups we‚Äôre exactly that and I would stay again in a heartbeat. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing and unforgettable time at the tiki house! It‚Äôs a very special place to unwind and disconnect from the world. Will be coming back and recommend 110%
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place for a celebration of a special day, in our case we were celebrating 13 years of marriage, it is a magical place, where you find tranquility and peace of mind, in the afternoon you only hear the sound of Del Mar, watch the sunset and wake up to see the sunrise is something unforgettable, 100% recommended for special occasions, thanks for everything."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely an amazing night! Sunset views were amazing. Tiki was very comfortable. The lights under the tiki attract SOOO many fish at night. It is beautiful to just sit outside and watch them.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing wish we had stayed one more day!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible experience!! If in Key West definitely book a night here! Great communication and took care of us quickly when we had questions.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Breathtaking is the only way to describe our 11th Anniversary stay. From the sunset to the sunrise, everything was perfect. Bluetooth music, cool breezes (even in July), spectacular views, spacious, secluded, romantic lighting, etc. It was just perfect. We had the most amazing time. Wish we would've booked 2 nights but we are already planning on returning."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at the grand tiki was tranquil. The sunsets had us amazed . The bed was comfy .
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fantastic experience! Next time I want to stay for a few nights! Loved every single second. Place was great and the communication with the host was perfect! 5 stars all the way!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing!!! Paddleboarding, snorkeling, and relaxing during the day!!! Putting the lights in under the hut at night and watching all of the fish and nurse sharks at night!!! It was simply amazing!!! Zack and Alyssa who were the boat shuttle drivers were so amazing!! We didn‚Äôt leave this place for 48 hours straight ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This by far was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had. Everything about this place was magic. Taking the water taxi was pretty cool. We took 2 coolers and used one that they had for spare ice and came prepared with food since we did not leave the tiki. We brought a couple of blue ray movies and noticed they had a couple of options just in case which was nice. Paddle boarding was super fun;
The water was perfect and the sunset
/sunrise we‚Äôre breathtaking. My husband and I will definitely be back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful experience! We stayed for two night and I‚Äôm so glad we did! We snorkeled and relaxed. The views were amazing! It rained and stormed both nights that we were there and we felt completely safe.
Helpful info- After we got off the plane in Key West, we stopped at Publix and bought a prepared sandwich platter, ice, yogurt, fruit and breakfast muffins. Then we took an Uber to the dock to ride out to the house. We ended up having plenty of food. Be sure to bring your own plastic ware and plenty of ice. There is a nice cooler that did great keeping our food cold. The only think I wish that I would have brought was paper napkins or paper towels.
Overall, It was really an experience that we will cherish forever!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing! Beautiful sunset views.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Tiki!! The views are just stunning. The sunset was a delight. The bed was comfortable and we closed up the Tiki about 10:00 and the AC cooled it down slowly for a comfortable sleep. The shower water goes a long way to wash the sea water and sweat off from the day. Everything was very clean. We picked up deli-sandwiches before departure and snacks and drinks. We also took ten pounds of ice out in a disposable cooler and transferred it over to their nicer cooler upon arrival. Granted the ice was almost melted by morning I don‚Äôt know what you do about that if you stay more than one night because the fridge is very tiny. Coffee was plentiful as was sugar and creamer. Take your toiletries and just prepare for an amazing time. We watched a DVD before drifting off to sleep. The sunrise was beautiful and so was the morning. This is truly a unique experience and I would highly recommend it and stay again if given the chance. It‚Äôs awesome to just lay in that bed with all the doors open and see the beauty of it all. I can‚Äôt imagine you being disappointed unless the weather was just horrible. We saw lots of little fishes swim by. Really on the top of my all time favorite Airbnb stays.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was an amazing experience we had an amazing time we will definitely be doing this again everything was beautiful we really enjoyed our anniversary trip thank you so much
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed here for our 15th anniversary celebration. It was such a unique experience and made our celebration so memorable! We booked a boat to shuttle us out there and were pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and amenities. We have never stayed in a place like this and truly enjoyed going to bed watching the sunset and waking to the sunrise. Opening the doors on all 3 sides and feeling the breeze was so pleasant. We also loved the lights underneath the tiki that we turned on at night and watched the fish swim around. I can‚Äôt say enough about this phenomenal place! Book it NOW!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best of my life
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience. Be aware that you must plan ahead for transport and if you are planning any early morning trips or late evening trips into key west it can be difficult to get back and forth. We made it work thanks to a very attentive and flexible captain. Highly recommend this airbnb. Bed was super comfy. Make sure to bring toiletries but pack light. There is a nice kurig and coffee and creamer provided.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a beautiful place. Very peaceful and relaxing. Directions were clear and easy to follow.
Ship2Shore did an amazing job and is super easy to work with if you need to go back to land.
I would absolutely do this again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the BEST vacation that we have ever had till date. If you are contemplating this place, just book it and you would not regret it!
It truly was a memorable experience for us!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great. Fun.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A word doesn‚Äôt exist to describe the experience. Definitely doing this again
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome place will be back
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, great communication and very accommodating! It was a great experience."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to be left alone - this is perfect! My husband and I came here to unwind after getting married this weekend and it was worth every penny. From the pleasant boat ride there and back to the school of fish that lived below, everything about our stay was special. Hope to get the chance to stay again soon."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Most beautiful, peaceful and serene experience of my entire life. Beyond expectations. Pictures do not do this place justice. Will definitely be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The BEST place to be in the keys!!! Everything was perfect & we were so secluded! Put this on your bucket list if you want that bora bora vibe!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cool stay!! They have literally thought of everything you‚Äôll want and need too! Definitely recommend staying atleast 2 nights to spend time seeing the sunset and sunrise! Would book again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing!!! You won‚Äôt regret your stay here! The Grande Tiki is so comfortable and secluded away from everything. It‚Äôs a boat so take some motion sickness pills. I don‚Äôt do well with motion well but I took my pills and was fine the entire weekend! The Tiki has everything you need. Make sure you buy some water and ice before you get out there. Ship2Shore shuttle is incredible! Super friendly and accommodating. Even after the cold front moved through Chris got us back safe to the Tiki.
If you are worried about not getting your money worth, do not stress at all! I recommend staying more time on the tiki then inland. When we stay again we will just stay the entire time out there. Enjoy the sun, Sound of the ocean, the paddle boards that are provided and snorkeling! Finally, the best sunset we have seen in our lives. We didn‚Äôt want it to end! Thank you for you hospitality and stay!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great concept and get away! I would recommend. Prepare for ‚Äúoff the grid‚Äù living

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place was incredible! It's going to be a Key West travel destination spot on its own for us!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely one of the most unique experiences we have ever had. Worth every penny, and a must-do if you're in the Key West area. The suite is comfortable, the view is unmatched, and one of the most fun possible locations.
The host was extremely responsive and provided excellent communication.
Five stars and highly-recommend you staying here!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, relaxation at its finest, paddle boards and snorkel gear were a great addition. Coffee was a perfect touch for morning times. So peaceful laying in the hammock watching the sun come up, laying in the hammock listening to the water lap the bottom of The tiki hut. Highly recommend!!!!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is your sign.....if you are thinking of booking the tiki - DO IT!!! You will not regret it at all. I would also recommend the water shuttle service listed. Captain Mark was prompt, professional, and friendly."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs exactly as pictured! Out in the water away from anyone. We recommend 2 nights so you have a full day in between. We did and absolutely loved it. Quiet, perfect getaway."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything we ever dreamed!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful location. Even though we went during a chilly day we enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed watching the sunset and the stars at night. It was a very different and unique experience.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication with the host was great! Travel experience to the Tiki was great also! Make sure you start recording once you get closeüòÜ The room was clean everything was perfect! Make sure to bring a cooler and finger foods! We left and went out for food but couldn‚Äôt wait to get back! The sunrise & sunset is amazing! I can‚Äôt wait to go back!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing, the tiki is just breathtaking, private, amazing people for the ship to shuttle and water/fuel.
Very romantic and unique. We read all the reviews and were prepared with things to make sandwiches and snacks and we were fine we stayed 2 nights and went to explore key west on one of the days. 2 nights was perfect, next time I might do 3 if it was warmer weather! Just amazing once in a lifetime experience!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved everything about this experience! We were able to swim and watch the sunset and sunrise! It was AMAZING!!! We were able to watch a movie with all the doors open and it was amazing! Highly recommend it.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience 10/10!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôd highly recommend this to anyone I know! If you want that bora bora over water bungalow feel worn out getting out the country this is the place to go! Water was so fun to swim in, so many small fishes under the boat. You barely feel any boat rocking super sturdy and such a indescribable experience.. from the sunset to sunrise all around wonderful."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were only there for one night but it was so magical and amazing. it was far enough away from other boats that you get a lot of privacy but not so far that it becomes scary haha. super comfortable and unique. Can't wait to try again in the future!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, it wasn't enough. Small school of fish under the tiki and even saw a sea turtle swim not too far away. Enjoyed laying in hammock."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of if not the best place we have ever stayed. Romantic, secluded & incredibly beautiful. Sunrise & Sunsets are spectacular. Our host & the staff were exemplary. Last but not least the water taxi driver was knowledgeable and easy to speak with. He shared his local knowledge & was flexible with us."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous views! This may be obvious to some but I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to feel like being on a boat. I just thought it was a house like those overwater bungalows. If you get sea sick easily there is some medicine on board but expect to feel nausea and plan ahead!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing experience would love to return
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, amazing"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time is definitely a nice place if you would like to just unplug from the woods for a bit. Spent my birthday here in nature couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience host was very helpful and responds quickly
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the Grand Tiki.
You NEED two nights! Trust me one sunset/sunrise just isn‚Äôt enough! The views are beautiful at anytime of the day or night. Bring light food/snacks and ice. You don‚Äôt need much!
Leave the world behind and enjoy!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Host was very responsive and the hut is as perfect as the pictures! They provide a large cooler which was nice although we didn't use it. The place was equipped with k-cups and creamers and an awesome movie selection for the DVD player. The bed and hammock were very comfortable! If you want to see the most amazing starry sky make sure to turn all the lights off when you're hanging on the deck at night. We loved our stay here and were huge fans of the shuttle service recommended by the host. Everything was perfect. :)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great experience. We stayed one day/night and that was plenty to get the experience.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for gave us the opportunity to live this day that we had in this amazing place . Anyone that have the opportunity to go you should go because I will be an unforgettable time . I am going back soon for sure .
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,EXCELLENT AND UNIQUE EXPERIENCE!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An indisputably romantic stay in the middle of the sea
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than expected! It was a dream! Highly recommend!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a unique experience In the United States! It was our first time in Key West, and we had the BEST time! We stayed for 3 nights, and that was the perfect amount of time to go into town one night to explore and still have a few days in the Tiki of uninterrupted relaxation.
Our boat taxi guy, Mark was phenomenal! He made the process super easy, and was always on time and super accommodating. He recommend the ""Boat House"" restaurant for happy hour, and it was the BEST. If you are going into town, you have to hit this place up for their happy our appetizers and drinks! Truly amazing food and super cheap!
It rained the whole day on our one day, but that didn't get us down, We just hung out inside and relaxed all day long. We flew in from PA, so we really had to play things out logistically. We ubered basically everywhere in town. When we got there we stop at the Publix and got food/drinks for our stay. We basically got lunch meats and snacks that we could easily eat. There is a very tiny fridge and a cooler. so definitely bring Ice. We brought Yeti cups to keep our drinks cold as well, since there is only coffee cups provided. We got to do a little bit of everything the tiki suites offered (snorkeling right off the tiki (we saw so many fish + jellyfish) , paddle boarding, hammock, swimming etc.
Truly unbeatable views all around. It felt super private, and you can barely see the other Tiki. We did have a random boat drive by super close and try and nose into the tiki (a bit embarrassing, lol) but they drove right by and didn't bother us again. The gas and water was filled daily, and he was super friendly and still respected our privacy.
The water for showers was nice and hot, and actually one tank lasted us the whole duration of our stay and we each took 1-2 showers a day. It was super humid when we were there , but The air worked great!
It really is a key west Icon, and everyone was asking where we were, and could not believe we were in Key West! We will definitely remember this trip of a lifetime and hope to come back to key west sometime, maybe if a new Tiki get built ;)"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an amazing experience. Absolutely loved it!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful, relaxing, and enjoyable.
I was worried about motion sickness but had no issues at all.
Sea life was very entertaining.
Tiki suite was clean, bed was very comfortable, and views were breathtaking."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best experience! I totally recommend it
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay. Book it, you will not regret it. Parking is free. Ship2shore was great highly recommend them for a water taxi. Everyone is super friendly. The stay was awesome and worth the experience. Try and book for 2 nights if possible and bring ice. There is a small cooler there and mini fridge."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience!!! Definitely recommend!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Superb sunsets! Comfortable bed. 30 gallons of water was not an issue and my wife has a head full of long hair. A night storm did blow throw pretty strong but the tile was dry and comfortable inside. AC worked well. Nothing to heat your food and the mini fridge is really small. Bring a cooler full of ice. Currents were not bad at all and I swam and paddle boarded both days. The water was 5-7‚Äô around the tiki and a short swim away you could stand in knee deep water. Not too much sea life though there was a few fish under the tiki.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,With no hesitation you guys should definitely book this place. It‚Äôs everything you‚Äôd expect plus more !!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was breathtaking and very calming to be here. The water was amazing to be on but the stay was amazing! Very clean, the host responded promptly and also helped me switch between the original tiki and grand tiki last minute with no issues. Oh! And I proposed here. My soon to be wife loved every moment of this place. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing üî•üî•üî•üî•
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an incredible place to disconnect from everything and be yourself! I will definitely be back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic long weekend getaway on the Grand Tiki. Great place to reconnect with your significant other, yourself and nature. Wonderful sunsets and sunrises! Recommend you bring a small cooler, ice, dry ice, water, alcohol, snacks, utensils and easy finger foods as there is only a very small refrigerator and no microwave. There are paddle boards, snorkel gear, TV and DVDs available if you are inclined to use. We found the Grand Tiki Suite very comfortable and the host was easily available to any questions or concerns. Transportation to and from the boat was very easy to set up. This vacation exceeded our expectations and we highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolute Paradise ‚Ä¶.. don‚Äôt hesitate ‚Ä¶ totally worth it ‚Ä¶ pack light you need less than you think üíô
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was everything we had hoped for. Bring a little cooler along if staying for a few days, as well as food and plan to have the most relaxing stay ever."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing!!!! It was beyond beautiful and peaceful. Lovers , friends , whom ever take this unforgettable experience. You won‚Äôt be disappointed at all. We celebrated my fianc√© 36th birthday at the Tiki Suites. The suites was everything we expected plus more. The sound of the ocean, rain and thunderstorms and lightning throughout the night was absolutely beautiful. Keep in mind the boat does move which is perfectly fine. If you get sea sick, the tiki suites does have motions sickness pills to help you settle down and enjoy the beautiful tiki suites. It‚Äôs basically glamping in the middle of the ocean. They thought of every detail. The life vest, hammock, paddleboards, dvd movies, a 50‚Äù inch Samsung tv (you can pretty much watch whatever you want and connect to your Netflix account). Pretty amazing!! We used the AC at night as it got a little hot. A mini fridge, cooler, K-Cup (pods/ sugar/cream was all provided to make your own coffee), beach and bath towels were all supplied. As others have noted, the fridge is tiny but just fine for chilling mini sodas, water bottles, salads and salad dressing as we used for our foods/ drinks. Must remember to bring ice, water and food if you don‚Äôt plan on traveling back and forth to land. We stayed 2nights and never left to go to land unless it was time to depart from the tiki suites. Our 2 night stay gave us plenty of time to enjoy, relax and soak in the sunshine, ocean, and peace. Oh my! Let‚Äôs talk about the comfortable California king bed! I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 and my fianc√© is 6‚Äô7!! The bed was Amazing. Finally our legs didn‚Äôt hang off the bed. We slept like babies on the bed. The water taxi there and back was easy to book and use for outbound/ inbound water taxi rides. Ms. Altah our host was responsive and easy to work with from the moment I booked it. We had issues with our flight being delayed which put us in a situation to miss our departure time for the water taxi. I emailed Ms. Altah and within minutes she replied back letting me know to keep her posted and to inform the water taxi company. I contacted the water taxi, he was willing to work with us and told me to contact him as soon as we got an update. Everything worked out perfectly fine. We made it to the taxi for our set departure time. But, overall Ms. Altah and the water taxi company were both quick to respond and assist us with our trip. I highly recommend the Tiki Suites for anyone up for an amazing adventure and an unforgettable once in a lifetime experience. Please keep in mind this is similar to glamping just in the middle of the ocean. Understand, that things do happen but Ms. Altah and her crew will be quick to assist and fix the problem. Someone comes out during the afternoon hours to fill the water tank up but they‚Äôre completely out of your way and only enter the front of the deck. However, we had a good conversation with the guy who came out to fill the water tank up. Everyone was very welcoming, warming and pleasant to work with. Don‚Äôt forget to book your tiki suites experience. I‚Äôll be back again but I‚Äôm going to book a week stay. I loved it. Thank you for an awesome experience. My fianc√© can‚Äôt stop talking about it. Remember, the cost for the tiki suites you‚Äôre paying for a different kind of peace and experience that you will never forget or stop talking about. So book it. Love Alston"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an experience of a LIFETIME.
Back in March, I was on Instagram one night & one of the travel pages I follow posted a reel of this place & initially I thought, ‚Äúthis has to be Bora Bora, the Maldives or somewhere.‚Äù However, to my surprise when I looked at the location I saw Key West & it was ironic because for my bday last December, I was contemplating on going to Key West but wanted to visit another place first before I came here. As soon as I saw this place I put Key West back on my radar & at 9am the next morning found it in Airbnb booked completely for the whole year until February 2022 & the only day within this year I could find was for a random Tuesday in September & I booked on the spot. I invited one of my girlfriend‚Äôs whose bdays fell on the same week which was perfect for her.
We thoroughly enjoyed this placed it provided everything we needed & didn‚Äôt expect for enjoyed. We had a grand awesome time. It‚Äôs definitely worth every penny & since posting it on IG last night. I don‚Äôt know how many people including my manager have hit me up trying to stay here & wanting more info. My cousin even put a picture of it in our family‚Äôs group chat. The locals in the area are very nice as well. I hope to come back one day & stay longer."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing time! Very unique experience. Clean and well thought out use of space.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a one-of-a-kind find!!! The most relaxing and chill trip in the most beautiful setting!! Tips- take ice! It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to bring a cooler with a second bag of ice if you like ice in your drinks or have much cold food because the fridge is small. They had a fabulous cooler for us to use that held our ice but if we had brought more than a sandwich each and a ring of shrimp cocktail to be cold we would have been in trouble. This is the most beautiful and clean room!!!! We will definitely be back!!! The air conditioning was wonderful, just book this!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! What an incredible experience this was. Perfect getaway for 2 nights to be off grid during the pandemic. The place was clean and super cute. We had an issue with the a/c but the host responded effectively. You don‚Äôt need to pack too much clothes- we literally stayed in our bathing suits all day. There‚Äôs only a small fridge and coffee maker in the suite. So you definitely need to prepare your food/snacks. We brought some ramen noodles and used the hot water from the coffee maker. We also had food delivered to us (luckily) by the captain from a Thai place right at the pier. It was delicious! A must stop. The other option was to catch a water taxi back to land and venture out. This can get expensive as it‚Äôs $60/2people RT. For 2 days, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and we did fine with the food we brought. The temp was around 85-90 but the a/c was cool enough in the suite. Although the water wasn‚Äôt as clear as I imagined, we saw many fish, sting rays, and dolphins. Sunrise and sunset were beautiful. Overall, this was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it!!!"

They thought of every detail... from the paddleboards and hammock, down to the classic dvd movies like Goonies, Kill Bill, Pretty Women & Top Gun. We used the AC at night as it is hot in August in the Keys. Plush bath and beach towels are supplied. As others have noted, the fridge is tiny but just fine for chilling wine, cheese and grapes for a one night stay. We only stayed one night but in retrospect, we should have booked a minimum of 2 nights. Just as we were getting the hang of it and enjoying the water, it was time to leave. The water taxi there and back was easy to book and use and Altah our host was responsive and easy to work with. We highly recommend the Suite for anyone up for an adventure and an unforgettable experience."

I had no worries, it's safe and you have everything you need for an emergency. And we got to experience it with complete silence. Ac unit worked great and our stay overall was totally worth it. It feel like two days wasn't enough!"
2021-08-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was slow or non existent, AC was not working and no one ever came out to fix it, we reported the issue at 4pm and waited til 6pm and no one came. Had to call the coast guard to send someone to get us off of the boat."

The only thing I would‚Äôve like to had was my water shoes (don‚Äôt forget them!). We had a issue with the AC one night but overall, it was awesome."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect to keep all of the doors and windows open to catch that nice breeze.
Come with lots of sunscreen
Bring a few good books
Internet is available but not for streaming and even FaceTime was hard.
Bring snacks but note that the fridge is small"

We stayed two nights (less than that won‚Äôt be enough) and I think that‚Äôs the time you need to live the whole experience. We went to celebrate our 4th anniversary and as a couple that likes to travel around the world, I could say this has been one of the best experiences we have had in our different trips.
Take enough tester with you, and you don‚Äôt really need much clothes (you will always be wearing your bathing suits I am not lying). And we set a very romantic dinner for the first night. We took everything we needed starting from the plastic champagne glasses till the decorative plates and fantastic food for that romantic night with electric candles as well (just giving you ideas of what to do lol).
You will feel safe and the structure is very strong as well. So, don‚Äôt be afraid of experiencing this at all!"

,,,"We had serious safety and cleanliness issues. We were initially scheduled to check into the Airbnb at 3pm. Due to extreme weather conditions (tornado warning, floods, thunder & lightening storm) we messaged Liam that morning our concerns for our safety staying on the house boat given the cancellations of ferries & flights to Key West. Liam gave us no option to cancel, and instead pushed the check in to 5pm as he assured us the storm would pass. The storm did not pass. Liam‚Äôs partner drove us to the house boat in a very small dingy and all of our stuff got soaked. She handed us two disgusting stained beach towels for us to bathe with. She also climbed on the bed (which had stained & dirty sheets) with her bare feet. I understand this is a ‚Äúglamping‚Äù experience, but you shouldn‚Äôt stay here if there‚Äôs any sign of bad weather. We were unable to sleep. Liam tried to help with an early pickup during a break in the storm. However the dingy engine died and we had to get an alternate ride."
,,,"Location is nowhere near shore and is much further than anticipated. Make sure you don‚Äôt plan on leaving the houseboat at night or early in the morning. Booked 2 nights, only stayed 1 so we could be in Key West for a night.
Liam was completely disrespectful and unprofessional. Charged us a ‚Äúbeer tax‚Äù on trip out. He offered to pick us up at 6:45am in order for us to make it to the Dry Tortugas tour at 7:45. Unresponsive to several calls/texts. He was ultimately 40 minutes late, telling us his engine wouldn‚Äôt start. Offered no apology, and when faced with our frustrations, began arguing with my fianc√©. While transferring bags into his boat, he fell into the water and claimed it was my fianc√©‚Äôs fault for not holding the boat. Insisted we wouldn‚Äôt be late to our tour, which cost over $400. Again, he offered to come pick us up in the morning. We would have kayaked to shore earlier had he not offered. He made what was supposed to be the most exciting part of our trip a nightmare."
,,,"This was supposed to be a romantic getaway with my partner and it turned into a nightmare! First off he was late, then when we got to the boat it was not like the pictures at all it needed lots of maintenance. Over night the winds were high and the windows kept slamming over, and over again. Liam said his brother would give us transportation back to the land for one day since we had a two night stay but after he left never responded with the number. The next morning I kept asking for the number but no response till 2pm in the afternoon. We had to tell a boat service it was an emergency. Finally around 8pm when we go ahold of his brother we planned to meet at 10pm he never showed, and finally when we contacted him he told us he broke down. Coincidentally, When we reached out to Liam he said the same thing and stopped responding at 12am we had to sleep in our rental car and ask someone to give us another emergency ride to get our belongings. Still never heard from Liam.. this was awful!"
,,,"Poor overall experience. Be warned of issues like being locked inside of your guest house with no escape, which led to maintenance being unable to open our door to provide an exit and police being called. Poor host and poor communication after incident. Still working to resolve this matter on an alternative end."
,,,You have to take a test before you can board the boat
