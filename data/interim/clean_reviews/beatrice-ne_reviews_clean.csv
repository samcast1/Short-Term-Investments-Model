2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a nice house with plenty of room for 8 people. However odd it seams, my favorite thing about it is the selection of mattresses. As someone with a bad back, mattress selection is important for me. There are four beds and they all have different levels of firmness. No matter your firmness preference, there is likely a bed in the house that will work for you. The house is clean, the neighborhood is quiet, it’s easy to find, and it is very private"

We got in somewhat late, and though the owner's place was the house next door, we did not need to disturb them to get in. The beds were covered in beautiful, country quilts and were SO comfortable. The bathrooms had lots of soft, fluffy towels. The kitchen had everything we needed. And on a hot August day, the air conditioning was much appreciated. Thank you so much for the oasis in the miles and miles of corn and pavement in our day!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Troy responded in timely manner to my questions. House was easy to find along with a peaceful countryside surrounding. The shower made a very loud screeching noise when in use and the house was a bit dusty, but other then that we weren't there long. I didn't understand why it cost more for 4 people compared to 1, but I assume that's a airbnb thing. It was a cute, little country house that reminded me of visiting my grandma as a child."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a family reunion in the area and this was a great place for my little family of 3 to stay. Make sure if you have a vehicle that you don’t want to drive on dirt roads- always take the route that comes in from the south of the location to limit that.

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful communication with Host. Quaint little cottage away from city noise. Beatrice is a nice community but don't try to eat somewhere between 2 and 5 on a Saturday (certainly not the host's fault).
The comment was made that this was like sleeping in someone else's grandma's house. And I suppose that is what it is.
Seriously it was a great value and a great house in the country to stay at. I wish I could have done a long weekend here and had some time to sit on the porch and watch the grass grow. We loved it.

Thanks Mary!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing place to restore. I stayed here for less than 24 hours- and it reset every fiber of my being!
The drive from Omaha was beautiful- highly recommend “skipping highways” and taking the scenic route! There’s nothing relaxing about I-80.
When I walked in, my first through was “wow I should’ve brought friends!” This space is LARGE!
The space is super clean, remarkably peaceful and as others have mentioned, the industrial kitchen is hard to beat.
I came with just my pup- and a desire to relax and unwind after too much time in the city during all this. The stars were incredible, the sunset over the fields was incredible…there is something so reassuring about an open sky and crops.
The bed in the master was so comfortable! This is an incredible Airbnb. Book it!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We always have a nice stay here. Plenty of room and host is very accommodating and responds quickly. So peaceful outside of town. Will return.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Accurate description, quiet and peaceful. Mary responded quickly to questions, was friendly and inviting. We were not hunting, but I could see this would be a perfect spot for this activity. I could hear pheasant in the tall grass. I was greeted by a lovely house wren singing every morning. Like I said, peaceful."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very friendly and clean. Enjoyed our stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can expect a very clean space and cold ac with a great place to shower and shoot some pool at the end of the day. It was a fantastic spot.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,100% recommend! Wonderful place to stay
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for a weekend family getaway from Omaha. The cabin/lodge is about a 15-min drive to the two trailheads that connect in Beatrice--the Chief Standing Bear Trail that extends into Kansas and the Homestead Trail that heads north to Lincoln. The nearby Homestead National Historical Park was also well worth a visit. The cabin/lodge also has great amenities--we especially enjoyed having access to a full kitchen, the pool table, and having plenty of space to spread out for family board games."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place! We loved our stay! Everything was great!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place great location great people
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a place away from the hustle and bustle of the city to just relax . I loved the rustic hunting themed lodge and the sleeping quarters were perfect for the amount of guests . the kitchen was available for us to use and we were provided clean towels and washcloths. two bathrooms with two showers made it so convenient. the country setting and the history of the lodge made it a unique experience for everyone. I would highly recommend this place for the wonderful welcoming hospitality we received . anyone needing to stay and needing more than two beds. not set up for young children and the sleeping quarters are upstairs but still way more enjoyable than a hotel.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was very clean and quiet.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"If i could give Mary's lodge a million stars...I most definitely would. Spacious, extremely comfortable, extremely clean, and Mary's communication is beyond expectations. Would recommend in a heartbeat."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Mary and Troy couldnt have been nicer to us. The place worked out perfect for our group. It had plenty of room for our gear and to spread out. I would absolutely stay there again.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean place. Well kept. Very responsive to needs. Worth the money
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary is the best. Very clean and even left homemade cookies! :)
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here for Christmas with my family. It's so nice to have a vacation rental in this area. Everything was as expected. The layout works out really well for a family or a group.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fabulous place to relax with everything you need for a great trip.
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place to stay with family. It is quiet and relaxing with plenty of space to enjoy the outdoors.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is one for the books! I’ve stayed at a lot of airb&b’s and this place topped all of them. I was here on business with my crew and they loved having a pool table to play on after work. We worked nights and the owners stayed quiet all day while we slept. Much cheaper than hotels and bigger with everything you need to cook clean and wash clothing.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice quiet place to stay

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely a great place to stay. Such a beautiful place and a beautiful setting: communication was amazing and we would definitely recommend staying here. We loved it!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay whether you are hunting or just a family gathering. Very clean, and the host Troy and Mary are great. Not far out of Beatrice with the comforts of home. We will definitely be back."

2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location to where we needed to be!

The entire property was beautiful."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary greeted me and was very friendly and welcoming. The accommodations were great with anything I could have needed.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family and I enjoyed our stay. We were greeted by Todd and found accommodations to be clean, comfortable, and quiet. In addition to relaxing otherwise, it was fun to play pool as a family. We recommend as a great place to stay!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet break from your rat-race, this lodge is just the place to get away and enjoy nature! There are so many amenities...everything you could need. If you have questions or need anything, Mary & Troy are right there to help!!!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a good time. Pretty cool hiking spots.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful host!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cub Creek Hunting accommodations are well set up for hunters, but also a nice place to stay for families. Very convenient to Plymouth (5 miles), Dewitt (7 miles), Beatrice (10 miles), Diller (13 miles), Wilber (14 miles), etc. We came for Christmas and were able to visit family in the area, and have plenty of space to host at our rental, too. The downstairs space has a well-supplied kitchen, bathroom (with shower), living area and 2 round tables that is convenient and cozy even though shared with the hunting business. The upstairs with 2 bedrooms, bathroom (with shower) and game room with pool table, is private and secure. Note that the bedrooms are all upstairs, so you must be able to do stairs if staying here. Each bedroom has 2 twin beds and 1 full bed. The decor is charming and comfortable, but with the log-style bedframes the Full-sized bed is quite small for 2 people used to a Queen or King. Hunting groups will appreciate the separate beds, though. Also note there is no counter space in the upstairs bathroom, so women with lots of beauty products will have to do some juggling. But the shower is very nice. The hosts live in a separate house on the property. They are very welcoming and communication was great. I highly recommend this property."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing lodge with everything you could need. Great bonus that dogs are welcome, and there was a trail to walk and let them run. Fascinating stuff to see and do everywhere you turn."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Looking forward to our next stay!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay. Very quiet, near town. Very clean, comfortable, easy to get to. Lots of room to roam!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean spacious. Comfortable.
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This venue was great for a large group! And the host is only a few feet away for any needs you might have
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations for traveling with a large group of friends or family.
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Would highly recommend staying there to anyone in need.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located near Beatrice. Enough room/beds for a couple families. Our schedule didn’t allow us to enjoy the extras like the pool table and basketball goal, but definitely a plus. The ice maker was a nice bonus as we were able to keep our coolers full all weekend."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, clean and spacious!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love this place!!! Mary is a super host and the place was so spacious. Our children had a blast learning how to play pool. Never a dull moment. We will be back in the near future!!!!
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The space was much larger than expected. The basketball hoop and pool table definitely helped keep my kids entertained. We felt very safe and secure while staying here.
The only real con was there was a smell of gas throughout that gave me a headache for the weekend. The host and overall stay was nice though."
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"By far the coolest place we have stayed to date, would come back anytime I am in the area. Hosts are as good as gold!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is great for a group. Very quiet and relaxing and easy to find.
2018-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time at Cub Creek Lodge hosting our families Christmas with over 25 people. We had plenty of room for everyone to stretch out. Our hosts had the shop area heated with a corn stove so we were able to expand out into that area. They have plenty of tables for activities that ranged from eating brunch to our first annual gingerbread house design competition. They also have some nice sturdy round tables for playing cards. The teens were able to play a little basketball in the shop or get away upstairs to play pool. There were several couches for those that needed a relaxing spot to nap. The kitchen was great. We were able to put together or finish some dishes in the stove and had plenty of storage space for leftovers between meals. There were lots of outlets for crockpots also.
As for our overnight stay...we found the lodging to be very comfortable. They have lots of comfortable couches. The beds were fine and everything was very clean. The towels were fresh and plentiful."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love staying here! Mary and Troy have an amazing place to go to for a hunting trip, a family retreat, or just a weekend to get away from it all. Mary is the consummate hostess. If you need anything, she is right next door on the acreage to make sure you have everything you need."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean and well managed lodge.If you are looking for a place to hunt upland birds then Cub Creek hunting lodge is the place
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A fun space with an incredible view! Clean, comfortable, and spacious!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place in a peaceful location! Will definitely stay again.
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,What a great cabin with everything you'd need. The place was clean and very cozy.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and cozy.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Don't worry about being able to find this place, a big sign out on the street let us know we were in the right place. 2 queens and 4 twin beds were plenty of sleeping space for our group as well. After a long day in the car, having an upstairs, downstairs, warehouse, and outside area gave everyone plenty of room to stretch. The kitchen had everything we needed and more, 3 tv's were plenty for us, and the pool table gave is something to gather around."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great host. Quick communication.
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great hospitality! The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. It was quiet and comfortable. There was a pool table and several televisions. It was perfect for what we needed!

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean! Loved the location.
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Large space and pretty landscapes! It was a pleasure staying here.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I stayed at Cub Creek Hunting lodge during a January 2018 hunting trip to SE Nebraska. The hosts are present on site and attentive to guests' needs yet give them ample privacy; the accommodations and amenities are outstanding. The kitchen is equipped like a restaurant so we were able to cook some elaborate wild game dinners. Perfect venue for hunters with dogs. This is special place -- rural and scenic, quiet and relaxing, a true home away from home when you traveling to or through SE Nebraska. We already booked again for next year!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cub creek was everything we needed, loved the quiet setting, everything was so clean and orderly."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is truly an amazing place in a unique location. The hosts live in a separate house on the property and are very nice. The house has six beds, a pool table, a basketball hoop (indoors), several TVs, and an industrial kitchen. The perfect getaway spot. They have hunting packages available depending on the time of year. We visited Vala's Pumpkin Patch one day and went to the very informative Homestead Memorial in Beatrice the next. Very enjoyable experience here."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The kitchen, OMG, 6 gas burners, stove, and a giant grill. This is closer to an industrial kitchen than I could have imagined, including the industrial 3-basin sink that was super deep. Comes fully stocked with dishwasher, tons of plates and glasses, cutting boards, cast iron pans, and all the stuff others have left behind or that was stocked there. There were so many condiments and spices! There was fish fry, pop tarts, and saltines plus more left by others. We left our bread crumbs for breading meat. :)
There are two cushy couches downstairs and a cushy couch and loveseat upstairs with the pool table. Downstairs are two large round tables so you can seat everyone for meals at the same time. There is a TV downstairs and one upstairs with the pool table. One bedroom has a TV. I believe the shop area had one too. Free wifi was offered as well.
Both bedrooms are upstairs, each with a full and two twin beds. I found the bed to be firm, but still comfortable. The temperature was good. Pillows were fluffy.
One bathroom up and one downstairs. Each with toilet, sink, and large shower. The water is scalding hot if you aren't careful - -seriously, be careful. This is a major benefit in my book! Fluffy towels and washcloths were stocked. There was even some body wash in the showers in case you forgot yours. There was hand soap at the sinks and reasonable quality toilet paper. (I really despise it when people don't leave hand soap in the bathroom because who is going to remember to bring that?)
The ""shop"" area has a basketball hoop and a dart board and more seating. It also has another industrial 3-basin super deep sink. The front porch has a large picnic table and two chairs that sort of bounce/rock.
We weren't there to hunt, but we saw deer, rabbit, raccoon, and probably coyote tracks. We walked the path between crops and mucked about in the tall grass by the trees (no one ended up with ticks or other pests without using any bug spray).
The owners live on-site but in a completely separate house. They gave us all the privacy we wanted but were right there if we needed anything. Very kind and accommodating. They made getting there and checking in easy.
The Sun Mart grocery store in town is bigger than we expected for a little town, but they had late hours, were easy to find, and had a decent selection of things."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was AMAZING! Stayed here for Wilber Czech Days and it was PERFECT. Much better than a hotel. The hosts were so nice! Would recommend to anybody who comes for Czech Days in a big group!
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary is an amazing host! Very welcoming and the home itself is very cozy. It's a little bit out of the way but is very much worth it, I would 100% recommend Mary."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful experience. The place was beautiful and the handwritten welcome note with cookies was a real pleasure. No doubt would I stay here again if I'm in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved staying here. Perfect for the four of us. It’s a great place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""The Loft"" - A Novella by Daniel Brodecky
""Where are we supposed to park, on the street?"" Lizzie said. ""I guess anyplace is good, it's Wilber Hun"", laughed Danny. Lizzie had a charm about her that honestly only he could probably understand. Perhaps it was because he was never very particular to begin with. ""Maybe we are supposed to park by the garbage cans?"", said Lizzie as she began to squeeze the Ford into the narrow space between the utility pole and the faded pink, blue and brown garbage cans that lined the rear of the building.
Outside they could hear faint speech, cars on the highway as they made their way down the dark alley towards the door. ""Okay babe"", said Lizzie. ""You're better at this than I am."". Danny smiled, knowing she was right. He carefully entered the code on the entry handle keypad, turned the dial, and gently pressed the door. ""Dammit!"", Danny said. He tried again with as much luck. ""Jesus let me do it"", Lizzie sighed.
""To be continued..."""
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a quiet, private space away from the city on game day. Judi’s loft provided a well-designed, peaceful home base for us. She communicated well and was very thoughtful. We were only disappointed that the local shops were mostly closed on a Saturday. Still, it was nice to walk around town. We would gladly stay at the loft again if we’re in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10 out of 10!! Beautiful private getaway!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the property. It's definitely my style! Clean, nice amenities, nice sheets, and towels. The loft is certainly a gem!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place. Furniture and finishes are unique. My husband wanted to take pictures for ideas on how to do some finishing in our place. It is probably better for people without small children. However, we did stay with our grown children and small grandsons and did ok. There is currently no lock on the bathroom so no privacy if you have curious little ones. The stairs are definitely steep and a little slick. If you are more than 5 foot do not stand upright in the loft. With that said our stay was wonderful. The beds were great. The town quiet, friendly, and wonderful to walk. Judi was excellent in communicating with us. You feel like she is the friend you haven't met who invited you to stay at her place while she was out of town."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Loft was a great place to stay. Loved all the decor and Judi was a great host and look forward to staying again.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of six stayed here overnight. I loved the industrial vibe it gives off. It comfortably slept all of us. The kitchen area is perfect and Judi has practically any kitchen amenity you could possibly need. Bathroom is very spacious. Only issue if I'm being picky is the actual loft area has very limited head space if you're on the taller side (I'm 6'3""). My family and I would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,First time at an AirBnB and it was great.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I could not be happier with my experience at The Loft!! Judi is a phenomenal hostess!! She was extremely friendly, communicated well during the whole process, and even made special accommodations for our stay. My husband & I stayed here the night of our wedding. When we checked in, we were welcomed with a sweet note, a bottle of wine, & a bag of chocolates. We were very touched by this!! We also found the bed to be very comfortable and the towels were some of the softest we have ever used! Judi definitely went above & beyond to make our stay stress free, comfortable, & memorable! My husband & I have already discussed revisiting The Loft every year on our anniversary! ❤️"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had never been to Wilber, but have been intrigued by the town because of my Czech heritage. Our stay had everything we needed and we were impressed by how nice the rustic look was from the kitchen, living area, beds, and bathroom. The Loft was a fantastic place to stay, but the location was even better! Only a one minute walk to Hotel Wilber, the bowling alley, and the bars on main street, so we can't imagine how we could have made the weekend trip any better. We plan to make a return trip soon and will encourage family members to ""Czech"" this place out too!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So cute and comfortable. The loft is exactly as described and what you see in the photos. Every detail of the interior and amenities were well thought out. You'll need nothing. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re ever heading to a Nebraska game or just a little getaway this is an awesome stay. Everything was just like it was online. No surprises. Judi and her husband are great! Wilber is really a neat little town. Some good food and some fun little bars. Less than 40 minutes to Lincoln. Everything is nicely appointed! I will say that if you have little children this is not the place for you. We had 4 adults and it was perfect for us. Great stay!!!’
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the loft!!! Very clean, neat space! Judi and her husband have created a true treasure in this quaint little town.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill's place was perfect. Cozy but open and roomy, comfortable, quiet and relaxing. Jill makes sure you have everything you need for a wonderful stay. She had food on hand, snacks, and plenty of water on hand. And if you happen to have forgotten some type of hygiene item, Jill has anything you might need in the bathroom. There was great WiFi, plenty of hot water for showering, a refrigerator if you are traveling with food, and a Keurig with various coffee pods for use. The entire place was spotless and the bed was very comfortable with a mounted large screen TV perfectly situated for a late night movie in bed or on the sofa. My wife and I definitely will look forward to staying at Jill's place anytime we want to get away and enjoy the country."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The 4 Generations Barn & Suite is a fantastic place to stay! The pictures are accurate, but it somehow looks even more charming in person. Jill has thoughtfully outfitted the suite with anything that you might need. The outside area is so pretty and appealing, as well - I only wish that the weather had been warm enough to allow us to enjoy sitting outside. The suite is very comfortable, and the barn would be a fantastic location for events such as weddings or reunions.
I highly recommend and would absolutely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy's place was very cozy and comfortable. And, just like everyone else has said, Judy's cinnamon rolls are worth the stay in and of themselves.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy's place was just what we needed. We really enjoy the option of preparing our own meals. A hotel might save ya just a bit of money, but then you have to be right in town, and many don't provide much of a breakfast anymore. We really enjoyed the privacy and the extra touch of hospitality with the cinnamon rolls Judy provided as well!
If her place is available the next time we need, we look forward to booking and maybe by then the fish will have grown! Lol"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first abnb. Judy was very helpful and considerate.
We were looking for peace and quiet, kind of home away from home, it met our needs exactly.
the only thing that could be improved, for us seriously seniors guests would be a railing on the steps up, and maybe some new cushions on the chairs in the sun porch. but we are used to that and brought our own cushions. would definitely recommend for any one who wants a low stress place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was beautiful and in a beautiful location! It’s quiet and not too far out of the way and it was so nice being able to use the pond and boats and fire pit! We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this cabin to anyone!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what beautiful peaceful place!! Judy is an amazing she will even bring fresh warm cinnamon rolls for breakfast. This place was the best medicine for us.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy’s place is a gem! Her cabin is so charming and relaxing. We had a wonderful weekend fishing on the pond and soaking up the Nebraska sun. The cabin was very clean and stocked with everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and we rested well. Judy’s cinnamon rolls are amazing! So is Judy! You will love her. She is a very loving host who will give you all the privacy you want but is easily available to meet any needs you have. She communicates well and fast. I highly recommend booking her place. This was our fist visit to Nebraska and we were glad we came.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"OMGOODNESS… the cabin was so cute. It was such a peaceful retreat to come home to after work. Judy and her husband were fantastic. I would definitely stay there again and again. The sunrise’s with the pond were amazing!!
Only minor detail the hot water tank ran out real quick. I am use to quick showers so it wasn’t a problem for me but the other guys staying with me …. Not so quick. Lol
I would recommend this little slice of Heaven to anyone."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy took care of all concerns.
Be sure to approach from (Hickory Road) and avoid several miles of gravel roads. My GPS took the shortest route, but not the best. Location is only a half mile off of paved road (Hickory) and much easier access to US77.
The difference is 1/2 mile to take paved road."

We will share our experience at your farmhouse with anyone else traveling that way.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s a small wonderful place on a beautiful pond. It is a one bedroom cottage with great enclosed porch
It has a sitting area and a daybed on the porch so there is plenty of
Room to hang out and look out on the pond even if it’s cold. They have it stocked with everything your need and maybe even want. Oh and the owner makes a wonderful baked good for your breakfast every day of your stay. It’s such a nice treat!!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy place to stay near Tri-County Public Schools, DeWitt, and Beatrice. The one-bedroom cabin was well appointed with a comfortable bed, cozy living room, and accommodating full kitchen. Judy is a terrific host that makes sure the place is clean and ready. Although we were there during a bitter cold spell I could just imagine sitting on the gorgeous patio and looking out across the pond. Great place to stay if you need some peace and comfort."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed the stay! Warm cinnamon rolls that you have to experience to understand! Had a lot going on over the weekend so didn’t get to fully enjoy all that is offered, but you know right away you're in the right spot when you first walk into the cabin!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My kids & I came 4 hours away to visit my husband who was working in the chemical plant near this cabin. All 4 of us stayed very comfortably. Judy made us breakfast everyday & was absolutely wonderful. She is the kindest host I have encountered thus far. The cabin is super cute with a home type feel to it. My kids love fishing & had a blast catching out of her pond! If you stay here, be sure to tell spread the word. We will for sure stay here again in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To anyone wishing for a peaceful and relaxing stay in a charming cabin by a pond with fish, this is the spot!
The host’s attention to details ranges from fresh cut flowers in a vase beside a dish of delicious homemade cinnamon rolls or blueberry muffins to noticing the guests forgot to close windows on the back porch, causing her to mop rain water off the floor, before they return from an outing. (Judy, sorry again about that.)
Treats of various snacks and a gift bag of scented oil goodies await you, making your stay even more delightful.
A charming place and a dedicated host, who is also charming, await your presence."

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay!
Pros- close to town so you can run in for supper or anything needed, very clean and super cute cabin, pond is nice and we caught several fish (catch and release) owners are incredibly nice and breakfast was provided!
Cons- with their farm machinery right there it was pretty loud until evening both days, the a/c unit in the bedroom is also very loud so sleeping was hard! the dock and paddleboat were not accessible due to a recent storm so that was a bummer as we had our kid with us.
Overall it is a very cute little place to stay! you could literally just bring clothes and food and have a great weekend. Make sure to include bug spray also, we ended up with a lot of ticks on us after going around the pond to fish!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place and amazing hosts, overall truly good people. Couldn’t have asked for anything more. 10/10 recommend for anyone, if I’m ever in the area I’ll definitely look here first."

The cabin is very clean and has all of the cute decorating touches to make it feel homey. You’re out on a farm but only a few miles from amenities. 5-star recommendation for sure!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing! I drove down from
Omaha to get away from the light pollution, and I got exactly that- pure darkness. Perfectly situated between Omaha and KC, if you are looking for a dark sky, this is your spot. The cabin is spotless- the wood and interior feel brand new. Communication and getting inside prefect as well. I have stayed in Airbnb’s across the globe, I can confidently say, this is one of my favs. I will be back very very soon! Don’t miss this gem."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came for peace, quiet, and dark sky and that’s exactly what we got. We did not have a chance to stay longer but a very cool experience all the same.

Very responsive and friendly host, local offerings in the refrigerator is a cool touch"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you want seclusion and to be able to see the stars, this is a great place to stay. Has the feel of a log cabin with all the luxuries. Enjoyed it greatly. Only problem was figuring out how to heat the cabin, and some of that was our fault. We thought the wall fixtures were for cooling only, but they also heat. Once we found that out, the cabin which was cold when we woke up, warmed up nicely. No fun taking showers in cabin at 60 degrees F. Maybe displaying a sign that says the wall units are for heating and cooling and the pellet feed stove is a secondary heating source, would have helped. But no complaints overall. Will be returning. Arrived too late to take advantage of the fire pit, but plan to next visit."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Derek was a great host and very helpful and responsive!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cabin while visiting family in Marysville. We had coffee on the porch every morning while listening to the wood ducks and other birds. Truly a “detached” experience as there is no WiFi and cell service isn’t really strong enough to support internet connection. The cabin was clean, and had all the basics we needed. We look forward to staying again on future trips. Thank you, Derek!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Couldn't have asked for a better trip. This has to be one of my favorite places I have stayed thru AirBnb! Lots of wildlife and super quiet. The front porch was my favorite. Got to watch all the dragonflies catch the mosquitoes which super nice. The cabin was super clean. Beds were very comfortable as well! Check out was flexible as well so it gave us more time to soak in our last moments in the very secluded cabin! Will definitely book again when we come back out!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you guys for letting us stay in your beautiful cabin on such short notice! Once we pulled in & got out of our vehicle, the stars were so bright & pretty! The cabin was clean & smelled just like a cabin should! The atmosphere was relaxing. We unplugged & relaxed! Once morning came, the scenery was even more stunning.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was exactly what we were hoping for - a truly peaceful escape to a cozy, secluded cabin. The cabin is adorable and well kept by the hosts, complete with a wood pellet burner and extra pellets. We had plenty of utensils to cook/eat with, heaps of clean blankets laying around and showers that didn't run out of hot water. It was a spectacular winter getaway - we got out of the driveway and road just fine, but be prepared if weather is inclement or snowy as the road into the cabin is gravel with some slight hills.
PS: Make sure to stargaze as you sit around the fire pit... it is a breathtaking sight!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Derek went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. When we ran out of fuel for the fireplace, his wife stopped out and dropped off more that night. Great place for a get away weekend!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a quiet getaway for a late anniversary celebration and this was absolutely perfect. The cabin is located inside a little shelter of trees in a very quiet area. We literally heard no traffic or sounds outside of nature the entire stay. I would recommend packing slippers, the floors are a beautiful wood and not particularly cold, but I’m a bit of a baby so I’d wished I’d had slippers! 😀
The pictures truly don’t do this cabin justice. It’s a very cute space. The wood pellet stove made it very cozy. There was plenty of space should we want to return with our kids. It was very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with equipment. We felt that the space, cleanliness, and amenities made this an incredible value. We brought in all our own food since there isn’t a nearby grocery store (to our knowledge!) It would make a great space for anyone looking for a quiet getaway with their significant other, family, or friends.
Derek was very communicative and flexible and happy to answer questions. We will definitely recommend this to others and may return for future getaways!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend getaway at the cabin was a perfect way to spend our anniversary. We ate Mexican food in Beatrice, lunch at Filley’s Bar and shopped at The Fort in Lincoln.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin!! The pictures do not do it justice. It was the trip we needed to get away, so calming and quite with a beautiful view of cows.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Derek's cabin was clean, cozy, and plenty of space for a family or friend gathering. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a quick breakfast in the morning. The cabin was completely secluded down a gravel road (and then winding little drive way) and surrounded by trees (and creek? I think). And a fire pit ring setup and a big open mowed yard for our kids to play. Great halfway point for us on our way back from KC vaca to our central NE home. Thanks Derek!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden gem of a cabin. Beautiful land surrounding the house. Secluded and private. Saw turkeys and owls, and heard lots of mystery animals at night. :) The wood pellet stove was an amazing touch, and we used the Dish CD channels to create the most relaxing atmosphere. Very spotty cell signal and no wifi, so be prepared to leave the ""real world"" behind for a few days. Enjoy the freedom of unplugging!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a really cool little cabin! You have to text with Derek to find the exact location, because it can be tricky. But well worth it. If you have a few minutes, ask about how the cabin was built - great story."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This was our first experience to use Airbnb and will definitely use it again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was described exactly as they stated. I was concerned with how the front door locked. I called them and they walked me through the process and even offered to come and check it out. (Their explanation over the phone worked) Great hosts and great experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy home that was nicely furnished and well appointed. It was close to the Chief standing Bear trailhead, which was our reason for visiting. Nice tv with good streaming options. Lots of really cozy towels in bathroom. That’s a pet peeve for us with some airbnbs. The only downsides were no USB charging stations- not a biggie, just bring your own. The second was the neighborhood. The house is next to a commercial/industrial area on one side. It was pretty quiet but not the vacation setting we expected. Still would highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It went very well. This is my 2nd time in an air bnb. I prefer it rather than a motel room. It was nice and cool in the house. We went back for a family reunion in Fairbury and stayed a couple nights. It was nice to get away a little distance as Fairbury was having their annual fair.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very neat and clean. Great for the four of us. Great experience for a couple of first timers in our party. Host communication when we got there just to see if things ran smoothly was a great relief to know if we needed anything they where ready to help. Thank you!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James and Rhonda’s place was exactly what I was looking for! We came to Beatrice to visit my sister and the house was only four blocks from downtown making it easy to get out and about to find food, etc. The house was adorable and very clean! Mattresses were extremely comfortable and house was easy to find and get into. James and Rhonda responded quickly to my one question I had and were very helpful. There aren’t a lot of houses right their close. House is behind an industrial building of sorts and you park next to an alley. Made us feel a little exposed at times but we had zero issues. The high or across the street was… friendly lol. He was often in his garden, shirtless, and with his very large dogs. He did say hi and we had no issues with the dogs and we never heard them bark from inside the house so it wasn’t a big deal at all! Overall this space had everything we look for when renting an Airbnb and it was way better than staying in a hotel across town!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised. Nice Stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay. Thanks!

Plenty of towels for showers and kitchen fully stocked with dishes and utensils. Very convenient and easy to get to. We liked the quiet ceiling fans in each room and the curtains kept the light out when you needed to sleep. Furniture was very comfortable as well. All modern decor. We will definitely stay again when we are in the area again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another sweet stay! I’ll be back again next month!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay in the cottage. Very clean and tidy. I was confused on the address as everything said 508 Cottage, but when we couldn't find Cottage street I had to text Rhonda. She replied right away and said it was Ames street. I dug deeper into my confirmation and finally saw the correct address as Ames Street. Still don't understand why they had it listed as 508 Cottage. But, we would definitely stay there again. It was so cute! My husband loved the firm bed pillow!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was adorable! Super sleek and very good pricing!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"As always Rhonda and James are great hosts and I would highly recommend staying here, except the first week of May because that's when I I'll be back next year.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing experience, I stayed a couple of times. I would have loved to stay more for
Often the hardest part being an overnight nurse is the check in and check out. Most places have a difficult time bc of cleaning before new guest. I felt really bad w/me being so tired my last stay I misunderstood my checkout time. I felt horrible. I was late checking out and did not realize bc I had work. I was thinking I was leaving the next day. I woke up with a text from Rhonda & James checking on me if everything was okay bc housekeeping notified them I was still there. Oh my gosh!! I was so embarrassed and confused! Realizing I made a mistake and misunderstood heck out and had to be at work in 30 minutes. Luckily they were very kind and understanding, I offered to pay any late fees for overstaying. I said I would be out in ten minutes. I fortunately am a very clean person and bring all my own & try to leave a place better than I found it. Loaded up sent a text I left & off to work I went❤"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My third stay; my husband’s first. Doug liked having a bakery a short walk away (donuts!) as well as the bike trail for walking.

The stay was wonderful, as expected!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great! Very homey! The bed was very comfortable. Very clean too! We came in late so it was dark, that being said I think the only downside to that was the neighbor across the street. He had a couple bigger dogs that barked a lot.

The RV itself was a cozy haven, tastefully decorated and thoughtfully equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was comfortable, providing a restful night's sleep after a long day of travel. Despite the compact space, every amenity I could think of was available.
Judy was incredibly responsive and accommodating. She checked in with me after arrival and stocked the RV with coffee, snacks, and delicious cinnamon rolls. These little things are soooo welcomed when traveling.
I arrived late and couldn't fully explore the outdoor amenities, such as the picturesque pond, kayak, and amazing patio & grill area. It's a place I definitely would look forward to revisiting in the future.
I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to fellow travelers."

Best to arrive before dark and locate during daylight hours. Nicely decorated camper. 3 steps into camper, 2 steps from main floor to bathroom landing, and 1 more step up to bedroom (be mindful of the last step, as there is only 1 foot clearance at the end of the bed before the step down). Host left nice muffins and rolls for breakfast! There's a nice patio above pond, a dock on the pond, with stairs going down to dock (no hand railings on patio, stairs, or dock). Enjoyed the peaceful sleeping."

The camper is super clean & decorated so cute & Judy has thought of everything! I forgot my hair dryer but of course there was one in the camper! I was concerned there might be a lot of bugs but that wasn’t an issue at all. Tim was in heaven sitting on the dock catching bluegill & catfish! Judy delivered cinnamon rolls & blueberry muffins for our breakfasts & they were delicious! We explored the area & took Judy’s suggestions to check out a pottery shop in an old church, also visited the Homestead National Monument, so glad we did! We ate supper Saturday night at the “Black Crow” (We we’re glad we made reservations) it was excellent! This was our first Airbnb experience & it was perfect in every way, we will be back!! Thanks so much!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy was awesome! The venue was awesome! The quiet was awesome! Don’t think for a minute that it can’t be great because it’s a fixed up 5th Wheel Camper (there is also a cabin/cottage)—pass it up and it will be your loss. I’ve been staying in Lincoln on business for 3 months straight (Both in Downtown & Haymarket). There’s nothing wrong with them but when you want a break from the muffler & siren noise and the College Bar scene, look here! This was the needed respite for my soul. Judy is a tremendous host, ask about the homemade muffins. I will be back for sure!"

Larry made a wonderful fire for us to enjoy our beautiful evening visiting on the patio enjoying frogs croaking and stars in the sky and just peace and quiet and surrounded by farmland. Judy makes All her guests homemade cinnamon rolls! ...custom ordered, with or with nuts and or raisins! She says, it is called air bnb so you should get breakfast. She has made a fabulous retreat by the pond. The camper looks as if it was decorated by Joanna Gaines, so cute! Totally enjoyed our stay and the hosts are such kind people."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect weekend getaway for my husband and I with our 11-month old baby. The location is great for an escape from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to the small town of Beatrice for dinner/drinks/groceries.
Judy was very easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. The camper is right in their backyard, but they were very considerate of our privacy. Larry came down and started the fire for us both nights, and Judy was always nearby if we needed anything.
Despite being an old camper, it is very well maintained. Judy remodeled it last year and it is so cute! The air conditioner worked very well, and we had plenty of hot water. There was lots of storage space for our things. We felt like we had plenty of space, even with a portable crib set up in the living room area. Judy had the camper stocked with all the basic necessities for cooking and grilling (salt and pepper, oil, butter, foil, cooking untensils), and even provided s'mores fixings and a few snacks. She also baked delicious cinnamon rolls and muffins for breakfast, which she dropped of the night before to avoid waking us in the morning.
We used their propane grill one night and had no problems. The patio area is a shared space, so you will potentially have to share it with other Airbnb guests if someone is staying in the Cabin, as well. We very much enjoyed sitting out on the patio and taking the paddle boat out on the pond. We applied bug spray before going out, but never noticed any mosquitoes.
This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had, and I know Judy strives to make that true for all of her guests. We definitely recommend!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paradise that would be the best way to describe this stay!! Such a cute camper with everything you need! We loved sitting by the pond and fishing. We took the paddle boat out and had a blast. At night Larry started us a fire and we roasted smores!! We will be staying again for sure!! Such a great escape!!!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Pond was amazing and so was the host. Judy was great. She has thought of everything to make you feel right at home. We truly enjoyed our stay and it will not be our last!!

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy was an incredible host! She thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and a home away from home. She was friendly and provided lots of options of things to do while there and what's in the area. The homemade goods were over the top! You will not regret booking with Judy!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Judy's was like being at home. Cinnamon rolls and apple muffins to start your day. Drinks by the pond with a fire at night. We will definitely go back.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect.
Judy is so thoughtful, not only making sure you will have everything to make your comfortable but also going out of her way to make your time at her home special. We were lucky to be able to stay in the camper on our honeymoon and were greeted by a special note, bottle of nice wine, and chocolates. Not to mention the fresh cut flowers, snacks, supplies to make smores, and she makes the best homemade cinnamon rolls.
The camper is clean, comfortable, and well stocked with anything you may need. The patio area and pond are a little slice of heaven and I wish we could have spent more time on our trip. Hoping we will get a chance to return for many more visits to this special place where we were treated like family."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a first experience for us, staying in an RV...we really enjoyed the well decorated and cozy atmosphere and the view of the pond is such a calming feature. We took it all in...paddle boating, fishing, walk around the pond, grilling, and wine on the patio with a beautiful night sky. Judy is delightful."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Judy’s place was perfect for my wife and I. Judy was very welcoming and had the answers to all our questions. We felt at home our whole stay. The fire pit her husband fired up for us on the cool night was the perfect touch. We definitely record this stay!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed in the Camper, enjoyed a fire built in the outdoor fireplace by Larry. Had family join us for smores. The cinnamon buns were delicious. Enjoyed kayaking on the pond in the morning. Very nice. Clean camper. Great hosts. :)"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! Private getaway on a lovely pond. Highly recommend!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judy's camper is cute, clean and comfy! We had a nice breakfast by the pond- good coffee and the best homemade cinnamon rolls ever!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy & Larry were fantastic hosts! They were so hospitable and kind. Their cozy camper was a perfect weekend getaway from the city for us.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at The Pond! Peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, and very comfortable. Judy went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and she even helped me get in touch with a babysitter so my husband and I could have a date night out. The breakfast cinnamon rolls and banana nut muffins were delicious, and we were able to easily cook our meals in the camper and also on the gas grill on the patio. The camper felt very spacious to me, although a very tall person might feel cramped. I caught several little bluegill and three nice catfish over our stay. Our 14 month old daughter loved the swing set outside and it was nice that the drawers are child-resistant, so she could walk around in the camper without too much worry about what she could get into. But be sure to latch the door properly!! She took a tumble out the door (100% my mistake) but thankfully it was a fairly soft landing and she was not hurt. All in all a fantastic value and we would definitely like to come back sometime."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place to stay! Very helpful and quick in responses. They were very kind enough to start a fire for our smores and bake cinnamon roles for breakfast. We were able to also paddle boat around their pond. Definitely recommend for a getaway to the outdoors.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful retreat! We enjoyed an afternoon of fishing off the dock, reading on the patio and relaxing by firelight in the evening. Everything was clean and well taken care of, and Judy was so hospitable and welcoming. It was such a fun getaway!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to find. Clean interior.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such hospitality! Very quaint accommodations and everything was so thought out and clean.
We were served delicious rolls and muffins with fruits for breakfast. Such a nice touch to start the day.
The patio is so peaceful and the morning view of the sunrise is worth waking for. If you have time take a stroll all the way around the pond. You might be pleasantly surprised by deer.
Campers have quirks so listen to what Judy has to say when you get there and you will enjoy your stay. We weren’t able to get the stove lit so if you want to use it be sure to ask about it ahead of time. We had other things to eat so we just didn’t pursue Judy about it."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The moment you arrive, you are greeted with a warm smile and southern hospitality; feel like family. Judy and her husband Larry have true servants hearts. The space is immaculate and cozy to say the least. Do not worry about the small stuff, Judy has already thought of it. All. Of. It.! Fresh baked cinnamon roles, dishes, toiletries, trash bags, tin foil, baggies, games to play, radio, welcome note, book to share your memories with her, lighted pathway, all the makings for s’mores , fresh cut flowers, and the list goes o & on. I don’t want to spoil it for you. Think of it as you are going to YOUR other home....amazing!! That’s just the beginning... Prepare yourself to be lulled by Mother Nature’s concertos in stereo at dusk. You will have access to front rows seats as you sit back and watch the dancers perform on the water. While the stars and fireflies steal the show; indescribable. Don’t just take my word for it, experience it for yourself! You won’t want to leave!!!
P.S. Thank you Judy & Larry for an absolutely amazing and relaxing experience at The Pond."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's such a cute space.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay with Judy! It was easy to find, rural enough to be peaceful but close enough to town to head there for meals. It was exactly what we needed!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the PERFECT place for my significant other and I to get away for a night to celebrate his birthday and our anniversary. The camper was very clean and neat. The inside was more spacious than I had expected. Plenty of space for the two of us, we never felt cramped I there. The view of the pond over looking endless rolling hills at night was so beautiful, especially since there were so many fireflies beyond the pond it looked like glitter was erupting from the fields for hours. This is just the perfect cozy quiet and peaceful place to have a great time. We also caught TONS of fish in their stocked pond. Judy also recommended plenty of local restaurants and events in town for us to check out as well. She is an amazing host and her cinnamon rolls are delicious! Staying for just one night did not seem like enough, we will definitely be back!!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed at The Pond on our way to Omaha. Judy met us upon our arrival and provided us with well-thought-out guidelines and recommendations for our stay. She was incredibly hospitable, and seems to have thought of everything a guest might require, including cookware, additional blankets, toiletries, and even items for making s’mores in their patio fireplace. The pond was lovely, and my wife and I enjoyed a trip on the water in their paddle boat, and spent some time lounging in the water-side patio. In addition to the cozy bed and incredible hospitality, Judy took the time to make fresh cinnamon buns, which were enjoyed as a nighttime snack, and as a morning meal. Truly a fantastic location and exceptional host."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at Judy’s place to celebrate our anniversary. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and some chocolate. This was just the beginning of the fabulous hospitality we experienced. Judy made delicious cinnamon rolls for breakfast the first day and banana nut muffins for our second morning. We were offered a parking spot in their shop when there was a possibility of hail as well as entrance into their home if the storm got out of control. Thankfully it wasn’t anything major, and we were able to enjoy our stay. I would highly recommend a stay at the pond to anyone looking to unplug. We hope to return!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an escape from stresses of life please go see Judy and Larry! Their property offers a great opportunity to enjoy nature and the outdoors. The cute little camper was a perfect accommodation and the patio provides a wonderful spot to grill and enjoy the pond. Loved fishing, bird watching and letting the croaking frogs sing us to sleep!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In considering staying here, don’t think camper, think cottage. We ended up in Beatrice, NE in a completely random way and had to change our tent camping plans due to weather. We ended up staying in this cute camper next to a pond. Judy has redone the inside so it looks like a little cottage with a kitchen, sitting area and bedroom. Judy and her husband are warm hosts and there are lovely touches including an outdoor sitting area and baked goods. It’s close to town and interesting historic sites. Five stars without a doubt!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This listing is exactly what it says it is. It's a camper in the middle of Nebraska by a pond.
And it is fantastic.
For my wife and I, it was the perfect place to unplug and relax."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My Father and I had a great time Mrs. Judy is awesome and should probably think about opening her own bakery. Best cinnamon rolls and muffins I have ever had. The place was beautiful and they made you feel like family!!! We will definitely be staying again if we are in the area!!!

This location is quiet and so relaxing!
We highly recommend her as a super host!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy is so kind! She made homemade cinnamon rolls for me and even brought some taco soup for me on a night I was working a little late. Would be more than happy to stay here again in the future!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to get away, this is it. Great place to stay and even better people. Judy was nice enough to make us breakfast every morning as well! Very clean, very quick to respond, and a relaxing stay! Will definitely visit again if I am ever back in the area!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend couldn’t ask for a better host or place to stay!!! The view the pond the out door kitchen the deck I could go on and on about what I loved about staying here but most of all we met two great people They made us feel like part of the family. I will definitely be back even if it’s just to visit. Thank y’all sooo much!!!
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the place to stay to get away from it all. Location is perfect, the camper is comfortable, the fish are plentiful, (make sure you don't sit your pole down they will pull them in! ha ha ha) Very gracious host who truly takes care of her guests"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures that Judy has posted don't do this place justice, it is absolutely gorgeous!! It is a great location in the country yet not to far from town at all with great roads the entire way. This was a perfect experience for my family and will definitely go back! And the cinnamon rolls for breakfast were just icing on the cake!!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a simple, private space, which is a great value; you will enjoy staying with Judy! She was always prompt to answer our questions and respond to our requests. if you don't want to drive on gravel, you won't like the location; but being off the ""beaten path"" is what provided the view of the night sky and sound of the creatures at night. My wife loved the fresh flowers and the patio by the pond was a comfortable space. Judy provided information about the area and clear instructions about using the camper, without being condescending. We appreciated her hospitality and good humor."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy’s place has lots of space to kick back and relax. It is just minutes aware from what ever your doing in town.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay and would recommend it to anyone! Very clean and well equipped space, nice outdoor seating area by pond amid the quiet and beautiful cornfields. Judy is a great host - fresh baked goods and other special touches made our stay very special."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for us. We were on a road trip and wanted to see the Homestead National Monument which was great and less than 10 minutes from the house. Judy was a great hostess and the space in the main house was lovely. We highly recommend.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judy went over and beyond. Fresh baked cookies on arrival. Warm muffin for breakfast. She knew we were leaving early for a baseball tournament so she had a care package and coffee in a to go cup. The property was beautiful. The pond and patio was a great place to relax. Location was great. Very close to Beatrice.
Camper was as listed. Very clean, soft sheets. We hope to come back soon!"
,,,"Very nice at first was sweet and didn’t even get bothered that we needed to add a guest. However, was no very nice when we ran into the issue of having a dog we did make that mistake of not seeing the no pet rule it said we would get back half of our money back but was not willing to work with us it left us stranded in a state we have never been to and had to sleep in a van for a night because nothing was open in the area until the next day. Very nice at first but will not work with you if anything happens THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU OUT IF LAST MINUTE THINGS HAPPEN. I didn’t even want half maybe even just 1/4 would be fine!"
