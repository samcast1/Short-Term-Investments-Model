2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was amazing! Everything was clean and was certainly an enjoyable space for my family. Erin was very responsive and accommodating.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Erin was very responsive. Quickest response time I’ve had with any host. My son left an item there and she made sure we got it back. She truly went above and beyond for us. The house was so clean! Not one thing was even slightly dirty. It was quite impressive. The neighborhood was very nice and we felt very safe there. There was tons of space. The back yard was fenced in and it was so cute and peaceful out there. There were plenty of towels and supplies. The bathrooms were especially clean and had great water pressure and stayed hot through several of us showering back to back.
Cons: The AC wasn’t working, but she quickly contacted someone to come look at it. It wasn’t able to be fixed immediately but she offered to bring us fans and made sure our stay was discounted. As stated in the description, the house is old so the floors creak a lot upstairs. It didn’t bother most of us but I am a light sleeper so it was difficult to sleep for me while others were up. The street is busy."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a gorgeous old home in the heart of Marietta in a quiet neighborhood. You can walk almost anywhere in town from this location. Erin was a very responsive host who answered my emails in less than an hour (and usually sooner!) every time. We were there for a small family reunion and some stayed at Erin’s home while other’s stayed at the Lafayette. One of the things we really appreciated was that the kitchen was actually well stocked with silverware, plates, glasses, etc. We were able to order carry out the evening we arrived and not have to worry about having something to eat on and with! (There’s also a working dishwasher, which was very helpful.)
I highly recommend this home and this location."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a fabulous time at Erin’s player piano home. We felt as if we were right at home as soon as we arrived. Coming back to Ohio from the Carolinas we enjoyed the architecture and detail of the home. We thoroughly enjoyed the Pianola in the evenings once returning from a busy day! The beds offered a comfy and peaceful nights sleep. The home was quite peaceful for a town location. Being close to restaurants and shopping topped off the convenience of the location. Erin was a sweet breath of fresh air and we enjoyed our quickly answered communication with her. We will always book Erin’s player piano home every visit to Marietta!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We are so glad we chose to stay at Erin’s beautiful home whilst visiting from the UK for a family wedding in Marietta.
Erin was always responsive to our many questions and went above and beyond to ensure our trip was great from start to finish. The property was the perfect location in a quiet, stunning neighbourhood.
A great space for our group of 5 with everything we could have needed.
Thank you again for your incredible hospitality and we hope to visit again in the future."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, great host! Highly recommend! Perfect place for our family to stay for Marietta College graduation weekend. A cool house with a big personality, everyone had fun picking which bedroom they wanted. Wish it didn't rain so much over the weekend, we didn't get to spend any time in the backyard or relaxing on the front porch. Thanks again to Erin for being a great host."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent Airbnb. And who knew Marrietta was such a nice place to visit? The old downtown is super cool. The architecture everywhere nearby was so historic and interesting. We loved the Levee House Bistro and highly recommend the Scottish salmon, best salmon we have ever had. Back to the ABNB, it was so perfect for our party of three couples. No one had the any dissatisfaction. It really is a perfect place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived in Marietta during the flooding and weren’t sure about road closures or flooding near the home. We messaged Erin and she responded immediately that the house was not impacted and provided us alternate routes to get there. The instructions to get in the house were easy, and the house was spacious with plenty of room for me and my husband and his elderly parents. Plenty of linens. Nice fenced backyard. Very close to everything in Marietta."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Very lively and quaint neighborhood. The house is amazing. So many treasures around every corner. The upstairs master shower was wonderful. And the heater on there was such a great bonus. Very comfy and felt right at home!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin’s place was beautiful and is big had everything we needed, the only thing I can say on the down side is wish there was a bedroom downstairs my dad is 80 and it was hard for him to go upstairs and downstairs but besides that everything was wonderful and would stay again when I’m in the area."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"FIVE STARS!
My family decided to meet in Marietta for vacation and we had a wonderful time staying at Erin's charming and spacious home! It was a very easy to find and we got settled in quickly.
It was very clean, comfortable, and inviting to stay there. The house was beautiful with intricate woodworking and details that made us feel like we went back in time. I love antiques and vintage and this house was full of great details. She did a fantastic job with her decorating. We had plenty of room and did not feel like we had to be quiet in order to not disrupt each other. The backyard was private and well fenced which was great for the dog to play in! It was nice to let her off leash safely.
The location was in a pleasant and quiet neighborhood and great for walking and exploring.
We have already discussed coming back next year to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoy a stay in Historic Downtown Marietta :) I grew up here, this downtown area has always been the “place to be” and it’s within walking distance of many nice things to do/places to eat.
This house is beautiful, nicely laid out with lots of bedrooms and a nice backyard area. My girls loved how it was decorated and we felt very much at home during our stay! There is a park and library right nearby and the local grocery stores are close as well.
Erin was kind and responsive, we didn’t need anything while we were there, the house was very well appointed… but she was also available if we had needed.
If you’re staying at Erin’s make sure to stop into All Pro Nutrition and grab a shake/goodie! It’s one of our favorite spots in town :)"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time here! House and neighborhood was beautiful. Great exterior and porch with a really unique interior. It was beautiful. Pictures didn’t do it justice! Really special with a touch or creepy (the occasional doll in the house) but we loved it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place was beautiful, it is by far the best place I've stayed. very beautiful home, everything about this place was amazing, so much nicer than the pictures show. Erin's home was very nice and very clean, it's very easy to get comfortable here, it even has a home gym. The neighborhood is very nice and is walking distance from restaurants and shopping, you can be downtown in just a few minutes. Erin was always very kind and friendly, very accommodating and easy to talk with. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back. a very good experience and I'm 100% satisfied. I can't believe that some people would pay just as much or even more to stay in a hotel, Erin's home is so spacious, you get a full home with a awesome fenced in back yard, all at a very reasonable price. all I can say is I loved it!!
if your ever in the Marietta area you should definitely check this place out.
thanks again Erin for sharing your beautiful home,,.... 😊"

I highly recommend this friendly getaway . It had plenty of space for the 7 of us. It was close to many delightful adventures in the town of Marietta. We love the town, and all the people we met. My grand children, as well as my daughter and myself enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked for the Sternwheel Festival and a fun adult away weekend. The house was walkable to the festival and had everything we needed for the weekend. Erin was helpful when we had questions about anything regarding the house. Neighbors were very nice and the neighbor was very safe and great for walking, lots of beautiful homes and churches. We had yo drive to restaurants but had a great experience every we went. The festival was a lot of fun and if go the fireworks show was the best we have ever seen. The house is older and much of the furnishing are as well but that added to the weekend for us."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We had such a great stay at Erin’s. She was most helpful with detailed instructions on accessing our stay. I was concerned with the on street parking but it wasn’t an issue at all. It is an absolutely gorgeous place and we felt at home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this home for my parents to stay at while visiting family in Marietta. My mother said it was extremely clean, comfortable, and conveniently located.

Thank you, Emily, for being a great host!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cute space with everything you could need. Would definitely stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"First of all, this place was stocked with care. Lots of linens, mountains of coffee pods, ample toilet paper and plentiful toiletries! While we didn't cook, I checked out the kitchen and had I wanted to prepare a full meal, all the needed pots and pans were there. We ate take out at the cute dining room table which seated four. There also are two very comfortable bar seats at the kitchen bar.
Second, this is a very dog friendly cottage. One of the porches has a gate up so guests can sit outside with their pup and there are no worries about their dog dashing off the porch in pursuit of a squirrel. There's also a fenced in yard, pet bowls & poop bags, and a crate that probably could house a medium sized dog comfortably.
We walked all around Harmar but enjoyed strolling along the river (which is less than 2 blocks away) the most. It's also easy to cross the bridge to walk around/dine in downtown Marietta!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Emily's fit the bill for 2 adults and 2 dogs. We were able to park our SUV+trailer along side the driveway, off the street. The fenced in backyard was just right for our 2 dogs to stretch their legs and do their business. The House was cute, clean, neat and tidy. We enjoyed sitting on covered back porch while dogs were out. Plenty of towels, blankets, pillows, toilettries, TP, Keurig coffes and creamers. We only stayed overnight so didn't use much or get out and about. We'd look into staying again when we're back in the area."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was PERFECT for our needs!!! We liked the separate bedrooms for privacy...SO much better then a hotel room ! The house was immaculate and the decor made it really feel like home. Although we didn't use them, we appreciated that in addition to the TV in the living room, each bedroom had their own TV, as well. The location was great with great shopping and restaurants nearby.

I REALLY loved the location and was able to get some exercise and run along the river from the BNB. Also, I would highly recommend walking up to The Anchorage Mansion right up the street.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time at Emily's. We were there with our kids and were able to enjoy cozy nights watching a movie and fun mornings making breakfast in the kitchen. The laundry was a huge gift for when the kids got muddy picking apples about 15 minutes away. The location meant we were about a 10 minute walk to the main strip of Marietta (or a 3 minute drive). Busy Bee was an awesome restaurant in walking distance. Just walking along the river was beautiful. We had a really wonderful time at Emily's and hope to come back next fall.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice house for the price! Our family was in town for the Sternwheel Festival and it was within walking distance. Older home but updated nicely. I appreciate how clean it was.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay felt right at home. The place was very welcoming from the time I walked through the front door
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a prototype of what the best of AirBnB can be, and the superiority that well managed entire homes on AirBnB can offer over hotel rooms. The house was beautiful, clean, and spacious, and the furniture and decor was very tastefully done, but also functional and very comfortable. Jennifer has planned out and provided almost anything you might think of, or possibly need, during your stay. This place was perfect for our family, and we would definitely stay here again if we needed to travel back to this area."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great accommodations! Would highly recommend this place while visiting the Marietta area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rented for 7 people for our daughters wedding at The Barn at Willow Creek. The house was a lot larger than expected and there were plenty of places to go and have some quiet/alone time. The attention to detail in the design of the remodel is impeccable. Kitchen is absolutely my dream kitchen and we hosted our 7 plus the bridesmaids and groomsman and grandparents for a BBQ with no problem and everyone was amazed by the house.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous old house beautifully renovated. I especially love that the linens and towels were so clean and not perfumey - my little girl and I have very allergy-prone skin, and prefer non scented detergents. This home was immaculate, and Jennifer was kind and helpful. Would absolutely recommend this gem!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Our family loved our stay over the Holidays. It was just like described and probably more beautiful in person. Loved the location, the decor, the KITCHEN was amazing. Not one thing to complain about."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was amazing, with beautiful antiques melding with new and comfortable sofas and chairs. Everything was well thought out from the extra USB ports on the lamps to the availability of tea and creamers for breakfast. The beds and pillows were great, with plenty of extra pillows, towels, etc. Jennifer was extremely responsive and very accommodating. My only note is the back steps and the powder room are a little narrow so may be difficult for senior citizens with mobility issues, but otherwise one of the nicest homes you can stay in and highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Embedded in the memories we made will the the backdrop of this beautiful century house turned “old meets new” palace. The atmosphere was special for six of us sisters and cousins reconnecting as adults. Well supplied-we lacked nothing as we cooked meals or cozied up for conversation. The seating / milieu in the various rooms would work nicely for adults and or kids. Quality beds and linens aplenty. Luxurious bathrooms. More than just a place to stay- you want to move in.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,First class all the way!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is, by far, one of the most beautiful and well appointed places I’ve stayed. We didn’t have time to take advantage of all of the amenities and will certainly book again so we can!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer's house, ""The Upperclassman"" was the perfect place for our family to stay during our trip to Marietta. Impeccably clean! High quality finishes, stylish furnishings, and thoughtful touches throughout. While the home is historic, it has been completely renovated with all the modern conveniences (high end appliances, beautifully tiled showers, on trend high quality lighting and bathroom fixtures). The private fenced -in backyard was quiet and peaceful, a safe space for families of children of all ages. The location of the house makes walkability to the riverfront, shops, restaurants, and outdoor events (farmers market and outdoor live music ) a breeze. We absolutely loved our stay! We hung out in the upper game room quite a bit and found it cozy and comfortable. The TV's were easy to use as they already had basic cable AND were also smart TV's so we could log into our streaming apps as well. We can't wait to come back and stay at the Upperclassman again soon! Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great location for us to meet our family 'halfway'. We had a lovely weekend packed with lots of family time --- this place was perfect for that! Great space/amenities that were just as described in the listing. Walkable to a playground and restaurants. A short drive to takeout places and coffee. A responsive & gracious host, we had zero issues. We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely exquisite! From the home to every little detail to make you feel at home! Perfect home! We plan to stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such an amazing home.
We will look to stay here every time we visit the area.
Clean, spacious, fun. Everything we could ask for….thanks Jennifer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was enchanting! Every room was special; beautifully decorated and architecturally interesting. The master bedroom and bath was unique and gorgeous. The host took great care to make this house accommodating to every guest; children to adults. Traveling with young children, we especially appreciated the board games in the den and the attic game room. The house offered its own special discoveries for all. My three year old granddaughter especially loved ""the secret library"" of children's books. Our stay felt comfortable, heartwarming, with a little bit of magic!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We love our stay in this home. It was very clean, private, and spacious for me and my 7 bridesmaids. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Austin’s air b&b is luxurious and welcoming. The house is beautiful and features modern upgrades in an historic setting. I particularly loved the movie room on the third floor and the spa-like shower in the primary bedroom en suite bathroom. Walkable to restaurants and several greenspaces, this place is a real gem. Would stay again any time."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Home was very clean and appeared like new inside. Pictures and descriptions are accurate. Liked the location in a residential area but walkable distance to the downtown with nice restaurants and shops. Would definitely rent it again when we’re back in town.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful updated home - great location - had a fantastic stay!! The beds were oh so comfortable!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the Merydith House! It was beautiful, spacious, and super clean!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment you walk in there front door, to the first time laying your head on the pillow, you know you are somewhere special. From the comfortable and welcoming parlor, the gourmet kitchen, the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the game room - no details has been overlooked in the remodel and preservation of this spectacular home. I look forward to staying here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although the host was very friendly and flexible about our early check-in, we did have trouble getting inside. It turned out to be our mistake, not theirs! I just had never used a lock like they have. I assumed that once I punched the code in, I would just need to click the door handle. I think it would be helpful for others if they knew that they had to turn the key lock part first before trying to open the door using the thumb unlock to open the door.
Once we were able to get inside their beautiful home, our accommodations were perfect! We all absolutely loved and thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations at this gorgeous home! We are already planning a trip back to the area when the weather is warmer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was absolutely beautiful! The heated bathroom floor in the master bathroom was a pleasant surprise! I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in town!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Austin’s home is a perfect example of an original marietta home that has been well cared for and then meticulously renovated, keeping the history and beauty of the home. Both my husband and I grew up in Marietta and this was a perfect space for our adult children to visit both sides of the family.
There was plenty of space for visiting cousins to share take out and then on the last day my mom came over and fixed a huge breakfast for the grandkids in the spectacular kitchen!
We will absolutely stay there again"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We selected this house for a girls' weekend. it was beautifully appointed. Everything was great! we would love to return in the warmer weather to experience everything the town has to offer. It was elegant and cozy! The perfect place to stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ours was a 5-star experience across the board. The house is beautiful, in a quiet area, and convenient to Marietta’s historic residential district and the terrific downtown. Communication with Austin was great. It was a perfect spot to spoil our children and grandchildren for the holidays! We would love to stay here again."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Nice house
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, beyond expectations. Plenty of space for the whole family. Great location with plenty of off street parking. Walking path conveniently across the street."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was spectacular. So much room and just beautiful inside. Plenty of space for our family and spotlessly clean. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The place is Gorgeous. The only recommendation would be to close off , the first floor shower that has a glass block window that faces outside. You can see into the shower/bathroom from the patio.
Also only 2 bath towels were provided for each bathroom. Other than that, the place was close to campus and the beds were extremely comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Austin was awesome, and the place was perfect. Plenty of space and great location - we will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and newly remodeled. It’s in walking distance to downtown Marietta. This has been my favorite spot yet!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location does not feel like a location set up for Airbnb profit. This location feels like it’s actually someone’s home they’ve generously decided to share with us. It felt like we were in our home. Beautiful rooms all up and down the home. Great energy and spirit to the home. Comfortable beds, warm and welcoming kitchen, spacious bathrooms, and the fire pit in the backyard is very relaxing. Although most of the seat cushions are dirty and, some, have mold on the seats, because of the falling leaves mixed with rain of course. However, we were still able to enjoy the outdoor setting in the evening. This home, location, even the businesses and people around the area, made this a great experience for me and my family. Would highly recommend and look forward to one day, soon, visiting and staying here again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a beautiful stay! Austin was quick to respond and accommodating with our check in time. There was plenty of parking onsite, the home was clean, and well equipped for our group."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a must stay if you’re visiting Marietta! The house is absolutely beautiful and perfect for a group or family. It’s in the ideal location - Close to the river and darling downtown where you’ll find lots of shops and restaurants. Definitely recommend!

Comfortable outdoor area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Great, friendly host who got right back to us to answer questions. TYVM!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is a lovely old home with modern amenities. The primary bedroom has a nice shower with numerous shower heads. Beds are comfortable and the attic room is perfect for kids. Nice stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house for a stay in Marietta. The house is impeccably clean, kitchen is first class as are all the bathrooms. Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can’t wait to stay there again! Stunning house!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful and easy to find. Very close to down town. We were in town for our sons wedding so didn’t get to take advantage of the local restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Lovely home and lovely stay ! Would stay here again - thank you !
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"highly recommend for a trip to marietta! the place was better than expected. very spacious, updated, clean. less than a 1 mile straight shot walk to downtown. would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Austin was super responsive and very helpful throughout. I highly recommend this place! It is absolutely beautiful and they have done a great job with the decor
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! This was LUXURIOUS! The gourmet kitchen was right out of HGTV! There is a water faucet above the stove to fill pots, and the giant refrigerator is built into the cabinets. The master bathroom is like a private spa! Heated floors! A giant shower with multiple shower heads provides a wonderful shower massage! And the beds are the most comfortable beds I've had while traveling. I just can't gush enough about this place, not because someone is pressuring me to, but because it's THAT GOOD. I've never felt more pampered. If you want to feel rich, stay here!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful house with a great location. There is a walking trail across the street from the house that leads to downtown Marietta and has beautiful views of the river.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Austin was very responsive and accommodating to our needs! Clean, well stocked with amenities and in a quiet neighborhood."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for our golf weekend trip
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Our family of 6 had a wonderful stay while in town to visit family at Easter. The home was extremely spacious. The decor and finishes were absolutely lovely and enhanced our stay. Our teens loved the loft area with the enormous television and the basketball hoop. The location was super convenient and we enjoyed visiting The museum nearby and the shops on Front Street.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We are staying there for work, great place and nice neighborhood!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is the beautiful restored Merydith House built in 1868. This home was in ruins before Austin bought the home restored it. Thank you for bringing new life to this old home. The home has everything you need plus luxuries like heated floors in the bathroom, gourmet kitchen and private parking on the property. The house was super clean and tidy. The home is very close to restaurants and shopping on front street. The river walk is just across the street for a nice stroll early morning or late afternoon and it is a 15 minute walk to Marietta College. And that’s a big plus for us when we come in town to see our son. Excellent home. Wonderful stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this home! Beautiful inside and out, spacious, and a great location close to the river and shops along Front Street. Our second day we had to contact Austin because of a mess made by one of our children. Austin responded quickly and was very nice and understanding. We are looking forward to staying here again the next time we're in Marietta. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"I stayed here with four other girls for the night before my wedding day and it was absolutely perfect! The host was very responsive and flexible with check-in time! As we walked through the house, we were all “ooh-ing and awe-ing” the entire time! The master shower is EPIC along with the heated flooring in the bathroom. The house was spotless and so cozy with some history and character. I will keep this beautiful home in mind when family come into town and need somewhere to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Austin for opening your home to us for our weekend away! The house is beautiful, top to bottom, inside and out. The upgrades to this historic home are impeccable. We will be back~
Pam"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,House is absolutely gorgeous- very well thought out! We had a wonderful stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gorgeous home with top-notch appliances and elegant furnishings! It featured a gourmet kitchen for those who like to cook, a luxury bathroom attached to the master suite, the beginnings of a gorgeous library, and the makings of an epic movie theater/family space on the top floor! (As a brand new listing that has been recently remodeled, the owners are still putting finishing touches on a couple of rooms.) The location cannot be beat, with easy access to outdoor experiences, historical sites, and local shopping! For nature enthusiasts, there is a bike/walking trail that goes along the river (across the street), and an outdoor adult gym and arboretum are within walking distance. The Ohio Riverboat Museum across the street is also well-worth checking out! It provides an account of the rich history of Marietta and the makings of Ohio River towns. Local shops in Marietta's historic downtown are just a few minutes' drive down the street. What a fantastic find!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hidden gym! Did not expect what we walked into. 10/10 would recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have always loved the loft apartments in Marietta. We were worried it might be loud with the foam garage downstairs. We didn’t hear anything! Chip was friendly and spoke to us in passing. We loved the added touch of the pet supplies and towels. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The price was unbeatable! There were so many restaurants, coffee shops, and boutiques close by. If you stay on the weekend, be sure to check out the farmers market 2 blocks away. We are already looking to book our next visit!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was excellent. Super clean and nice. Hosts were extremely friendly and welcoming. Place was super close to everything. The place was exactly what I was expecting
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place was amazing. I grew up in Marietta and was able to relax and enjoy the downtown. the shower was amazing and the hosts were more than amazing when I wasn't the greatest tenant.
I will definitely stay here again.
I really hope they are not impacted by the coming flood."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at Chips here in Marietta! First for Valentines Day and then for our 5 year anniversary. Both times were great. Our dog loved it just as much as we did. The kitchen is awesome, the space overall feels like a second little home away from home. We cannot wait to come back! If the wind agrees we'll definetely be using the bikes in the shed to check out more of Marrietta! Awesome local shops in walking distance and the 740 social I think is what it was called, but it's a restaurant right around the corner. If you like Mussels go there! chip also reccomended another great seafood spot nearby but I can't recall it. Ask him, he's very nice. The foam Garage downstairs had some awesome music over the weekend, not to loud, but not overpowering. Just loud enough to vibe to taylor swift in the hallway! Also almost all of the local shops are are dog friendly so don't be afraid to bring your furry family! Can't wait to go back up!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed here a few times when we visit family. Will stay again if it is available when we visit the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thank you!!! I enjoyed everything
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The apartment is conveniently located to everything downtown. Had it not been raining and snowing we could have easily walked to everything. Will definitely add this unit to our list of preferred places to stay when we visit Marietta.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for our visit to Marietta. Nearly everything was within a 15 minute walk of the loft. The loft itself was exactly what we were looking for. My wife and I came down to Marietta for the weekend and were looking for a comfortable place to stay, walking distance to restaurants, shops, and interesting things to see."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am visiting Marietta OH for work and needed something that was nice and quiet, but close enough to amenities that I can step out for a cup of coffee or a beer. This place is just that. The space is very well kept and accommodating. I will definitely look to stay here when I come back for another round of work. Thanks."

Chip and Marianella were super responsive!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this flat! The enclosed shower was terrific, wish I could get one for our home. The kitchen was new and modern. Chip and Marianella have put a lot of thought into this place. It is located in the heart of downtown and is quiet place to stay. One draw back was the mattess, which is a little firm to my liking and the pillows were generic. I was not expecting luxe but a little more comfort. My husband and I actually met Chip and he is a wonderful guy with a lot of information about Marietta and recommendations. He was very responsive when we needed something. Do not let the parking area discourage you. We will definitely book again if it is available."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cool, hip, roomy and comfortable apartment directly opposite of the Ohio River. I used the rail trail for walking, biking and running. I could walk to get coffee and dinner. Fun to check out the earthen mounds and good proximity to Blennerhassett Island."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, peaceful place to come home to after long days doing touristy and family things. Expectations for sharing their space were resonable and clearly expressed and easy with which to comply. We look forward to staying here again when we come back to the area. Thank you Chip and Marianella for providing such great space for us to hang our hats for a few days."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our visit to Marietta, The Loft is close to the river, bike trails and cute little shops ! If we are in the area again we will definitely check to see if theLoft is available. Thank you, Chip&Marianella"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a very nice and relaxing place. Home was welcoming, clean and comfortable. Host was friendly and helpful with many food and activity suggestions. Would definitely be back for an extended vacation at some point. Would highly recommend it for a low key couples getaway! Thanks Chip and Marianella!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"1st Airbnb experience and these “super hosts” had a wonderful place in a town we love to visit. Will not hesitate to use again. So much in walking distance of the loft.
The description on the web site was spot on, no surprises, this was important."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great central location! The shower is quite an experience! Lots to in this cute river town! If there first of month, check out First Friday downtown! Moose Club nextdoor can be a little loud on weekend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Well-appointed loft, close to walking path along the river. Sylish, comfortable and clean. Our host, Chip, was personable and friendly. Location is great for access, not the view necessarily. The Moose lodge next door was a bit noisy but bring your ear plugs and you should be fine. We recommend it and there is a good chance we will request booking again when we are in Marietta again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very helpful hosts! With all walking distance to the Ohio River & Marietta College.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely love this loft!! It is close to downtown shops and dining!! The host is very welcoming and checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was okay. Would highly recommend staying here!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a amazing trip back to Marietta. Our accommodations , right in the heart of town was a big part of it. Loved it ! Great Hosts !!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went for our 13th wedding anniversary and the place was really outstanding. It’s within walking distance to lots of stores and restaurants. Lots of history which my hubs loved! Loved that we was also right by the rivers. The hostess was very friendly and always responded quickly. Their place was very cozy and comfortable. We really recommend staying here! They even let you use their bicycles if you would like to. Great Place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. A true gem in downtown Marietta!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely love this loft!! This is our 2nd stay here and have already booked the next one. The hosts are very welcoming and the loft itself feels just like home! Highly recommend staying here.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very helpful. Wonderful loft at a fair price. The place was beautifully done. I give the complete stay from speaking to the host before booking to our checkout an A+. The loft is in the perfect location. Thanks Chip and
Marianella!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stay here when we visit Marietta. Love the area and this Airbnb.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I stayed one week in this clean and comfortable, uncluttered upstairs apartment. The three rooms were adequate, kitchen was good with basic necessities. The bed is on a low platform, comfortable with a large dresser, closet and quiet fan. Large TV with fine Bose surround sound and comfortable couch and a small writing desk. Enjoyed the shower. Off street parking space, 26 outside steps to apt. The hosts were personable and responsive. The Foam space was not intrusive. The street is one way with an easy walk (on biking/walking trail) to the Point and the Lafayette Hotel, the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. The town is easily walkable and close by and the Kroger store within a couple of miles."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chip and Marianella's place is wonderful. It's very comfortable and very clean. It;s withon walking distance of the downtown area as well as the Valley Gem Sternwheeler. We detoured along 4th Street when we headed to the riverboat. The architecture of the houses along this street was worth the extra walking time. Since the apartment is on the third floor, this is not the place for you if you have difficulty with steps. Chip and Marianella gave us suggestions of things to do and places to eat. They are very helpful. We will definitely stay again if we are back in Marietta."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place to stay. Would stay again. :)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great love nest or hang-out pad right downtown. Shower is amazingly luxurious, high-tech touches, marble counter-tops in kitchen, great sound system and TV, comfortable bed and furniture, very nicely decorated. Very walkable location, secure.
You are downtown, so you will hear early morning sounds like dumpster being emptied. Also, there is a large AC unit hanging on the building wall, outside the bedroom, so you will hear the fan running most of the time (didn't bother us at all, not loud, just persistent). During the day, you may hear the sound of children squealing in laughter from the Foam Playroom below.
Parking is on the side of the building, plenty of room off of the street, and the metal stairway up is secure, solid. Other cars will pass by your parked car in order to access the two spaces behind it."

Thanks so much for the peaceful retreat that we needed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Chip's & Marianella's place, and we hope to stay again the next time we're in Marietta! It's so convenient to downtown and to the college. While they describe it as ""downtown"" so that you'll have to deal with some noise, we've not found it to be an issue in either of our stays. You can tell there are people around and the occasional loud pickup goes down the street, but the noise level didn't interfere with work or sleep."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Prefect location for work, 5-10 mins away from all job sites I had to attend. Everything written in the binder really helped understand the loft and it’s services."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the location to the amenities, you're going to be bowled over by the value in this loft. Located right in downtown Marietta, it's just blocks or a short walk along a greenway to just about everything including the nightlife, restaurants, museums, Saturday Farmers Market, collage and other attractions. It would be totally wrong to judge this property by its exterior. It is a modern, thoroughly appointed loft with all the amenities. We were very impressed by how attractively appointed, clean and comfortable our two night stay was. On a summer weekend the urban noise level was no more than a few people enjoying the evening at the small outdoor seating at the Moose Lodge next door."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay if visiting downtown Marietta restaurants and other locations in town. It's comfortable and surprisingly quiet at night.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic loft in the right place! Couldn’t have asked for more. Loft is central to the town so you don’t have to use the car. Everything you need and more is in the lift. We have had a fantastic stay. Chip and Marianella are fantastic hosts😊
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chip was quite helpful and accommodating throughout our stay and even let me check in early. Immaculately clean and peaceful upstairs studio right near the main dining and shopping area of downtown Marietta. Still very quiet and did not hear noise outside even on Fri & Sat nights. A great location to stay for mountain biking in the area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a lovely stay in Marietta for us. Not only is the loft cute, clean, and spacious but it was also super convenient to get around downtown. We hope to stay there again."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Location alone is worth the price of admission. Only thing that beats it is the shower - only one I've had that needed its own remote control.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Chip and Marianella's place. The space is wonderful; fully equipped, comfortable, and stylish. We loved the recommendations and had a wonderful time in Marietta. Because of the location we never had to drive, everything was right within walking distance!

Finally, hosts were quick to respond and provided solid recommendations for all of our needs. Can’t wait to visit again!"
2022-01-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and awesome place.
Code to door did not work and place was not cleaned when I arrived. The hosts were on it and had everything taken care of within 90 minutes while I grabbed a coffee right around the corner."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is just as advertised. It's not for those with mobility issues (metal outdoor steps and low bed frame) or those expecting a peaceful night (quiet hours are 2-7am). But the apartment is so well laid out with lots of little touches throughout. There's so much flexibility in lighting, heating/cooling, shower settings, tv choices, games and books, etc! Thanks for a great stay in Marietta!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay in the heart of downtown Marietta. It's a sixty second walk to some really nice restaurants and a brewpub. The kitchen is well-equipped, the shower amazing, the TV great too. Chip and Marianella are great hosts."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is the perfect location for a home base to explore Marietta. We absolutely loved everything the loft had to offer from the surround sound to the steam shower. Chip and Marianella provided exceptional hospitality and made sure we had what we needed. We were able to walk everywhere and swing back to the loft if we didn't want to carry our shopping finds. If your not sure where to explore, Chip and Marianella's recommendations on Airbnb were on point. So many great local spots! Thank you for hosting us for the weekend."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome Airbnb, was above and beyond my expectations! I felt the place was very clean and was an 11/10 experience! I would recommend this place to anyone :)"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a very pleasant and comfortable space. Easy walk to good places to eat, parks on the river and excursion boat. The steps to the loft are on the outside, but are well lit and not a steep climb. We would return without hesitation and recommend the host's and lovely space."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an upscale loft in an interesting college town with many amenities.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second time at Chip's and it was just a pleasant as the first. This is our go-to spot in Marietta.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Until recently, visiting my hometown has always been a little difficult because there are so few places to stay that are cozy. So finding Chip and Marianella's downtown loft apartment has been the greatest discovery. Downtown Marietta is one of the greatest parts of coming ""home."" It's colorful and thriving, with new businesses emerging all the time. And the loft is located in the heart of it all.
Check-in was a breeze. Chip and Marianella were so warm and welcoming. And the loft is perfect: clean, charming, well-appointed, comfortable. I was only able to spend one night, but have already shared the listing with a couple of close hometown friends who appreciate the historic charm of Marietta but no longer call the town home. Being able to go ""home"" and stay somewhere so lovely makes visiting all the greater. I'll definitely be saving this as a favorite for a future visits, of which there'll now likely be more."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place great host the unit was awesome and it was downtown close to everything
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! Great modern place!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Terrific place. High end finishes. They're remotes have remotes. :-) Great location, terrific entertainment center, fanciest shower i've ever been in, luxurious towels. It would be a great place for an extended stay. Definitely would come back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, we had a wonderful stay! The loft is clean, close to everything, amazing shower, and great, communicative hosts. We will be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! A true hidden gem. Although the alley way was confusing, once there, the inside was not only comfortable but also stylish. We felt right at home with a full kitchen, living room and spacious bathroom. Chip was also such an accommodating host and was extremely kind as well. Good vibes over all. Would have loved to stay even longer"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing. What an apartment!! So close to everything in Marietta. C&M were wonderful hosts that we actually got to speak with several times. Great sized living room, large tv, wonderful sound system, built in wall fireplace with different color flames, and large couch. The kitchen was adorable, we admired how up to date all appliances were, excellent coffee maker with coffee AND cream for us to use, fridge that dispenses water and ice and plenty of storage room, separate wine cooler (the host delivered us wine too!), and a little breakfast bar/counter. The room was beautiful decorated, bed was comfortable, you could smell detergent on both the freshly washed sheets and the comforter and I thought that was very comforting myself. The bathroom was gorgeous with a large shower that had several options rain, hand held, mist, you could play music in there. The AC was on the wall and you could make it so wonderfully cool as well. You do have to walk up stairs to get to the apartment but it is no big deal. The bike path runs just by the apartment, and a short short walk to the river. The river is gorgeous as well. The town was bustling with people and so many delicious options. What a gorgeous place with kind and helpful hosts."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything everyone else said is true! We were there during heat advisory weather and the fancy air conditioner was a blessing. Plus it made a nice white noise sound. Chip was nice enough to put a HEPA filter in the loft since I have a cat allergy and they have cats in their unit next door. I had no problem! If you need a place to stay in Marietta this loft is a must!!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great loft, very clean and close to everything. Highly recommend staying there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very comfortable accommodations at Chip and Marianella's loft in downtown Marietta. Loved being able to make breakfast and have coffee in the morning before our hour drive every day to New Martinsville, Wva. Chip was so nice and helpful as to where to go for dinner and so many other things we were curious about. Great place to stay! We will be back for sure! Mary and Scott"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! The shower and amenities are incredible! The little touches, such as labeling switches and remotes, all help make this a worthwhile stay!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this loft! Modern touches throughout and set up very well. Very quiet even though it is downtown in a great location. You do get a good bit of light at night from the downtown businesses but that's not enough of an issue to keep us from staying there again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,I can’t rave enough about how great Chip and Marianella are as hosts! Their loft is the epitome of class and very convenient. 10/10 would stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chip & Marianella’s loft is a great location downtown Marietta. We docked a boat at the harbor and it was very close so that was handy as well. Both were very friendly in our interactions and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. The listing and pictures were accurate and check in was very easy. If the loft is available during your stay I would recommend it!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you want a place to stay in Marietta you can't go wrong with Chip and Marianella 1 bedroom. It is exactly like the pictures show and you are close to many restaurants and bars.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The loft was a fun place to stay and very comfortable! Clean and easy walk to all of downtown! Chip’s location directions are impeccable and if you follow them you will land perfectly!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing loft just steps away from the river. Chip and Marianella are wonderful hosts and made us feel so welcome during our stay. The location is walkable to many restaurants, shops and historical sites in Marietta. We had a great time and hope to visit again."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,The loft is sandwiched between the backs of bars and restaurants. The weekends may be a little loud at night. We were there on a Thursday and it was fine.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chip and Marianella’s place is spacious for two people and has a great location! We really enjoyed staying there and checking out the local restaurants and coffee shop.

The loft itself was very clean and modern and we felt very comfortable and welcomed there.
If we ever find ourselves back in Marietta, we're definitely staying here again! Thanks Chip and Marianella!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely beautiful. It has everything one needs to feel comfortable and is in a prime location for discovering the historical town of Marietta. The hosts were also extremely friendly and were quick to respond if we needed something. We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely consider coming back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot to stay in, right downtown with walking to everything. All the things you have to deal with when using AirBnb are really easy. From check in to check out it was a pleasure. Some places have a check out list of things you need to do that spans 2 pages, this one was so short I forgot to put the towels in the shower, sorry. The apartment is well equipped if you plan on cooking, everything is pretty new and so works well. Towels are super plush, so much so that I need to do some towel shopping for my own home.
The location is right next to the riverfront path, great for walking, running, biking. Our last night here we visited with Chip and Marianella for a few hours and had a great time. Really special people with hearts of gold."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was way beyond amazing. The attention to detail, cleanliness and communications were way beyond our expectations. Chip took the time to chat with us whenever we saw him. We would highly recommend the Loft as a couples getaway for an anniversary, to hide from work LOL or just to have a wonderful weekend. We would recommend this beautiful place to anyone and will share it with our family and friends. You won't be disappointed!!!"

This was our second time staying at the loft, and I anticipate returning again. Highly recommend."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is amazing, and Chip and Marianella have thought of everything. The loft was spotless , well-stocked with dishes, glasses, cookware, even some board games and books. The location is ideal, and you can walk almost anywhere you’d want to go. And the shower! It’s the best shower ever, and Chip even labeled all the shower settings, as well as labeling the light switches. We’ll definitely be back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chip is a great host. He was very down to earth and welcoming. Always available if you need him, but gives you all the privacy you want.
The apartment is in a great location close to everything you'd need. The rental is very up to date, clean, and inviting.

I needed a place to quarantine and work long distance before visiting family, and this space was perfectly set up for both. Plenty of cookware in the kitchen, comfortable furniture, clean and sanitized, hi tech shower, and plenty of privacy. I arrived later than expected, but checking in was a breeze. I'll definitely be back!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chip and Marianella were warm and inviting hosts who made my short stay feel full. Their place is impressively well put together with modern features that are complimented by cozy touches of home. It’s as centrally located as you could possibly get with many of the town staples just outside the door step. I especially enjoyed my stroll through the Saturday farmers market just a three-minute walk away. A quiet and comfortable stay. I appreciated the attention they paid to cleaning and sanitizing, and presenting everything in a very user friendly fashion. The board games were a nice touch, too. Also! Be sure to ask Chip and Marianella to plug you into the places where the locals hang. All around great experience in a nice loft hosted by cool humans. I’d have stayed another night had they not been booked. You should do it, too :)."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caroline’s place was perfect for our relaxing weekend away. On a very quiet, picturesque street with all Marietta has to offer within walking distance.

We can’t wait to visit again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Caroline’s place is perfect for short term or long term. The place is super cute in a great, safe neighborhood.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. Loved that we could walk to so many places by the apartment and across the river to downtown. There’s a bakery, and several restaurants, and a church all within 2 blocks. This space is perfect for 2 adults. Know you have a full set of steps to climb up to the apartment. Very charming and if you are into antiques you you will love this place. You are on our list for our next visit."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline and her flower shop were wonderful. Caroline is a pleasant host, responsive and super friendly. Her place is in the perfect, private and quiet location. The inside matches the photos and is absolutely stunning, especially if you enjoy rustic or antiques.
I mixed up my days on the booking but Caroline was so supportive and understanding. Such a treat! 10/10 recommend!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel to Parkersburg/Marietta area once a year to visit family. We've stayed at the Blennerhassett Hotel in the past, but as we have used AirBNBs on our other trips, we thought we'd see what was offered locally. What a wonderful surprise! We've enjoyed exploring Harmar Village in the past, so it was a treat to be able to stay there. As designers, we really appreciate the amazing architecture and interior space of the building. And, having the decor being chock full of historical memorabilia was a super nice touch. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be sure to book on our next trip if it's available."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely LOVED Caroline’s loft. It was listed as a studio but it is really a one bedroom. Full of character and impeccable decor. I could’ve spent days looking at everything and learning about the history of Marietta! Everything about this place was ideal. Location, the decor, easy check in and out, came with parking, and Caroline was super friendly and accessible! We hope to spend every trip to marietta at her home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very peaceful and the house was clean and beautifully decorated.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable. Well equipped bathroom! Plenty of towels/washcloths!!! So nice not to have to use the same towel and washcloth for 5 days! Very quiet neighborhood! Bed was comfortable. Livingroom seating was comfortable. Kitchen well equipped. Would definitely stay here again! There were a few opportunities to improve the experience: There is only one night stand in each bedroom. If you and your spouse both need a nightstand for book, CPAP, water, etc., it is challenging. If you are someone who likes a lot of light, bring a small task light or reading light. There is no overhead lighting in the living room, only two small lamps. Great for watching TV. A little too dark to read in the evening. Overall, great experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay. I was mostly tired or at work the majority of the week, but it was a very nice place to come home to. thank you very much..."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessi’s place was exactly what it is named - cozy!! It was a wonderful retreat with a well-appointed kitchen, comfortable beds, and a cozy living room. The only thing Id caution is that it is not really walkable to downtown Marietta, unless you’re up for a long walk. But is a very short drive to reach Front Street and other places of interest. It was wonderful and I’d definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Enjoyed our stay. I travel here a few times a year and would definitely stay again. Thanks Jessi for a great space for my sons and I.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience during my stay! The home was great and Marietta is a very pretty little town!

The beds and the sectional in the living room are very comfortable. The hard wood floors are just beautiful! We really appreciated that our small dog could stay here as well. And the notebook full of information of where things are located in the area was a nice touch. Cute and cozy well stocked house that was perfect for us, our kids, and grandkids visiting family in the area. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jessi is a great host and her Cozy Corner was exactly as we expected. What wasn’t expected was how beautifully decorated it was for Christmas! I highly recommend this place!

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had many air B&B options to choose from in marietta Ohio and this Airbnb is definitely as advertised, which is why we were so pleased! It was clean, comfortable, quiet with plenty of space. Offstreet parking made us comfortable, leaving a bicycle on the back of our car. Jessie was more than accommodating! We traveled 14 hours to find our way to this Airbnb and she added a night for us at the last minute. Jessie was Incredibly flexible and responsive. We were grateful for the opportunity to stay here and be close enough to friends to visit in Marietta. The beds are incredibly comfortable and we slept very well. The living room is perfect for the end of the day post travel rest that we needed.
I can confidently recommend this Airbnb to any travelers needing a comfortable place to stay."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, organized, comfortable and well equipped. We will definitely plan to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a nice stay here. We were in town for Marietta College homecoming weekend. There were (4) of us and the house was plenty big enough. Super clean and comfortable. When booking this place, we knew it was a little further from campus than we would have liked, but there weren't many options when we booked. It was a short drive to campus, which was fine - a little too far away to walk back and forth."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here for our family vacation! It was super charming and conveniently located to downtown Marietta. The overall feel of the home was so warm and welcoming. It was clean and the hosts went above and beyond to make sure we had all we needed during our stay including local recommendations that were super helpful and accurate. Each room had Roku TVs and there were some games in the living room, too, so we spent plenty of time lounging around the house as well as going out and exploring. The checkout instructions were included in a checklist which was really helpful when trying to get on the road with two toddlers. Would stay again and definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jessi was super responsive when I had a question upon check in. She quickly helped us troubleshoot and the rest of our stay was great!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank You so much. This is such a beautiful place to stay. Very quite & roomy. Location perfect.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This has literally become a home away from home. We always stay at Jessi’s place when we’re in Marietta.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Jessi’s house is lovely. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are nice. The little extra’s (toiletries, coffee, spices, etc) were great. The river is close enough to walk to as is fast food. I will definitely stay there again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second stay at this property and will definitely stay again. The space and comfort sure beat a hotel stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family enjoyed our stay. It was family and toddler-friendly and since the downstairs has hardwood floors and easily wipeable services we didn't have to worry about minor spills that toddlers may have. I preferred the on-street parking to the driveway as the drive is on the side as opposed to in front by the steps and door so it was easier to load and unload from the front (this will make sense once you're there). Jessi left brochures and guides so if you haven't planned anything to do, you can find things while you're there. The house was really cute and welcoming and provided plenty of space for my husband and me to stay with our son and his family. And the beds were so comfortable that we slept amazingly well. I would definitely stay again and the toddler gave it her nod of approval."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice stay and lots of space !

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our family! We loved the quiet dead-end road and cute adjacent homes and close to downtown. The upstairs loft was adorable and appreciated the cozy living room furniture and Roku in all rooms.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay in Marietta. Everything was as listed. Beds are very comfortable. We didn't use the kitchen but just a quick look around appeared to have everything one would need to get the job done. Great guest book full of area information to help anyone find what they are looking for. Being pet friendly was a great plus for us and always appreciate when we find a place that is, Thank you. Overall, a great stay and would definitely stay again when we return to the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Home was clean and convenient for us.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Was perfect for a one night stay. Furniture was very comfortable!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This house was the perfect size for our short three day trip to Marietta and much better than a hotel. However, the house is older, so it had some quirks such as squeaky floors, bedroom doors that do not close all the way, a few broken window panes, stiff handle on the front door, etc. Overall, we enjoyed our stay; but, there were a few things we found odd and/or inconvenient. The living room only had one small lamp, making it hard to see if you wanted to read or do something else besides watch TV. There is also only one end table in the living room on the far end of the couch. A small coffee table would be ideal, so the people sitting in the middle of the couch or the opposite end can have a place to put their drinks. The half bathroom upstairs has no outlets, and the outside seating area in the side yard was not guest ready having dirty cushions. Some areas we could tell had not been cleaned in a while. A thick amount of dust on one dresser and a lot of dust and debris by the couch."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy Corner was perfect for our family. Great if traveling with kids. Easy, and felt at home!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our trip to Marietta for a family wedding. Beds were comfy, house was very clean, plenty of towels, perfect location, great front porch, peaceful neighborhood. It was a short and easy drive to all of our wedding weekend activities-the church, The Lafayette Hotel and the river. The restaurant recommendations were spot-on. We especially enjoyed the Busy Bee, and the bakery a few doors down. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much Jessi!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay! super quiet, great neighborhood! clean!!!! looked just like the photos. would highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessi's place was cute, clean and well maintained. We enjoyed our stay there as we were visiting with some family near Parkersburg. Much more comfortable, spacious and home-like than a hotel for about the same price!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Need a place to stay in Marietta, Ohio??
Consider Jessi’s Airbnb.
Perfect three bedroom home for a family to stay in. In our case, two sisters driving our Snowbird folks, age 87 and 90 home to Ohio from Florida. Since Covid, we have found Airbnbs much better of accommodations than hotels, when it comes to avoiding cooties.
Highly recommend.

Directions for check in and parking left nothing unclear. The place was spotless and had all amenities listed. The gift card to the Busy Bee Restaurant was such a kind touch and the food was made with locally sourced products, it was delicious with hefty portions- next time I will order their “mini” sized options
This is definitely a place we will be using again as our trips to the area will be increasing in frequency"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simple/basic but charming room--it is basically a hotel room set-up, with bedroom + bath + mini-fridge in a quiet but charming neighborhood. At least on the weekend when I rented, it was very affordable for a real b&b deal (as others have mentioned, the owners include a gift card for the delicious and delightful ""Busy Bee"" restaurant around the corner). There are many points of interest and several other good restaurants in the neighborhood, too (I had a delicious eggplant parm at Spagna's, just up the block). Only reasons I gave <5 for anything was that, even though the owners have done good reno work, it is obviously an old building and is missing a few creature comforts and you walk through a slightly creepy hallway to get from the front door to the room. With that said, I'd pay for a simple charming room in a quirky historic neighborhood/building over a boring corporate hotel any day! This is a great find!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great studio in a classic setting.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We passed the place at first because there is some construction going on downstairs and I didn’t recognize it at first glance. Once turning around it was obvious. Looks like something fun going in downstairs!
Host was very responsive and helpful when I asked a question. The place was clean and very quiet, great for an overnight stop. Thanks for the gift card, that place was fantastic and I wouldn’t have found it without that.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room is in a neat old building that is in an area with a lot of activity. There is an obvious move to revitalize the area, and it is neat to see.
You can walk right out the door, and down to the river! There is a path that follows the river for walking or biking, and if you want to go across the river, the bridge is one block away. There are numerous restaurants one block away, or more across the river. All of them are within walking distance.
Parking is easy right outside on the street, and the neighborhood feels very safe. It is very quiet! Take a walk around - there are some amazing houses right around the corner!
Check-in was easy with the code on the doors, and Larry's instructions were clear.
The room was what I would call hobo-chic. There's no pretense of trying to make it look like a high-end suite with the construction. It is very clean and neat. The decor is very tasteful and comfortable. The bathroom had fantastic lighting, and the water pressure in the shower/tub was great.
In an attempt to be environmentally aware, I'm sure, there are not a lot of extra towels available. I don't blame him because whatever is in the room will have to be washed, used or not, so why be wasteful. However, Larry is quick to respond to your questions and requests, so don't be afraid to ask for more of anything.
He included a $10 gift card for the restaurant around the corner for breakfast. Don't throw that away! The restaurant is wonderful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay here. It’s located in a beautiful area, and it was easy to drive or walk to local dining and attractions. The gift card towards breakfast was a really appreciated touch. Will stay again!"

Larry offered helpful suggestions for places to eat - we tried them all and they were great! A nice surprise was a gift card to the Busy Bee where the food is from local sources, the portions are huge and the service great - a must try. It's an easy walk over the bridge to Marietta. We enjoyed walking both neighborhoods, exploring shops and checking out the beautiful architecture and local history. Larry was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. I highly recommend, and would definitely stay again if in the area."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy is a communicative and fantastic host who cares about her guests and gives them their privacy as well. Her airbnb is close to West Virginia and downtown Marietta. The neighbors dog gets on your nerves after a while. But, obviously, this is not an issue on the hosts end. Therefore, it doesn’t affect my review. I would recommend staying here and know I will when in the area again."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great affordable place on a quite road close to the edge of town. It is connected to the house so she doesn’t like a lot of noise after 11pm. She has just a few hot plates for cooking but everything else you need is there.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great landing spot if you’re visiting Marietta. Very clean and accommodating. I pretty much used this for a spot to sleep and shower.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy’s place was extremely cozy, comfortable and very accommodating. We really enjoyed the tree at Christmas time!"
2020-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"We appreciated how quiet and private Judy's apartment was. We had no issues with check-in or finding the place. My husband enjoyed the Keurig coffee that was there, and Judy included a helpful information sheet on backing out of her driveway (it's a little curvy and on a hill!). The bed was too soft for our liking, but that is definitely a matter of personal taste! Unfortunately, the apartment was just not as clean as we expected it to be with the ""sparkling clean"" ratings and reviews. There was dust in a number of visible places, smudges on the mirror, some dirt on some of the walls...probably nothing a good spring cleaning wouldn't help with! Overall, we had a pleasant overnight stay, and I hate to leave a less-than-5 star review. But I would have liked to have known to anticipate a less-than-sparkling-clean place as I looked at reviews before booking."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I chose the Road Runner because of the combination of the great reviews and low cost. The apartment was very comfortable, and Judy, who I met when I moved in, was pleasant and helpful. The location is just a couple of miles to beautiful downtown Marietta. I was grateful to have this option for my stay and look forward to staying there again."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Judy’s Road Runner House was the perfect place for our overnight adventure. Her place was very beautiful and clean.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"For all travelers you can expect
most pleasant experience with
MissJudy at the Road Runner"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy's place is great. The apt is as nice, and maybe even nicer, than the pix. It's a short drive to downtown Marietta and to a cool Covered Bridges route. I could see it being a great place to stay for a few days to explore the area.
I had asked beforhand if the driveway was large enough for me to turn around since I was pulling a trailer with my car. It turns out the driveway is one way on a hill, and I wouldn't have booked the place if I knew this. Judy was great about helping me leave -first trying to guide me down and then, when that failed, calling her son to lend a hand. She was such a great hostess to go above and beyond like that.
I highly recommend this place."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place for a rest and a movie! Convenient to i-77. Clean and comfortable 🙂
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy provides a beautifully designed place. The lay out really makes sense, which helped us have a great stay. We love the nice large bathroom and shower that has great pressure and nice hot water. The walk-in closet has great places to unpack luggage and hang clothes. The couch is very comfortable and a little dining table is just the right size for two people. It’s nice to have a full sized fridge. The full size bed was a little soft for me, but the linens are soft and comfy."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Good place to stay. Quick response to queries
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy’s place is clean, cozy, & perfect for your trip to Marietta!"

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming from Nebraska, I was looking for something quiet and out of the ways a bit. I came to visit a friend and she was only 15 minutes away which made it very easy for her to pick me up at the start of each day. Upon entering, I couldn’t help but LOVE the smell. I had to ask Judy what it was I loved it that much! I will definitely be returning!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 5th AirBnB stay, (If I remember right) and my best. The apartment was absolutely perfect, through & through. The kitchen was stocked with everything, even ice and the cold packs to use in your cooler, coffee, creamer, snacks, water, and so much more. The living room had a very comfy
couch, tv, with DVDs, cable, all you would need to keep you occupied.
The bed was super comfy, slept great. There is a utility room, with an iron & ironing board, and plenty of space to hang your clothes if more long term. The bathroom is wonderful, and well stocked, even a blow dryer, and scales.
There's also a small table with 2 chairs to eat at, in an open concept floor plan. It was super clean, and nicely decorated. It's a little out of town, but just a short drive. I saw more of Marietta than I ever have, being off the main drag. There's no steps to worry about, good even for the elderly. The shower is elderly friendly.
I'd love to stay there anytime I'm in Marietta. A great find."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed at and we stayed at many. It is a warm and inviting space. The brown tones and squared off but open space design, plus the arrangement and ease of everything made us feel right at home. A balance of helping us feel grounded and a feeling of space around us after traveling for awhile. Slept so well! Spacious enough to do yoga in the morning. My only regret is that we didn’t have a reason to be there more than one night. It was so cozy. I can see all the thought and love that Judy put in to the creation of this space herself. It kind of reminded me of the IKEA showrooms—I always wondered what it would be like to stay in one of those spaces. For us, it was a bit difficult to find the entrance to driveway at night. Hopefully, that may change. We enjoyed wandering Marietta; and she is 5 minutes away from a very significant Earthworks Mounds. If ever we travel through there again, we will definitely keep RoadRunner’s Haven in mind! And we will let others know! The name suits it well."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, easy access, fast communication."

Bottom line... you can NOT go wrong with this sweet find!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Roadrunner's Haven was perfect for our weekend trip to Marietta. It was a beautiful space and very tidy.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and has everything you need

I recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the Ohio Valley area!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judy's roadrunner haven was a great place to stay! She's thought of absolutely everything you could possibly need and was available for help if needed.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Judy's twice during my travel nursing contract. I can't even tell you what a great value and blessing her home has been for me!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cozy, stylish and great use of space. I was here while traveling as a night shift nurse. It had everything I needed. The bed was super comfy.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Book it now! Do not look at any other places in Marietta. This place is centrally located, easy to check in, and had a great connivence store and deli on street level.
Best time we have had as a family of 5 in a long time, and that’s coming from a family that owns a RV and travels during the summer months."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a great spot in the middle of town. Walkable to everything in Marietta. It’s a bit of climb to get to the unit, so if anyone has limitations be careful. Great space for a family get together etc. HUGE living room area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying here and it was great! Maxx was very accommodating with weather concerns after the flooding too!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Maxx was great! Great communication!! Place as described. Loved that you could walk to all the restaurants and boutiques.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to the beautiful town of Marietta
Walk a few steps to find yourself right amongst great restaurants and live music in a gorgeous river town, rich with history!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This was/is our favorite Airbnb stay. Maxx’s listing like taking a step back on time. This beautifully restored ballroom has a historic vibe but with all the modern amenities needed for a fantastic stay. (The ceiling is amazing!)
Our group had 3 couples and a toddler. There was plenty of room for all of us to be together and have still have privacy.
The location is great with several restaurants and unique shops within walking distance.
Comfortable beds, lots of extra pillows and fresh clean linens and towels provided.
Maxx is a very responsive and helpful host.
Highly recommend this listing to other guests."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This property is the PREMIERE LOCATION of all of the Marietta Airbnb’s. So much so… that I may regret my decision to SHARE MY LOVE of the space to the world through this review. Each room is so full of charm that it’s hard to pick a favorite, fully stocked kitchen for cooking & a beautiful view of historic downtown Marietta. Our stay couldn’t have been more wonderful. Special shout out to MAXX, our caring host!! Thank you for everything!!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful loft in downtown Marietta! Perfect for a moms/daughters night away for shopping and dinner. We'd definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Such a cool rental! It has all the feels of an old Victorian space but with modern amenities. The location is right in the heart of downtown Marietta. We would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"It was an amazing stay here as always! Close to great entertainment, dinning, and shopping!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Good stuff
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Such an amazing space, one of the coolest AirBnB’s I stayed at recently. Clean, comfortable, beautiful space! Maxx was super helpful, and very kind in response to several requests. Looking forward to staying here again in the near future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The listing of this place does not do it justice. It is absolutely beautiful! The high ceilings provide such a regal feel, truly stunning. The place was clean, and had all the amenities needed for a wonderful stay in beautiful Marietta. The parking spots were all full almost the whole time we were there, but we just parked in others reserved spots and did not have a problem. The location is steps away from all the shopping and bars downtown. We would not hesitate to stay the next time we are in town for homecoming!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The place is beautiful! Amazing ceiling!! A well
stocked kitchen. Not much closet space to hang clothes. We were aware that it was on the third floor. However it was a challenge to get our things to the third floor. Some sort of a dumb waiter or wheeled cart would have been very helpful. It’s clear to see there is still work in progress in the building, but things were cleaned up and put away. The bonus was being downtown where we were able to walk to so many attractions and to the rivers. Our visit was for 3 nights. I would return but will definitely travel lighter."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The six of us were in town for a wedding and it was the perfect place. Being in that old historic building was absolutely beautiful. I've always been a history buff and staying in a place and town with such history was awesome. People should remember when booking that this building is old... everything creaks... there's a lot of stairs... so don't book it and cry when you're in an old building. The kitchen and the bathrooms were updated and very nice. The furniture and high celings were charming and the place had such a great open feel. The town was hopping with tons to do within a couple blocks. The little deli downstairs, the Galley restaurant around the corner and the taco place Spanglish right on the river were all awesome. There was a little wine bar by the galley that was a ton of fun with great music as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. we had a blast."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique. Comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was great! Checking in was easy, the place was beautiful and the location is perfect for walking around downtown."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This was an absolute perfect air bnb! A great location with a beautiful historic feel while having everything you would need on location. Just a walk away to Front Street’s shops and such. It’s also an absolute plus McKenna’s Market is below for a delicious sandwich and other goods! Maxx was absolutely great and quickly responsive! As a previous Marietta resident, this was so great to come back and enjoy this beautiful place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place and great area!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Very beautiful and unique property. Highly recommend this for your group in Marietta!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Loved the ballroom! It was fun to imagine what it was like when it was used for big parties in the day.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed the stay!! We will stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying here! It was easy to find, absolutely beautiful, clean and peaceful. Maxx was a great host, very friendly and nice and super helpful and responsive. Marietta has a special place in our hearts, and we will definitely be back for another stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Max was great with communication. He answered questions before I even had the chance to ask them. Pictures were very accurate of space. Would recommend and rent this space again for sure!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This place is gorgeous! High ceilings and it looks even better in person than in the pictures. We had a large group and there was plenty of room for us all to hang out in the living room. Maxx was super responsive and helpful throughout. Definitely recommend it if you need a place to stay in Marietta!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay with Maxx in the beautiful Ballroom. Maxx is a wonderful host. Friendly and helpful. The space itself is stunning and has become our home away from home while visiting family in Marietta. The location is ideal - close to the river, restaurants and shops. We walked everywhere and often walked just for fun. Our group was holding an event at the nearby Galley / Adelphia Room and rented all three of Maxx’s units (the Flat on Front and the Shopping District Apt) and they were all charming, comfy, and beautifully restored. We would highly recommend any of Maxx”s properties to a prospective guest and look forward to future visits with this first-class host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful, newly renovated old ballroom that fits seamlessly into the charming historical environment of downtown Marietta while providing all the modern amenities and comfort you wish for. Step out of the building and you're already within sight of most of the downtown attractions. You also have a market right below you if you need to stock up on any food or drinks for the room. If you're spending any time in Marietta with multiple couples, this becomes a better economic decision than rooms at The Lafayette or The Hackett while still having that high standard of accommodations and convenience of being in the center of a great walking neighborhood. I spend a couple of weekends in Marietta every year and we're already talking about staying here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place if you wanna visit Marietta or Surrounding area
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place. Easy to get in. Maxx was extremely responsive and the location is in the heart of downtown Marietta. We used this as our bridal suite and couldn’t have asked for a better bnb for our weekend. Only negative was lack of closets for hanging items, but we brought in a rolling rack and it was an easy fix!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Unique and huge space in the heart of downtown walkable to great bars and restaurants, even took a stroll across the river to West Virginia. Neat old space with tons of room for hanging out."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Maxx is amazing to work with. Stayed in two of his places in Marietta - top notch!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We arrived a little early and Maxx was happy to let us check in which helped a lot. The house was beautiful, clean, and looked just like the pictures. It was a perfect location for shopping and dining and very walkable! We would definitely stay here again!! Thanks Maxx!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay, and everything was exactly how it was described! We plan to go back next year!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay with Maxx. Beautiful, large and spacious restored ballroom in central downtown Marietta. Loved every minute. And Maxx was incredibly helpful and responsive. Highly recommended!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cool!
Right downtown walkable to everything we wanted to do. Lots of space for a bigger group which is a nice option instead of a hotel when our family comes to town.
The tv and/or internet was kind of slow and was confusing to figure out (had to get the Roku remote from our bedroom to get it to work in the living room). The couches were huge and crazy comfortable.
It was surprisingly quiet with the building being so old and having other apartments down the hall."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful stay. Space was gorgeous! Comfy and clean. Maxx was a wonderful host. Would love to visit again! Great location for walking to dinner, winery and coffee. Only issue was the reserved parking spaces were not available so we did have to park a distance which was not ideal. Also the store below was amazing!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is incredible! Beautifully decorated, so full of character!
Maxx was the best host! So communicative, very responsive and kind. His instructions were clear and precise, seamless entry.
The area is great, so much to do, all walkable. We would highly recommend this property and look forward to returning in the future!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lift is absolutely gorgeous!!!!! Friends and family came over to see it and were in awe of the beauty of it.
Very comfortable with everything we needed and the location is amazing!
Thank you Maxx!"

Dean"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place to stay in. It was more spacious than I expected. Great location.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at this beautifully appointed Airbnb. It’s in a convenient location, right in the center of everything, yet we felt hidden away in the privacy of the loft like space. We appreciated the extra towels and all of the amenities that the space has to offer. The ornate ceiling and renovation is truly breathtaking. It’s a real hidden Marietta treasure. Maxx was very attentive and professional with his communication. We would love to come back and have a longer stay! It doesn’t disappoint!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really neat place - if you need to be in downtown Marietta you’re golden. Parking can be hectic when busy, which was only one night when we were there. Overall a great value and lots of charm."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! We love the ambiance and the amenities.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The third floor , ballroom loft apartment is absolutely beautiful. Easily sleeps 8. But affordable enough for 2. Everything was very clean and in immaculate condition. Comfortable beds. Great place if you’re wanting to walk around downtown Marietta and visit the shops and bars. Highly recommend!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous historic loft in beautiful downtown Marietta! Extremely spacious and open floor plan. Walkable to all of the downtown restaurants and shops, which is a great perk. Very well stocked with anything you could think of needing during your stay. We’d love to return with a group to enjoy this 3 bedroom loft again in the heart of downtown!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a phenomenal loft! The location is perfect-right in downtown Marietta. Inside, the space is beautiful…it has been wonderfully restored and has so much room. The kitchen had all of the extras and the bathrooms were nicely remodeled. Although restored, there is tremendous character left in this historic building- truly a gem!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This place is beautiful. Getting to the unit is not stellar, but the unit itself absolutely is. I have family that lives in Marietta and they were awestruck at how cool of a place it is. Also, to experience Marietta you wouldn’t find a better location."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am actually from Marietta originally but live in Texas and have lots of family and friends in town and others who come into town for the holidays. The Ballroom is an incredible space (beautiful historic details and architecture) and great location to meet and hang out. Perfect location right downtown also to grab a bite at one of the downtown restaurants, or drinks somewhere with family and friends. Full kitchen to cook when you want to as well. We loved our stay! Thank you, Maxx!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful, very quite, definitely worth the money"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location was incredible!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location, absolutely stunning place to stay. We enjoyed every bit of this as we hosted my daughter and a couple of her friends for a sleepover for her 16th birthday."
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,This is in a great location. So many fun places to explore.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and spacious place. Max was great to deal with and very responsive.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with plenty of amenities. Right down town in the middle of everything. Enjoyed very much! Thanks!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Ballroom is lovely! It is the perfect combination of authentically historic and comfortably convenient. Our group enjoyed daily walks from the ideal downtown location; tasty meals and treats at McKennas (right downstairs!), the Galley, Marietta Brewing Co, and the Busy Bee - all walking distance; homemade meals in the Ballrooms gourmet kitchen, and settling in to the comfy beds looking up at the beautiful antique tin ceiling imagining the folks who’d been in the ballroom hundreds of years before us. The renovated shower is spotless and spacious and we enjoyed the convenience of having the additional powder room at the top of the stairs. The upstairs loft was great fun for our kiddo and our biggest problem is now he wants a loft bedroom back at home.
Maxx is a kind and knowledgeable host who has thought of everything one might need to feel both special and at home. We loved our time in Marietta at the Historic Ballroom and would recommend it to family and friends without reservation."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cannot say enough great things about this property! It’s so spacious and cozy. The architecture and decor are amazing. The location couldn’t be any better. It’s right in the middle of the historic downtown and inside a DORA. Many outstanding local establishments within a short walking distance. Very clean, plenty of towels in the bathroom, full kitchen, seamless checkin and checkout. Thank you Maxx!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a nice one night stay at this beautiful Space. Very cute and charming town. Loved the local gluten free bakery

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"My stay in this gorgeous downtown updated ballroom was nothing short of perfect. It was clean, accommodating and close to everything you could ask for in downtown Marietta. If you need a place to stay, this is the spacious spot for you!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Maxx was super helpful and easy to reach when we had questions about parking. The place is gorgeous and the perfect location! We will for sure be staying again - in fact my in-laws already booked for next year!
Thanks to Maxx for making our weekend awesome and sharing this beautiful and historic building with us!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at the Beautifully Restored Ballroom was awesome. It’s a 5 star apartment to stay in. It is well furnished and nicely stocked in the kitchen. The beds are very comfy and main bathroom had plenty of towels. The location of the apartment is great to walk around town to shop and eat. The apt made all four of us adults feel at home that after we got done eating we went back to watch the OSU game in the Spacious and comfy living room. We came down to Marietta to see the “Big Bucket” (1 hr drive) and did the “ Valley Gem SternWheeler Boat” tour. Which I would highly recommend.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything in town. Only issue was the drain in tub was very slow so if someone needed to use the shower or tub after someone finished in the bathroom you had to wait awhile.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Toni and Jeff were great hosts for us. We had an extended stay at their property on Virginia Street when we first moved to Marietta. They were our first friends in town. They gave us so many great recommendations of businesses, restaurants, activities, and more in and around town. They knew we were on the hunt to buy a house, so they helped us by giving us some details about the different parts of town. If we had a question or concern, they were always immediately available by phone, and could be on site in just a couple minutes.
We stayed there over a month. The surrounding neighbors and community welcomed us with open arms. We couldn't have asked for a better start to our lives in Marietta. What a beautiful historic little river city!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a perfect fit for our family needs.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, safe location which was walkable/bike-able to down town and river trail"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House is accurately described, clean and access was easy. Actually quieter than staying across the river in downtown Marietta, but walkable to everything."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Seems to have thought of just about all of the little things and makes improvements upon suggestions.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very nice an up to date. This was a great stay. The host was great with communicating I felt like I was at home

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a great stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,first time at an airbnb. it was a very pleasant stay. just like being at your own home. I would recommend that other visitors park on Franklin St. They have put a handicap parking space in front. customers of the restaurant across the street tend to park on the same side as the house. other sideeverythingwas perfect. thank you Toni for providing a clean and comfortable place to stay
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a good stay! The place was as described, other than the yard being only fenced on one side. The place was clean, some trash left under the main bedroom bed. Felt pretty safe and had easy and clear check in instructions."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property! From Austin TX and my fiancé and I were so charmed by this stay. They had everything for a small family including seasoning and shampoo. Things like that validate her hood prices! Also try the boat house. Only thing I would change is advertising that it was an Airbnb out front but I definitely see the marketing aspect but it tells locals where foreigners are.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family enjoyed a relaxing weekend in Marietta and Toni’s place was wonderful! The home had everything we needed, very clean, quiet, and comfortable. It is a vintage gem and deserves 5 stars! Toni was friendly and quick to reply to my msgs. Check-in was easy, instructions were clear, and we would definitely come back again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,House was very clean. Within easy walking distance to local Harmar restaurants as well as downtown Marietta.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a nice house with a lovely porch and views of the river.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Toni’s place is a nice place if you are looking to being close to downtown Marietta. Views of the river were good. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and watching the Sternwheel fireworks!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"First, let me say that being right on the river was wonderful. We enjoyed the front porch and would sit out in the evening overlooking the paddle boats and barges. Toni’s home was one of the most well-stocked places that we have been, and we have been at many Airbnb’s. She put many personal touches into the home and made our stay very comfortable. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean and it just made for the perfect stay. Would definitely stay again! Thank you, Toni!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,k
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Toni was a very responsive host and her place was better than described. House access was easy, it was clean and had more household items than most airbnb places that I have stayed lately (tissues, paper towels, kitchen utensils, etc.) and it was in a nice location with a good view of the Ohio River. Lots of shops and restaurants were in walking distance or a short drive. I highly recommend Toni's place if you are staying in Marietta."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Pictures and description of what is in the home very accurate. For an older home , very well updated and made it comfortable. Nice sitting on porch and watching river traffic. Having the Boathouse Restaurant across the street will make me come back!! Could eat there multiple times in a few days. Thanks Toni"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My only complaint was the parking. The restaurant accross the street does a tremendous business and parking near the house was normally used by patrons of the restaurant. I had to park a block away when unloading. There were lots of little extras, Bananas, fresh flowers, and ice pops for the kids. There was also body wash and shampoo, laundry supplies and great thick towels. Everything you need!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brother and I stayed at Toni's while we took in the sights of Marietta. The home was clean and had everything we needed. I enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evenings. The restaurant across the street was a good place to eat. The home was an easy walk to the main attractions. For those with mobility issues, it was an easy drive to downtown and parking was not a problem. I would definitely stay there again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Toni was an excellent host. We found her house to be very spacious and clean upon arrival. As we were staying longer than 1 week, Toni also came in once per week to do some light cleaming of the property. There were a few problems with one of the heaters, but Toni was very responsive and we usually had these fixed within 30 minutes, so it never affected out experience. Would highly recommend this property"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed over the Christmas holiday so we chose a location close to family and where we could bring our dog. Toni was very responsive when we arrived - had a couple of questions and need for assistance. The home was very clean and had plenty of room for us. A pleasant stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best AIRBNB stays I’ve had. Toni’s apartment was VERY clean, organized, and had anything and everything you might need. Along with the gas fireplaces throughout the home, there was a Christmas Tree put up in the living room for the holiday season which made the apartment extremely cozy and made us feel at home. There’s a large backyard, a nice laundry room complete with laundry supplies, and the shower had awesome water pressure. The beds are comfortable, and the apartment is very well put together. I would definitely stay again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Toni's place was wonderful! The house was very thoughtfully decorated and well stocked. There were fresh flowers on the porch, interesting old books on the tables, a tuned guitar by the couch, a working smart TV, and nice amenities in the bathroom and kitchen. Everything was very clean and the king bed was quite comfortable. The location is ideal. It is in a quiet area but also very close to a tasty BBQ place. It is also walking distance to a number of other restaurants and taverns, and close enough to the bridge to be able to walk to the other side of Marietta.

It's very kid-friendly, including a high chair, pack-n-play, a baby gate that can be placed in doorways or stairways, and a large yard with a play area. The kitchen is large, which was great for us since we cooked a Christmas meal without people tripping over each other. And most importantly, the hosts are responsive. We had one very minor issue, and they responded to my message almost immediately. I would highly recommend this house and these hosts!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Very clean and convenient location. Great for families.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was absolutely stunning from top to bottom. I came in town for a wedding with my 3 kids and MIL. I picked this home because of the bunk beds and option to have a pack n play & highchair for the youngest child (a lot of airbnbs don’t have these as options). Ultimately those were my decision makers! I was part of the bridal party so I needed an early check in, after communicating my needs to James & Daphne they were quick to respond and to help with a solution on getting us checked in early so I could enjoy the day with the bride! All of us had an amazing experience inside and outside (fenced in yard is a MAJOR plus with kids!) If I’m back in the area for a stay I will most certainly look up James & Daphne. Wonderful hosts!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was as described , very nice accommodations - thank you for a lovely stay ! We would highly recommend this facility and the hosts were very communicative!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,What an amazing place to stay. We only stayed for one night but wished we were staying longer to enjoy all that James and Daphne's home had to offer....it was a great find and we would highly recommend it. Everything was as described and we enjoyed it so much that we would give it a 5+ star rating.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 stars all the way around !
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are in MOV and have a large group, book this. If you have any doubts, don’t, it’s what you need! Awesome host, great property. Thank you J&D!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at James and Daphnes's! We felt right at home in their thoughtfully appointed, clean and well organized home. We will absolutely be back again! This house is set up well for families AND adults (if you are not traveling with children it is relaxing and inviting for an adult trip yet safe and laid out well for children)The fenced-in level backyard with a play-set/ swing set was the perfect place for our family to unwind and spend time together. James and Daphne's house is a rare item in Marietta, let alone the Mid Ohio Valley. As a former long time resident of Marietta who has moved out of state and comes back to town from time to time I was THRILLED to see THIS house, in THIS neighborhood, become available as an Airbnb... I have known this house and neighborhood for years and their are few to little houses in Marietta that have this type of neighborhood and modern home layout. James and Daphne were very responsive and professional hosts. We can't wait to return!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great spot. Owners super friendly and ready to accommodate
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay. Clean, spacious, and in a nice neighbourhood. Will stay again if I'm ever back that way."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very accommodating and responsive. The decor was very nice and the master bedroom had a wonderful steam shower.
Unfortunately for the owners the cleaning crew did the bare minimum.... which was not the owners fault and to which they responded immediately and were gracious to discount the stay.
The toilet in the guest bath along with the bathtub had not been cleaned. And I found out later by another lady that was with our group that she had to clean out the microwave... the oven was dirty, and someone had left milk and eggs along with a dirty fridge.
I do feel bad for the owners as I believe they do pay a cleaning service which did them a huge disservice. So with that being said if I knew that it had been properly cleaned I would stay there in a heart beat because it is obvious the owners have worked hard on that place!
The owners were very gracious when one of the elderly ladies tripped on a step and a glued piece came completely off the ledge!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,This house was just like coming home. It was an amazing stay for my sons and I. James and Daphne were incredible hosts. I would recommend to anyone.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great house with a number of unique amenities... steam shower, massage chair, and the pool table in the basement-- but we didn't have enough time to enjoy. House had lots of room. Kitchen had high end appliance. Couldn't find a toaster but used the oven which was a perfect option. Lots of bathrooms- a full bath in the basement we never even used. Very conveninet to downtown Marietta. Fenced in backyard with a nice little chidlren's playset. And beds and linens were fabulous!"

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We came into town to go to our sons graduation. The house is close to the college and was absolutely perfect for us.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, well furnished, well stocked with linens and appliances, and looks to be recently redone inside. Kid friendly yard, and neighbors! Love the flowers around the house! Away from the lights of Marietta so you can see the stars and see some wildlife. We saw deer in the yard the first morning. Love the walk in showers, and washer and dryer! And love the porch! We spent a lot of time on the porch! Will define stay again when visiting family! Dough boys pizza isn’t far, close to Marietta but far enough away you don’t have the lights and noise from town! Beautiful location! Beautiful home!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a sweet little gem! Clean, spacious, stocked with everything you may need in kitchen or that you may have forgotten in the bathroom. (Really appreciated that attention to detail!) Owners were very helpful, kind, and quick to respond. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW.... I don't know where to start! First, Sarah and Anthony were both very responsive. They literally thought of EVERYTHING to accommodate you in their home. They were thoughtful of us arriving late, so they left the back porch light on for us. The home was exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was quiet, and definitely had the ""country living"" vibe. The beds were comfy, and the 2 bathrooms came in handy with having 2 pre teens in the group. The kitchen had everything you needed to cook your meals. The living room area was cozy to watch movies snuggled up, although the internet was down, Sarah attempted to get it serviced, but my hotspot kept us afloat. It was a peaceful New Years Eve, as we wanted. It was great to be out the city, in hidden in the country to enjoy each other. There was salt for the stairs due to the snow that arrived on our last day. Sarah was accommodating to a let us check out a little later due to the holiday. She gave suggestion on hidden gems, we'll be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Anthony are fantastic hosts; very responsive, very hospitable, and very eager to assist in any way possible!

Biodegradable dish soap and brown coffee filters! Bonus! Back steps to get into the home are tiny and slippery Be Careful.... If you have any problems they responded quickly as they live right next door! Fast service :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sarah's place was great, with a large living room and bedroom, and the kitchen was very well equipped with utensils that made me feel at home.When there was a problem, Sarah handled it very promptly and helped us with a lot of difficulties.This stay was an amazing experience!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space was large and provided plenty of room for my family of 5. We loved watching the boats on the river from the balcony and the bedrooms. The place was decorated very nicely and with plenty of the extras you would want, but aren't always provided at other places. We loved the notebook with recommendations of things to do and restaurants and the history of Marietta. We definitely recommend this place!"
