2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time in Dubuque, and found this space so relaxing. We also had so much fun playing cards, and listening to the juke box at a most unique local dive bar; Paul's."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy little place downtown. Really fun for a weekend stay in the middle of downtown.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed at Vicki’s for one night. The room was clean and well furnished. The use of the space is genius with a small kitchen area that would work well even if you were staying several days. It is close to downtown with cute shops and restaurants. I highly recommend staying here.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Trendy, New, and clean. Prompt and courteous response for Last minute plans."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely place is just as the pictures showed! Very unique place, would ABSOLUTELY stay here again. Bed very comfy, everything clean and the small fire place made the entire experience so cozy and comfy. The bathroom is roomy and the shower is AMAZING! The only negative comment I have (and its really not a big deal at all), I do wish there was a full length mirror, but that is clearly a personal preference . Lots of surrounding restaurants and grocery store less than an mile away. So incredibly happy with our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vicki’s AirBnB is the perfect space for a couple looking to stay in Dubuque. Multiple restaurants and bars within walking distance with other areas of Dubuque easily drivable in 10-15 minutes. Also a quick 20 minute drive to Galena!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Downtown- easily walkable to restaurants, bars, shopping, coffee shop, Farmer’s Market and more. Only odd thing is it’s right off the streets and appears to be office space. Once inside though, you’re in your own private oasis. Beautiful, well kept room with a mini kitchen. Way better than a hotel room! Parking was perfect. Once we parked, we walked everywhere. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A little piece of heaven right in the middle of Dubuque. Perfect for two people. You won't be disappointed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Vicki’s wonderful place for a weekend in October and we will definitely stay again when we come back to Dubuque! It was super clean, had great towels, and a comfortable bed. She went the extra mile to provide extra shower/bathroom supplies in case you forgot something, along with complimentary welcome snacks and bottles of water. The location was perfect. It was walkable to so many restaurants, bars and shopping. Definitely 5 stars!! ⭐️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a small studio in heart of Dubuque. Love the location and design of the space. So much of the cities highlights are within a very short walk. Very nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and high quality bedding and towels. I'd go back without hesitation.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my and my fiance's first Airbnb experience, and it was awesome! Vicki and Mike are great hosts! The place was perfect and so gorgeous! Vicki went above and beyond when she let me get into the Airbnb hours before checking in just so I could add some romantic touches to help make it a great weekend for my fiance. The only issue we had was fixed in minutes!! It really is a cozy and very personal space!!! We loved it and plan on staying again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for attending a wedding for the weekend. It’s in a really nice spot downtown where lots of bars/food are an easy walk.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, I really liked this place. It had everything I wanted and more. Below I'll break down the great things and not so great things:
Great:
* location - It's downtown and easy to walk anywhere
* space - it's a huge space, much larger than expected
* price - great value
* check-in - very easy with the lockbox
* parking - free parking as opposed to a lot of places downtown
Not so great:
* Stairs - it's on the second story and the stairs are a little narrow. It's not a deal breaker but be careful if you have heavy bags to carry
* AC - this is an older building and doesn't have central AC. It's a window unit that works ok but if it's really hot, can see it not keeping up
* Directions - Where you have to park and the door you have to take to get into the airbnb the first time can be a little confusing but this not the fault of the host, the building itself is setup in a weird way.
Overall great place to stay and if I go back to Dubuque will definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Conamore Apt 3 was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. I loved the sunflower bouquet on the steps and the views of the neighborhood. It was close to the riverfront and to the Sunshine Family Restaurant, a lovely spot for breakfast. I hope to stay here again when I'm back in Dubuque."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay in Jeff's place! Attended for a friend's wedding over the weekend, and it was quite and peaceful in between all the wedding activities.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was super helpful when Mother Nature dumped a disrespectful amount of snow relentlessly over several days, causing my car to get stuck pulling into the parking space. I was in town for work, and will definitely stay in one of Jeff's properties again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Decided on a quick getaway. I can’t say enough about the experience. The pictures are what it shows. We felt like we were at home since it was cozy feeling. We were very pleased with how comfy the bed was and the pillows were. I didn’t even wake up with a backache. It was that good!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described and very clean. The outside temps while we were there were close to 90 so that made the place a little warm with only the one air unit, but other than that it was a nice place to stay.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable place to stay that’s easy walking distance to all the downtown restaurants and bars. Cheaper than even the most low level hotel in town and having a full kitchen is great when you’re there for 3 or 4 days as I was. Would definitely return under similar circumstances.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place for a great price! My one and only complaint was the traffic noise, as it is on a busy street. But there’s a nice fan/AC there to help drown that out at night. That being said, the location is convenient for walking to almost anywhere downtown."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! Everything was wonderful, clean and very comfortable! We slept so well in the bed and everything was neat and clean! Jeff thought of everything with very clear instructions with a diagram for parking. There are so many places you can just walk to from his location. The decore was nicly done. I would just show off the gorgeous curved windows at the front of the apartment. It's a beautiul old building with wonderful details. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much Jeff for the delightful place to stay!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely girls weekend in Dubuque and this apartment fit our needs perfectly. My only problem was that the shower didn’t get hot water and it was pretty cold in the apartment probably 65, but granted we had unexpected colder weather this weekend so I’m guessing they didn’t plan for that. Other than those two things the apartment was spotless, and had a great vibe. We had a comfortable stay and would stay again next time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,free place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot for some alone time. The furniture was VERY comfortable and set up nicely with a great reading light right where I needed it, the sectional was great for sprawling to watch TV or napping. The neighborhood had some traffic noise, but was really peaceful and had so many places to walk to. Not that I did a lot of walking, but really could have not gotten in my car for three days if I hadn’t wanted to. It was just as described and perfectly priced, too. I was alone, but it would be a comfy place for a couple, I think. Everything worked fine, the Kuerig was easy to use, shower pressure was great and it is really nicely decorated too. I am grateful for a really refreshing stay, just a sweet little place."

The space was super clean and very cozy/comfortable. Bed was very comfortable and loved the decorations too! Would definitely stay there again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and a great service. Expect one bedroom for sleeping, and a small kitchen. Location is more suitable for take-out, with all the great local restaurants. I would suggest anyone doing a long term stay, to give this place a try."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's place was perfectly charming and cozy with quality linens and towels and a very comfortable bed. The location was fantastic, he was promptly helpful with the one question we had and the massage chair was an added bonus! Felt like a bargain for the price, would definitely stay again if we were back in Dubuque."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, perfect for a single person or a couple.
Couldn’t have been an easier stay."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ok, so I've been to a bunch of ABNBS. Jeff's had to be one of my favorites. For the following reasons.
1 - Jeff was super responsive... always. Like within minutes of my query. That was important to me as my getaway was kind of spur of the moment.
2 - His place was exactly as advertised. And it is perfect for a solo traveler or couple. Just perfect. Quant and had everything I needed.
3 - It was spotless/squeeky clean. I met the gal that cleans on the way in. She is awesome. Everything was really perfect.
4 - The bed. No really, the bed. It was so very comfy. Like really nice. Super important even if just for a couple of days.
Thanks Jeff. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'll be back!!
Mike"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really couldn’t love this Airbnb more! It was beautiful , set up really smart & smelled nice (which is top tier for me)! I especially enjoyed the two window nooks overlooking the street. I knew the Farmer’s Market would be close but was over the moon when I saw venders setting up right outside my window Saturday morning! Host was so kind and helpful. I hope to get back to Dubuque and if I do I’ll do everything I can to stay here again! Ashley"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would visit again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as advertised and everything we needed for an overnight visit. Loved the location, cool walking around the old manufacturing district of this river city and seeing how the buildings are being repurposed. Good choice of restaurants and an abundance of breweries/brew pubs!
This is a petit space, so would not have wanted to stay much longer than our one night, but it was EXACTLY as described, so this is not meant as a ""ding"".
Ken responded to my request in minutes - which is great because we were looking for a place to stop for the night. Loved his excellent directions and photos to help with parking and check in. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Ken! Less worry for us for our Dad, yet allowed for him to have his own space. As well as easy access to get him to and from our vehicle without a lot of steps"

Everything you need is there and he’s always available if you need anything."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Ken's place for an overnight stop on a roadtrip and it was a very comfortable, peaceful place. Although the interior is a little dated, everything was impressively clean. Ken's communication was clear and quick. I would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a decent alternative to a hotel room. Location is easy walking distance to anything downtown and next door to a brew pub and dining options.
NOT recommended for light sleepers: You should know an active train line runs thru town about 8 blocks away and sounds it’s horn often enough at night to easily hear Also you will hear the upstairs neighbors moving about. The couch shown is not comfortable enough to sit on more than an hour."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was clean and welcoming. The only thing I would recommend would be having some to sort of office space.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was so easy and convenient!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Comfortable place to stay, me and partner stayed for a week.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken was an excellent host! Communication 5/5 .. anything we needed he was right on top of - bed was comfortable and linens were fresh and clean - excellent shower , all of the extras, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair dryer.

It was decently quiet although we did have some upstairs neighbors arrive home around 12-1am(ish) and it did wake us up as you can hear everything above you. The entrance to the building is directly next to the door of the apartment so if someone enters you will know.
We were there for an event at the convention center down the street. This was the perfect place to stay as we only had a short drive back and forth. We really enjoyed the surrounding area and ended up walking around looking at all of the cool buildings and beautiful architecture. It felt very safe.
We would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area."

Great restaurants and the Fenelon Place Elevator just a short walk away. Recommend for a simple and clean place to stay downtown."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ken sent photos of the location entrance. Ken had created a helpful binder of local restaurants and photos to make them easy to locate. All kitchen cabinets were labeled clearly to easily find utensils and glassware. Ken took the initiative to come by when we arrived and we did not contact him. We also talked with Ken while loading up our car. We give Ken very high marks as a host. We’d recommend and stay there again.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful little chill spot in great location. It felt safe enough for me while traveling alone and I appreciated how much Ken took care to be sure I had what I needed for my stay.
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Let’s start with the good - Ken was amazing. VERY responsive and friendly. The unit was very clean. Bed was comfortable.
Now onto the not so good - it’s not listed in the description that this unit is located RIGHT inside the front door and there are other units in the same building. The building is old so you hear everything. This was not so great when trying to sleep. Other guests were up and about at 2am, right outside our door listening to videos on their phone. Since we couldn’t fall back to sleep after being woken up for a hour straight we decided to head home at 3am so we could get some sleep. For that reason, I wouldn’t recommend this specific unit and we will not be back. I’m sure the upstairs units are much nicer regarding sound issues and you can tell Ken takes great pride in providing a clean home and good experience."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ken went above and beyond with our stay. Even messaged at night to verify the room temperature was okay. Great host!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken’s studio was a great choice for a long weekend stay in downtown Dubuque. The space is welcoming, tidy, super clean, comfortable, efficient, and conveniently located within walking distance to dozens of cafes, restaurants, microbreweries, shops, and other attractions. Having a dedicated parking spot is a real plus for us. Like others have suggested, we parked on the street in front to unload and then tucked away the car behind the apartment. Instructions were organized and easy, Ken’s communication was top notch, and the space was a good value. We would definitely stay at his place again!"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Would be nice to have control of the heat. He warned us we might be to hot and we could open a window. We told him that was not a problem, we liked it warm. In the middle of the night it got down right cold. Could have used a blanket on the bed."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was looking for a place to stay near the Mill District so I could walk to/from event attending. Ken's place was a perfect location for this and also a great price for an overnight stay. Larger space and more privacy than downtown motels as well as the best price. Place was clean, quiet and a great deal. Very happy with my experience and would stay again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken was a great host!

I was able to finish up some baking in my ""down time"" between family gatherings. The neighborhood is an interesting blend of ""downtown"" and unique architecture known to the area.
I didn't have much contact w/ Ken this time around as I really didn't need anything extra. I would certainly stay here again (and likely will.) I would also recommend it to anyone traveling solo or maybe w/ one other person."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken's place was great! The location in downtown Dubuque was fantastic--walkable location to shops, restaurants and brewpubs. We were happily surprised to find the Dubuque Farmers Markets right outside our door on Saturday morning--great bonus!!

It also has direct access to the popular Saturday Farmers Market. The place was clean, cozy and quiet. Ken is extremely helpful, the check-in process was great and so was his follow-up.

Ken was extremely quick with responses and communication was outstanding. He had thought of pretty much everything. I was arriving late at night, so appreciated the easy self-checkin."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommoding and hellful
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Any place that Ken offers is worth every penny! His places are always so clean, priced great and have everything you need for your stay! His communication is just as great, last time I went there I was confused by parking and he walked to the where parking was provided and physically showed me where to go! I recommend staying at Ken’s Airbnb’s!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I checked in on Friday, got a great sleep. Next day made a cup of coffee then stepped out the door into a great farmers market to browse and find breakfast. Sooo many vendors and ready to eat food options as well."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay! The location is great!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was so perfect for what we needed! Best location as it’s quiet, but can walk to Main Street in 1 minute, and we walked to dinner, walked to the casino and the river, and never needed to use the car (and having a dedicated parking space was nice). The bed was comfy, and Ken was very sweet and made sure everything was good. Loved having a kitchen and a cute lil spot, and way cheaper and better than a hotel. Stopped by on a Roadtrip and Would definitely stay here again when in Dubuque."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ken has thought of everything in this space! Loved the water purifying jug.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy’s place worked very well for us for a short trip to Dubuque for our son’s graduation.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,super fun neighborhood for an architectural walk! Jeremy was super gracious and we barely saw him the whole weekend. would 100% recommend
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at this Airbnb was a delightful experience. The cozy atmosphere welcomed us from the moment we arrived, providing a sense of warmth and comfort. While the beds were small, they were surprisingly comfortable, and we found ourselves drifting off into peaceful sleep each night. The decor & furniture was a bit basic but it added to the charm of the space and served its purpose adequately.
The location was superb, with easy access to all there is to do in Dubuque. It was close to all the college campuses, making it easy for parents to visit with their student while giving the student space.
What truly set this Airbnb apart was the exceptional hospitality of the host. From the moment we booked our stay, Jeremy went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcomed and had everything we needed - even scratches for the dog when the host used the shared kitchen!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy was a wonderful host! Would highly recommend!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great and fit our needs. We were in town for the Dubuque Wedding Expo.
Jeremy was a great host and very friendly.
One downside is that there was not a washer and dryer available use."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Air BNB was as described. I thought it would be awkward with the shared kitchen but the host never used the kitchen while we were there. The house was clean and comfortable. We would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. It was a very convenient location. We really appreciated the clear instructions and communication from the host. Definitely will stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful place. The bed I used was so comfy, I wanted to take it home. A very responsive and respectful host. So very peaceful. I wanted to stay longer."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Recommend for a quick visit to the area.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"As a whole, this place worked well for us. Space for everyone to sleep with decent beds. Location is nice off of a main road and easy to get downtown and other activities. In our opinion, it is a bit more than a shared kitchen because there is no door blocking off the kitchen to the space rented and his living space downstairs. Yes, he has his own entrance at the back of the kitchen. And I'm guessing it's listed that way because he wouldn't go beyond the kitchen, it still is a unique scenario. There is a door from where he enters/exits his space that leads to a bedroom that is part of the AirBnb. It does lock but it feels a bit awkward as a renter with young kids with a door right there. We use AirBnbs to be able to cook -- so we would have loved a table to eat at (but we knew this going in), a working dishwasher (didn't know it wasn't working), and enough dishes for all renters beyond 1 meal. Small things but notable. Overall, it was a decent space for a bargain price."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An excellent enjoyable place to stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay for our trip!

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice house and convenient location. We knew the kitchen was shared, but didn’t realize there was no door separating that and our living space. We did not see Jeremy at all, but just not as relaxing knowing he could walk in anytime."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeremy was a wonderful host and we enjoyed our stay at his place in Dubuque! The house was exactly what we needed—close to nearby restaurants, plenty of bedrooms, and clean. The only aspect of the house we did not like is the shared kitchen. His listing accurately states the shared kitchen, but I did not realize there was no door to separate the spaces from each other. I felt a bit uncomfortable about that, but it was not a problem. We didn’t run into Jeremy at all. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and Jeremy was a responsive, kind host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was perfect for our weekend stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the house was really nice and clean and relaxing. Jeremy is a really great host

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, price and host. Will be back when in the area!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeremy has a very nice location here and a great price.
Small House, and well kept yard, spotless inside with newer amenities. Awesome coffee selection and kureg! We were on a motorcycle trip and this was a great spot with rim to park the bikes safely off the road. Good neighborhood as well. I adore Dubuque and was glad to get to spend a night in what feels like home.
Of note: the bedding pillows are very puffy / dense leaving ones head at an elevated angle. If you like soft flat pillows I'd suggest you bring your own.
All in all, very decent."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place welcome stay Fordable
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jeremy proved himself to be an exceptional host from the very beginning, leaving an warm impression on us. Given our unique circumstances, with my reliance on a wheelchair for mobility, our requirements were somewhat distinctive. Notably, the back entrance presented a challenge with two separate steps. Displaying deep thoughtfulness, Jeremy constructed ramps for both entryways, effortlessly accommodating the needs of our family. His kind act of selflessness exemplified his unwavering dedication to ensuring our comfort.
Aside from his genuine warmth & amiable demeanor, Jeremy consistently demonstrated an admirable balance between attentiveness & respect for our privacy. The property's advantageous location, a mere four-minute drive from the university campus where our daughters were attending a week-long camp, proved to be a serendipitous arrangement. Furthermore, the inclusion of three bedrooms within the premises provided ample space. It was a great visit, with a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay a short walk from family on Grandview. Jeremy (host) was communicative and helpful. Shared kitchen had areas with cleared shelves in the fridge and was easy to figure out. Jeremy was cordial and pleasant during our few interactions. The Neighborhood was quiet at night. Plenty of street parking. Will stay again when in Dubuque!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was as described. Jeremy was very helpful and we felt right at home. It really felt like we had the place all to ourselves. Everything was spotless, the kitchen had a Keurig coffeemaker, the three bedrooms were comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I lived in Dubuque for 10 years, so I knew my way around but it is quick to anywhere downtown. I found it to be quieter than I expected and got a better night’s sleep than I do at home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot for our family to settle in before a visit to Dubuque. Good, quiet location with quick access to downtown. Host was helpful with anything we would need. Would stay again when in town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy was very responsive to my communication requests. We had everything we needed at the airbnb. The place was very clean and had all the needed amenities. I would stay there again without hesitation.

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Relaxing stay, easy to check in, very clean."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,Jeremy was communicative and checking in is seamless. Shared kitchen space loses the privacy feel. He needs to put up a door to keep your space separate.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, even though the kitchen and back entrance are technically shared, I was still able to bring my dog and Jermery stayed completely out of our way. Great space if you have a group of 4 in town for a night or two!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeremy‘s place was everything as advertised. Very clean, new floors throughout, great shower,ect…
Shared kitchen but we never saw Jeremy or noticed that anybody else was living in the house :-) we had a great stay and would definitely come back again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean and a small yet cute place for a weekend stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here 1 night for a concert that was in town. I liked that it had 1 off street parking space, it was easy to get inside. Space was very clean, modern, and nice. The owner lives in the basement and the kitchen is a shared use but it didn’t affect our stay in anyway. Definitely would stay here again especially for the price."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jeremy's place was clean (my kid even crawled under the bed at one point and did not come out covered in dust) and the neighborhood was quiet.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jeremy was a perfect host, helpful and friendly with us and with our dog, very communicative and proactive and prompt with information and responses.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped at Jeremy's house in the middle of a family road trip. His house was right off the highway (US-20), easy to find, and exactly what we expected from the listing. Super clean, super quiet. Great food spots nearby. We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy's place."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Squeaky clean, great location! Easy to find and quiet neighborhood. The bedrooms all had blackout curtains and comfy beds, providing a good night's sleep.
It is a shared kitchen, as noted in the listing, but there was generous space cleared for us in the frig & freezer.
We were just passing through, so can't give any tips on Dubuque. Except the one place we visited was fantastic - Wayfarers Coffee!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here! Clean, just as pictured, comfortable beds, super soft towels, and off street parking. It was close to nearly everything and easy to find. Jeremy brought us up new batteries for the TV remote when we needed them; but it was the only time we crossed paths. If it's available the next time we are in town, we will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was clean, easy to access, beds were clean and comfortable, kitchen was great to cook in."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeremy is an amazing host! We didn't meet in person, but communication was great over the messaging feature, and his place was great for our little group - my husband, toddler, mother-in-law and I. There were very thoughtful, nice little touches Jeremy added that made the stay feel very warm and welcoming. I can see why he's a Superhost!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Clean house in quiet area.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value. As presented. Simple & functional. We had a good nights rest. Jeremy had nice touches for his guests. Would stay again.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jeremy has done a bice job fixing up this older house--new floors, remodeled kitchen, new furniture. Excellent communication. All beds are doubles. The A/C works well, but the windows don't operate. One bathroom. Quiet street a few minutes from downtown. Owner lives in the basement, but is a good guy and respects your privacy."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our son is attending university of Dubuque and we are from California. University is 3 min away from this beautiful cozy home .

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful remodeled home to enjoy for a quick nights sleep while passing through. Busy town with all hotels full because of a bike rally. I found Jeremy later in the evening and he graciously let my husband, I and my parents stay. We run an Airbnb but my parents have never stayed at one so they were impressed with how nice of a house it was. Great place to stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a pleasant surprise the home was. I say home because they really focused on making it like a home.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden gem in Asbury! Walking distance to two small parks. Near police station, retirement apartments and public library - quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable beds and furniture. If you are a larger group - the kitchen table only seats 4….just FYI. Other areas are spacious and kitchen well equipped. Already booked it again when visiting family! Bradley is quick to respond to any questions and issues that arise."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Well located - close to Dubuque and fairly easy to jump over to Galena too! The house worked well for our family and the hosts were great!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is FABULOUS! We had 9 people… 4 adults, 2 teenagers, 2 children and a baby. There was SO MUCH space! We had plenty of room to play with the kids… having 3 bathrooms was super convenient and there was plenty of bedroom space. Kids and adults alike played Boss Toss and Ping Pong. We set up a PlayStation on one tv, a Nintendo switch on another and also had a tv to watch March Madness basketball games (plus 4 more tv’s if you didn’t want to watch any of the above). The kids also loved the popcorn maker. Everything was exactly as listed. Brad responded to my messages quickly and was very accommodating. I cannot say enough good things about this listing. We are planning to go back. :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place just as described. We enjoyed playing ping pong and eating popcorn in spacious rec room area

Even when I made a mistake with the booking dates, the host was understanding and friendly. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The showers and beds were so great it was hard to get out of them! 😀 The kitchen was easy to work in for both baking and cooking; there was plenty of room to do both and it was well equipped. The location was great as far as proximity to grocery stores etc. and easy access to downtown. It was very comfortable for us, and we didn’t even use the very spacious basement play area or 2 queen bedroom.
We are very familiar with the Dubuque area having lived there for over 30 years and think this is one of the better locations to stay when visiting family or enjoying local restaurants or activities."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great space for 2 families vacationing together! The basement was so comfortable and fun! We used the games and made popcorn. Highly recommend this listing!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bradley is an AMAZING host. He is always very friendly and willing to help. I look forward to staying here and always hope the next time I’m in town this property is available . It truly gives you that “at home” feeling and has plenty of space so that you have your privacy. The beds are comfortable and the shower head is awesome..it’s the little things that make the stay comfortable and hard to leave . I HIGHLY recommend Bradley as a host and though I’ve only experienced this home I’d venture to say that his other properties are just as amazing and inviting.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly as advertised. It was clean, comfortable and had awesome amenities (we loved the popcorn maker and ping pong table!). Bradley was helpful and responsive. Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriends and I loved this place. Perfect location for friends traveling from Iowa and Wisconsin. The pictures of the home were an accurate representation. Brad responded to the questions I had within minutes. The entire home was very clean when we arrived, and it was so easy to get into the home. Furniture and beds were comfortable, found everything we needed in the kitchen, and parking was perfect for four cars. We were impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers in the showers. Considering we were four women in our early 60's, we had so much fun playing ping pong, bags, and jenga on a couple of cold winter nights. We all commented that we would love to come back to this specific home for another weekend in the future."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for a weekend to ski at Sundown Mountain Resort, and the location could not have been better. It was just minutes to the ski resort, and also easy to get to shopping and restaurants. The house was very clean and beautifully decorated. Our kids loved the cool basement hang-out area. Next time we go skiing, we are definitely staying here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the most impeccably clean place we’ve ever stayed. The host was extremely friendly, and open to communication. All instructions were very clear. The house was well stocked, including games, and extra touches that really made it feel special. We could’ve used with a slightly larger dining area with a number of guests the house holds, but we knew ahead of time that there wasn’t a separate dining room. Everything is great, and we will absolutely be staying there any time we visit the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in downtown Dubuque! We walked to dinner and then to a few bars and there is a brewery right below, so no need to figure out transportation. Although it’s above a brewery and restaurant, it is very quiet and we had no issues with noise. There are some steep steps going up, but not too many and my husband navigated it just fine with an injury. Would definitely recommend and will stay here again if we are ever back in Dubuque."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed at Ken's and we plan to return. It's easy to get too, very clean, and has good space and layout. Just minutes from the action downtown which is where we spent most of our time."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location for an overnight stay after an evening in Galena. Appreciated the off-street parking and that he happily allowed us to check in a bit early before heading out for the night. We were not really planning to spend any time in Dubuque, but this looks like a cool area and we did walk 2 short blocks to a fun coffee and donut shop in the morning It was clean, bright and spacious. Beds were comfortable, although one is definitely on the firm side. The optional memory foam pillows were a nice touch. Brought my own firestick to use with the TV and that worked great, though you can also log into apps on the smart TV. Thanks for a great stay, wouldn't hesitate to stay again."

There was a fabulous bookstore less than a block away, 3 coffee shops within three blocks, and lots of restaurants nearby. (The best one was Ken's own restaurant, just downstairs. The bao were fantastic!) It's was spotlessly clean and quiet, with lots of great natural light. Near to lots of things, it was also still really quiet--I would have never guessed that there was a restaurant and a brewery in the same building.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My 79 year old Mom said it best, ""Ken's a good person, and this place is beautiful!""
You are in for such a lovely treat staying with Ken in Dubuque IA. He was a communicative host, provided for our needs with clear instructions as well as kindness, and helped us when needed. The property was C.L.E.A.N.!! It was obvious that Ken very much cares about his guests, but also takes great pride in his property, which after staying in AirBnB's ""managed"" by groups, was refreshing.
Parking was convenient, the location SPECTACULAR because it was near the historic home district (very walkable) and a variety of yummy restaurants. The beds were comfortable and the shower heavenly.
Please do yourself a favor while traveling to Dubuque and stay with Ken. My family unanimously agreed ... we all LOVED it!"

The host was flexible when I needed it, which was very helpful to my complicated day of apartment hunting.
One comment is that you should be aware it's up one flight of stairs. I think Air B&B needs to do a better job of tracking accessibility.
Great place!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED this place! The only negatives were the walk from the designated parking space, and the many steep steps up to the 2nd floor unit. However, there was metered parking right in front of the door where we could park for loading and unloading, so that made the distance to the parking space much less of a problem. The space was bright, airy, clean and surprisingly quiet for being next to a well used city street. I would definitely stay there again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ken was extremely responsive. The entrance to our apartment was a bit difficult to find but Ken came out and walked us to the entrance.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The air BNB was very clean, one of the cleanest Air BNB's we have ever stayed in. The beds were the most comfortable beds. I love memory foam and I sleep so well on it. My ONLY critique was that there was no extra sheets and blankets. I wouldn't stay again, only because our family prefers a more ""home-y"" feeling place to stay. This did feel like a giant two bedroom hotel suit. Ken was a great host. His restaurant has really good steamed dumplings!"

We ate dinner at the owner's Asian restaurant, Oolong, downstairs- it was delicious, and the staff was very friendly. Back at the apartment, we enjoyed the softest Airbnb towels and the nice comfy beds- black out curtains were also great. Staying on Friday night was a treat because the Farmers' Market is literally just a few steps from the door. Location perfect for keeping car parked in reserved spot and walking downtown, and just a 5 minute drive to the University. We will definitely try to book here again when we return for visits!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a super cute spot. Quiet, extra clean, soft towels, excellent water shower pressure in a great location.
More than that is Ken. He personally showed me the proper parking spot and went out of his way to let me know my car was leaking oil (not in a mean way either, which he could have since it was in his driveway) in fact, the last maintenance on the car was faulty and because of Ken’s keen eye, he probably saved my engine. I really appreciate him coming out as we were leaving and going out of his way to tell me. Amazing. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great apartment in downtown Dubuque! Very clean and roomy! Safe location! Easy walk to many downtown attractions! Parking spot out back included! Located just above great bar and delicious Asian restaurant! Not noisy at all though-solid building blocks all of that and both close at reasonable times and don’t cater to rowdy crowds anyway.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although previous visitors mentioned this place was quiet, we were skeptical since it is over a restaurant and bar - but it is! We have stayed at the Holiday Inn in downtown Dubuque and it was noisier and more expensive. The space is large, and airy with nice amenities. We like being in downtown Dubuque and will definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Not far from places to eat.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We needed a place for friends and family to stay together when attending a wedding over the weekend. This place went beyond our expectations. We loved the location in the historic area of downtown and enjoyed walking and exploring Dubuque. The interior was exceptionally updated while maintaining the fine touches of vintage quality. Would definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a lovely stay at The Real Dubuque Experience. The house is very charming and exactly the amount of space our group of six (four adults, a tot, and a baby) needed. The bathrooms are amazing (I so regret not insisting on spending some me time in that incredible soaking tub.), and the kitchen is well done with sturdy, stylish fixtures, cabinetry, and appliances. The place is also tastefully furnished and the old Midwestern style of the house’s interior goes so well with furnishings love, love, love the doors separating the living room/TV area from the dining room). Although my communication with the owner was limited to text instructions and responses to standard questions, Joseph seemed very friendly and was accommodating and hospitable, providing plenty of water, soda, coffee, and condiments. Parking is also great, and there’s ample street parking and two leased spots that guests can use.
Overall we had a wonderful time in Dubuque and very much enjoyed our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Words really cannot describe how wonderful Joseph’s place is. It’s a beautiful home with extremely comfortable beds, plenty of seating in the living room, dining room and kitchen. Speaking of the kitchen, it was very well stocked! He even had different coffees and teas on hand. There was drinking water and soda in the refrigerator. The three bathrooms were amazing! We have never stayed in such a nice Airbnb. Thank you Joseph for making our son’s wedding even more special."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this place for two nights and it was a wonderful place! It was clean and unique. I enjoyed the neat lights and style. There were a lot of added perks such as complimentary drinks, shampoo and conditioner, and chargers for every phone type. when meeting Joseph, he was super kind and positive. The only downside was the train sounds but that is not a big deal. I can tell they did a lot of great work to the place. I would definitely stay here again and will be suggesting it to others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best air bnb that we’ve ever stayed in. It is beautiful and Joseph has literally thought of everything! Can’t wait to book again for our group. It is close to everything. His suggestions for dinner operations were spot on. Parking is easy and abundant. House is exceptionally designed and decorated. If you’re going to Dubuque stay here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable and convenient stay. I look forward to staying again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My daughters and I were in Dubuque for my mother’s funeral. Joseph was beyond accommodating and kind. His communication was quick, kind, and to the point, which under the circumstances, was just what I needed.
The property itself was fantastic. Tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds and bathrooms. The games and huge television made family bonding easy as did the magnificent kitchen.
Joseph’s place was a wonderful respite. The location is convenient in the more interesting part of two and the restful and well stocked home made a difficult trip so much easier.
I hope the next time my family needs to be in Dubuque Joseph’s perfect home is available. I recommend it highly and look forward to our next visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time in Dubuque and staying at Joseph's place. It was a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the company of friends. We will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great stay! So clean and the location was perfect. Thank you for opening up your place and providing the wonderful recommendations. We will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing old home charm with modern upgrades where you want them! I came for the pocket doors but stayed for the kitchen. Perfect layout for our family - parents stayed in the basement bedroom (with king bed) while two teenagers had their own bedrooms and bathrooms on the second floor. The kitchen is a dream! And complimentary drinks?! That is a rare perk! The thing that stood out to me was the attention to detail - lighting, lamps and night lights everywhere. We’ve stayed in airbnbs all over the world…this one goes in our top 5! Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed in town for the weekend for my daughter’s wedding. Joe’s place was perfect for family to be able to stay with us. We didn’t spend a lot of time at the townhouse but it had everything we needed and then some! I was so impressed with the fully stocked refrigerator. It was great to have 3 levels, 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms so everyone was able to have their own space get ready at the same time. I would definitely recommend this home to others and would stay again when visiting!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful place to stay, second time we have stayed here, we will be back again.
Host goes all out to make the place as clean and pleasant as possible.
Host is extremely helpful, with all our questions."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was well worth the price. Amazing rooms and finishes. The host was extremely kind and friendly. Definitely plan on staying again and bringing more family and friends to enjoy the relaxing space and privacy it provides.
I was in love with the home from the pictures but once I saw it in person I was blown away by the cleanliness, the space, and truly the kitchen was so nice we never ate out. I cooked every meal the entire stay.
There is no bathroom on the main floor and it is next to a church that has bells the ring often... I didn't quite get the timing as I slept in the basement and you can't hear it. But I will say the kids did not complain."

The kitchen provided an inspiring setting that was perfect for collaboration and comfort. Restaurants were very walkable and the address for DoorDash provided a lot of choices. Unfortunately we had to rush out because of a pending snow storm, but Joseph had the walks all cleared out and even brushed the snow off our vehicles. Dream stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The space was beautiful, rustic yet modern and extremely clean. So many little comforts of home were available for us to use. Joseph was kind enough to get the grill out for us after he had tucked it away for the winter. it was spacious enough all 6 of us could have quiet or alone time if needed, but big enough for us to sit down together. Our family felt so comfortable in the home and we would stay here again in a heartbeat."

The bathrooms were especially amazing, we felt like we were staying at a resort! It’s also conveniently located. You can walk to restaurants and other attractions in downtown Dubuque, and it’s close to Highway 20.

Thank you so much!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little mini spring trip for my sister and my two nieces - never been to Dubuque before, and our main reason staying was because I found this amazing place! For two adults and two teens, there was plenty of space and we felt very much at home. The kitchen had EVERYTHING and was beautiful. We spent both evenings there making food because it was so great. Beds were super comfy and luxurious. Oh, and that master bathroom - amazing! Four ladies and we all pretty much shared it despite there being two other bathrooms. Totally recommend. Thanks, Joseph!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay here, and our host went above and beyond to help us out and make us feel welcome.

We hope to come back soon and stay here soon. There are lots of bars and restaurants within a short walking distance of the property.
Possibly the only mistake we made in booking this property was not staying longer. Even though our bedroom faced the street, we never noticed the traffic at all.
Thank you Joseph!
Mark and Annette"

We appreciated all of the personal touches, cleanliness, and high end appliances. I have stayed at several Airbnb’s in Dubuque and this one was the best! 10/10!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Couldn't ask for a better place. Joseph greeted us to show us around the house. The remodel was beautiful and couldn't beat the location. A short walk to many places and just a short 5 minute drive to others. Easy access to the highway. Lots of details that made the stay perfect. Would highly recommended staying here as we will for our next visit to Dubuque.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joseph was a great host! The house is beautiful! It’s in a great location within walking distance to downtown bars and restaurants! It was a perfect place for our weekend stay!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a beautifully restored home. The location is great for walking to shops and restaurants. The kitchen provided coffee, soft drinks, and water. Joseph met us at the door to give us a tour, house keys, and parking permits. I will definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was bigger and better than I expected and exceeded my expectations! Besides the place being super clean and nicely decorated, it also was had fully stocked refrigerators with drinks and condiments upstairs and downstairs. The kitchen had fresh coffee beans/coffee machine, full set of dishes and pots, and full the kitchen amenities. The basement is like your own personal little apartment with a little bar area off to the side. Plus the location is the best place to stay in Dubuque because you’re in the middle of everything and downtown is just around the corner and takes a few minutes to walk to. Don’t sleep on this place!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the townhouse. Joseph is a wonderful host and had great recommendations for our first time in Dubuque.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ken was very responsive and helpful when I made a booking error, and helped me get booked with this property.
The parking instructions and property entrance were very concise.
We didn’t spend much time at the rental but: the shower pressure was amazing, the rental was nice and quiet and the farmers market was a nice stop after we checked out early.
I flipped through the book of things to do in the area and found that it was helpful.
The only thing I wish for next time is that I arrive in town early enough to try the owner’s restaurant because it sounded great!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ken is amazing, he helped us find the parking and was very friendly. We walked to all the restaurants and bars from his house. The decor is sparse, but the most important things—the bed and the fluffy towels— were great!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place as we needed to bring our dog along to attended our wedding. very clean and nothing for our dog to ""get into"". We don't crate our dog but plenty of space to bring a crate along. walk to 7 Hills Brewery/Event Center or plenty of other restaurants."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken and his wife are great people. The airbnb was an amazing deal! it’s in the historic district and there’s so many cool things in walking distance. they own a restaurant called Oolongs right next door & it was delicious. we also walked to the dubuque elevator and around town to some beautiful places. Odd Fellows bar is a cool place to check out if you like oddity places. We stayed here to attend a conference at the Grand River Center and it was perfect. i loved the space, location, and our hosts. Thanks so much Ken! will definitely be recommending your place to others staying in dubuque."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Ken's for 1 night. His place was easy to find. He sent video directions to the off-street parking spot and to the apartment. We met him that evening when we were taking our dog for a walk, and he was very nice. The apartment had everything we needed for an overnight stay. We were very comfortable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ken was a great host, and this was a great place to stay!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"As advertised. Decent, functional space with everything you need. Good restaurants close. Quiet. Took a minute to find the parking (it is right along 12th st) and the alley entrance to property. Ken was very responsive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, comfortable stay for short visit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, especially if your going to the farmer's market. Ken did an amazing job with communication and getting back quickly. Enjoyed our stay."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was a great place to stay. The place was clean, the kitchen was fully equipped, the bathroom towels were stain-free, there were makeup wipes in the bathroom, it was nice to have a fan and AC in the bedroom, the coach was comfy, and the parking spot was nearby. If you’re staying on a Saturday during the months the farmer’s market is going on, the Airbnb is right on the street the farmer’s market takes place, so that’s very convenient. We also went to Ken’s restaurant, Oolong Asian Cuisine, that was only a block away from the Airbnb, which was a good restaurant to check out. Overall a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ken also pays attention to some important intangibles:
-high-quality tissue in the bathroom
-whisper-silent AC window units. They just pump cold air without much sound.
He's very responsive and answered his phone all 5-6 times I called him. Even after we left, thinking a makeup bag was left behind. We later found the bag in a side pocket of luggage but he checked after we had left."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved his little place. Tucked away and private. It had everything you need for a short stay. It was extremely hot while I was there but when I got into the apartment is was cool and quiet and I was able to stretch out on the couch and stream some good movies.
The bedroom is awesome with a huge bed.
He was very nice and answered my messages instantly."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute spot with many walkable cafes and breweries! On Saturday there was a local farmers market that was really nice to walk through ( and was massive). The home itself was very clean, and even had exactly what was inside the cabinets (I think is very helpful). Ken is very responsive with any questions you have. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Dubuque!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, nice place. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ken's place was the perfect home from home in Dubuque. I was travelling for a conference and for the first time brought my new adopted dog. So this dog friendly Airbnb was perfect for us!
The place was just as described and the location is perfect for exploring Dubuque. The kitchen is well equipped, the bed is super comfy and the shower is amazing! We felt right at home.
Given that my dog is pretty reactive still, I appreciated the private setting of the apartment. The great thing about Dubuque is that it had the right activity level for her. She barely ever got triggered, so if you are travelling with a reactive pup, I can highly recommend! There are many great trails nearby to explore, Mines of Spain was our favourite!
Ken is fast at responding, helpful and the instructions for check-in and check out are easy. I highly recommend his place! Sadly, I didn't manage to check out his restaurant, but I can confirm that it smells divine! Next time!"

He is a busy person, but always responsive to my questions. Thanks for a great experience and cute place."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a beautiful little apartment. The neighborhood is ""up and coming"" so I probably wouldn't walk alone at night but it had private off-street parking so not a huge issue.
The only real complaint was that it was very hot and there are no temperature controls in the apartment. Ken said there was one set of controls for the building. He had fans in every room and opening a window helped, but it was not ideal. But really that is the only thing that was not awesome."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Ken was very friendly and responsive. We would stay here again - very walkable location!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Ken's place - and it is more spacious than in the photos. Ken was very responsive and checked in to see how our stay was going. Overall, it was very clean, the bathroom was updated, and the bed and pillows were super comfy - we all slept really well both nights. The location was perfect - walking distance to a bookstore, yarn store, an art gallery and restaurants, including Ken's Oolong Asian Cuisine - the teriyaki stir fry udon was definitely a favorite!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was very clean and had an excellent location. The bed was very comfortable, however, the couch in the living room was not comfortable for two. If you're planning to cook while staying in this apartment, you might want to bring some items that you would need to make it possible. When we stayed, there were only two frying pans, some plates, bowls, mugs and utensils. We would consider staying here again if Ken took our suggestions and provided a few more staple items. He was very quick to respond to our questions."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really good place! Ended up having an emergency back home and needed to leave early, but what we did experience of our stay was really good! I would say that while the alley that gives access to the apartment is well lit during the day and has a front door camera, I'm not sure I would feel safe by myself at night. (the apartment itself was secure, just the path from the lot to the place is what I mean) Tbf, the people out at night could have been very nice and friendly people, I'm just anxious and there wasn't a lot of light or cameras that I could see. It's more of a personal preference, but I thought I'd mention it in case that would bother someone else :)"

Ken was very friendly and very responsive. I can't recommend this place enough.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great little apartment for an overnight in Dubuque!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot for a couple nights stay. Ken‘s place has all the basic necessities, and Ken himself was very responsive and helpful in communicating. We parked in the wrong place to begin, so he was able to help us find the right spot right away. We also needed a can opener, and within 5 minutes or less we had one!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken provided great instructions finding the unit with texted recorded video and photos, which was so helpful. The location was fine in older downtown Dubuque and the entry/parking is in an alley. This older unit is ground level and the walls and ceiling are thin. We heard multiple conversations, showers right above the bed at night, as well as light and heavy footsteps, so if you're a light sleeper, you may want to find another spot. The unit is cozy though and the amenities were just right for two people."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was very glad that Ken gave useful and specific instructions for parking and how to find the apartment. The apartment itself felt like our own private hotel room, very clean and simple. Ken introduced himself to us at one point outside, and he was very kind in person and over messages. The quality of the mattress/pillows could’ve been better, but for the price, this was an excellent place to stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Ken's place. It was the perfect location for a private getaway in Dubuque while my children were at camp. Walkable to many attractions in Dubuque, and a short drive to many more! Ken was so kind, and responded right away to any question I had. Clean, comfortable, and everything in the kitchen I needed to cook for the week. A really wonderful spot, and I'll be booking it again for next summer!"

Not a review on Ken, but Airbnb: The cleaning fees have gotten quite ridiculous. With cleaning fees included, the total cost of a nightly stay becomes twice the listed price of the Airbnb. $50 to clean a tiny apartment this size? Hmmm."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ken is a great host!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ken was a fantastic host! There wasn't an iron on premises, but he delivered one right away when I asked. The apartment was as described. The bed was comfortable, We appreciated the full kitchen. The shower is tight, but expected based on the size of the place. The only think that might be more helpful for future guests is to somehow have better instructions on the dedicated parking spot. It was very helpful that public parking is free on weekends in Dubuque. Over all, the location and this spot was great for what we needed."

The room was small but has a surprisingly large kitchen area. Everything was functional and clean.
The bathroom, sink, and toilet are also on the small side as listed in the description, but met all of our needs and was great value for the price we paid. I would definitely stay at Ken’s place again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Ken's place. The location is perfect for pretty much everything downtown Dubuque has to offer. Walking distance to breweries (the apartment is a literal half block away from Jubeck's and the other breweries aren't too far away) and several coffee shops/restaurants as well. The neighborhood is safe, walker friendly and quiet. The apartment itself is clean and well stocked with kitchen essentials. The host, Ken, is a wonderful person! He was super quick to respond when we had a question about parking and was very warm and friendly throughtout our entire stay. If we're ever back in the Dubuque area, we'd definitely book Ken's place again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Perfect for work, very clean and quiet"
,,,"We were hoping for a special weekend away and ended up disappointed.  We left halfway through our stay. A measure of a host is not only whether things are right to begin with but how they respond and rectify things if issues arise. This host treated us poorly when we complained instead of providing proper customer service. The experience at this property was unacceptable, not representative of super host status. There was a uric odor that permeated the apt. during our stay-not the fault of the host, yet the host denied there was any issue and didn’t prep the place appropriately until we complained. More critical was the lack of hot water in the shower. The response from the host was to blame us for the problem and accuse us of lying, then belatedly mentioning that the hot and cold on the dial were BACKWARDS. Additionally this property is in a busy, noisy part of Dubuque with raucous crowds rocking nearby bars. Wi-fi was unreliable, dropping out and when we did have it, a weak signal."
