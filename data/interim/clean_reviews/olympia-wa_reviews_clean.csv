2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely, peaceful house. We loved everything about it. She had it stocked with shampoo, olive oil, firewood. So much stuff that made it so easy. Thank you again Cindy. Hostess with the mostess"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place and Cindy is excellent host! Very peaceful and serene with all the lake views. Close proximity to where we needed to be and to local area. Very cozy and loved the fireplace as the weather was not the best while we were there unfortunately. This will definitely be our go to place though for our future visits. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greatly enjoyed our stay at the lake house! Cindy proactively made sure that we had everything we needed
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family of 3 had a great time at Cindy's Lakeside Haven. The view of the lake from the wall of windows all along the back of the house was outstanding. Everything was clean and neatly appointed. We really loved making use of the dock (and were so glad it wasn't a floating dock but stationary!) We used every single one of the water sport options and thoroughly enjoyed each one! We would love to come again. Cindy was responsive and helpful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s place is so comfortable and nicely furnished! She included many extra kitchen and bathroom supplies !!
The view of the lake is incredible from inside or from the amazing deck!
The fire pit looks awesome !!
Want to come back when we can use it !
Great yard heading down to the lake.
The dock is very cool. Especially at night with lights edging it.
We loved the peacefulness and beautiful surroundings!! Nicest AirBnB I’ve ever stayed at!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy is a responsive, gracious and kind host. Her home is secluded, spotless, well decorated and better than the images. The fire-pit was a great amenity and added to the peaceful view of the lake. We will definitely be back soon!
Thanks Cindy! ♥️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Cindy's house. The house is beautifully decorated and we felt right at home. All of the amenities were perfect and the bed was so comfortable. We would love to stay again next time we are in town. I recommend Cindy's place to anyone staying near Olympia or Lacey.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at your lakeside house! The house was the perfect size for our family of 3, and the location is so beautiful and peaceful. Cindy was a great communicator and was really willing to go above and beyond if necessary - when we visited there had been an unexpected (and short-lived) snow storm the night beythat knocked power out at the lake house. Cindy kept us informed about the power status and even offered to let us spend the night in another studio property that she has for a night if we needed to. Fortunately the power came back on right before we were ready to check in! The kitchen was well-stocked and had everything we could have asked for."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay at this airbnb, the home is very clean and new. It was nice being next to the water and watching the ducks and eagles flying around. The home feels like stepping into an interior design magazine and the beds are comfortable. Cindy was a wonderful host who checked in with me on the first day and allowed me privacy the remaining days. While I stayed in the winter season I am sure the summer season would be wonderful since there amenities like the kayaks that would be perfect for summer. I especially loved the lake view from the living room and it was very calming and peaceful. I highly recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If I could give this SUPER HOST 10 stars I would. It was everything. The house was immaculate with an amazing view. The amenities made you feel like you were staying in an upscale hotel. The host responded and helped us with everything we needed in more than a timely manner. They were very friendly and willing to do anything in their power to help make your stay amazing. I’ll definitely be coming back to this Airbnb anything I’m in Olympia.
THIS IS A MUST STAY LOCATION!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can’t express but I will try, this home was so comfortable and complete with everything you needed to feel at home away from home and then some. If you were to move in this home, you wouldn’t need anything but your clothes. It was so beautiful inside and out. Inside is like you would see in a magazine. The outside is just as nice . Very well lit up inside and out. First class barbecue, with a rotisserie Cindy purchased at my request. Cindy went out of her way to have everything we needed.
I haven’t even mentioned the views. To wake up in the morning, get your coffee and to look out over the lake and watch the ducks swimming and flying over the lake was so peaceful. The beautiful deck in the back , wall to wall windows to see from inside as well. Last but not least, is the train echoing over the lake with a beautiful sunset was like being in a movie.
I was so impressed that we are spoiled for future vacations. Cindy Thank You so much for sharing your home with us 😊"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little hideaway nook in Mud Bay! The home is newly remodeled and very cozy for a couple or small family. Theists were responsive and attentive, and proactively checked in a couple times to make sure that all needs were met."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a cute little casita with a beautiful view of gorgeous trees and Mud Bay. I got a kick out of the fact that it used to be floating on the water. The view and the peaceful, private setting are what I enjoyed most about it, but everything was great. It was very clean and had everything I needed. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fern’s Cottage was absolutely lovely! Quiet, clean, and centrally located to everything we wanted to see while visiting. Anne recommended a cafe for breakfast, and we ended up going every morning…a truly delightful experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Anne was a welcoming and flexible host. The accommodation was private and perfectly equipped. We were in Olympia to visit our daughter and her wife and were able to host them for a cooked meal given the excellent kitchen facilities and living area. The accommodation was equipped with everything we needed and Anne had also provided snacks, tea, coffee, milk and even a bottle of wine to help us settle in.
The local co-op store (open 7 days a week) and Bits cafe (open Fri, Sat, Sun) were very handy and the free bus (no 45) into Olympia or out to the Mall made a useful alternative to walking or using the hire car.
The local area was a quiet peaceful residential area and we felt very safe walking around at any time of day or night. There was also a pleasant woodland path and bayside park to walk to.
The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the outside seating area. We definitely plan to stay with Anne again, the next time we are over in Olympia!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Anne's place for 5 nights and felt right at home from the moment we stepped into Fern's Cottage! It was wonderfully stocked and the little extras were such a welcoming and kind touch. The cottage is cozy and the bathroom was nice and spacious (which sometimes isn't always the case for smaller dwellings). The outside was beautiful and peaceful, and we had such a restful time. We both work from home and found the wifi speeds were great (worked well for the video calls I had!). If we need to stay again in the area we would return in a heartbeat, and definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Olympia or the surrounding areas. Thanks again for a great stay, Anne!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time staying at Anne's place; it's a pleasure to stay here with the well-equipped kitchen, helpful folder of instructions (for those of us new to induction burners!), comfortable sitting and sleeping spaces as well as a spacious bathroom. Well-furnished without being cluttered. And free of intrusive air scent products - Hurrah! For me, it's also very walkable to downtown- through the residential neighborhood & across the bridge."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,The Fern Cottage is a perfect location for West Olympia. really enjoyed my stay. Would recommend to all. I was on a business trip this time around. but will be great to stay again when I could really enjoy what the area has to offer. Anne is a great host also. She offered insightfully recommendations about the area. Will stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time staying at Anne's place! I felt extra at home with the provided water bottles in the fridge and a few snacks in the drawer. Overall I would highly recommend this place!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend this property. Anne's place was perfect for me as a solo traveler. It was SUPER clean, had lots of thoughtful amenities, a well-stocked kitchen, and a well-stocked bathroom. She left coffee and some snacks which was above and beyond. The space is updated and well laid out. The location is perfect, close enough to walk along the water and to walk to restaurants and stores if you wanted. The bed was extremely comfortable, I slept great! The outdoor space is peaceful. Anne was easy to communicate with and a very gracious host. I will book again if I can when I return. :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stayed for 2 weeks. Needed a quiet, restful place to spend Christmas. Chose this lovely cottage for the high end finishings and gorgeous little kitchen. We are from scratch cooks and found the kitchen well stocked for the most part. Enjoyed cooking on the induction stove and being a short walk (less than 5 minutes) from the excellent organic produce at the Olympia Food Co-op. Bed was comfy, neither super soft or super firm.
Notes for future renters:
The hair product was a combination shampoo/conditioner so if you have easily tangled hair, bring your own conditioner. Great place for 1 person, or a couple comfortable with each other given the lack of privacy. It was perfect for us as a married couple. We would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne’s place has everything you need for a comfortable and cozy stay. The bed is very comfortable and the place is tastefully decorated. Anne provided everything you need including extra pillows, extra towels, and binders with information about local amenities and attractions. The kitchen was well equipped. The little patio and garden area are very nice and private. It is a pretty quiet place to stay and still be close to downtown Olympia. Check in was a breeze since Anne leaves clear instructions for you. Wifi worked great as well! I hope her place is available the next time I am in the Olympia area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Anne is a great host, very personable and willing to assist with her guests needs.
The property was very nice and fully equipped for a night or a few weeks.
The location is very convenient to shopping and downtown Olympia."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Fern’s Cottage! Truly spotless in every respect. Cozy, with every amenity. I would stay there again. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A perfect cozy spot for a visit to Olympia. Close and walkable (15 minutes) to downtown but located in a quiet neighborhood. The cottage is an exquisite studio apartment for two, well-designed and appointed, and meticulously maintained. Anne is a great host, responsive, and communicative. If you are looking for a getaway to Olympia, this is it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Would definitely come back
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short time at Anne's cottage. It was very clean, comfortable, and had everything I needed. Anne is very communicative and responsive. It is in walking distance to a great little trail down to the water, the Olympia Coop, and downtown. I would highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice studio apartment with a large bathroom, very nice small kitchen and great outdoor space. Definitely worth a look if you’re in the Olympia area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Anne is an amazing host and it’s clear she paid attention to the details, giving her place that “home away from home” vibe. The location is peaceful yet close to everything Olympia has to offer. Would highly recommend a stay at her place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I think this place is quintessential example of what an airbnb stay should feel like. Super clean and fully equipped with everything you need to call it home, short distance away (by foot and car) to everything you might need. An absolute must for those looking for a place in between Mt. Rainier & Olympus. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne was an excellent host and the place exceeded our expectations! Would definitely come back here again! Highly recommended!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,The cottage was a good location for us to explore Olympia. Anne was very communicative and the cottage had everything we needed and more.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute clean place. It was perfect for the weekend get away.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have never stayed in an Air B/B as nicely and thoughtfully appointed as this cute little cottage. Everything was spotlessly clean, every little detail, from welcome wine cheese and crackers to extra towels and pillows- was taken care of. The cottage is set in the back of the host's house but there is plenty of privacy and a patio just for the cottage. The bed is very comfortable and super quiet. Just a great alternative to staying in a hotel. I can't recommend it enough, we will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To say that Anne’s place was perfect would not be an exaggeration. It is a beautiful, newly built, well-stocked and comfortable studio with some separation between kitchen, dining/sitting and sleeping areas. Anne has enhanced the space with a number of thoughtful, lovely touches, stocking the fridge and drawers with everything you will need and in addition to the usual and expected, also provided bars, half&half, coffee, tea, drinks, cheese and crackers, books, maps and brochures about Olympia and nearby attractions, and even a bottle of wine.
The house is on a hill above downtown, but it is easily accessible by a short walk or bike or drive. Anne also was very responsive and promptly answered questions we had. If/when we return to Olympia I’m sure we will visit this home again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Walking distance to local places (recommend Bits and Olympia coffee) and about 10-15 min walk to downtown Oly.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean place and great host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Fern's cottage as our base while visiting Olympia. We were there to visit our family but I really enjoyed the cottage and the neighborhood so much we spent most of our time in this area. Anne gives attention to every detail, the cottage is immaculate and beautifully styled. The bed was cozy and comfortable. The kitchen and bath were super. The living areas both inside and out are quite nice. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Within walking distance you will find a cool community filled with great things to see and do. I hope to visit again and again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved every minute! So peaceful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fern Cottage was wonderful. The decor and surroundings were comfortable and welcoming. We felt safe and secure and almost like home there. Anne was welcoming and eager to help us whenever we needed it. We would gladly return the next time we are in Olympia to visit our son and his family. Thanks for the wine, cheese, and crackers."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ferns Cottage is an amazing find. We hope to stay here in all future visits to Olympia. The place is perfect and Anne is a gracious host. The layout and privacy of the place (even though it’s behind the main house, we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves) combined with the thoughtful touches and treats make this place truly top notch. I really enjoyed my coffee in the garden each morning. Stay here! You will be so glad you did."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and beautiful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne’s cottage is one of the nicest Air BnB studios I’ve stayed in. The bed is very comfortable with nice linens and pillows. It was stocked with absolutely everything and anything I might need. She thoughtfully provided cold drinks, cheese and crackers, a nice bottle of wine, coffee, half n half, and condiments/seasonings. The unit looks brand new with many personal touches, interesting art, and local maps and guidebooks. The views of trees out each window and a patio area make it a very pleasant place to stay. I visit family in Olympia occasionally and would definitely stay there again if it’s available. Anne responded promptly to my questions and graciously let me check in early."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my 2nd stay at Anne's place. I was so happy it was available again. Top drawer all the way!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Modern. Clean. Well appointed. Anne made sure we were comfortable and equipped. We loved staying at Fern’s Cottage.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I love Olympia and our time at Fern Cottage made this year’s stay perfect. The quiet garden setting was just what we needed to come home to each day. The comfortable interior was cozy, spacious and immaculate, and the extra treats Anne had left us made us feel especially welcome. Our communications with Anne were easy and our questions were promptly answered. We look forward to returning to Fern Cottage on our next trip to Olympia."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Perfect location! Loved going to Bits Cafe nearby. Anne provided alot of necessities one would normally need at a hotel. the cottage had everything! Cute decor, loved the quiet/peaceful setting. We will absolutely stay again here on another vacation to Olympia! Thank you to Anne for being an incredibly considerate host!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fern's cottage was great - beautiful, comfy, efficient, well-located - with a lovely patio for eating outside. It was perfect for visiting my son, an Evergreen grad, who lives in Olympia. We enjoyed cooking together, listening to music (on youtube), and walked to the nearby coop.
The bed is very comfy and the neighborhood quiet and peaceful. Anne was easy to communicate with. The coffee machine is easy to operate if you ignore the righthand side, and just pour the cold water into the reservoir right behind the metal coffee filter."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with lots of amenities that we really enjoyed. Spacious and easy to get in and out to enjoy the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne's cottage is amazing and truly one of the best places we've ever stayed. Her attention to detail in every area from the interior design to the extremely well stocked kitchen and bathroom made for a very comfortable and lovely stay. She was also so easy to communicate with and made sure that all of our needs were met. This is the only place we'll stay next time we're in Olympia.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place looks adorable and crispy clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne was a very patient and understanding host. :-) Thanks Anne!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne is always a great host and is readily available to answer any questions or issues. The house is in a nice neighborhood on the West Side and within walking distance of the nearby co-op for groceries. The guest house is very clean and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage, Anne. I hope it continues to be a successful venture for you."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect quaint and romantic for a couple. Bed was warm and cozy.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fern’s Cottage is a lovely Airbnb. It’s a new building (a year or so old). It’s beautifully decorated, with a very comfortable bed. Anne provides a lot of nice, thoughtful extras with your stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a comfortable place to stay in Olympia and easy walking distance to the west side co-op for groceries. Anne provides nice treats in the fridge and the bed is very comfortable. I highly recommend this for your stay in Olympia.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quaint clean cottage in a convenient location.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Anne is a gracious and accommodating host. I was forced to change the duration of my stay once I had already arrived, and she was fantastic in responding to the change and communicating with me about it.
The self-contained cottage is immaculate and well equipped with all the conveniences. The location is excellent.
The host lives in the adjacent home. The cottage used to be the garage, and the two structures are close to one another. For somebody not used to having a host present, this is something to consider.
The guest shares a driveway with the host.
The bed is on the far end of the soft scale, meaning that it is very soft. I found it to be too soft."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne's cottage is a new, well-designed and tastefully furnished studio apartment with lovely comfortable bed, very large bathroom, and a fully supplied kitchen including all the appliances one might need (microwave, toaster, etc). It offers privacy in the midst of a nice quiet residential area at a walkable distance from downtown Olympia. Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne's Fern Cottage was a magical place to stay. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. I have a disability, and there has never been an easier place to access. All walks were paved, there are no steps in, and there is a walk in shower with a seat. The floor was not over crowded with furniture dodge. Anne went over the top with a bottle of wine and a few snacks to make someone feel right at home. Very close to shopping areas, and the local food Co op was just around the corner. I would not only stay here again myself, I would also recommend it to anyone I knew that was traveling to the Olympia area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I booked this for my parents who were visiting me from out of town and they loved it! the cottage is super cute, private, and accessible. Anne was a wonderful host. I hope to book with Anne again the next time my family comes out!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect little house right in the heart of Olympia, in walking distance to restaurants. The house was spotless and possibly the cleanest Airbnb experience thus far. Anne was a great host and made our stay as easy as possible. The location is right in between Olympic national park and Mt. rainier. The drive each day to the parks was soooo worth it- if you’re wanting to hit up both."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place is beautiful!!! Location is perfect!!! Would recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is adorable and so clean. We enjoyed our stay and it is a quick walk to the Olympia Food Co-Op, and downtown is just a skip away. Very comfortable."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the property was close to everything you could want including the local food Cooperative which was nice. The accommodations are well appointed with everything you could need for cooking, coffee and snacks. Anne left some lovely yummies in the fridge including some very delicious coffee!
Provided in the studio was cooking items including oils, spices and coffee/tea/ cocoa to enjoy while you watch your morning programs. There is outdoor seating area to enjoy your tapas or a book. The studio is fully ADA equipped with bathroom that will accommodate someone who is not able to stand which a wonderful! Air conditioning was a plus as well due to the time of stay was during a heat wave. Anne, your host, is wonderful and highly recommend staying here when you travel to Olympia!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne's place was fantastic. We stayed for Friday and Saturday nights and were very comfortable as we visited with family and friends in the area. Anne's place was spectacularly clean and well stocked with everything we needed and much more. Communication with Anne was fast and clear, and check in was a breeze. The neighborhood was quiet, and we walked out to downtown multiple times. This was one of the best Airbnb we have stayed at, and we will certainly look for Anne's place the next time we visit Olympia."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Not a speck of dust to be found! Anne’s place is located in a nice quiet neighborhood that offered a nice sense of security for a solo female traveler. The bed was comfortable too!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fern Cottage is an absolutely charming and delightful accommodation. Anne couldn’t have been more gracious and communicative. There were so many special little touches throughout, and the cottage was impeccable and incredibly clean and spacious. Most Airbnb‘s don’t come with quite the extensive amenities that were available throughout, including generous kitchen items and ample supplies in the bathroom. Access was also wonderful and the location of the cottage itself was incredibly convenient to all the areas in Olympia one would want to get to. I would absolutely recommend Fern Cottage and if we ever had a need in the area, it’s the first place we will call. Anne is a wonderful host!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna is so warm and friendly and her house is very quiet, clean, and peaceful. I stopped there on a road trip when my tent and car-bed were wet after a rain forest trip and I needed some place warm / dry to sleep. I booked at the last minute and Anna was very quick to respond and accept my request. Her pets are so friendly, chill, and well-behaved. Was a joy staying there!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two thumbs up - the price is VERY reasonable, the house and bedroom were spotless (even with a dog and a cat!), and Anna is welcoming and gracious. I was there for 5 nights. She offered to let me do laundry there, encouraged me to use the kitchen, asked about my day, and offered to help carry things out to the car at the end. She is very good at making brief appearances and then going to do something else. It was a pleasure to stay at her house!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful host! I enjoyed staying at Anna's home. It was very clean & Anna was incredibly friendly. This is a great value option for a room (one of two at the AirBnb) near Olympia with all the comforts of home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna is such a wonderful host! Her house is clean, bright, spacious, and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable! I loved getting to meet her sweet dog and cat, and her garden is beautiful. The Cul de sac is quiet, and a short walk from Tumwater Square. Anna gave me great advice on what to see and where to go.

Made me wish I packed a little lighter. If I’m ever back in the area, I’ll definitely book with her again! She just left a really great impression on me."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Having stayed at Ana and Leika's place before, I knew what to expect and everything went very smoothly just as before, including pre-arrival communication, check in, and check out. Because I was in town on business, I wasn't around much during the day--was mainly there to sleep, shower, and eat breakfast--but while I was there, I felt very much at home. Although the bathroom is shared, it was always available when I needed it, and there was good off-street parking and plenty of refrigerator space for my three days' worth of groceries. Since the last time I stayed with Ana, she's taken in a couple pets which are both clean and well-behaved--Ana also checked with me to make sure that I didn't have pet allergies before I stayed. And since it was very warm when I stayed--it was in the 90s on one day--I appreciated that Ana already had a fan running in my room when I checked in and the room remained cool enough that I didn't have much trouble sleeping. Ana remembered me from my previous stay, so it was fun to catch up. I'd be happy to stay with her again!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's a phenomenal stay. Anna is a gracious host who will help anyway she can. My stay couldn't have been any better. I've been here a day over 2 months and hate to leave.

I love her thoughtful and minimalist home that was always sparkling clean. My room was more than comfortable; her kitchen had everything necessary; the bathroom was always clean. Anna is easy to talk to and a pleasure to live with. Thank you so much for everything, Anna!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Anna’s place, and everything was pretty much as before—efficient check-in/check out, very neat and tidy space, and Anna remains a friendly and gracious host. Since I had stayed with Anna a few months earlier, there wasn’t need for an extensive check-in but Anna was around in case I had any questions and she also let me borrow her iron even though it wasn't included as one of the amenities inside the room. As with my previous stay, I was here for work so I wasn’t at the house much except to sleep and eat breakfast. This time, I found the freeway connections and commute to be a lot easier to navigate, although I did leave before the 8 am rush and was coming back at night well after evening rush hour—if you’re coming from the westside of Olympia/Tumwater after 8-9 pm on a weekday or even on Sunday afternoon, that stretch of 101 to I-5 is nice and clear. Unfortunately, I still haven’t had a chance to explore the area much, but this time I saw that there was a Safeway near the freeway and Anna’s place also appears to be close to the highest-rated Italian restaurant in Tumwater, so I’ll be sure to check those out next time I’m in town. During my previous stay, I found Farrelli’s to offer a decent pizza in a part of Lacey that’s maybe 10 mins. away by car Anna’s place, so that’s another reason to come back in addition to the good value and convenience that Anna’s place provides."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna is delightful and friendly, and her place was a great base for our short trip from Seattle to the Tumwater/Olympia area! Highly recommended!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cozy place! Anna is very nice and replies promptly.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Anna's. Every step was easy from booking to her check-in/stay instructions. One of the best rest I've had while traveling during our stay. And what's so interesting, we knew some people from Lacey. Small world!!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was one of the pleasureable experience of staying away from home. The place was neat and clean as promised. Anna was great at community and ensuring our comfort. Highly recommend.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna's home is clean and comfortable as always!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna's place is the best kept secret. It's a place to get a good night sleep and be on your way. Great location. And, a quiet neighborhood."

I would recommend this to anyone .
Thank you Anne"

Next time we’re in the Olympia area we will definitely try to stay with Anne again!"

I am a regular here ( one night per week). Her place is always; quiet and clean. Her rooms are cozy. I feel like I’m home when I’m at Anne’s place."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anne was a great host. She responded very quickly for my last minute stay. If you forget to pack any of the essentials, don't worry Anne has you covered. Would definitely recommend a stay at Anne's place!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a nice stay at Anne’s place, which is well represented in the photos provided on Airbnb. The entire place is very neat and tidy, and even though I was only there to sleep and eat breakfast, it appeared to have everything anyone would need to be comfortable. Anne has set aside room in the kitchen fridge for you and the individual bedroom also had a lock with key that provides an extra measure of security. Anne checked me in herself, and provided perhaps the most thorough check in I’ve had at an Airbnb. And in case you forget anything or check in yourself, she also has a handy preprinted guide that you can consult, complete with photos and detailed instructions for off-street parking. This was my first stay in Tumwater, and I found that this safe, quiet suburban location provides easy access to Olympia just an exit or two away on the freeway (also accessible by surface streets). It was easy to find Anne’s place from the freeway, but it’s a little tricky getting back on when you leave the first time—just make sure you use GPS or consult a map for that first foray. This was also the first time I’ve stayed at an Airbnb with a shared bath, but it was easy to coordinate—any possible inconvenience that might arise from a shared bath seems to have been considered in the pricing, which I believe to be quite fair. In any case, Anne is a friendly, very well organized host who’s excellent at communication… Even before this stay, I had already booked a second stay later in the fall and I’m already looking forward to returning…"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne is a fantastic sweet person. Her place is super clean and cozy. It’s a nice place to relax. She’s has everything you need. Which a lot of people don’t have. I would stay there a million times. I do really thank her.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne was nice enough to book me last minute after I had a change in travel plans. She is very responsive and answered my messages promptly. The room was clean and comfy as expected. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are around Olympia!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second stay at Anne’s AIRBNB went well. I love this place, I look forward to visiting again soon!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne puts the H-O-S-P-I-T-A-L-I-T-Y in hospitality. The reason I spilled the entire word is that she is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The house is a 2.5 mile 20-30 minute walk (5-minute drive) to downtown Olympia as well being close to Interstate 5. There's a small store down the street from her house in case you need anything. She offers amazing toiletries which were great after spending a week in a hostel in Portland where I used hand soap to wash my hair. The best part about the location was its essentially 2.0-2.5 hours from the national parks and cities.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne is a wonderful host. The house is sparkling clean, comfortable, and convenient. It is in a very quiet residential neighborhood but very close to amenities (grocery/gas/restaurants in walking distance) and a 5-minute drive to the Capitol and downtown Olympia. Highly recommended!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anne´s place is very clean and comfy. She´s a very nice and flexible host. since we had to check-in in the middle of the night she offered us a late check-out and let us sleep in on Sunday morning. Thanks a lot, Anne!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I’s stay at Peggy’s place far exceeded our expectations. The place was very clean and smelled nice. Peggy also had several homey touches that made the place very functional, like a rack in the bathroom to place toiletries on and ibuprofen on standby. We had a brief conversation with her, and she was nice and polite while also being considerate of our privacy and space. I would highly recommend this stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! Peggy is a great communicator - both informative and responsive. Very comfortable setting - unit is as pictured with top quality amenities and the lawn/gardens are most relaxing. Recommended restaurants and bakery were delightful. Enjoyed walking the neighborhood with so many beautiful trees and flower gardens. Olympia seemed to be a fun town to explore and if we are able to return for a longer stay, we’d hope to stay with Peggy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy is such a great host - she really goes the extra mile to make sure you’re comfortable. The space is also full of little touches that add to your comfort. I would love to come back!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy & cozy in Olympia.
This was our first time in Olympia and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Peggy's place was comfortable and clean with just the right amount of amenities to get us going in the morning (microwave, toaster, Keurig, water cooler, etc.). Peggy's suite has really easy access to downtown Olympia and the I5, plus a nice neighbourhood bakery right around the corner.
Peggy also, tastefully, laid out some extra snacks, coffee pods, tea bags, and even spare toiletries. A VERY appreciated gesture.
Check-in/out was easy with the keypad door lock and it was easy to find out way to the suite.
The Mission Creek Nature Park (accessible through the back gate on the property), was a beautiful spot for a walk and to bask in the Pacific Northwest Nature."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"extremely well appointed, comfortable and peaceful. I will definitely return. Peggy was super friendly and accommodating."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy had really taken the time to make it feel like you were walking into a house. The breakfast nook had snacks and coffee, which we were not expecting. There were fresh flowers and she had a sign when you walked in that had my name on it! She really made it feel like honey and even checked in the next morning to ask us how the first night went! She left us alone most of the trip, but checked in every so often just to make sire everything was still going well. Such an amazing host and when my husband and i come to washington again, i am definitely looking to see if she is booked or not(I REALLY REALLY HOPE NOT!!!)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy place to stay and relax, the backyard is beautiful and connected to a walkable trail right behind the house.

Her gorgeous backyard which she cares for so lovingly is a huge extra bonus.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is a real gem and the perfect place for a quiet evening after days of training. I will certainly look to book again when I’m in Olympia!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I should start by saying that I have primarily been someone who stays at hotels and not at Airbnb locations. My stay at Peggy’s Urban Cottage Suite has really converted me! I can honestly say that everything was perfect. And I don’t say that lightly…it was such a lovely place with so many wonderful amenities. The special touches were endless and made for such a welcoming and comfortable stay…enjoyable snacks, every bathroom amenity you could need, cozy bathrobes, comfortable bedding and extra pillows….the list is truly endless! The location is charming, which also describes Peggy as a host. I can’t wait to stay here again! Thanks for everything, Peggy!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can tell Peggy puts a lot of thought into her little cottage. From the odds and ends you might have forgotten or need in a pinch (e.g. cough drops, floss, Neosporin, etc.) to a couple chilled glasses in the freezer, she's thought of everything! This was the perfect study spot as I got ready to take an exam at the testing center nearby. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, very quiet and peaceful, AMAZING backyard/garden space, and all the amenities you could want. What a great airbnb! After I leave this review, I'm going to book again for my next work trip into town :)"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy’s place has set the bar high for all future b&b experiences. All the little touches like snacks (when you get in too late overnight) and earplugs (bc you forgot them). A cute place that was squeaky clean and comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved her place and she is a great host, communicating well etc. The kitchenette worked perfect for us as we were visiting family. Stocked very well with snacks, coffee, tea, essentials. She asked more than once if there was anything she could pick up for us. We walked often around the neighborhood which is super funky with lots of old houses that run the gamut in condition. I new the neighborhood with relatives 5 blocks away, which helps know the nice bakery is in easy walking distance. Although not sidewalks on every street, it is nice to walk the neighborhood. Interesting, charming, quiet, and the bakery! We hope to stay again when Peggy’s yard is in bloom.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy has created a beautiful, home away from home, place to stay. We arrived after an unexpected long day of travel at 4:00 pm without lunch; we found snacks in the kitchen. A life saver for us! She has created such a comfortable, warm and inviting little house. The bed was very comfortable, lovely linens, a clean bathroom with a place to put our toiletries, great blow dryer and bathrobes! Towels for makeup, clean shower and even a floor heater.
The kitchen had a hot and cold water dispenser for tea, hot chocolate and a Keurig for coffee. Refrigerator, toaster and little table for breakfast. Seriously, Peggy, you are amazing!!! We loved our stay and would HIGHLY recommend her place to anyone staying in Olympia.
Peggy is responsive, kind and delightful. Thank you Peggy for going over and above as you prepared your lovely place for travelers. Happy New Year!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy's place is such a lovely space. The entrance brings you to your own private porch overlooking the backyard. Inside was immaculate and inviting. The bed was big and comfy with wonderful quality sheets and comforters. The gas fireplace next to the bed kept us really toasty and provided wonderful ambiance. Great, large TV positioned so it was easy to watch from bed and had lots of channels to watch. The bathroom was very well thought out, and Peggy provided thick, lush towels and nice smelling soaps and lotions. In the breakfast nook, there was plenty of room to store cold stuff in the fridge / freezer. We used the microwave, but not the toaster oven or coffee maker, but Peggy provided lots of snacks, hot apple cider, hot chocolate and coffee. Internet was very good and there were plenty of outlets to charge our phones and computers. Highly recommend Peggy's! Close to everything!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my 3rd stay with Peggy. It's a nice quiet area and the on site parking is a plus. The room is comfortable and inviting. Looking forward to my next stay.

As it got down into the 20’s during my stay, the fireplace next to the bed was easy to operate and kept me feeling warm and snug.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Peggy’s suite was great. To start, the neighborhood was peaceful and pretty, with a park less than a block away that we could walk in. The bakery nearby was a short walk for breakfast as well. Finding the house was a breeze and we were grateful for the designated parking space off the road. Peggy’s instructions were super easy to follow, and she was always available to answer any questions. She really seemed to care that we settled comfortably and certainly made us feel welcome. Overall our stay was wonderful and we will definitely recommend this AirBnb to our friends and family in the future!"

Loved the gas fireplace! We wished we could have had more time to spend in her wonderful garden. She provided foods and a ""just in case you forgot"" box that were a nice touch. The only thing this room doesn't have is a kitchen sink but we didn't miss it. When we were leaving she gave us some yummy breakfast bread for the road. We wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you Peggy."

Peggy left a binder with check out instructions, and local sites of interest like an amazing local bakery within walking distance. The airbnb is near to a very cute nature trail as well, so I did early morning walks. The garden is a lovely place; very peaceful and quirky. Make sure to read the check-in instructions clearly.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time using an Airbnb, and Peggy’s place was as good of an experience as one could ask for. Everything was beyond our expectations, and it would be my first recommendation to friends and family if they ever want to come to the area to visit."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful use of space. Friendly host who added personalised touches for our stay. Very private with tons of natural light. It even came with ample snack food, coffee, and tea. We will definitely be staying again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another stay at Peggy’s place, and we continue to be grateful to stay in such a clean, cute, safe, convenient place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming place— will definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy's home is quite truly the best AirBnB I've stayed in. She's clearly thought about the needs of her guests and anticipated those needs. I really appreciated everything she's done. The bed is so comfortable, the linens lovely, and with a choice of layers to easily warm up or cool down. The kitchenette is thoughtfully stocked - hot beverage options with coffee, teas, cider, hot chocolate, and I really appreciated the snacks and oatmeal options. There are breakfast and other dining options in driving range, but so nice to be able to start my morning quietly. I've stayed in other places remote from any options including coffee shops that didn't even bother with a coffee maker, not nice! It was very cozy snuggling into a movie alone after a fun but busy day visiting with my small grandkids. In the morning I sat with my coffee by the window looking out at the garden which I will love to visit during the growing season. It looks amazing even in winter! Thanks, Peggy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy- your home was so lovely to stay in. We are so lucky to have gotten the chance to book with you last minute and call your place a home away from home. Your attention to detail was immaculate- we had everything we could need and more. Thank you again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is beautifully decorated and cosy, with a nice gas fireplace. Very quiet neighborhood, good for walking around. Close to the inlet and downtown Olympia."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was traveling in late December, when the weather caused flight cancelations so my arrival was delayed. When I explained the situation to Peggy, she was very gracious and easy to communicate with. When I finally got to the Airbnb, it was such a lovely space, i immediately felt relaxed. I would definitely recommend Peggy's place to anyone looking for comfortable stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Peggy's has been the best I've had in the Olympia area this year. I've been traveling a lot, staying at different rentals, and Peggy's place surpasses them all in every regard. Comfortable bed, adorable and practical decorations, amazing location ... this place had it all! I really appreciated the snacks and extra items in the bathroom in case a guest forgets anything. Those little touches made the place stand out. Peggy was very responsive but not intrusive. <3 I hope I can stay here again soon!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Peggy's for a quick, surprise visit to my folks. The house was easy to find, entry was a breeze and everything was as-pictured and clearly labeled to make life easy for the tired traveler."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy is a great host. This space is adorable and comfortable. The gas fireplace/wood stove adds a homey touch too. The backyard is super cute even in the rain - bet it is really fun to sit out there on a summer evening. And location is really convenient. Highly recommend Peggy's place. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Peggy's. She has literally thought of every amenity. Her space is a special one for sure. You can see her creativity come through in her furniture choices and layout of the space. Luxe linens and plush towels made the place feel special. She has a cute deck overlooking a very fun backyard with gardens, a fire pit and potting sheds. The yard backs up to a wooded park with walking paths through it, so it feels like a private nature preserve. We will definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy with the wonderful fireplace and amazing bed. Peggy's place is amazing any time of year.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is wonderful! I stayed for 4 days very comfortably for a training downtown and the location was perfect (7 mins by car). The place was clean, warm, and cozy, yet spacious for a studio. I worked online in the evenings and had good internet connection. The bed is very comfortable and I slept well. Her kitties have an enclosed outdoor area and they were nice to engage with when I passed by when they happened to be outside. Her garden is lovely! Overall, I felt safe and welcomed, and it was private and quiet. I would stay here again if I found myself in this neck of the woods again. It’s super clean with fluffy towels and crisp bed sheets!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite Airbnb's I have ever stayed at. Peggy was absolutely amazing! She was so king and welcoming.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy's place is fabulous. Five stars all the way!! If I could give the value attribute 10 stars, I would as our stay was worth every penny and then some!!! From the beautiful gardens where we were offered to pick delicious fresh raspberries to the comfy space/bed, luxurious linens, fluffy towels, etc. etc.etc. everything was perfect!! We stayed till the very last minute as we hated to leave. I highly recommend staying here and my recommendations do not come lighty. As an added bonus there is a small park a few houses down that provides for a great little nature walk in the early evenings.
Thank you again Peggy for setting us up with the outdoor fireplaces, which was a treat given we are from FL and it isn't often we get to relax by a fire. We hope to come back one day!!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This precious nature sanctuary was quiet, peaceful and stunning. Every comfort listed in the description and more. The space was perfect for two people. It was impeccably clean, cozy and spacious. Very convenient to downtown, hiking and various parts of the city. Peggy was the hostess with the “mostest”. And her garden was a wonderful sight to behold. Do yourself a favor, when in Olympia reserve this wonderful space. The best air bnb I have ever used."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy’s home was absolutely delightful. We so enjoyed our stay and will definitely ask to stay again when visiting Olympia.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was tempted to downgrade Peggy on the description portion of this evaluation because her AirB&B description fell short of my experience. Peggy, her accomodations and her gardens far exceeded the many other B&Bs that I have visited. Think fine linens, spacious rooms and a magical garden, for starters. She is at the ready to provide for her guests but does not hover. She goes well beyond (even lofty) expectations. See you soon and often, Peggy!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Olympia! This was one of my favorite places to date, it has all the comforts of home you could want. Peggy is extremely thoughtful and added personal touches that meant a lot to my husband and I!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Peggy's a few times and each time has been perfect. This time, the amazing flowers and lovely gardens were in bloom. There are areas to sit outside any time of day or evening. I really enjoy this place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place Great host!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy was an amazing host and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We honestly did not want to leave our mini vacation at Peggys place.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about this place. I was in town for work, and Peggy's home was perfect. Beautifully appointed studio (with yummy free snacks!) and a wonderful outdoor deck looking over the backyard. The home is adjacent to a wonderful park, and as an avid birdwatcher, it was amazing to be able to watch birds visiting the yard each day and night. I will definitely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a lovely and relaxing place to stay. This was a return trip for me and this time the beautiful flowers were in bloom. As before, the space was immaculate and the bed incredibly comfortable. I'm looking forward to returning soon!"

She went above and beyond with amenities and personal touches within the place, including a cute greeting sign welcoming us. The private guesthouse next to Peggy's place was perfect, giving us ample privacy while feeling completely safe in an unknown city to us. Her communication was extremely fast and she made sure we had everything we needed. We can't recommend Peggy or her Airbnb enough, truly a memorable few days in Olympia!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy was such a wonderful host. we spent the week with her celebrating our anniversary and it was wonderful! she provided us with a bottle of wine to celebrate and even left us a cute message.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Oly Urban Retreat! Peggy is a fantastic host, with clear and kind communication. The suite was exactly as pictured and very well-appointed. Check in instructions were super detailed (with photos for each step) and accurate which I appreciate as a solo traveler on this trip.
I particularly enjoyed the gas fireplace heater, fluffy soft towels and provided robes. She also has snacks and incidentals, which is so thoughtful. WiFi was fast and reliable.
I would absolutely recommend!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being blocks from an absolutely stellar bakery makes Peggy’s place a bit dangerous - but only because so many carbs are involved! The location is perfect in relation to both downtown Olympia, the waterfront, and activities in Lacey. Entrance through a gate and into the backyard makes the space feel super safe. The studio both feels and smells really clean, which is so lovely for a germaphobe like me! Hope to stay again as I’m in town frequently… Peggy’s place definitely tops my list!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lovely quiet northeast Olympia residential area, with beautiful trees, easily walkable to nature park, downtown, restaurants, and shops. Peggy is a pro at ensuring a delightful retreat."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cute one bedroom just outside (NE) of downtown Olympia. Very quiet with great public park directly behind the property. All the amenities including 2 bikes with a lock.
I only failed to notice in the description there’s no stove/oven available but made do with the microwave. Never met Peggy in person but she was wonderfully accommodating and attentive via text"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a comfy, cozy place!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most beautiful little Airbnb! Everything is thoughtfully planned out and is intended to make sure your needs are taken care of during your stay. The bed is so incredibly comfy and cozy! I hope to visit again in the spring or summer because I'm sure the garden is full of delightful surprises and I would love to take advantage of the spacious deck. Peggy was warm and hospitable. She even remembered it was my birthday! A delightful urban retreat!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was so happy to return to this inviting, spotless, cozy place in a beautiful setting and sleep in the most comfortable bed ever. Peggy, the host, and the unit are both exceptional."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy was beyond attentive. She was kind, always made sure we had what we needed and has a super nice place. It you visit the PNW. Be sure to go with Peggy. We’ll be back for sure!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the space here! Everything was well equipped and super comfy. Ended up running into our host Peggy and had a nice short conversation about the area. But other than that, our stay was very private and peaceful. We enjoyed the usage of the back yard, it was very cute. Close to a local bakery and coffee spot which we loved. And very close to downtown Olympia, along with other great walking trails! The bed at the air bnb was extremely comfy! We appreciate all of the small details of the space and will highly recommend anyone else to stay here. Thanks Peggy!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at the inviting cottage suite. Peggy has truly thought of everything you could possibly need. Her place is very clean and well taken care of. Loved the decorating and special touches. Wish we could have enjoyed sitting outside but not quite warm enough. Peggy is an A+ host and would definitely stay here again
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved everything about my stay here. The host thought of everything and communication was great. The place was extra clean, cute and private, and the extra touches like a bottle of wine, snacks and fresh flowers left in the room made me feel so welcome. I highly recommend this place to everyone, and I can’t wait to come back again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is amazing! Was perfect for us to come home to after a long day of hiking. The bed is so comfortable and the morning coffee and snacks provided were just what we needed waking up before the sun to get the day started. We would love to stay again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy is a wonderful host. The studio is lovely, super comfortable, peaceful and private, with view and access to the beautiful garden. Would certainly stay again, highly recommend it!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,After a long week of hiking and driving around Washington; staying at Peggy’s cottage felt like a vacation from our vacation. Everything that you need is around the corner and she went above and beyond with her amenities. Can’t wait to stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy’s place was awesome! Private and within a 6 minute drive of downtown, about a 30 minute walk. Perfect for 2 people and had everything we needed including board games and snacks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Oh boy, I don’t think I have enough space to say what I need to! Stet and Lynn were wonderful hosts that helped usher in our first experience in the Pacific Northwest! Stet was there to greet us and gave us everything we needed and more! The location was wonderful, and we were within a short drive to access the Olympic and Rainier national parks! We did plenty on our trip, but waking up with the view of Burns Cove while sipping coffee (that our hosts graciously provided) in the rocking chairs and watching the wildlife had to be the best way I’ve spent mornings in recent memory. The grill and chairs outside were also wonderful way to soak up the view. So peaceful and serene… part of me wishes we just hung out at the cabin even more! Stet and Lynn were flexible with us at checkout, and were a resource for us to talk with. They were also eager to find out what we did so they can share it with future guests— now that’s good hosting! They were a blessing for my wife and I— highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I really enjoyed staying here and will probably be back next year for our anniversary
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot overlooking the bay! Stet and Lynne are awesome, thoughtful hosts from the homemade granola to the comfortable surroundings!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,One of the nicest views and thoughtful hosts I've had the opportunity to experience!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a great stay at Stet's cabin. It is a very peaceful location, with a fantastic view of the bay. The stove/fire place and rocking chairs were highlights to cozy up, read a good book or watch something on your devices. The wifi was fast, and the extras provided by Stet and Lynne really made this a 5 star stay. Stet had solid information on where to go/see/do (for me some hikes and places to paddle). The cabin had all the things required for a perfect stay (BBQ, stocked kitchen, wood). I would recommend staying for a peaceful getaway or a home base to discovery some near by attractions."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had such a wonderful stay (and fun visiting family) that we didn't want to leave!
Thank you Stet & Lynne!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet and Lynne were so nice and we loved the little cabin!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a little less than a week at the cabin and wished it could have been more! Walking on the trails, reading on the porch as the sun set, and having farm fresh eggs was so much more than we expected. Our hosts were nothing short of kind, warm, welcoming while letting us know that they were there for us. If you’re thinking of traveling to Olympia and you’re lucky enough to stay here, it’s an absolute must!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time during our week at Stet and Lynne's place! Cabin is perfectly cozy with the ideal view out across the water from the main room, and added ambience from the wood stove. Plenty of nature to explore in the immediate area, and an abundance of things to do (or not!) in the area. While it was a little too chilly for us to use it, there is also a great deck/outdoor area in the warmer months. We will definitely be back, and hope to enjoy it even more then!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stet and Lynne take such good care of you. It’s hard to leave. The cabin is a perfect place to relax away from the world, yet close enough to local establishments if you need to get a few things. The drive to town is quick and Olympia offers great restaurant options."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was absolutely perfect for my needed getaway! Gorgeous view, peaceful, and unbelievably quiet. I really enjoyed having the cozy comfort of a woodstove with the luxury of electric heating if I didn’t feel like lighting the fire. Stet met me when I arrived, helped carry my bags in, and showed me around. He then disappeared, and I never saw another soul, except for the wonderful visit with the horses, chickens, and deer."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,A quiet cabin overlooking Oyster Bay. It was the perfect place for my writer's retreat. And Stet was so patient and so generous--including fresh eggs strait from the chickens. I told Stet I would just pay rent and live there if I could.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing cabin with unbeatable views in a very peaceful setting!!! Stet was an amazing host he went above and beyond to make us comfortable and provided tons of recommendations for the area. Could not be happier with our stay!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amazing cabin, we had a great time and Stet couldn’t have been more welcoming or helpful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet and Lynne were amazing host. Stet met us outside in the dark with a flashlight when we arrived and showed us right in to the cabin. He explained all the amenities inside the cabin and we were on our way to spending the first night there. What a peaceful place and an amazing view of the bay and the sunrise in the morning. We saw seals and birds in the bay during the day. Stet had the tide tables available for us and binoculars as well so we could have a better view. The cabin was equipped with everything you need for a getaway and the also had raisin bread and homemade granola for us which was delicious. Every morning we made our way to the barn to say hello to the horses and chickens and feed the horses some hay. They had a guest book where you can write about yourself and your stay at their cabin and were blessed to see a deer right by the porch on our last morning there. It was so much fun. We will gladly book again for our next stay in the Olympia area. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Loved this little cabin above the bay. They keep it clean and uncluttered, yet it has everything you’d need for a stay. The hosts are next door if we needed anything, and we felt we had privacy too. It was quiet and an easy drive into Olympia when needed. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bathroom and shower are small & the only sink is in the kitchen area. That wasn’t a problem for us. Great value. We will definitely return when we’re in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet and Lynne are wonderful hosts who went above and beyond to make us comfortable and see to any needs we might have. The cabin is soothing and calming, just perfect for a little getaway. We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My fiancé and I stayed at Stet & Lynn’s place for just over a month while working remotely, and had a wonderful time! The cabin is right on the water, and we loved sitting enjoying the view through the wide double windows. We grilled out and enjoyed many meals sitting on the deck overlooking the sound. The cabin itself is even nicer than it looks in photos. Although the space is small, we were able to make it work both working remotely and could take meetings from the covered deck if needed. We were sad to leave and would love to come back again someday!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was lovely, with a fantastic view of Puget Sound. The hosts were wonderful, very friendly and accommodating, providing a lot of information."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stet and Lynne are very friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable about the area and willing to offer advice about the area. The cabin is prefect for me and wife, it has the essentials and also includes extras like fresh eggs and homemade canola. The property is like a nature preserve, with great views of the bay from the covered deck. We have often seen bald eagles, deer (fauns in June time frame) and lots of water fowl (blue herons, ducks, and loons) and seals. There is a very good walking trail just up the road through an old growth forest. The property is in relatively close proximately to Olympia for restaurants or shopping. This property is a great place to stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a privilege to be able to stay at Stet and Lynne's cabin. I was able to work in the mornings and find nearby hikes for afternoon explorations. The view from the deck made it hard to choose whether to stay or go sometimes!
It was a delight and I look forward to my next stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stet and Lynne made us feel right at home. They are such amazing people and this place was an amazing way to spend the week. I will definitely be coming back and I can't wait. I have already recommended this cute place to a few friends of mine as well. 20/10 best Airbnb I have ever stayed in.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Stet was a great host meeting us as we pulled up. Gave us the key and made sure we had everything we needed including firewood for the small woodstove. The cabin was very clean. The small but efficient kitchen was stocked with homemade granola, coffee, filters, eggs, bagels, and milk to keep is going until we were able to get to the store.
The cabin has a great view perched right at the edge of the water. It is small though and although it did note this in the listing I don’t think I realized just how small the bathroom space was. If you are a larger person you may find the small shower a little too small and there was not a sink in the bathroom area meaning the only sink is in the kitchen.
All of this is in the cabin listing but I feel like a picture of the bathroom area would have been helpful in making our decision to stay as ultimately it ended up being a little too small for us, especially during the cold rainy winter months when getting outside is more of a challenge."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stet and Lynne are great hosts, which is why it’s my second stay at their Olympia cabin! Water view and access to so many outdoor adventures. I felt right at home in their cozy spot. I’ll be back! :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very beautiful surroundings; very close to several very beautiful hiking parks and forests. Host is very kind and attempts to meet any needs you may have during your stay. Cabin while a bit small feels very homely and cozy. I had a fantastic stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Stet's place. It is a very nice water front cottage with great views of the bay. The cottage works great for my wife and I, it felt very private and is in a quiet location. The deck has a covered section with a gas grill, so great for cooking or taking in the views. The kitchen worked well for us and is stocked with fresh eggs, and homemade granola. Stet is very helpful with any questions one may have about the area. I would highly recommend this as an excellent place to stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stet was amazing and the cabin was perfect. Couldn’t ask for more!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin in a picturesque setting, with easy access to highway and Olympia. Friendly and responsive host. Loved sitting by the wood fire. We would happily stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet and Lynne were both uber accommodating and treated us like family. We loved the homemade granola and cozy wood stove. The waterfront location was gorgeous. They made sure we had everything we needed to ensure our stay was comfortable and rellaxing and were very attentive and available if needed. Thanks for a great stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Just what I was looking for... a low maintenance quiet retreat where I could relax with simplicity. It's completely stocked with what you need in the kitchen and in the bathroom. The host, Stet, was always available to answer questions. And they keep it spotlessly clean."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet’s place is a hidden gem! The location is spectacular with water views of the south sound and access to forest walks. The cabin has a wood burning stove and the kitchen is well stocked with cooking utensils. Overall a comfortable spot to come back after your Olympic Peninsula adventures. And Stet and Lynn are wonderful! they give just the right touch of hospitality and space. I felt both taken care of and private. I will be back! Thank you Stet!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As a repeat guest, I found the cabin to be a cozy Fall retreat & hosts made sure there was plenty of firewood."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful unforgettable location that makes me never want to leave
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Our stay was amazing! Stet and Lynn are very gracious hosts and offer great suggestions for pleasant experiences.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Top-notch AirBnB experience. Stet's place offers all the best of Olympia ~ explore the Peninsula or stay local with trails & enjoy a cozy retreat at the cabin, but be sure to try the local pub for oysters!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet's cabin was a first rate experience and everything was exactly as described in the home manual and by Stet himself. The cabin was nicely equipped with just what you needed to enjoy a peaceful stay, cook meals, and explore the surrounding towns and parks. Recommend that you take his advice on local restaurants and hikes. The farm environment had lots to explore including the beach and horses and chickens. Will happily stay here again!
One note that I missed in the listing description - there are motion detector lights outside the cabin that can be disabled via a lightswitch just inside the door. They would turn on occasionally overnight - reading comprehension fail on my part for not realizing they could be turned off entirely!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stet and Lynne were excellent hosts and the location is wonderful. The spot is excellently situated for bird watching across the sound, as well as a brief forested walk not too far from the front door. Everything I could have wanted was provided plus some unexpected bonuses from the Stet and Lynne's generous hearts. Don't hesitate to book!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This an awesome property, awesome location, and a great couple.... I couldn't be happier with my stay with them in this rental and would expect that you would as well...."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My stay was exceptional–the cabin is beautiful, and probably underpriced (don't tell the hosts! ;) ), right on the water. The hosts are great humans, very friendly, and really good at being open and available while giving you room and privacy. We were greeted with homemade banana bread and fresh eggs, and the hosts were always available for a local tip or to encourage taking a kayak out onto the Bay. The horses on the property absolutely stole my heart, as did the chickens. I would absolutely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very wonderful experience. The surroundings were great. The cabin was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The hosts were great. They had great suggestions and personal touches for our stay, as we were celebrating our anniversary. We definitely want to come back to this stay again. We feel refreshed after our time at this cabin. This stay is a great catch. Out of all of our stays, this one was by far the best value. Thank you for a great vacation!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a wonderful place. Charming and cozy cabin on the bay. Quiet and idyllic.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Overall wonderful place. I'd love to go back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Really great experience working remotely and exploring the area! My favorite part was the incredible views from the porch or inside cozy with the big windows. It's a really special spot. Stet and Lynne were very thoughtful hosts-we were greeted with baked goods, farm-fresh eggs and they were super helpful with any questions throughout our stay.
We were a little worried the wifi wouldn't be strong enough for both my boyfriend and I to work remote but we had no issues at all! Would definetly reccomend :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was perfect for my wife and I during a 1 week stay. The cabin has all of the necessary appliances and was comfortable. The deck with a covered portion was great for grilling and having dinner on the deck while watching the great views of the inlet. The views from the living room are equally good. The location is very quiet, no road noise and the inlet is shallow, so practically no boat traffic, which made for a very peaceful stay. During our stay in early June we saw 3 new born fawns, Bald Eagles, Blue Herons, and many rabbits. Stet and Lynn were very helpful with information about the area. I would highly recommend the cabin for any length stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is a lovely get away stay on a very quiet inlet with panoramic views of still waters and sea birds. It includes a small wood stove, an adequately equipped kitchen and shower/toilet bath. The kitchen has dual purpose sink. This is a great getaway for one person or couple (a double bed) looking to refresh, renew or relax. Stet is very hospitable and a very knowledgeable guide and storyteller about the area. As I was working while there, I left wishing I had had more time just to enjoy it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐This rental deserves six stars! By far our best AirBnb experience yet. Stet and Lynne are the most kind and generous hosts, the property is gorgeous and it's such a great location for all kinds of Olympic peninsula hikes! A perfect place to slow down, unwind and relax. Can't wait to go back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,This cabin is perfect. Stet and Lynn are incredible hosts. I really appreciated the fresh eggs and homemade granola. The internet is fast for people looking to work remotely. Just a fantastic setting and lovely people. Thank you so much!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin looked exactly as shown in pictures. Stet gave us a warm welcome and showed us around the place. They left us fresh eggs and granola, which were delicious. this stay is worth every penny."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a really comfortable place to relax, after an intense year of school. Your tv are the windows. It was lovely getting into a groove watching the tide come in and out. And the cherry on top was Stet. He was very friendly and the eggs from his chickens, milk, butter, bread, and firewood was totally unexpected and appreciated. Thank you for opening your home to us."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin was a sweet spot. It is close to Olympia, but it felt like you were away on vacation somewhere. The property is beautiful and you are sitting on the water. I had homemade granola, fresh eggs, coffee, bread, and milk waiting there for me. It was such a wonderful added touch. I look forward to my next stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my second time staying at this beautiful cabin. I love it so much and hope to be back. There’s nothing better in my opinion than kicking back, sitting by a fire, and looking out big picture windows at the puget sound. I love how secluded it is, yet close to Olympia and great restaurants and other fun things. I love the walks, and simply sitting outside on the porch. Stet is an amazing host and provides so many extra touches that make it feel like I’m staying with family"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,I feel very fortunate to have been able to stay here. Quaint and comfy with a view that is just stellar. Stet probably couldn't be any nicer or more accommodating. I highly recommend.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing your wonderful cabin. I really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful views. Much needed. Hopefully it's available next time I'm in town!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What more can I say except that this cabin was perfect!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Real close to paradise. The cabin is peaceful and quiet, clean and well supplied, just as described and praised by everybody else who's stayed there. Stet and Lynne are terrific hosts. The woodstove is a bonus. There are trails through the woods, quiet neighbors. And it's a short drive into town -- but why go there when you can stay here and look out at the water? Just a great spot."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Views are the icing on the cake! Cozy, well stocked, wonderful hosts and no traffic noise! You won’t regret staying here to re-charge, connect, or just have some down time."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was one of the best stays I've ever had. The cabin had so much charm with little details of fine pottery pieces in the cupboard, large windows to watch the water, and a comfy bed. But best of all was the kindness of Stet and Lynne throughout my stay going beyond continually and having such thoughtfulness in their hosting."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The coziest little cabin well equipped, beautiful view of the water ( Burns Cove) ducks and birds galore. Sip your coffee while rocking in the chair looking out of the large picturesque windows."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don't even know where to start. Stet and Lynne are amazing people and it reflected in every way in the space they have created. The photos can not depict the tranquility and perfection of this small space.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I consider myself a Cabin expert. No, I don’t know about building them, or architecture, or really anything else substantial, but I do know how it feels to stay in them. This cabin is the gold standard. A full 10 out of 10. Amazing view of the sound from the living room of the cabin. High-quality yet simple kitchen. Amazing location. A wood-burning stove! But best of all, the hosts. Extremely kind and welcoming, and left me some fresh baked snacks and some other wholesome foods upon my arrival. (I like food, especially given in such a kind way)
The area is super fun to explore, and really good for taking long walks. I used my time for meditation, and working on some creative projects. I cannot wait to go back again. I left feeling recharged, calm, and delighted."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This little spot is exactly as described, perfectly located, incredible view, really well suited for one or two people, private, clean, great for staying home and cozying up or using as a home base for exploring the peninsula and beyond. Stet and Lynne are wonderful hosts. I so look forward to seeing them, and this little corner of the world again!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin is the perfect place to unplug and take in the beautiful scenery. Stet was quick to respond to any inquiries that we made prior to our trip. He was detailed and thoughtful when it came to directions, greeting us at the driveway and making local recommendations. When you pull in there is a long gravel driveway, then the horse stalls, the main house, and your parking spot. You walk down a gravel path behind the main house, through the backyard about 100 feet to the cabin. The cabin was clean and warm upon arrival. The woodstove was set up and ready for us to light whenever we wanted to. There were spices, cooking oils, condiments, granola, fresh eggs, coffee, creamer and all of the kitchen things you would need to be able to make a nice meal. The bed was comfortable and so were the sheets/duvet. We both liked the shorter rocking chair lol, it was comfy. The bathroom is extra small but, it has the necessities. Stet & Lynn have a great guide that they leave for you. It outlines the property, nearby stores and favorite places, hospitals and safety information. The wifi was great, we streamed a movie on Netflix through our laptop and were able to watch a movie without any buffering. We stopped by and fed the horses each day that we were there. They were happy to see us when we walked up and we're friendly. We walked down a little trail to the water and saw oysters at low tide. There were different birds in the area and we liked the binoculars and bird book they set up at the window for us to use. Such a nice getaway, affordable and much more beautiful than the photos. You should definitely go if you're thinking about it!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing getaway trip. With homey vibes yet, completely different than any hotel experience. Would recommend to anyone wanting a change in scenery. The views and simplicity of the cabin truly are worth seeing."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hosts! Beautiful retreat away from the busy stresses of life and the city! Perfect for what I was needing!
Stet and Lynne were soooo kind and welcoming! Beautiful people!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely amazing stay, it was so homey and the perfect location! Stet and Lynne were fantastic hosts, very hospitable, friendly, and helpful. Every little touch in the cabin was great. The bed was comfortable, the rocking chairs were a great touch. Stet is very responsive to any questions you text him, and he’ll remind you often that he’s always willing to help with anything during your stay - such a friendly guy! Be sure to spend some time with the horses, they’re adorable and both Lynne and Stet can tell you some interesting facts and stories about caring for horses. The cabin has all of life’s basic needs - a shower, a toilet, running water, hot water, stovetop, toaster oven, and pans and dishes. The view from the cabin is amazing, especially during sunrise. It’s the perfect couple’s weekend getaway! I definitely want to come back soon!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Views on the water are amazing, cabin is so comfortable, and Stet & Lynne are such great hosts! Made us feel so welcome. Pictures online are great but in-person it is far better. Close to Olympic National Park, and Olympia of course. 5 stars+ in our book. One of best places we have stayed on Air BnB."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet and Lynne's cabin is truly what you go to Air Bnb for -- a one-of-a-kind experience! We loved the coziness of a fire in the woodstove while we watched ducks feeding on the water. This is a cabin, not a hotel suite, so you have to be a little flexible with regard to the bathroom accommodations, but it's part of the charm. Their kind and thoughtful hospitality was very much appreciated."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a lovely get away to relax. It was nice of the host to leave us with information about the town and places we could go to explore. I would recommend this place to go to!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet and Lynne were such amazing hosts. Check in to the cabin went smoothly- they taught us how to use the fire stove and even prepared breakfast for us the next morning! The cabin is truly a gem. Peaceful and quiet, which is exactly what we needed."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, and wonderful hosts. We loved this cabin and it’s location. Has everything we needed and more. Also, close to many beautiful parks, restaurants and stores.
We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a wonderful little space to escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Stet was an amazing and informative host!!! We loved our little cabin that overlooked the sound.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful cozy place to stay on Oyster Bay. Fantastic location. Great comfy bed. Everything you need is there and if you don't have something Stet will bring to you right away. Stet is very responsible, friendly host. You can't go wrong. Wifi was intermittent so couldn't really watch Netflix on my computer but my phone did everything I needed to do. That was my only issue. I would stay again anytime, especially if I wanted help switching off of the computer and more into reading, which I ended up doing and it was great. I caught up on all the books I had that I never have time to read. Love this place. It was the second time I stayed there."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! We came to Christmas shop for our girls and we didn’t want to leave the cabin and do what we came to do! The views are breathtaking. The cabin is warm and cozy! Stet was amazing and welcoming. We had a change of plans due to my husbands job and Stet accommodated our needs. Sad we had to leave early our last morning, I would of rather drank my coffee, enjoying the surroundings . I highly recommend to couples, friends, or singles to book and enjoy this place! It was the perfect place to get away from reality! Thanks Stet for the great amenities and thanks to his wife for the homemade goodies! You guys have done a great job!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet’s cabin was such a lovely place to spend thanksgiving. Even though I couldn’t see my family for the holiday, I still felt so at home because of Stet’s wonderful hospitality. And if you’re here on a clear night, expect to see a wonderfully starry night sky. I’ll always keep this place in mind when I want to plan another getaway. Cannot wait to come back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a beautiful view!! This cabin is amazingly located and the hosts are some of the nicest and most responsive we've ever had. Stet gave us wonderful ideas for dinner and things to see in the area and they both made us feel very home. There cabin was very clean and we got to make a fire for ourselves every night. We also saw bald eagles, seals and so many cool birds from the cabin!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy space to spend a couple of days. The hospitality was wonderful and it was a great distance from town. I hope I get the chance to stay here again at some point!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is an absolute gem! My best friend and I met at Stet and Lynne's place for the most relaxing girl's weekend we could have hoped for. The view is spectacular and you will lose time just rocking in a chair and staring out over the water, trying to identify all of the birds (we saw eagles and cranes, among many others). The cabin is well-furnished and cozy with every amenity we needed to make ourselves delicious meals (including plenty of breakfast items - farm fresh eggs, yum!) and firewood enough to keep a crackling fire going. Stet made sure we had a table upon which to do our puzzles (a favorite pastime) and Lynne dropped by mid-day on Saturday with biscotti hot from the oven (with the most delicious ginger orange glaze, fabulous!). We took the walk suggested in the welcome packet and passed through the barn on our way to say hi to the beautiful carriage horses. Check in was a breeze and Stet provided very detailed instructions on how to find their place. We can't recommend this cabin and these hosts enough!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All of the reviews for Stet and Lynne's place are incredibly accurate, great vibes and everything we forgot was provided. I will say that, when you are in the cabin, it feels very remote but walking from the drive-way into the cabin feels like you are in someone's backyard. Not a big deal but definitely something to keep in mind if you are looking for absolute solitude."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynn and Stet are wonderful host!! The cabin is perfect and oh so quiet! We enjoyed the bay. Looking out the picture windows each day was so relaxing. We enjoyed our stay.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a wonderful relaxing comfortable place to stay we thoroughly enjoyed it! Stet and Lynne are wonderful hosts!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful and welcoming cabin. Situated directly at the fiord this cabin offers everything you need and Stet and his wife made our stay as much comfortible as it could be. We had great talks and they give us a lot of advices and stories about the environment.
We hope to come back again. Thank you so much :)"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a peacful place to unplug and unwind. Has all the comforts of home and is just a few minutes from town. Its such a quiet area and the hosts are very sweet.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this cabin! It was quiet, simple, and just what we needed to end our trip in Washington. Stet and Lynn went out of their way with small touches to make us feel welcome and had so many great recommendations on the local area. It was such a great value! Definitely recommend."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet's place was a great place to recharge and get away fron it all. Only about 15 minutes away from cool shops and restaurants in downtown, but still remote enough to enjoy quiet."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful and amazing slice of heaven on earth. Everything from the top to the bottom was amazing. My wife and I are planning another trip hopefully soon.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are seeking a quiet and peaceful location, this IS the place. It’s almost as if you step into another time that the hustle and bustle have forgotten. If you are contemplating, STOP, just GO. Even though Stet and Lynne are next door, you feel such a sense of privacy. They do not barge in on your time but are readily available for any questions or concerns. Go and unplug for sometime. Your mind and heart will thank you."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynne and Stet have an amazing place right on Oyster Bay that is full of fun and adventure. Anything that you don't find already in their well-stocked kitchen can be found very close by. We especially loved the beach access and views.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, isolated. Great access to Olympic National Forest. Not too far to the ferry to Seattle."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. The location on the water is quiet and still and peaceful. Stet provides eggs, granola and an assortment of all sorts of condiments. It was easy to cook and everything I needed was available to me. There are beautiful hiking/walking trails nearby. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept on. This is one of my favorite places I've stayed so far and hope to return for a couple of weeks this winter."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin on Oyster Bay was wonderfully quaint, quiet, and peaceful, offering my wife and I the opportunity to recharge our batteries after busy days of exploring he Olympic area. Stet was an amazing host who offered us fresh-baked goods and drinks and kinds words of advice to make the most of our trip. Thank you helping us feel at home."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing if you want solitude and Mother Nature. Very relaxing and very convenient for our needs. The hosts are very thoughtful and helpful.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this beautifull ocean-view cabin. The hosts were great. The cabin was nice and cosy. More convincing to you perhaps, the guestbook was overloaded with very positive reviews. The quiet area was often described as almost therapeutical in the guestbook. Unbelievable views."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second time visiting Stet's place and it was just as wonderful as we remembered! Complete privacy but stet is only a call away if needed. The cabin is filled with so many unique touches that make it special.
The view is still spectacular. Don't hesitate, book this gem!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet was amazing. He responded promptly, kindly showed us around during check in, and readily provided local suggestions for our hiking excursions. In addition, the cabin was very peaceful and well kept. We hope to visit again!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was stunning. The cabin sits on a quiet bend of the Puget Sound with breathtaking views, perfect for a getaway from the big city. Our host was very kind and hospitable. He took the utmost care of us while we stayed there. He remembered small details of comfort, like putting farm fresh eggs in the fridge so that we could have a solid breakfast before a long hike in the Olympic National Park. He had tips on local restaurants, local hikes, where to go in the nearby national parks, and he even had a huge jar of homemade granola! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a peaceful, quiet, and calming retreat away. 10/10 recommend."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet’s place was awesome. Amazing location and some of the best hosts we’ve had. They go above and beyond for their guests. Stet was always available to answer questions. Great property and area!

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give this cabin 6 stars! Stet was an amazing host. Answered any and all my questions, and gave us great sightseeing tips.

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Private and chill.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time. The cabin is very clean and cute. There was everything I needed to enjoy my stay. The view is spectacular as the beach is right there. The spot is very peaceful and the solitude is to die for. It’s minutes away from county parks and walking trails along the beach and in the woods. I definitely recommend this Airbnb!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic cabin with a little wood stove and nice outdoor deck space, right on quite serene Puget Sound waterfront. Great hosts who have provided an eclectic array of breakfast goodies and wonderful freshly ground coffee. Truly a hidden gem!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to enjoy a peaceful weekend.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet's cabin is clean, cozy, and well stocked with food and other amenities for enjoying the serene beauty of the Puget Sound. Stet is a most gracious host and I highly recommend his place."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at AirBnb locations through the United States and six European countries. This cabin is easily in my top three favorites. Great view, cozy, comfortable, friendly hosts. I will return!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Breakfast fixings awaiting you on arrival,;plenty of towels, toilet paper; fabulous water views of Burns Cove right outside the big windows complete with flotillas of entertaining ducks;split kindling and firewood on demand if you are there in a cold season; instant hot water in the shower."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend getaway. Truly peaceful and beautiful with so many lovely and thoughtful touches that just added to the whole experience. Beautiful views, clean, cozy bed, lovely little fireplace, beautiful grounds, and lovely hosts."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a magical place. Come here!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the tranquility of this cabin with its wide view of Puget Sound thru 2 large picture windows! A wood stove, nice kitchen, comfy bed, and really nice hosts. Everything I needed and in many ways much more. An opportunity to rest, contemplate and enjoy the natural surroundings. Easy to find; about 10 min to the main highway."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stet's cabin is a lovely, quiet place to relax and marvel at the beautiful waterfront. a great location for explorations of the nearby state parks and state capital, which is just 20 minutes away. Stet couldn't be a more friendly and accommodating host. would highly recommend."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Reviews are accurate. Great place with magnificent view. Our new favorite AirBnB to just relax. Stet was the perfect host with detailed directions and met us out front for a tour of the cabin. Nice and close to Olympia if you need anything but even on a cold January day, it was difficulty to move ourselves from the picture window and rocking chairs. At one point we were about to head out and an eagle flew past the window and start going after some fish ~50 yards away. Will definitely go back."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the best host, very accommodating and great at communicating. We stayed at this cabin 3 years ago and have been looking forward to a second stay ever since. Our recent stay was as wondeful as our first. Close to downtown Olympia and the National Forest. But no need to go far since the cabin has a picturesque view of the water."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect little getaway! A cozy cabin with a spectacular view. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful as well and Stet is a wonderful host! The best weve had on Airbnb so far. Everything was great from morning strolls by the water and the fresh granola and coffe to feeding the horses and eating at a seafood restaurant in town.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, kind and generous hosts, and lovely location - an all around treat indeed. Many thanks!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I needed a respite from the current news cycle. A forested cabin ala Thoreau. Found it! Stet's cabin is nestled in the woods facing Puget Sound. A Perfect retreat.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with a perfect view of the water. The water line was practically below the deck at high tide. Stet and Lynne were great hosts. I felt well taken care of; preset fire and ample firewood, farm fresh eggs, homemade pastry, granola that really is as good as other reviewers have stated. Quiet, comfortable, clean and private. My only suggested addition would be footstools for the rocking chairs, or perhaps a small sofa. I'm looking forward to staying again!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so great! Such a good place for the soul to read and unwind. Very peaceful.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin and Stet’s hospitality is nothing short of amazing and perfect. The cabin was even better in person. It has everything you need inside (just no oven) but it’s not a must. There’s an electric microwave oven and an electric stove so that was perfect. Being RIGHT on the lake is completely surreal, you have a complete view of it from two big windows in the cabin where you can sit in the rocking chairs and just enjoy. Stet also has carriage horses which he lets you feed carrots, pet and interact with if you want to. I can go on & on about this stay—overall it was perfect and I highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a quiet, calm and serene stay by the water with surrounding nature."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable little cabin and in such a beautiful place. We were visiting for a workshop and didn't spend as much time in the cabin as we ultimately would have LOVED to, (we're thinking a week staring at the water next time!), but it was so wonderful to have HOME to come home to! Thoughtful touches abound at this property. Stet and Lynne couldn't be nicer and the view from the rocking chairs was unreal every day and changed every 10 minutes. Comfy bed with plenty of bedding and pillows, great kitchen setup and a pre-set fire. Warm and toasty inside and out. Book it. You won't regret it."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stet and Lynne were some of the best hosts we have ever stayed with. Their cabin on the water is stunning and their property is beautiful. Stet had some wonderful suggestions for things to do and see while we were there and was overall incredibly nice and helpful. We highly recommend staying with them if you get the chance!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and kind owners! Would definitely recommend this place for a nice weekend away.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the sweetest of refuges nestled in under the trees with a stunning and peaceful view of the water. Quiet and beauty surround. It was also an easy 20 minute drive to and from downtown Olympia where I was taking a dance workshop.
Stet and Lynne are the most gracious of hosts. I felt taken care of in every way from the moment I booked to the moment I left. Everything from the prompt and welcoming communications from Stet, the video tour, the wood stove being stocked and ready for use, the fresh and homemade breakfast selections, to the welcome from Lynne with fresh garden flowers made this a delightful stay in every way. They went above and beyond.
I highly recommend this cozy retreat cabin and I can’t say enough about the welcoming hosts."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin is exactly as described. Lots of thoughtful touches like farm eggs, homemade granola, firewood, binoculars and a bird identification guide, a NW forest pass—everything you need for a short or long stay. Stet is a kind, courteous, and thoughtful host. He gave good recommendations of places to walk/hike within an hour of the cabin. We had a restful and happy stay. Thank you!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic cabin on the lake
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is pretty amazing. It's low key, quiet, clean, and has a great view. It is stocked with pretty much everything you need if you're staying there a couple days, including towels/bath things, food, dishes, wood burning stove, linens, etc. It's a relaxing getaway from the city, and it's still close to it. I'd stay here again, and I'd recommend it for anyone considering it."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful solitude was just what I needed and this just was the place. Cute little farm setting. Very clean, tidy and efficient."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time at the cabin and we'll definitely be back. Everything others have said here is true and it's becoming a cherished place for us.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stet and Lynne’s cabin on Totten is a sweet little get away place where you can surround yourself with the best of the northwest. If you spend time watching the waterfront you will see eagles and osprey and many seabirds feeding. The seals like to come into the bay and you can see the oyster and clam fishery activities. There are many great hikes nearby and we kayaked from Young’s cove nearby and Arcadia point. Stet and Lynne can help you with local info and they are great hosts. The cabin had fresh farm eggs, homemade granola and coffee and was a comfy place to relax. It is close to Olympia for a great farmer’s market, waterfront boardwalk and cute shops and eateries. We also liked walking the Capital campus and lakefront and Priest Point park in Oly."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands down the best traveling experience my husband and I have ever had. Stet and Lynn have outstanding hospitality, easy check-in/check-out, a fully stocked cabin with breathtaking views, and horses!
There were thoughtful touched through out the day entire cabin which made our stay all the more special. We cannot wait to come back!!
We spent most of our time at the cabin but did venture out one of our days to Olympic national parks Staircase trails. It was a scenic drive and only about an hour away. Definitely worth it if you like hiking."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to stay for calm, peace, tranquility and right on the water. Photos don’t do this cabin justice. The deck is warm and inviting with all the flowers and it wraps around the cabin. There’s chairs to sit outside and just watch the wildlife on the water. If you aren’t into sitting outside, there’s two rocking chairs inside facing the oversized windows and the views are just as great. Bed was comfy and sheets were clean and very soft. There’s extra toiletries in the bathroom if you forget something. Only word to the wise is there’s no sink in the bathroom...only the sink in the kitchenette. Didn’t bother me a bit but you never know. Will stay here again if and when I’m back in the Olympia area."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent place to just sit back for a few days, relax, read, watch the tides roll in and roll out -- in short to ""recharge the batteries"". Location is very convenient to Olympia and all of its funkiness."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin nestled in the woods with a beautiful view of Oyster Bay. There is a very nice short walk nearby and a fair number of amenities in the cabin. The location is quite far from Seattle so if you are planning to go to the city it is quite a trek so plan accordingly. But if you are looking to get away from it all, this is the perfect spot to do it."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous property that's only a few minutes out of Olympia. It's perfect for those who are seeking a quiet retreat but want to stay close to a city
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet & Lynne have a phenomenal little piece of paradise outside of Olympia. This cabin and location far exceeded our expectations. We will be back some day! But in the mean time, if you're trying to decide where to stay in close proximity to adventures around or in Olympic National Forest/Park with a nice place to come home to or just looking for a peaceful stay this is your place!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and peaceful! This is a great place for a quiet retreat, a base for daytrips to kayak and hike, or even a respite for a business traveler. I was surprised how quick the trip is from I-5 and downtown Olympia--only 15 min. It's a safe choice if you're traveling alone; Stet and Lynne are right next door, available and helpful, but leave you to do your thing. They introduced me to the horses and told me about a neighborhood trail through the woods. I loved the special touches of cozy flannel sheets and homemade granola."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed 4 weeks at Stet's place. I'd a great time! The location is amazing. The view from the cabin is stunning. It's quiet and the perfect place to relax. On the other hand it's a perfect place for doing outdoors , I e.g. did a lot of hiking. Stet and Lynne are wonderful hosts. Kind, responsive, helpful with great ideas what to do but also respecting your privacy at any time. I loved to be their guest. I would always come back and can recommend this place 100%."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet’s cabin is a lovely secluded retreat. We enjoyed the time to look out over the water at the birds, and the occasional seal and sea otter whilst enjoying a beer and snacks that we brought.
Stets place is well appointed with kitchen essentials so that your basic morning coffee/tea and food needs are covered. This is a very nice touch, so that you can take your time in the morning, rather than realize you have to drive into the market for a forgotten item. Much appreciated.
We picked up some local oysters and cooked them up on the grill, and we got to put our kayaks in twice, at boat launches that were about a 30 minute drive away. Delightful. All in all, the Puget Sound experience we were looking for.
Thank you, Stet!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,This cabin is so adorable and on a beautiful plot of land. Stet and Lynne clearly take the time to make their guests feel welcome and right at home. My partner and I were here for a week and loved every part of stayed by here. Stet and Lynne were incredibly friendly and full of ideas for us. We were blown away by their thoughtfulness. If we could give more than 5 stars we would. Thanks!!!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin is cozy and tranquil. View of bay is ideal. All the amenities provided were top notch and cabin was very clean. Great hosts that communicated clearly. Would DEFINITELY stay again. Thank you!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was more than expected, pictures didn’t do justice for the property. The hosts were amazing with providing pointers for our trip and never ran out of things to do in the area. The cabin was only a few minutes off the main highway which made it easily accessible and provided the basics for making our stay a comfortable one. Hopefully I’m a repeat customer, would definitely stay again in the future."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very friendly and informative, the property was gorgeous and away from town like we hoped and the cabin was cozy and a perfect place to venture out from or stay and relax in.
We loved the views from the front windows and spent our mornings drinking coffee admiring the cove. The owners also shared some farm fresh eggs and homemade granola which were both delicious!
We would definitely visit again!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is in a wonderfully quiet and serene setting. It was well equipped, centrally located for hiking and the hosts are incredibly nice people."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy cabin. Fantastic views . Host are great people, very accommodating."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, amazing views, and an amazing time. So relaxing and quiet out here. Quite a far drive to some of the northern hikes in Olympic National Forest, but close to southern hikes and the city of Olympia."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet was such a great host, he was kind and always accessible and totally respectful of our privacy. He was generous and recommended some great spots for food and for hiking. The space was so cozy and peaceful with a beautiful view. The cabin is well insulated so it was easy to warm it up with the heaters provided, also we used the wood stove to create even more warmth. We really appreciated how Stet already had the stove loaded with wood and paper for us. We were able to stream movies using the internet connection. The cabin was stocked with home made granola, fresh ground coffee, and milk and cream, and eggs. We slept so well on the comfy bed. Only wished we could have stayed more than two nights."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage on the water! It was very peaceful. Yummy granola and eggs from their chickens! Stet was kind and welcoming. I enjoyed my time there.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely spot right on Puget Sound! This is a delightful little cabin right on the water with great views and a very peaceful feel. We really appreciated the homemade granola in the morning and fresh eggs from the chickens! I would recommend this cabin to anyone traveling to Olympia looking for a serene getaway.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend to anyone looking for a great get away. Hospitality and small touches definitely made the experience. Planning on coming back again!
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! Stet and his wife Lynn were such great hosts. This cabin is a great place to relax and enjoy nature. You're right on the water and it is so cool to see the tide change every day.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Stet and Lynne's cabin. It was cosy, warm and very picturesque. The location was beautifully tranquil yet everything we could need was close by (supermarket, pub, trails) Throughout our stay Stet and Lynne couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome! Thanks for everything, we hope to be back someday soon!"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at this cottage when I come to Olympia. Stet and Lynne are so accommodating and so sweet with everything they have to offer.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet and his wife were absolutely wonderful. Never find a kinder more attentive host. Stet have me the lay of the area and a ton of recommendations on places to go as well as giving me a state parks pass to use and was always available for anything I needed. The place is such a pleasant getaway sitting right on the water of puget sound. Stet always has fresh wood for me to burn in the little wood burning stove (which is an awesome touch to any place you stay), and even came over twice to help me get the fire started. I’d love to go back and stay at there place again."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was just what I wanted for my solo retreat: scenic and quiet but not far from urban amenities. It was plenty warm and had everything I needed. The cabin is right on the inlet and I loved watching the birds and the tides go by each day. Stet and Lynne were perfect hosts, proving thoughtful touches and the right balance of privacy and support."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Stet and Lynne's cabin was so much more than we were even hoping for! Stet was very communicative with us, letting us know that the cabin would be ready earlier for check-in if we'd like and making sure to be there to greet us when we arrived. We appreciated his quick walk-through of the place and notes that were in the cabin with everything that we may need. The granola and coffee were delicious but the real treat was the view of the Sound! It was hard to leave the quiet and solitude that Stet and Lynne's cabin provided for our weekend. We would absolutely recommend this cabin and hope to return soon!"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is exactly what I hoped it would be: cozy, well-stocked, warm, private, and with a spectacular view of the Sound. Stet and Lynne clearly put a lot of thought and care into this place. The small touches, like the binoculars by the window with the Puget Sound bird book, are really special. I will absolutely return in the future. The value of this rental can't be beat."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay here! The location was near Olympia and there were some other nearby trails and beaches that were wonderful. The cabin itself had everything we could need and more! Plus, Stet was so welcoming and gave lots of suggestions for things to do in the area. Would stay again!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Forested waterfront location with picture windows looking out on the ever-changing natural scenery. Birder's paradise, complete with binocs and a field guide. Electric heaters keep it cozy, even without a fire in the wood-burning stove. Great hiking trails and country roads all around, but just a 15 minute drive on 101 to downtown Olympia. Responsive hosts kept us well supplied with breakfast foods and firewood."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at Stet’s place. He was so helpful in guiding us into the property from the city. Exactly as advertised with perfect touches of homemade goodies and even fresh eggs in the fridge. The wonderful view, extremely comfortable bed, and wood burning stove were exactly what we were looking for on our short relaxing getaway from city life. It was beyond peaceful. Would stay here again in a heartbeat if given the opportunity!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet was one of the most gracious hosts that I have stayed with on AirBNB - homemade cookies and granola waiting for us upon our arrival. And his property was amazing. My boyfriend and I have both lived in the Northwest for our whole lives and have never had the opportunity to visit the Olympic Peninsula. Stet pointed us in the right direction for us to have the perfect day trip complete with plenty of hiking, exploration and oysters from Hamma Hamma. We cannot wait to return!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warm, comfortable, clean, and friendly getaway right on the sound. Can’t recommend it highly enough."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is really lovely, has a great wood stove, and amazing views! Highly recommended :)"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a beautiful stay at Stet's cabin on the Puget Sound. I wish I could post pictures I took of the sun setting over the water, of the frozen fields in the morning with fog caught between the trees. Other guests have surely said it before, but it's truly a magical place. Stet's hospitality was the cherry on top; you can definitely that he goes above and beyond for his guests. We'll surely be back!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view was amazing. I asked for extra firewood because it was pretty cold during our stay. Stet, a most amazing host, brought an entire wheelbarrow full for my wife and I! Will definitely be going back in the future."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is a wonderful place to come and relax in a quiet and serene environment. Unplug yourself from the city, and enjoy the ducks on the water, or the quietness of the trees standing still, ominous, and witnesses of what being alive really means.
My wife and I enjoyed our first anniversary here. We plan to come back, maybe in the summer if it is available.
Thanks to the host! Stet was very hospitable and made our stay an unforgettable one."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic time at the cabin. I was really impressed with how clean and well stocked it was, and the bed linens were so soft. And the view! It is just fabulous. Constantly changing and always beautiful, the Puget Sound really makes itself known in this space. It took my breath away a couple times, between complete zero visibility fog ,to a huge sunny purple and gold sunset, and giant moon over the water, all in a two day visit. Plus all the birds you can see right there from the living room. I went in December and was warm. Also, the host is extremely nice and an interesting person."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is such a gem! Located right on the water, it was lovely to see so many birds and boats at different times of the day. Being in the woods, we also got to see deer. Peaceful, quiet, and lovely place.
Stet and Lynne were great hosts; quick to respond and accommodating.
Would definitely stay there again!"
2017-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Consider yourself lucky if you can reserve this cabin. It is charming and has waterfront views of Puget Sound. Every morning we were able to watch seabirds, and saw a seal one day. Not only is the cabin on the wayee, but it's in the country, and we saw deer every day. All this, and it's only 15 minutes to the middle of town. One star off for the miniscule shower - it really was quite uncomfortable. *Note that the bed is a full size, so if you have more than one large person in it, you'll be cozy! *Also note that cabin has been updated from some previous reviews and now has a small, 2-burner stove top. No regular oven though, just a toast oveb, but that is not an inconvenience."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and cozy cabin by the water! The cabin is very clean and has almost everything you need from freezer to microwave to shower. They even provide you some stuff for breakfast which we found very convenient. The best was the little fire stove, although it wasn't that cold we used it a lot. It added a lot to the atmosphere.
The hosts leave you alone if you want to be alone, if we needed help or had questions they were immediately there to assist or arrange things.
All in all very great experience!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,View from the cabin is amazing. Peaceful location. Cabin is small but comfy. Stet is a great host and very helpful with ideas on things to do and places to eat.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is sooooooo sweet. We were warmly greeted with so many personal touches and thoughtful accommodations. Aside from the amazing view, the cabin itself has everything for a short or long stay and is well supplied for stove top cooking. It is also surprisingly spacious with ample heat sources including the easy to use wood stove. The location isn't really that far from the highway but it seems like you've found a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. It's close to many state parks that are easy to get out and enjoy. We had a perfect trip with falling leaves, northwest rain, even snow and a rainbow off the deck, all in the same 2 days. Truly a perfect experience."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Star's cabin was phenomenal. The view is breathtaking and his warm hospitality is the best. I definitely recommend this beautiful place and hope to return.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a special gem this place is. A charming waterfront cabin with so many great features and special touches. I had a truly enjoyable brief stay. The fantastic accommodations included a picture window with a view of the sound in a cabin with a nice kitchen and comfy bed. And the special touches made the stay even more memorable. The cabin was stocked with books on trails and birds... amazing homemade granola, yogurt, and fresh-groun coffee for breakfast, and the surprise of cookies on arrival, great granola and yogurt breakfast. Thank you Stet and Lynne so much for such a nice stay -- I wish I had more time there!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed four days at the waterfront cabin and loved every minute of it. The cabin is so cozy and located in a beautiful and quiet area directly at the water. From the living room the view is stunning and you can perfectly relax after long days. For us it was the base to explore the Olympic national park and the location is pretty convenient since you can access both the east and the west coast of the park.
Lynn and Stet are perfect hosts, the communication was absolutely amazing and they even provided us with food and homemade specialities that were unbelievably tasty.
We would definitely come back and recommend the cabin."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for spending time in a quiet, serene setting! Host was prompt with all communication and provided all the information we needed."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful gem remote enough to feel completely secluded while 15 min from anything you could want or need. The quiet space felt very healing. We had our favorite moments birding on the deck, relaxing and gazing out as the mist rolled off the water. Stet and Lynne were open, kind, very generous with lots of food and extras provided to make us feel welcomed and at home. Highly recommend for easy going nature-lovin' folk. We would definitely return."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was cute and cozy, a perfect place to relax. The view onto the water is beautiful and the grounds around the cabin are lovely too. The hosts were nice enough to stock breakfast items like locally made bread and granola (both were delicious!) and had plenty of suggestions to make the most of our stay. Had a great time here, would happily return!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was as advertised: cozy, but not cramped. It's easy to get to and not far from the 101 and just 15 minutes from downtown Olympia. The shower was hot, and they had fresh ground coffee, eggs, granola, and other breakfast essentials. The nearby scenery adds an additional layer of charm to an already nice little cabin. Would recommend Stet's place to anyone needing to stay in the area."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful view! We came to relax and relax we did. Worth noting that there is a toaster oven only but it worked great for us. We baked quiche and cookies and more in it without issue. It's a beautiful property and we hope to come back,"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place is amazing! The view off the back deck (and view from window) is breathtaking. I can't describe how relaxing it is to sit and take in the view with total silence. Like others have mentioned, it's really quiet -- the only sound you'll hear is an occasional bird. I never thought watching the tide roll in and out throughout the day would be so entertaining. The cabin is well equipped to prepare meals. We enjoyed eating dinner on the deck watching the sunset. The property is quite beautiful with two friendly horses, Tally and Kippy, and lovely gardens full of flowers and vegetables.
Stet and Lynne are the most gracious hosts you'll ever encounter. They'll give you all the privacy you desire however we enjoyed visiting with them and appreciated thier advice on all the great things to do in the area.
This is truly a wonderful place. We can't wait to return!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quiet little cabin right on the water. Need some R&R; this is your place!!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is so serene and peaceful with everything you need for one or two people. While it is close to Olympia, we ended up eating in every night because the view and setting couldn't be beat. The kitchen is small, but has everything you need to cook a meal: two-burner stove top, high functioning toaster oven, and a microwave.
Lauren and Stet are also extraordinarily gracious hosts. We will absolutely be back."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely cabin. It feels secluded, but is only a short drive from everything you could need. We loved our time here."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous charming secluded cabin on Puget Sound - hosts are very generous and welcoming- totally enjoyable stunningly beautiful place!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're in need of a perfectly quiet get away to ponder life and re-connect with the planet, Stet & Lynn's spot on Puget Sound is the perfect sweet little spot. They're most gracious hosts making for a truly lovely stay."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is amazing! Quiet and peaceful, and comes with amazing granola! I was only there to sleep as I was hiking Olympic and Mt. Ranier during the day, but I can see myself coming back just to hang out at the cabin!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin of Stet and Lynne is picturesquely located right on the water, in the middle of nature just a few minutes drive from Olympia. Ensured that the entire arrival and check-in process went smoothly and helped us with any problems that may arise. We were able to enjoy the view of the Puget Sound at breakfast and the Olympic NP is also not far away. The furnishings leave nothing to be desired, we were even surprised with homemade muffins and granola. Our stay was actually far too short for this great place to stay."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing- simply amazing!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot to end our two week travels along highway 101. If you want a lovely, clean and well stocked cabin at the water's edge, this is your dream place. Stet and Lynne were awesome hosts with great suggestions to enjoy the area. This cozy cabin tucked along back roads provides a touch of class."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both the cabin and Stet were absolutely fantastic! We were looking for a relaxing weekend getaway, and that's exactly what we got. Stet had lots of suggestions for where to take our kayaks and things to do around Olympia, but we spent most of our time on the porch taking in the amazing view. Everything was clean and organized, the fridge was stocked with the essentials, there was homemade granola on the counter, the bed was very comfortable, and Stet was available if we needed anything (but we never did because he had thought of everything!). We definitely plan on returning, and would absolutely recommend this cabin to others!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Stets cabin. All the breakfast foods and amazing help and communication touring the local area were so appreciated!!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What everyone said before is true: perfect place to getaway and the hosts are delightful :) ! Highly recommend!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at the cabin- it was so peaceful and was the perfect way to end our vacation. The cabin had everything we needed and Stet and Lynne were so welcoming and helpful. We wish we could have stayed longer because the view never gets old!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stet and Lynne's cabin is amazing! It is so cozy, clean, and charming. You can't beat the views, either! We loved staying here and hope to be back!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet, cozy""tiny house"", waterfront location, breathtaking view of the inlet. Clean and comfortable accommodations, well stocked with everything we needed. We will be back if our travels take us this way again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a perfect location to visit my son and his new baby.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Vintage charm with wonderful peek-a-boo view of the bay. Comfortable bed. Close to Farmer's Market, restaurants and shops. Great walking path around bay. As our host, Elena was super responsive, attentive to our needs, and welcoming. Thank you for sharing your home with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely stay and lovely hosts!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, quiet, spacious spot for a weekend getaway. Elena was super easy to communicate with. Hope to return!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I absolutely loved this place, and would recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, peaceful, quiet, very well laid out and furnished. I'll definitely stay here again next time I'm in Olympia."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I lived here for 3 months during a home remodel. The view out the windows every morning to look through trees at the waters of Budd Bay Inlet was such a peaceful way to start the day; I'm going to miss that. Really comfortable gigantic bed, plenty of room to store clothing and other things I brought from home. The one thing I missed was more kitchen capacity but this is a small space and it was what I expected--a ""heat things up"" space (toaster oven, microwave, gas cooktop, no full oven, smaller refrigerator). Our cat loved looking out a small window in the bedroom to watch birds pecking at the ground below. I bike for transportation and this is a great place to stay if you ride! Easy flat trip to downtown for restaurants, groceries, entertainment, and a beautiful ride the other direction if you want some hills and mileage with a bike lane and then shoulder. Beautiful Squaxin Park is close by with forest trails and access down to the water to watch birds and the occasional seal."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elena's place was perfect for staying in Olympia. Clean, modern, very comfortable. I wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommend if you have a chance to book."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean. Comfortable (esp. the bed!). Though we didn't do any cooking the kitchen was well supplied. It's on a street with daytime traffic, though you are above it. Super quiet at night (for a good night's sleep)."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Although the pictures don’t show it, there is a small fridge in the kitchen which is perfect for storing leftovers and drinks. We found it to be very clean, comfortable, and quiet. We would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, comfortable location for visiting family who live near. Comfortable ‘apartment’ with nice amenities."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location to enjoy ""all that is Olympia"". Everything is walkable including a park leading down to the sound, the local marina, the public market and shopping downtown. This wasn't my first visit, and I hope to stay again soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely location in Olympia! Close to downtown, close to parks!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With bike lanes and sidewalks from the property to downtown Olympia, it's the perfect location. Elena's place is very clean, has everything you need, private, and is very cute. We appreciated the AC and the temperature was always comfortable. The only thing I would change would be another window to open for ventilation. Otherwise, it was perfect."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well-kept apartment within short drive from Olympia
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love love love this place! Very convenient to downtown, waterfront and beautiful walking and running trails. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My new favorite place to stay in Olympia. Comfortable, safe, private, peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Right across from the water, close to downtown (approx. 1.5 miles) shopping, restaurants, farmers market….yet far enough away from the city. Elana was a lovely host and very quick to respond to any questions I had. My new home away when visiting family in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I loved staying here! Elena is a phenomenal host! She was responsive and even brought one of her personal deck chairs down to my level so I could read outside and sip my coffee.
I hike A LOT! So I actually didn't stay in the Airbnb the entire week, as I was camping in Leavenworth and stayed in Seattle for a night. BUT...when I was there, that bed was SO COMFY! It was PERFECT for my rest days, especially after my 22 mile hike to Aasgard Pass)
Things to know if you hike:
-Leavenworth for Colchuck Lake and Aasgard Pass is 4 hr drive from Airbnb
-Mt. Rainier is a 2.5 hr drive from Airbnb (left at 12 am, so this is travel time with no traffic)
-Seattle Airport is about 1.5 to 2.5 hours, depending on Seattle traffic .
-Lastly, Squaxin Park is walkable from Elena's Airbnb. Squaxin Park has ""Telephone of the Wind "" which is why I actually booked this trip. This is where you go to send your loved ones (my daughter, Eliza) who have passed away messages to be carried by the wind..."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"peaceful, restorative stay, will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were 5 minutes from the Lac A Do Hall for our square dance workshop week. What we loved most: beautiful surroundings, close to Squaxin Park and San Francisco Bakery. Convenient to anything else you want to do in Olympia or surrounding area. Be aware though: there is no thermostat so you are dependent on the upstairs residents for heat or air conditioning. Only two windows actually open and only one of those has a screen on it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect home base for our visit to Olympia. Just minutes from beautiful parks and trails and from the restaurants and art downtown. Elena was quick to respond and we would love to stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very sophisticated, functional and equipped with hair dryer , towels , shampoo, good coffee etc. I am coming back for sure . Loved it . Very gracious hosts . Beautiful place to stay . Top 5 for me ."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apt was spacious and clean. Even though it is the bottom floor of the house, there was a lovely partial view of the water. The neighborhood is extremely walkable, with sidewalks on both sides of the street. We walked to a beautiful park and down to a rocky beach. We also walked to the historic downtown where we had great pizza and beer at Well 80. Would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Elena's was just as we hoped! Easy to find and access the space, which was just as described. Quiet, clean and well equipped for everything we needed. Great find!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The Apartment was very nice and everything was clean and tidy. The only issue I would mention Is that the apartment is directly below the owners residence and was extremely noisy. On the last night we were there someone was up all night banging doors, dresser drawers and walking loudly throughout the owners home upstairs. My husband and I did not get much sleep! That would be my only complaint."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. It was a beautiful and super clean home. Elena was so helpful and responsive. The location is great to access downtown, the park and other areas. I would definitely stay again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Elena was very responsive and helpful. The location of her place was perfect for walking into town and next door to the city park. The sunset view was an added bonus.
The bed was comfy and nice to have a washer/dryer!
I highly recommend the rose donuts on Sunday morning at the Filling Station coffee shop right up the road!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a great place to stay. Everything was clean and in order. It is within easy walking distance of parks with trails leading to the Sound. Elena was very gracious and easy to communicate with.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was extremely pleasant - everything was “as advertised”. The apartment was clean, cozy and had everything we needed. A quiet property with a nice peak view of the water. Elena was promptly responsive and a pleasure to work with. Highly recommended!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elena's place was clean, quiet and comfortable. Check-in instructions were clear; her communication was quick and friendly; the location had easy access to downtown Olympia; and the description of the space was accurate. Couldn't ask for much more. Definitely recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Elena’s apartment was nicely furnished, clean, and has a beautiful view of Puget Sound on Olympia’s East Bay. The apartment was larger than I expected, and in a safe neighborhood. It is a downstairs apartment with a private entrance, and the owners live upstairs. Elena was very responsive to any communication from me during my stay, but I felt complete privacy at the same time. I would definitely stay at Elena’s place again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Elena is a great host! Respectful of our privacy and responsive to our needs and questions about the area. The suite was clean, comfy and in a great location."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Elena’s place was clean and comfortable. It was well equipped with everything I needed for my stay. She was helpful and response time swift. I especially enjoyed the views. I could see the beautiful colors of the sky over the water while the sun was setting. I would highly recommend her place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elena was there to greet me, showed me the ropes and then made sure I knew she was available if needed. Lovely place right in town near a park and the harbor. Very comfortable. Hope to stay there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful apartment with fantastic view of bay. Very close to a good walking / running park and only a mile from the lovely downtown Olympia. It was clean, well-furnished and even has a washer / dryer!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stop looking -you've found THE place to stay in Olympia!!
Here's why:
The bed is COMFORTABLE
The view is INCREDIBLE
The accommodations are IMMACULATE
And the hosts are WONDERFUL
Notes:
Hubby has had 3 spine surgeries, so when we say ""comfortable"", that means he was able to relax and sleep well.
The couch was also comfy for him.
The accommodations are peaceful and well laid out. There's enough room to work, read, cook & relax. All with a view of the water and sunset.
Literally steps away from the beach.
The hosts went over and above to ensure our comfort.
When we're in the area again, we'll be booking here (if there's an opening)!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very cute place with a great location in Olympia, right across from the water. Elena was great with communication. The apartment was spacious and clean and had all the necessities."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It’s in a safe neighborhood, the space was clean, and what is pictured is accurate but could tell it’s a newer listing since there were a couple things missing. There’s no full oven (just the toaster oven with no baking trays that fit), and the tv was not working when we arrived. When I messaged about it I got a quick response that the previous guest had the same issue and she had tried to fix it unsuccessfully before we had arrived. She was kind about it and offered to try fixing it again, but we eventually fixed it ourselves a day later. Overall a good quiet place and the issues we ran into were minor and can be improved for next guests."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very clean and with an amazing view! kind and helpful hosts
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Elena and Nic were fabulous hosts and their suite is beautiful and spacious, with a fantastic view of South Puget Sound. They bent over backward to make our stay very comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this gem of a place. So close to many things, but far enough away from city noise. The place is very comfortable with a kitchen, washer,dryer,comfy bed! The hosts are very kind and respond quickly if you have any questions or needs. I would love to stay here again if I am ever in Olympia."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just recently renovated with all new decor and some appliances such as washer and dryer. There was coffee and tea provided and new microwave and fridge also. The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom is new and was stocked up nicely with soaps, shampoo and clean new towels. The front room is large enough for small dining table and a pull-out sofa bed to sleep an additional 2. The location is perfect for a getaway with partial view of the bay and short driving distance to Olympia historic downtown. The location is very easy to access, huge amount of parking and exceptionally clean everywhere. There is also access to a beach in the bay across the street within a 5 min walk. We watched the sun set over 3 nights. Elena's communication was excellent she welcomed us on the first night and provided many recommendations for local restaurants and places to visit. As with many newly listed and newly renovated places there are some minor issues that Elena addressed immediately upon contact. My wife and I had a beautiful time, and the location is perfect, fantastic restaurants and for a short romantic getaway we would definitely consider returning in the future. Thankyou Elena!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As only the second guests at this property of Elena’s, there were a few things that needed some guidance, but Elena was very communicative and addressed our questions (how to use the stove, WiFi password, etc.). The place has beautiful views and was newly painted and decorated, and quite clean."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elena's space was perfect for my week-long stay. It was clean and spacious. The host provided everything needed such as dishes, cleaning supplies, etc. They responded very quickly and were always very helpful in answering all my questions. The apartment was in a great location with a nice view as well. I would stay again if given the chance!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh’s place was just like the pictures; bright, green, and clean. The bed was amazing!! I’m a bed princess and this one passed the test. This is a mother-in-law like apartment but privacy was maintained."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I live north of Seattle and this was just what I needed to rest up for the Capital City Run. It was clean, cozy, and Josh gave good instructions for Check-in/checkout which were easy to follow. I would book this suite again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really liked this bright, spacious home away from home. It was spotlessly clean, and we loved the cute kitchen, the nice TV/living area and the comfy bed. After four nights here, I kind of hated to leave! Would definitely stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was beautiful and ""evergreen' in color and decorative touches. I loved the pictures and little signs with green sayings placed just right. Joshua put a lot of care and thought into the kitchen and bath -everything you need is there! Temperature was perfect inside and the heaters, air conditioner and fan is sure to keep it that way no matter what the weather outside. The black-out blinds and the air filter were both pluses for me!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua's apartment is well appointed. Clean, happy space. Very comfortable bed with great pillows and comfy sheets. Easy walk to the Community Co-op.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and excellent communication. Extra bonus for covered parking.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simple, but met all my needs for an overnight work trip. Communication from Joshua was clear and timely, and getting in was easy. Snacks and oatmeal for breakfast were nice touches! And I really appreciated that there weren't a jillion check-out requirements on top of the (reasonable) cleaning fee."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfy
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This a very lovely and nicely appointed place! Easy to relax, or to work. Josh has it set up well for a mostly peaceful experience. Some nice books if you are a reader. Easy walk to one of Olympia's best Latino restaurants (IMO)!
The unit is next to the carport that is shared with another guest space so can be noisy when another guest is arriving/departing or idling their vehicle.
The unit shares a hot water heater with two other units, so my second morning I waited about an hour for the system to recharge. Not a major issue as I had time to wait."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed for a week and it was a very comfortable
Place to relax and rest. We were there for family matters and will come back and stay again when in the area. Thanks for hosting us.😊"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay here! Location was quiet and private but still close to all Olympia has to offer. Everything inside the space was comfortable and worked perfectly. Huge plus having a gas fireplace, full kitchen, full bath (plus a bidet). The biggest plus was the host Josh, he was incredibly flexible with my need to stay an extra night when weather restrictions made it impossible for me to leave on my scheduled day out. Couldnt recommend this place more!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little studio. Felt very spacious! We'd definitely come back. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely satisfied with Joshua’s cozy place! Easy to find and use cookware. Plus appreciated the smart tv options and quietness of the neighborhood. Bed was comfortable and the place stayed warm. Will book again when the time comes.

simple spot and did not have any problems"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed at the Evergreen Escape for a night while visiting my sister and had a lovely, peaceful time. I arrived after dark and it was easy to find and very quick and easy to get inside. The bed was extremely comfortable and I got a fantastic nights sleep. I felt very rested in the morning.
Overall it was a quiet location and well appointed with nice coffee and even a few snacks which I really appreciated as I arrived a bit hungry!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the space is private, there was the ambient sounds of the other people on the property living life and doing usual upkeep to the grounds. As noted in the description, there is a shared wall with other residents, and for the most part, the noise was minimal. While it seemed there was nefarious activity happening down the street from the place, and I questioned my safety, no one hassled me."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cute studio. Quiet area
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect.
The location makes all parts of Olympia and Lacey easily accessible.
The first thing we noticed is the tray with the snacks and 2 bottles of water. Such a nice welcome.
The space is inviting. Lots of light, but has black-out curtains that allow you to sleep in.
The portable a/c worked perfectly. Kept the space nice and cool.
Love that shampoo, conditioner and body was provided. Shower was nice. Pressure from the showerhead is good. But let me tell you, those TOWELS! We took a picture of the tag so we can buy some for home.
The bed was super comfortable.
We had plenty of room to park our 2 motorcycles in the covered carport.
We can't rave enough about Joshua's place. Highly recommend!
Thank you for your hospitality."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy stay in updated studio, complete with small details like coffee, oatmeal and reading materials!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic AirBnB! We’ve stayed in hundreds over the last year and this was one of the best equipped. Communication with Joshua was smooth. Check in was incredibly easy.
Hot powerful shower with bath, comfy bed, coffee provided, cool aircon - you won’t want for a thing. Also check Josh’s guide book for local recommendations. We did a free tour at the Capitol - would highly recommend. Also pick up some sea food from The Olympia Seafood co and cook it at home - DELICIOUS!
Thanks Joshua"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The guests who say this place is more like an apartment are correct. Lots of space and super clean. I booked the night before I would be checking in, and a technology glitch meant that I didn’t receive a code for the lock. Yet once Joshua realized what went wrong with the auto-response email, he made it right, and I’m glad I was able to stay at his place. A very good value given how roomy and clean it is."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay with clear communication and clean accommodations
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Joshua for a pleasant stay at Evergren Escape. Your place was well put together and I could tell you had tried to provide everything a guest might want. Thanks so much. I recommend this place for a quick stay to anyone passing through.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place. Just as described and exactly what we needed. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very communicative and helpful. Made some accommodations for us when we arrived earlier than expected. Host was friendly, and the rental was quiet, and the portable AC worked great for the space. We enjoyed our stay and would come again. Close to town and drivable, not walkable, to all areas.
Please note the area is experiencing some homelessness, but not the hosts fault, and nobody bothered us. There was no use of outside areas. Definitely best to stay and sleep only and not somewhere for a vacation destination (which was fine for us because we were out most the day anyway). Overall it worked great for what we needed!!
Thank you Joshua!! :)"

Communicating with Joshua was a delight; he was friendly and proactive .

Highly recommend staying here in Olympia!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joshua’s studio was the perfect stop for us on our way through Olympia. We loved the big windows, cozy decor and comfortable bed! We slept great after several days of hiking and traveling around the PNW. It was the refresh we needed before heading home."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Evergreen Room is nice because it has a treehouse feel. It's part of a house that's built on a slope, so although you enter on the street level, the view out the back is from the second floor. Lots of big trees around the property offer a sense of privacy. The house is located on a street that starts off a little rough from the main road (residences with deferred maintenance, fence graffiti, etc.), but the farther up the street you drive, the nicer the neighborhood gets. The house itself is well-maintained, and we enjoyed our stay. The host emailed us midway thru our visit to offer extra towels, and to ensure we were comfortable. He provided some chilled water bottles and a basket of snacks, which were appreciated after a long drive from CA. Overall, the room was quiet, secure, clean, spacious ... we would recommend. We had a great time in Olympia!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua’s place was very clean, private, and quiet! The self check-in was convenient and the private parking is right in front of the entrance.

Loved our stay and recommend if you are coming to Olympia area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh was incredibly welcoming and hospitable from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The place was spacious, private, and everything you need for a few nights of rest. I recommend booking his place."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is apparent that Josh has put a great deal of thought into creating a space that is welcoming for his guests. We appreciated his attention to detail, including spotless linens, clean, well-organized and clutter-free areas, and numerous amenities (air purifier, AC, bidet, etc). We had a very comfortable overnight stay."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was perfect for what I needed, I arrived late to seattle and needed a stop off en route to Portland so it was perfect just off the motorway and close to Olympia for a morning walk around the lake and so many choice of coffee shops to relax.
Joshua’s place was great, clean and very comfortable bed . Thank you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and homey with all needed amenities plus. Very clean and just what we needed. Joshua was great in communicating about everything. Would not hesitate to stay again! Thanks for sharing place!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie was a wonderful host! we were visiting for a convention at Evergreen. The space was perfect. Clean, quiet, and had everything we needed. It was very easy to find and we had no issues. Mac and Dutch the goats were such a special addition to the visit! Stephanie was so accommodating and even went above and beyond to cut up some of her recycling cardboard to help make sure my kiddos art didn't get bent. <3"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She’s a great host so kind and helpful. The place is so cute and private but so close to everything. Best of both worlds. I’d definitely stay here again in the future. Also the goats are nice and greet you with big smiles.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice rural feeling neighborhood, clean smallish suite, but nice bathroom and shower, friendly goats"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was welcoming and accommodating from the start. The goats were friendly and so many trails nearby. This place was ideal for me.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I enjoyed a lovely long weekend in Olympia and this was a great home base. A very cute and safe neighborhood nestled in the beautiful woods of the PNW, and a short drive into town. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Stephanie’s place! We loved the goats; she left a jar of treats that we could feed them. The goats loved that part 😉 All in all, we enjoyed our visit."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie's place is a very peaceful urban retreat at the end of a dead end street. The cottage was clean, well appointed, and comfy. Alas, the rain prevented us from interacting with Mac & Dutch, the goats, but we were able to say hi to them, as well as the cats in the catio. Stephanie was friendly and responsive. We definitely would visit again"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie is a wonderful person and host. We felt right at home upon arrival and enjoyed our time with Mac, Dutch, and the kitties. It was a wonderful place to wind down at prior to returning home. Cozy and cute! Thanks again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 4 enjoyable nights here while exploring the Olympia area. We found Stephanie's place to be very homey and comfortable. The floorplan is a bit unusual as the walk-in door enters into the bathroom, which is spacious and includes a closet. There's a sliding door off the other room. The kitchen was well supplied for two. We cooked several meals there and found nothing lacking for simple cooking. The bed is a futon style that can be folded up into a couch. The place is located at the end of a street bordering a greenbelt area, so there was no traffic passing by and the neighborhood was very quiet. We very much enjoyed meeting and interacting with Stephanie and the goats and cats that she obviously loves and takes very good care of. We hope to return soon and will definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place for a quick stop over. Very quiet area. AC was a bonus.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space for a couple or a single person to stay. Very clean and comfortable. The goats are really cute and if you ask, you can feed them their special treats. Don’t feed them random plants or food though!! Always ask first!
The surroundings are so quiet and lovely with the woods all around, yet you are a short drive to downtown Olympia. We had a lovely breakfast and then went to the farmers market and it was a mere 5 minute drive away.
The host is very responsive and pleasant to chat with. She is very welcoming!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best experiences I've had with Airbnb. Stephanie is super kind and thoughtful, and she keeps this place very clean. The shower is beautiful. More like a work of art than a shower. And this is the first time I've ever taken goats for a walk. Mac and Dutch are great! (And the kitties are sweet, too.)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Suprisingly quiet and peaceful for how close to town it is.
Clean and attractive. On a sunny day there are very comfortable outdoor chairs.
And of course the goats add some smiles - very cute."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little studio in great neighborhood. Perfect location-minutes from downtown, but also an awesome woodsy feel. And THE GOATS! What a pair!! Loved it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's place reminds me of the Airbnb experience of 5 to 10 years ago - friendly hosts, extras (like snacks and tea), and love hosting travelers.
The location is peaceful. Mac and Dutch (the goats) are awesome to have on the property. It's also in a great location to get around Olympia.
Stephanie was very responsive and friendly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! The studio was super comfortable and the shower was so needed after a week of camping. Pulling into the driveway we were immediately greeted by the goats and Stephanie's beautiful garden. We had access to everything we could want and more. Stephanie was super responsive and kind. We chatted with her while she was gardening and loved hearing her stories of backpacking, growing up and finding her way to Washington! She even let us take the goats for a morning walk around the neighborhood. This is such a great stay and Stephanie is the best host. I wish we could've stayed longer but it was the perfect end to our camping trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Stephanie’s place and would definitely stay again. She was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
The place was immaculate, well appointed, and quiet. It’s a separate space on her property, so it felt private but not isolated.
She’s on my list of ideal locations to stay while visiting my son in Olympia."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful space and very thoughtful host. Eco friendly cleaning supplies and soaps/shampoos/etc. even a compost bucket which warmed my heart❤️

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a nice, peaceful stay at Stephanie's place. She was about to walk the goats when I got in, and I was able to join and enjoy their spirited personalities :)
The space was very clean and quiet. I enjoyed the soft towels and clean body and cleaning products. There's a trail and greenway very close by, shaded and tree-lined, perfect for walking and trail running. Nice place to stay, and cozy / safe as a solo lady traveler!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was one of my favorite AirBnbn experiences so far. The hosts clearly enjoy what they do, and it can be seen on the visitor nomad map and the guestbooks. I loved the cute studio and the goats! The hosts are well aware of what tired travellers might need on their trip: there's coffee, detergents, stuff to read, sanitary products for women, even milk was left for our morning coffee. There's everything you need really.
Simply nothing bad to say about this place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie’s studio was very cozy, clean, and comfortable. You can feed the goats (and sometimes cats) breakfast and soak in the woods surrounding the house. It’s a very peaceful studio & was a fun memory for me and my daughter’s road trip."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I thought this was a wonderful space. I could live there, it was so nice. Stephanie and her partner were great, and I loved the goats. It was the last property on a road that backed up to a park. I watched squirrels, birds, and rabbits through the bedroom window. I will stay again when I visit Olympia."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for a visit with my daughter who lives nearby. I was initially disappointed that there wasn't a seating area aside from the bed and kitchen chairs. Realized later that the bed is a futon and was configured as a sofa in one of the photos. The kitchen was conveniently stocked and the ""artsy"" shower was great. Would definitely consider Stephanie's place again in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie and the goats are very friendly, and the great communication made it really easy to get settled in and checked out! The studio was clean and has everything you need for a stay."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, comfortable, private space that has everything you might need! It was lovely to be able to get away and enjoy a relaxing evening in such a calming environment. Early on I made a mistake when booking and Stephanie reached out to Airbnb to help me get it all cleared up, just that in itself was amazing. I would definitely stay here again 10/10 ☺️"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! Very cozy and secluded. Stephanie was a joy to talk to and gave us carrots and veggies to feed to the goats, Mac & Dutch, who were the highlight of our stay. The location felt secluded but was only a 5-10 min drive to downtown Olympia so it was easy to pop over for dinner and drinks! Will definitely come back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A special bit of magic away from home! You're in for a treat with a stay at Stephanie's place! Beautiful, quiet, peaceful and the cutest little goats you've ever seen!
Spotlessly clean and tidy with everything you could possibly need and more! Quaint and cozy but never the feeling that it's too small, it was perfect for our weekend getaway. The extra snacks were a real treat!
Stephanie was super helpful with restaurant suggestions of which we took full advantage.
We'll definitely be heading back for more adventures and Stephanie's place is top of the list!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Stephanie's. She is such a gracious host.
The goats made the experience even more enjoyable. Completely pleased with our getaway there!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was tidy and cozy
And the animals is lovely!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie was a most thoughtful and generous host. I will stay with her again!
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"This place was clean, quiet and overall fine. The host was great about adjusting check in time but I found a 5pm check in with a 10 am check out to be pretty rigid considering the price. I was ultimately disappointed with there not being a living area with a separate couch/lounge space. The bed is a futon which is just very uncomfortable. That was the biggest disappointment was paying $180 a night (with fees) to not have a comfortable space to hang out and a comfortable bed. Overall it was clean, good communication, we just couldn’t sleep well on a futon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was very straightforward. The place was tidy and easy to locate. Went on a walk with Stephanie and the goats, did a little leashing and brushing, a true Airbnb experience. Leant a lot about herd animals from Stephanie. Goats were so welcoming and just adorable!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such cute goats to greet you each morning! A lovey little studio
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great stay. We couldn't believe on convenient the location was. The space itself was neat, clean, and thoughtfully put together. It's clear that Stephanie takes the time to think of the little touches to make the trip great. For example, we told her we were thinking of buying a home in Olympia, and she left us some cards from a local real estate agent. So thoughtful.
The goats are also great. Loved seeing them."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie’s cottage was beautiful, clean, and welcoming. The bed, despite being a futon, was SO comfy (I slept soundly for a week on it!) and the shower was something out of a spa! Her property was a lovely hideaway in a forested area somehow only a stone’s throw from downtown! It was truly the best of both worlds. The goats were adorable as were her cats, who kept me company while I studied on the catio! Stephanie was a gracious host and I would stay again anytime I’m in the area!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay here, we really enjoyed the relaxing spot, the wonderful goats and walking the goats with Stephanie! Lots of smart amenities in the house and a quiet area with woods surrounding but still easy to get downtown on foot to explore as well."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at this quiet and calm nature oasis for a solo retreat. The goats are so cute, and the location is perfect. Just a few minutes drive to downtown Olympia, but far enough to be secluded away from the hustle and bustle. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very thoughtfully appointed, small but comfy stand alone apartment. The host is very knowledgeable, sweet and attentive. If you like quietude, to be near an herb and veggie garden, goats and trees, this is a lovely respite."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean place and in a great location. The host was wonderful, very responsive and helpful. I recommend it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice ADU. Great location near Watershed Park. Love the friendly goats!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cutest spot!! Stephanie is the best Airbnb host I’ve ever staying with, she is incredibly kind and understanding and was a gracious host. There are lots of snacks and tea in the studio, and the goats are absolutely adorable! They are so much fun to watch and made our entire stay. The guest studio is cute and cozy and has a big mosaic shower, and the house is surrounded by lovely woods to hike in. Highly recommend! Thank you Stephanie!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Delightful little spot that is so close to downtown but off the beaten path enough that it feels like a retreat. We only had a short time here but the open concept shower was wonderful and the bed was cozy. Due to schedule changes on our end we weren't able to walk the goats BUT Stephanie handed us some banana peels to feed them as we were leaving and it was a nice little time with those cuties!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here for the goats and the trails and loved both! I enjoyed my night away in Olympia. Stephanie was great with inviting me to brush and interact with the goats, who were both very sweet. Being able to walk to the watershed loop trail and the woodland trail were a wonderful way to spend the early evening. The studio was so clean and cozy and well equipped. I would stay again in a second."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and cozy place to stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"First off, goats were amazing. Place was clean & adequate. Communication with host was great. Would recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much fun, she was so sweet and helpful! Hoping to be back again :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here where a walk to down town was easy and approachable and the goats provided excellent in house entertainment. A cozy and comfortable place that made Olympia very fun.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely short stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie's place was perfect for our stay. It's quiet, cozy, surrounded by beautiful nature, and even comes with adorable goats! I highly recommend staying here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the setting. Wooded background and at the end of the street. A young fawn came right to the goat yard. Facility was clean and got a good night’s sleep.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful little place to stay for work or play. I needed a spot for a couple nights while I worked in Olympia, and I’m so grateful I found Stephanie’s place. She was communicative, flexible, kind, and helpful. The place itself was cozy, clean, and comfortable. The goats are a joy! I have to mention how Stephanie went above and beyond to help me; I had a sprained ankle and my job is a physical one. This meant that I needed lots of rest time between job activities and Stephanie ensured I was able to rest and recover as much as I needed to. She was super easy to get a hold of and always ready to help if needed it.
Also this spot is great. Very close to downtown, as well as parks that are good for walking, running, or hiking.
I would absolutely stay here again, and look forward to being able to walk with Stephanie and the goats next time!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for just a day, but it was great. Stephanie was very friendly and helpful. We felt welcomed every minute. Also the studio is very clean, comfy and she has snacks and coffee for her guests. Our favorite part was meeting the goats. And even though the studio is very close to the main house it felt very private and quiet."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! This was exactly the staycation away from the city that we needed!
If you are desiring a cute, quiet, wooded retreat within driving distance of Seattle then this is the spot!
We’d highly recommend staying here. Stephanie is a very warm and welcoming host and the accommodations were great. The friendly on-premises goats are an added bonus!
Five star experience all around!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Goats and Gardens with Stephanie is a great place to relax and feel as if you are far away from it all and yet, you are minutes away from everything you could possibly need. Stephanie is a wonderful host who took great care to make us feel a part of her farm family :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The studio was beautiful and new! It was much closer to the downtown area than I originally thought, in a great location. I received a warm welcome and loved petting the sweetest goats I've ever met. The shower was amazing and I had everything I could need for a nice stay. This place is delightful and I would love to come back again someday!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an incredible experience! Stephanie was incredibly generous with her time getting us time to hang out with the goats, Mac and Dutch. The place was just as described, and incredibly clean."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Would definitely stay here again when coming back to Olympia! Host is amazing :)
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is located perfectly between the woods and downtown! We were able to explore the beautiful forests and the buzz of downtown with amazing restaurants! Highly recommend staying here. And don’t miss out on walking the goats with Stephanie, it’s a real treat!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved Stephanie’s place so much! Not only is it comfortable, but Stephanie is a great host. Made sure we had everything we needed and was quick to respond. Would recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful spot for one or two people. It is tucked away into a safe, sweet and quiet neighborhood in Olympia- just a few minutes from the Capital building. The shower is phenomenal, the bed is cozy and the land is welcoming. Stephanie is a really awesome person who goes above and beyond and a host. A True Airbnb :) :) :)
I recommend for sure"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie is the kindest and most generous host! Her goats are adorable and sociable, the studio was clean and the location was beautiful. CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to go for a walk in shower and a good night's sleep on the edge of a quiet wooded greenbelt with two fine looking goats.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie’s studio is adorable. It is quite close to downtown Olympia yet close to hiking trails and nature. If you can, ask Stephanie if you can go on a hike with her two goats, Mac and Dutch. What a treat. We loved staying at Stephanie’s studio. She is an excellent host and a wonderful human being. This is what Airbnb is all about. We’ll be back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie’s woodland haven was magical! 🧚 I spent 5 days cozy & warm in the woods, just what I needed! 🦉Perfect location too!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Stephanie! :)

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy relaxing stay at Stephanie's! Mac and Dutch were gracious hosts as well, they make a wonderful welcoming committee every time you pull in! Stephanie was very generous with tasty snacks and coffee, everything you need to take care of yourself is available (spoons, dishes, mixing bowls, shampoo/conditioner, shaving cream/body wash, a rather large mini fridge with separate freezer). The space is small but functional and very comfortable. The bathroom is huge though, almost as big as the bedroom! Overall we had a very peaceful stay and I recommend it to everyone."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great private little space and convenient for Olympia and surrounding areas. Stephanie is very kind and helpful and meeting her two goats was quite fun. Loved getting to take them on a walk!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked super last minute and are so happy we did! The guesthouse was very clean, extremely comfortable, and it was evident that the host pays attention to the smaller details to make the stay extra relaxing and nice for guests. The place was in a lovely area that was quiet and peaceful. I couldn’t recommend Stephanie’s place more."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie's place was perfect for what I needed. The bed and the bedding were clean and comfy.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My first ever Airbnb experience. It was easy! Stephanie hosts a, warm, quiet get away. If you’re looking for a quiet country feel with all the amenities of a city suite, this is for you! I had a blast watching, and learning some about goats. Who knew they could see 320 degrees!? Really enjoyed my stay and recommend! I hope all my future stays can live up to this! A high bar is set!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet space and sweet host, plus the goats were cool. Cozy bed and the shower was a highlight—good pressure and heat. The one, tiny downside was the space can get a bit dark for my taste. Appreciated all the rainbow flags in the neighborhood. I brought my bike and there were several significant bike paths a few blocks away. Thank you Stephanie."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cozy place! it had everything we needed. Stephanie also gave us some pointers on where to go for our honeymoon. :)
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie was a very kind host for my mom while we were grieving a family member. She was very communicative and thoughtful, which made everything about the stay easier. The goats did so much to cheer us both. We’d definitely return for another stay."

She is an excellent host with great communication. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Olympia."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed a quiet night at Stephanie's place. She helped us out with a special request and communicated clearly with us before and during our stay. The room had everything we needed: comfy bed, small kitchenette, full bathroom with nicely tiled hot shower, and access to a shared outdoor seating area where we could enjoy the nature sounds from the forest behind the house. She even provided some snacks for the day. We got to meet the goats the following morning and they are adorable! If you don't like the goats they won't be in your way, though. We can definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay if you are in the area. Stephanie was so friendly and her goats were so much fun. The guest house was beautiful we had a wonderful time!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderfully quiet oasis!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Stephanie’s studio was everything we needed. The first thing we saw as we pulled up were her two goats Mac and Dutch, waiting for us in her driveway. She offered great trail hike suggestions and allowed us to join on a walk with Mac and Dutch. She was very easy going and accommodating, even allowing us an early check in. The studio had everything we needed. Unfortunately we only had one day there but we hope to be back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Could not have wished for a more peaceful, relaxing stay in an immaculate studio with a heavenly shower! The goats, hydrangea, and Stephanie's gentle presence were the icing on the cake!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you Stephanie great beautiful place.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie's Airbnb is one of a kind. We are so glad to have stayed with Stephanie on our trip back from Olympic National Park. Stephanie is such a gracious host! We really enjoyed getting to know her. She gave us a tour of her beautiful vegetable garden, let us feed catnip to Ozzie the cat, and join a morning hike with Mac and Dutch the goats, which was so much fun! And there is the awwsome four legged welcome committee: Ozzie the cat, Mac and Dutch the goats. We had so much fun hanging out with them. The city of Olympia is a hidden gem, and Stephanie’s place is an oasis surrounded by natural but yet so convenient to get to great restaurants and shops in downtown Olympia. We’ll sure be back on our next trip to Seattle Area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very comfortable at Stephanie's place. It was our home and refuge for six nights as we explored the area. It was a pleasure meeting Stephanie and delightful to walk with Mac and Dutch. I heartily recommend it if you get a chance. The property has a woodland buffer area on one side and is surprisingly quiet for being a convenient distance from downtown. It is two blocks from Watershed Park and two blocks from the Woodland bike path for morning or evening walks.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is amazing… comfy home backed up to a forest with two adorable goats to hang out with. What else could you ask for?! I’ve stayed here multiple times and would gladly stay again!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet area. The goats were a nice bonus! Wasn't there much because of work but when I was it was peaceful.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good spot, mind their business, leave you to yours. Clean,snacks and beverages. Great location. The goats werent very friendly, but what goats are. A+++"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came during a heat wave, and Stephanie did everything she possibly could to ensure that our stay was comfortable. She borrowed an extra fan from a neighbor and even engineered a DIY AC for us. We felt very welcomed and taken care of. The space is well-appointed and comfortable, and Stephanie has put a lot of thought into the little details to supply everything guests will need. Stephanie was a great logistical communicator throughout our stay, and we also enjoyed chatting with her in a more social capacity. Spending time with the goats, Mac and Dutch, was the icing on top — they’re adorable and incredibly friendly!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"One-of-a-kind and a must-stay place! Wonderful, kind, and accommodating hosts. Seeing Mac and Dutch were the highlights of our stay. Absolutely beautiful!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy studio was everything we could've asked for and more. It was very clean and organized. We felt at home and had everything we needed provided at the studio for our 6 day trip. The studio included hotplates and plenty of dinnerware for nights we didn't feel like going out. The shower was one of my favorite touches; it really made for a relaxing night after a full day of hiking. Stephanie is welcoming, kind, and friendly. She was very easy to talk to and showed some of the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Mac, Dutch, and Ozzie were a real treat! We had a blast walking Mac & Dutch on our last night. It put a smile on my face every morning seeing them before we went on an adventure. The location of this Airbnb was perfect! It was nice and secluded while at the same time being centrally located to many beautiful places. We were about an hour and a half away from Seattle, Mt. Rainier, Ocean Shores, and more. When we were too tired to spend another day hiking, we spent the day in Olympia. It is such a cute city and had a lot of good food choices! The studio is a few minutes away from one of the best pastry shops we have ever had (We had to resist going a third time!) If we ever make it back out to Washington, we would love to stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's place is such a gem. The studio is quiet, cheerful, and cozy. The goats are so much fun and Stephanie is wonderful. I stayed here for a weekend while taking a kayak class in Olympia and will definitely come back again."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this place! Olympia is beautiful and quaint. Ozzie the cat is the chillest. The studio is clean, well stocked, and just about everything you need. Stephanie was friendly but respectful of your privacy, and prompt to answer any questions. I would happily stay here again next time I am in the area. Conveniently located near Capitol Forest. Check in/check out was a breeze."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The goats are the best part!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie’s quiet, wooded wetland studio is a charming, nice sized studio with an amazing bathroom and shower!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! The space itself has everything you need for a stay in Olympia. Stephanie is so great to talk to and so are her two adorable goats.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to relax. Has everything you might need and is close to everything in Olympia.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stylish room, heaters worked great and easy to use.The shower was incredible (pretty tiles! and warm) and I enjoyed the studio lay out with the separate bathroom. The kitchen amenities (hot plate, microwave, etc..) were enough for me and it didn't feel too crowded! The basket of teas and granola bars was much appreciated.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"10 out of 10 WOULD STAY AGAIN
Stephanie is an exceptional host. She is friendly, informative and genuinely wants you and your family to enjoy your stay in Olympia.
The studio was immaculately clean and equipped with everything a traveler might need (and might have forgotten to pack) like towels and washcloths.
As well if you’re looking to save some money on food she provides a microwave, clean dishes and cups, silverware, a cooking grittle with pans, pots and utensils.
If you stay here you’re missing out if you don’t ask for a walk with Mac and Dutch. (the goats) They love meeting travelers and posing for pictures."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay! She was so accommodating, and the spot was very cozy."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie is a super host! She is responsive. The place is very clean, comfortable, and quiet. We recommend it!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muy bien! The welcome goat committee was a beautiful extra pinch of happiness to the quiet studio. Stephanie was a nice host and took us on a walk with her perky goats, Mac and Dutch. Overall, the studio is in a central great neighborhood location, and possibly too close to Left Bank Pastry, because each day we stopped by the pastry shop for some sweets to enjoy at the studio. In conclusion, I recommend you stay with Mac and Dutch. Relish in hot showers at the studio and indulge in lemon tarts from the pastry shop down the street."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to wake up to, wooded scenery and quiet neighborhood adds to the stay."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Stephanie's. It was quiet, private, and comfortable. Thank you for hosting!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice, clean space! Good neighborhood for walking. There’s even a park close by."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a worthwhile stay. Stephanie’s hospitality and care really come through the studio, and it’s charm is indisputable. Waking up each morning to pass the cutest goats in the world was the best ever, and the multiple heaters in the Airbnb made my Florida bones not feel an inch of cold. Not only that, but the selection of coffee and teas and little snacks left by Stephanie were such a nice treat! Such a great and comfy stay with a host that quickly responds to your messages or questions! I highly recommend!!!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie’s place was a wonderful stop on our itinerary. The place was very cute, with an entrance right near the adorable goats, and in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood. The shower was incredible after a day spent in the cold (or anytime, really. Never underestimate the power of a good shower 😉) We really appreciated the coffee, tea, and hot plate the next morning for breakfast. And the internet was fast for a good movie viewing before bed after a long day on our feet."
2020-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"1. This place is really convenient right off I-5 and so close to downtown Olympia.
2. Great assortment of teas and snacks, and very well equipped kitchen for basic cooking.
3. If you are excited about seeing and interacting with goats, you will be very happy here.
4. The place is spotless and adheres to the highest COVID standards.
5. Beautifully decorated with nature scene canvases (photos/paintings) and the most artistic shower ever.
6. This place is perfect for a single person or couple."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's place was the perfect layover spot on our way to the Olympic coast. We got to check out the state capitol and the city. Great location, super clean, and Stephanie was obviously responsible about COVID and creating a healthy environment.
Plus the goats are super cute!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay while we explored Olympia, near a lot of nice walks! Stephanie was willing to work with us if we needed to cancel/reschedule for a storm which luckily passed, and we enjoyed taking a walk and chatting with her and hanging out with the goats."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, quaint and quiet. And the goats!!! Too cute"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome and cozy space with everything you need to feel comfortable. Beautiful location with a gorgeous trail nearby. Say hi to Dutch and Mac the goats!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not regret staying here with Stephanie! She is such a gracious host and so warm and welcoming. Walking with the goats in the forest was such a magical experience. Plus, she gave a lot of good tips for me and my roommate’s eventual move to Washington. Amazing value!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay with Stephanie! The space is serene and close to everything including the Olympia coop, which was one of my favorite places to pick up some goodies. Loved the spaciousness of the bathroom, felt luxurious to take hot showers."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie was great! She was very attentive and provided us great amenities. We love the cleanliness of the studio. She contacted us right away when we accidentally one of our belongings. We also loved meeting Ozzie and seeing her goats before we left. We hope to come again in the near future! :)
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie is an amazing host. The little guesthouse is all you need for a weekend away from the city.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie was such a gracious host and was very responsive to email inquiries beforehand, and texts during our stay. We chose her place because of the cute goats (absolutely adorable and worth it), and the location (very close to everything we needed in Olympia). I was able to work remotely from my laptop using her reliable WiFi during the day while my family enjoyed the nearby trail and met up with friends. The room was absolutely clean, and the shower water nice and hot. The well stocked kitchenette helped us prep food for the babies and warm up with coffee and tea at any time of day. I recommend staying here - especially if the sound of goats bleating makes you smile."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's place is great to put it simply. The space itself is clean and thoughtfully put together. Its proximity to local shops and breweries is awesome, but what made the stay special was walking the goats and sharing stories with Stephanie. Would and will absolutely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Olympia."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect quiet and comfortable getaway. Loved this cute place and would come back again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second stay here. The air is always so fresh here, right next door to Olympic NP - I left the window open all night. I slept so well. Thank you for your outstanding hospitality (as always!)."
2020-10-01,3,Stayed one night,cute place
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you like goats, this is the place for you. If you're not into goats, but you want a great stay near the city with incredible hospitality, thoroughly COVID safe cleanliness, in a standalone and private house, you can opt out of the furry ones and get a perfect stay as well.
Stephanie is a great host who is easygoing, and seems to enjoy getting her guests set up to be comfortable while they are around. I have nothing but praise for my partner and I's stay there."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie is a fantastic host and the place is wonderful. I wish I could have stayed more than just one night! Loved walking around the neighborhood with the goats.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie provided the most lovely place for us to stay. From watching the goats eat to watching the adorable slugs outside in the rain and the stunning shower, we had a lovely time! So glad that we had the opportunity to stay here!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stephanie's place is veey clean and cozy. Sje is a veey rhoughtful host and made sure i was comfortable during my stay. I would certainly come back again.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stephanie runs an ozone cleaner after every guest leaves. She washes every bed linen, including the blankets and the bedspread.
Good stop en route to (or on the way back from) Ruby Beach and Olympic National Park (the south-west sides of the park).
I was working from home during the week. The wireless internet was fast and Stephanie had lots of tea bags, Kashi snacks, and Lara fruit bars in the kitchen that came in handy when I was busy working. The kitchen has a microwave and a small fridge. Firm but comfortable bed for someone who doesn't like futons or lumpy mattresses.
I look back fondly at my stay here. When the air quality in the SFBA, the Portland area, and the Seattle area was horrible (among the worst in the world), Olympia was a rainy spot near the many trees of the Olympic National Park - where the air quality was perfect. A soggy refuge during some traumatizing wildfires."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here! Everything we needed was available in the rental, and the bed was very comfortable. It’s in a great location, and Stephanie gave us perfect recommendations for nearby dinner options and things to do. Stephanie is a great host, and the invite to go for a walk with the goats was definitely the highlight of our visit."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great company! Thank you!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying in this cute studio and had absolutely everything we needed. The location was ideal for us driving back from Olympic National Park and we loved saying hi to the goats. Thank you Stephanie!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Stephanie's! It felt very clean (extra important in covid times) and cozy. We got a good night's sleep and went on a fun walk through a beautiful path with the goats. Highly recommend :)
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, close to downtown, quiet."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a neat little unit in a quiet neighborhood a short drive from downtown Olympia and the capital. Not a ton of space, but the layout is very efficient and thus doesn't feel cramped. Obviously the biggest highlight was getting to learn about and interact with the goats! Stephanie was very easy to get ahold of whenever needed and a great host. Thanks!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying with Stephanie was truly wonderful! The studio unit we stayed in was very clean, stylish, and COVID-19 safe. There were fresh towels and linens, free coffee and snacks, and a very comfy bed. There was also a huge shower! Her goats and cat are so sweet and we had a lovely socially distant goat walk, which we loved. We would recommend Stephanie's home for anyone who is traveling through or visiting the Olympia area. Thank you Stephanie!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, clean place to stay, close to downtown and also to parks and trails. I much enjoyed my interactions with Stephanie and also with her cat and the two goats. Thank you!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute space with an awesome shower and comfy bed. We were on our way back from camping in Olympic NP and this was a great find. Olympia the town itself is pretty cool and overall low key comparatively. Good hospitality, fun goats, neat garden, and comfy bed. Check-in was easy and checkout wasn’t any different. Recommend starting here if you’re simply passing through or want to explore Olympia for a couple days."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a must stay if your in the area. Stephanie is one of the most accommodating and pleasant people I've stayed with. I've stayed here twice and I plan to do again. Great price and the goats are so cute and SUPER friendly!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, two room cottage with cute goats that love attention."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie is a wonderful host! She was very communicative and flexible! We had such a fun time walking the goats and getting to know the surrounding Olympia area. The house is close to a great bike path that connects you to everywhere you need to go (local food co-op, Left Bank Bakery (SOOO Good), and other fun shops downtown). She is a few miles from everything you need. The Airbnb itself is super clean and sweet, you'll have everything you need :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. What a cool place with lots of fun design details. The coffee and drink options were a great touch.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! We loved the boat house and all it had to offer! Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was a once in a lifetime experience for me. I had the absolute best birthday! The best part was seeing all the jellyfish! I hope to try to stay again before we leave this summer. I recommend this place to anyone for a staycation or if you’re visiting Olympia
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked for my parents to stay the night, since they always wanted to sleep on a boat. It was an amazing place to stay. The neighbors were friendly when they were out and about. There is also an amazing restaurant on the same parking lot. Peaceful at night with a wonderful view of Olympia. Would highly recommend. Hosts were friendly was great with communication."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun, unique stay for a night! Have stayed on a house boat before and this one was far roomier. A highlight was seeing all of the jellies in the evening! We also enjoyed eating at Tugboat Annie’s before turning in."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing weekend on the boat. Lulled to sleep by the rain and tide. Tugboat Annie’s for easy snack a beverage at Marinas edge.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! Just a quick work trip up and I was lucky enough to find it open! beautiful craftsmanship and attention to detail! cozy home on the water!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The boathouse was perfect. We were in the area for the day and need place to crash for the night. The back patio was perfect to sit out and watch the sunset. Tugboat Annie’s is right next door so dinner was a breeze. Everything was super simple and relaxing.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"everything was great, it was exactly what I wanted!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a fantastic place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great stay at Chris's house. I felt right at home when I checked. the marina is quiet and the bed is so comfortable. I would Def recommend staying here if you are in Olympia.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We live in Olympia and were looking for a fun weekend staycation. This houseboat exceeded our expectations and made for a fun and unique experience. Due to the lovely weather we were able to spend lots of time on the rooftop deck, drinking coffee in the morning, eating dinner and lounging in the evening under the sweet hanging lights. During low tide there is fun sealife visible right off the back of the boat. The amenities were plentiful and we had everything we needed to prepare meals and host my parents one night for a bbq dinner. The marina is quiet with a sweet and friendly community feel. The hosts were extremely responsive to all my communications. We hope to come back soon!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super-fun boat house and a mile away from the best organic grocery in Olympia.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely time at the floating home - only one night in a long car journey, but an exceptional one. Lovely setting, really comfortable bed and sheets, excellent lounging opportunities! Thanks for hosting us, Marian and Ian"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time even if it was way too short. The house is super cool and everyone seemed very friendly. The restaurant/bar at the marina was really good and super convenient. But the ""downtown"" area and year-round farmers market is a must and only a 10 Min drive. We can't wait to return for next dockside adventure."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorite unique stays now 💙 I originally came across this when I was out walking and it was tied to a different slip. I was so sad when I thought it was gone! I’m a tiny home enthusiast and noticed the house was well built and easy to manage! I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes you come across some weird quirky things. It was enjoyable, peaceful, & the people at the marina are so friendly. ((If it any moment you consider selling it, call me first 😅 but I hope ya’ll keep it, it’s such a gem!))
The porch is easily, one of the best features of the home. Some of the sliding glass doors will open so you can still get the breeze and water feel from inside, but still safe for children with the railing. I’ve never seen my kiddo so content! The hosts were prompt & easy to contact for any questions and concerns. Thanks again for such an enjoyable stay!
-a"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and cannot wait to come back! Thank you for sharing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely enjoyed our stay will be coming back because it was a great experience
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"this is one of my favorite places to stay. very unique, fantastic interior, super clean, and fun to be on the water. the hosts are very contentious and responsive. And it's right off the dock from Tug Boat Annie's, so terrific fish and chips, too."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Chris was responsive and helpful. Really fun and unique experience.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was really great for us. It's right next to a popular restaurant and venue, but that closes pretty early so you don't have to worry about noise at night. It's in a area where people live on their boats. It's a little rough around the edges but ... That's Olympia to be honest. And we really liked it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful houseboat is spacious, clean, and comfortable. The view is great and the neighbors very inviting and friendly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool place to stay, super clean, comfy, and unique.
Chris and Robin were extremely easy to communicate with and are excellent hosts.
Stay here and go to BITS for breakfast/brunch…. You will not be disappointed!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The boat house is really unique and it was fun to “sleep on the water.”
It’s quite evident that thought went into even the details of the place creating not only a fun space, but also fun experience.
The host is a great communicator and made navigating the stay very easy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy cute unique place to stay! I would be happy to go back. Chris was very attentive and quick to respond to my text. Great location not far from the Capital Building.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greatly enjoyed our stay! Cool experience.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! Peaceful, comfortable and warm."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The best!!! So much fun and just awesome experience! Worth every dollar! And they were so accommodating also so responsive ￼!!! Texted back in seconds and made it so easy and so just laid back and what more can I say but 10/10!!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute little place! It was nice and cozy
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming houseboat in a quiet location near a fun restaurant. Very clean place. Provided refreshments for a nominal fee. Host provided excellent instructions and was always available. Appreciated the hospitality!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super easy check in, beautiful home, comfy and spacious. Loved getting to sit up top with the lights on and relax. I cried <3"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love this charming and peaceful spot! Host was kind and communicative, getting there was clear and easy, and looks exactly as pictured. The deck was a perfect spot for drinks and coffee, the bed was comfortable, we had what was needed to make a quick breakfast, and Tugboat Annie's next door made for an enjoyable dinner. The jellyfish and birds the next morning were also a fun bonus! Would definitely stay here again.
Recommendation for my fellow night owls: the bedroom gets lots of natural light coming through the blinds in the morning, so pack an eye mask if you're a vampire who prefers a dark environment to sleep in to ;)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful spot, perfect for a quiet, peaceful respite. Well-managed and cared for. The hosts are responsive without being intrusive. I wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I have never stayed on a houseboat, an interesting experience. Unfortunately the weather kept us inside, and too cold to be on the beautiful deck!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"basically under sold if I had a ""criticism"". the house boat is more than I expected. such a great space. if you want more outings than the marina restaurant, you'll have to hop in the car. small price to pay.
if you want a really relaxing spot to just have a quiet, peaceful stay. this has been my all time favorite spot."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, and wonderfully decorated. Love that it's peppered with ornament lights at night. There are so many incredible seating options throughout the home that you get different vantages of the water every time. The close proximity to Tugboat Annie's is welcome and fun, too, especially if you want one of their many cocktails (mock or otherwise). Can't forget the convenient parking! Chris is a fabulous communicator, who is both incredibly kind and accommodating. One of my fave hosts. I recommend this experience to all!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Marina location is a drive to most things to do but, The houseboat is so cool!! It's clean and comfortable and a GREAT experience!! So much fun!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon here. Not only was is just private enough for us, but it was also just close enough to enjoy the town. The food right on the water was great for the night we didnt wanna go exploring and just stay in. the little crows feet pityer pattering on the roof was a welcomed surprise. the jellyfish in the morning got me all giddy cuz who doesn't love seeing that? ot was wonderful go fall asleep to a gentle rock of the water and listen to the waves that splash faintly along the side. we absolutely would stay here again for an anniversary. 10/10"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot. Would definitely book again. Close to where we needed to be, relaxing atmosphere, ideal all around."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Been here before and will be there again. Why stay in the city when there is this house on the water? Definitely recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming and clean! Great views and the bed was super comfy.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at this charming houseboat! The photos represent the space very well and everything about the experience was easy and enjoyable. We’ll definitely come back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay on the houseboat. We sat on the deck and watched seals play in the water, pelicans flying overhead and a blue heron on the shore. It was very comfortable and had everything we could possibly need."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just loved staying on Christopher’s houseboat! What a fun experience! (Now my husband wants to sell our house in Tucson, buy a live-aboard, and live at the marina in Olympia)! Comfortable bed, plenty warm, beautiful view of the Capitol over the water. We would definately stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This boat house get-away was perfect! The place was super clean and the restaurant right there was great. Chris was very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend this space to anyone who loves the water!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a sweet spot! we enjoyed our stay so much and hope to return. The details and finishes are so well done. super comfortable and clean.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay!! Was in town for a work trip and decided to do something different from the normal hotel stay. The house boat is very clean, has all the amenities! Bed was comfortable! Christopher was very accommodating and responsive with messages! If you haven’t stayed on a house boat before, this is the place!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Christopher’s floating home! It’s such a unique and charming space that was equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Loved the views from the upstairs deck! Definitely a worthwhile experience. And the location was super convenient to everything in Olympia, plus you could walk to the marina restaurant for drinks and tasty bites."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. It was everything we wanted.
Thanks"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying on this houseboat! It was very comfortable, had everything we needed and a good restaurant right there on-site-Tugboat Annie’s. Downtown Olympia was so close by as well as easy access to Westside amenities and Evergreen State College. We all can’t wait to come stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying at Christopher's houseboat! The location on the sound could not be better. It was so serene and peaceful, perfect for relaxing and enjoying a glass of wine while watching the sunset. The houseboat itself is incredible - so spacious and comfortable with a full kitchen to use. Overall this was a one of a kind getaway for us. If you're looking for a place to unwind surrounded by natural beauty look no further!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a super fun, unique stay while in WA— this is it. We stayed here as we rounded out our road trip around the Olympic Peninsula and we are glad we made the stop in Olympia! The city has great food and shopping and the boat made for a great hangout after touring around. Chris was responsive and proactive, and the boat has great amenities that made it a relaxing stay. There were no cleaning tasks for us which was a nice change from other AirBnBs during our trip."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The houseboat was charming and beautifully finished. The furniture is colorful and comfortable. It was well maintained. The bathroom is terrific with a unique arched tile shower. The views are amazing of downtown Olympia, the bay and the marina. We had a great dinner at tugboat Annies. It was the perfect October day for our stay. We would absolutely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was not long, but if you’d like to have a place away from home in the bay there is nothing quite like it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing! It was everything I had hoped for, and I had the best sleep ever! I look forward to returning in the summer. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love stays that are a little different, and this space did not disappoint. I surprised a friend for her birthday and just pulled up to the marina and walked her to the boat. The pictures looked great, but it was even better in real life. It felt very spacious and had everything we needed for a calm getaway.
It's close enough that I could return, and I'd love to come back and share this place with my family. It was truly special!."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely incredible and our first time ever being on a houseboat. Would strongly recommend anyone to take advantage of this.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a perfect getaway! very clean!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic and unusual spot!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christopher was so helpful & responsive, We sincerely loved everything about their home & we will surely be back ! It is by far the coolest bnb I've ever stayed at !! We are obsessed with this boat house location and vibe, thank you so much for having and hosting this incredible spot! Honestly, we were blown away when we arrived at this unique treasure and now have a dream to make one of our own back on the east coast one day!! Book this awesome home, you wont regret it and it'll be better than you expected ! So incredible!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, unique experience; fell in love with the boathouse right away. We arrived late evening and the entrance way was still enticingly lit up, the inside was welcoming and felt like a home. Every detail is so well thought through, from decor to cleanliness, neatness, attractiveness, to everyday needs of their guest. It is immaculately clean and tidy. The ambience is brilliant, even down to the comfortable temperature, inviting scents and dreamy deck. The host is very generous with a check-out time of 12:00pm so we were able to enjoy a little relax in the morning sunshine on the deck. We also enjoyed the opportunity to purchase a wine of our choice from a good little collection. All in all this boathouse is an amazing place and we feel privileged to have stayed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"When I go on any trip the first question I always ask myself is: ""Is this an experience?"" My aim is always to find the unique, the charming, the downright interesting and fun places/things/experiences.
The House Boat checked that box off completely! Not only is it an absolute odditty I would see on a listicle of unique stays - it was also comfortable, cute, and cozy.
The stay was clean, the balcony I could live on (and practically did playing cards until the sun went down), and Tugboat Annie's was a great restaurant right down the boat ramp.
I would highly recommend this place for any traveller that loves an experience and getting off the beaten path."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool spot! It was even better than the pictures. We had a lovely evening sitting on the deck watching the sun go down. Christopher was great at communicating, and they really thought of all the details that make it nice to stay somewhere. I only wish I had stayed another couple nights."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this hidden gem! Something we have always wanted to do and definitely did not disappoint! We hope to be back in the near future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a great and fun experience for us. Beautiful little house boat. Great host. Excellent (surprisingly so) restaurant literally next door. Highly recommend and can’t wait to go back on my next stay in Oly!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,This boat house was VERY cute and very homey. Loved sitting out in the back deck.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Can’t wait to visit again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful houseboat with a beautiful view. Everything we needed for a relaxing weekend. The place is beautifully remodeled, super clean, and very cozy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was brief but no less lovely. We found this unique opportunity to stay in this home and my husband and I were beyond pleased with our choice. The home was just adorable, so clean, so cute, the patio was gorgeous, the view of the capital was a huge bonus. We wished we had stayed longer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My partner and I enjoyed our stay here! It was beautiful and peaceful. Christopher was a great host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed are stay here and loved the restaurant that was in walking distance. Christopher was very responsive and gave clear instructions for check-in and check-out.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay on the houseboat. The place was beautiful and clean. The views on the water were great. It was a great stay and we would recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris was a great host! It was a fun experience to stay at the boat house.
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat is darling, but should be located in a nice marina…. The neighbors boats were basically like living by the homeless. Nice restaurant and bar was the saving grace. We made the best of it, but left a day early to come home to a much better view…. Christopher was an amazing host, with a very quant houseboat. Ha- happy we made it up and down the stairs in one piece after a few drinks ;)"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat was a nice change from usual places to stay. Pleasant deck outside for eating and viewing birds. Absolutely no privacy from each other or nearby people, but that’s typical of boats, I imagine. Nice shower, nice bed. Close to town. Overall enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super fun experience! Beautiful deck to spend the evening. Saw a heron and a sea lion.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was seeking a place to fully relax and disconnect- this place was exactly that. I spend the majority of the time on the rooftop lounging in the sun, reading my book. It’s peaceful and relaxing. It’s definitely a unique stay, but felt super comfortable. The space was larger than expected and felt like a home away from home. It has everything you’d need and was nice and clean. Super easy to find and directions are easy to follow. Communication was quick and responsive. Thank you"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Definitely a unique experience! We arrived later in the evening after a day at Mount Rainier. Even in the dark it was easy enough to find - the marina's lighting and signage were helpful. We walked in to fresh cut flowers on the counter (very nice touch), with contact info and instructions on a paper next to them. There was a fairly strong smell that may have been the cleaning chemicals used, but otherwise everything was great. The place was beautifully decorated!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts for the house boat in Olympia. Peaceful and quiet. We drove from Kansas and we would definitely stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the houseboat! Clean, comfortable and cozy. We saw the full moon over the capital building from the upper deck. Beautiful and peaceful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! We saw jellyfish, clams, seals, starfish. It was so peaceful at the pier. Loved the deck. Very accommodating owner. My husband said this was a very memorable trip!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and unique. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here 3 nights and loved it. The place is very clean and in a great location with a restaurant in walking distance. You can tell the owners go out of their way to make it a great experience. Will stay here again next time in Olympia.
2023-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was unsatisfactory for a couple reasons: cleanliness and smell.
The major cleanliness issue was the portable air conditioner, which was sitting in a tub of water full of pink and black bacteria when we arrived. The drain was clogged, so instead of fixing it, the AC was placed in the tub.. The AC unit itself was dirty. Outside tables had food encrusted on them. There were numerous spider webs inside and out housing spiders.
The smell was putrid. There were 8 air fresheners in the small houseboat: 4 in the small bathroom, 3 in the salon and 1 upstairs. The air fresheners added to the smell instead of masking it. This smell was only in the houseboat, the dock smelled fine. I grew up boating in Puget Sound and am familiar with the smell of water and tides, this was the houseboat.
We cleaned the AC tub, opened windows to try to air it out and swept away the webs. We stayed 1 night instead of 2 due to the smell."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Cool experience
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed on one of our last nights in the PNW, and this was probably the best overnight stay we had out of five stops. Sitting on the deck reading books, overlooking the capitol, surrounded by seals, kayakers, and jellyfish. This was so relaxing and a unique place to spend the night. One of the highlights of our trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot! Cute house with great amenities. Stayed one night ate at tugboat Annie’s which is in the parking lot and it was great! Couldn’t ask for a better location!
Would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous space! They really thought of everything.!! The pics don’t do it justice. The outside space was twice the size we thought and inside was bliss!! Unique, but we felt right at home! Already told the owner we will be back!!
Didn’t even mention the harbour seal!! The view is stunning, they really have thought of everything!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was fun to get to stay in a houseboat. The houseboat itself is very comfortable and we definitely took advantage of the deck. We also enjoyed a good meal at Tugboat Annies. Was a fun place to stay for our time in Olympia!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"what a wonderful stat! super well appointed, beautiful design, fun environment. Defeat at tugboat Annie's, and keep ane eye out for seals and huge jellyfish 🪼. wish we could have stayed more than one night !!!! 10/10 recommended 👌"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I couldn't say enough positive things about this amazing, mind-blowing stay at the houseboat! every aspect was amazing, from the location to the style to the amenities to the comfy bed to the patio.... we were able to watch heron, otters and jellyfish while sitting on the deck and reading, all with a view of the capitol and the mountains in the background."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely, relaxed two nights on the houseboat. It is perfectly situated in a quiet area with views back toward the Capitol building. Super fun to be there over the 4th and watch the many fireworks shows.
The restaurant in the parking lot, Tugboat Annie’s, has good seafood and burgers and such so no need to go anywhere. The lighting inside was great for going up and down the stairs after dark and the place was filled with thoughtful amenities.
Completely enjoyed our time here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"More than worth the money! Low-key but high-quality accommodations and location. This was the PERFECT place to come to wind down and be alone after our wedding weekend. It was so quiet and peaceful, but also only a mile away from all of the convenience and amenities of downtown. Having the alcohol available for purchase in the fridge was a brilliant touch! Book your stay ASAP. I will definitely be recommending to all my people!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful adventure to stay on a houseboat! We got to see seals and otters, we rented kayaks from Tugboat Annies, and it was so nice to grab a drink and sit up on the deck in the evenings."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The houseboat is spectacular! Nice space & layout. Bed was so comfortable, I watched a movie & fell asleep. Great little weekend getaway!!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A fun place to stay for something out of the norm. Very quiet and peaceful location
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am beyond grateful for the night we spent at this location. It was beautiful, peaceful, and exceeded my expectations. They paid such attention to details. The sheets were so soft, the kitchen was beautiful and the hosts were amazing to work with!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time on the houseboat. I really wish I could’ve stayed longer! It’s perfect and I will definitely be back. The bed is super comfortable and all the amenities are exactly what you need. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This boathouse is SO cute! Marian has thought of everything. It was super clean and comfortable. Air conditioners and heaters on both floors. The view of the city was lovely at night. There is a restaurant right on the marina so you never really need to leave to area. We also enjoyed a cute cafe up the road for breakfast. This was our first time on a boathouse, but we were suprised at how nice the bathroom and shower were! We never ran out of hot water and it was updated nicer than most other airbnb's we have stayed in. Highly recommend this rental. You won't regret it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so amazing! The pictures did not do it justice and the experience of staying on a houseboat was worth every penny. I can’t stop talking about what a cool place this was.
It’s a quick drive to the downtown area and there is a cute restaurant/bar right in the marina parking lot that you can walk to.
The host really thought of everything, including offering beer and wine for a small fee for convenience.
I hope I get to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful day on the water!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest little floating home with all the amenities you’ll need for a comfortable, relaxing stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Olympia houseboat was the perfect overnight getaway. Beautifully designed, comfortable and spotless with many unique features. The top deck outdoor lounge was a favorite spot to share a picnic and soak up the sun. We enjoyed the marina and capital views with lots of seabird action. The marina is a quiet location to recharge after a hectic week."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Very easy to get to and find. Place looks just like the pictures and had great views. Located close to downtown and right by a restaurant in the marina. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"So amazing! Had an incredible time here. The houseboat is so clean, with everything you need. It was very well thought out. The location is just perfect. Beautiful views of the city, but so peaceful and quiet. The boat was nice and warm, which is perfect for this time of year. The hosts were all very responsive and were able to accommodate an early check in and check out. Already missing the boat and hope to come back soon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We loved it! Had a beautiful views! Close to downtown restaurants and different places to go! We spent the days going to different national parks along with Seattle. Great location to able to go to the different sites. The house boat was amazing. It was super clean and just as the pictures showed! For sure will go down in the memory books! Will not be disappointed!! We LOVED IT!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice relaxing weekend getaway spot.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book it. Book it now! I originally selected this booking because the idea of a houseboat was a quirky way to spend our anniversary weekend, but I didn’t expect anywhere near the quality experience we had. The photos do not so this place justice. It is immaculate! Sitting on the upper deck watching the lights of the city over the water was absolute heaven. It is just a quick drive to the Olympia Farmers Market and tons of fun little shops. There is a great little restaurant in the marina, just steps from the home. Try the milkshakes, you’ll thank me.
We can’t wait to book another trip."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t wait to stay here again! The house boat is so clean, spacious and all around cute! The shower was hot, fresh and inviting. The sound of rain beckoned morning naps and evening laziness. Just a delightful space! Loved the option of being able to help myself to some extra amenities, having a restaurant right there, and a quick drive to all things food, explore and shop. The ducks, geese, fish and birds added to the overall enjoyment. Grateful for this option while staying in Olympia!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is fantastic! They think of all the details and extras that you could possibly want. I’ll definitely be coming back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve always wanted a houseboat experience and Marians little nautical oasis more than delivered! It was way roomier than expected and the decor was fun and modern without being overly beach/nautical themed. I particularly liked the smart tvs ( one in the main area and one in the bedroom ) and the large upper level lounge deck with comfy furniture and fun lights was unexpected and perfect for sunning or stargazing! Thanks again, I can’t wait to come stay again soon."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a perfect stay! The houseboat was absolutely beautiful. The hosts were really kind and communicative. Just lovely!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just left but are already scheduling another trip to this houseboat. The host is proactive with communication and responds to messages very quickly. The space is clean, smells nice, and has everything you need. The marina is quiet and we loved the view from the deck. We had a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the floating house was adorable and very fun to stay in. it had everything we needed. we were there on a Wednesday night and the restaurant nearby Tugboat Annie's had live Irish music and nearby Tugboat Annie's had live Irish music and that was additional surprise
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I rarely spend much on lodging, but the houseboat was worth the splurge. It was peaceful and tranquil. So clean and had everything needed. Will definitely return when I can go to Olympia Farmer's Market and have dinner on the houseboat. Only note, not fault of Marian, dock gets really slippery when it is raining."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and fun to stay here well cleaned and nice to stay in
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great weekend oasis!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found this boat house and I booked my trip to Washington, so glad I did. It is it cozy and stylish. Wonderful experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat is relatively spacious and well equipped. We cooked dinner there one night without problems. The downstairs stayed warm with the heaters. The upstairs was on the cool side, but that came with the benefit of some of the soundest sleep I have had in some time. The houseboat is close to downtown Olympia and its numerous coffee shops which made it easy to head there each morning for breakfast. The best feature of the property, by far, was waking up each morning and watching the birds (cormorants, mergansers) diving for their fish breakfast in the water around the boat."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay at the little boat house! It was very cute, area was nice and quiet, team was responsive to questions I had. I would definitely love to go back"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat is very cute and clearly a labor of love - as the remodeling and decorating are well thought out. We visited during a cold snap of only 20 degrees and the space heaters couldn’t quite keep up, however the hosts bent over backwards resolving the issue. We will definitely return - in fact plan to in June!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at the houseboat! It was so cozy and comfortable. It has everything you could imagine needing; condiments for cooking, extra blankets, wine and beer you can purchase during your stay! It was a chilly night in the low 20s but they provided lots of blankets and two space heaters that kept us warm all night long! Can’t wait to stay here again!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive to questions with helpful suggestions. Location was nice an quiet. However we were there in February, and there are many other boats around so it could be busier in warmer weather. Layout was great with a nice outdoor area. The power got tricky for a bit, but nothing we were not told about. Just avoid running too many items at once. Overall I would recommend it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the place...nicely appointed.....i would gladly stay again!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marian’s airbnb was cute, peaceful and comfortable. We stayed for a night on a trip up the coast. We even booked the same day as check in and everything was made very easy for us. We would definitely recommend Marian’s place."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marian's stay was extraordinarily tranquil. We had a nice time cooking and relaxing on the water. The cozy stay was a short 7 minute drive into town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute stay!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique experience! Beautiful views of the bay and capital in the background. Quiet and peaceful location. House was comfortable and cute.

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat was clean, quiet and had a great view of Olympia. The marina was within our price range."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I absolutely loved our houseboat stay! There was plenty of room to move around, the wifi was fast and strong enough to handle my work Zoom meetings, and the hosts were very helpful and responsive. We would love to come back for longer!! Thank you for an incredible stay!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had an amazing stay at the house boat. The hosts were incredibly accommodating and helpful. Such a cool experience and so unique Would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing stay.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique experience, well worth it."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Tons to do just a few miles away, but a fantastic restaurant is just a quick walk through the parking lot. It takes a minute to get used to the boat rocking, but at the same time, hearing the rain on the roof while resting in bed is priceless."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place is absolutely adorable and has beautiful views. it was a bit chilly inside, but then one of the wonderful hosts brought us a space heater. they were so helpful and communicative. we will definitely be back."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A unique stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot recommend highly enough--houseboat is adorable and surprisingly spacious, kitchen and bathroom both well-stocked, plus the setting is impossible to beat. We woke every morning to see a great blue heron take up his shift on a neighboring barge; saw seals bobbing in the harbor; and in the distance the state capitol loomed in the morning mist. We will be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay aboard Marian’s home! Communication in advance and throughout was clear and quick. Check in was easy and instructions on finding the home clear.
The space itself was perfect - equipped with everything we needed for our girls escape - coffee/tea fixings, comfy beds, and an amazing view. We didn’t cook (walked into downtown Olympia for dinner - a few miles but well lit and side walked most of the way), and kitchen seemed well stocked with basics. Hope to come back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really fun over-night stay in this super cute houseboat. The location was quiet, and easy to get to. Great view of the Capitol building and lights of Olympia! It was very cozy and clean. We only wish it wouldn't have been raining so much so we could have enjoyed more time out on the upper deck--but that's Washington in November for you! Definitely recommend this unique listing!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a great experience! It was beautiful and unique! Great location!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Houseboat was clean and well stocked, and the unique nature of this rental was certainly an appealing factor. For my first house-boat stay this was an enjoyable one. Hosts communicated well and were quite accommodating of my guest needs."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great area. Smooth seas
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and cozy! Excellent communication from the hosts. Tugboat Annie's was a great spot for dinner - took a slice of cake to go and enjoyed it on the deck while admiring the Olympia skyline. Absolutely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Olympia!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,As advertised! One of kind experience.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful houseboat, well maintained and clean and comfortable. The hosts were excellent communicators and answered all questions.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marian’s houseboat was a really cool spot and wonderful stay-definitely worth it!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This houseboat is everything! Loved how spacious it was and all of the little details, especially the lighting (living room, bedroom, deck, and even in the shower had interesting lighting options!). Super unique stay and very friendly, responsive host. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a cool float home B&B all to yourself, don't hesitate, book it!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Never knew I wanted a floating house until now! One of our favorite Airbnb experiences. The design of this home is stunning with details from the lighting, railings, and bathroom that make this a work of art. All of the hosts are wonderful and attentive. We had the pleasure of meeting Robin at their coffee truck too! Everything about this experience was amazing and could not recommend this space enough!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within the marina and a unique experience. We enjoyed the deck with views of Budd Harbor and the Capitol building. Easy access to town too. Very nicely thought out interior space, clean and pleasant space to spend our time."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"easily the cutest place we've stayed at in Olympia. immaculate, comfortable, and a great view from the deck. the food at Tug Boat Annie's, just a few yards away, is also pretty dang good!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve always wanted to stay in a boathouse! We’re so happy we chose this one, because it is incredibly well appointed and maintained. We loved cooking in the spacious kitchen then savoring the meal on the deck while they sun set, the city lights twinkled and the moon rose."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fantastic. So clean, so fun, decorated in such a cozy and intentional way with the lighting and use of space. Awesome tv, comfy furniture and bed, plenty of blankets and towels and even wine available. Great hosts! I was offered an early check in and late check out without even requesting it. I never had to ask for anything because it was all communicated clearly in the beginning. I would love to stay again for a bit longer."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Marian's floating home is so cute! It's bright, clean and well supplied (soap, paper products and coffee were all there for our use). Communication with host and co-host, Chris, were excellent and check-in/out was a breeze. It's about a 5 minute drive to Capital Lake and the down town area - so close to all the things we wanted to do. Having Tugboat Annie's right there was also a plus..We thoroughly enjoyed hanging out on the deck with a glass of wine watching the sites. West Bay Marina is a bit run down, but don't let the initial view upon arrival sway you. The people are all very nice and friendly and it's very quiet at night. We really did enjoy our stay In this lovely boat house."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great get away!! Lots of cool extra’s! Saw some jelly fish!! Bed was comfy! Couch was comfy!! It was the perfect retreat!! Communication was awesome! Definitely staying here again!!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay on this floating home! It is beautiful and has everything you will need. Communication is terrific, and check-in easy. We wish we could have stayed longer, or forever for that matter!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really unique place to stay, the floating home really has the wow factor! Extremely comfortable, everything has been thought of and taken care of. The location is maybe a 25 minute walk downtown, or 5 minute ($10) Uber ride away, so you'll never feel too far removed from Olympia. Overall, I'd totally recommend this place, and the restaurant next door!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Delightful little boat house! Beautiful view and fairly quiet, especially for a weekend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house boat was everything that we wanted and more! The pictures are accurate, the communication with the hosts is just the perfect amount. We loved this house so much we want one of our own! Thanks, Robin, Chris and Marion for an awesome getaway! Only downfall is we wish it was longer!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent and unique spot for a beautiful Olympia stay. The floating home is truly charming, thoughtfully appointed and set up beautifully to enjoy gorgeous views on its awesome deck.
A couple of things to note: The house is moored at an active marina with relatively few other house boats and a number of live-aboards. It’s neither a top-end marina, nor a dump. Expect very close neighbors (though the house has plenty of curtains and blinds for privacy), and a fair amount of boat traffic. Nothing bad - We very much enjoyed our stay - but worth knowing.
Highly recommended. Great stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay here for a true Washington vibe. The floating house is charming and cozy with so much attention to detail. Olympia has so much to offer in its downtown. So glad we got to experience it.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had the opportunity to stay at this amazing boat house!
The Host Marian was very accommodating! The house was very well taken care of and had a great appeal to it!
We loved our stay,hosts where quick to respond through text if we needed anything or to answer a question. I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Olympia! Try something out of the box !
Way cool"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a fun place to stay. The rooftop deck overlooking the Capitol was fantastic. I had one of the best nights sleep I’ve had in years! Will definitely be returning.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a really love stay at this houseboat. I had always wanted to stay on one and the experience was great! Such an incredible, peaceful view from that deck. I soaked it up for many hours and did not want to leave those seals behind. Would recommend!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a unique, lovely home. We loved sitting on the deck taking in the views. Place was super clean and there were thoughtful extras - like lots of towels and extra blankets. We enjoyed being able to walk over to Tugboat Annie's for a bite and to rent kayaks."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place to get away. Sitting on the deck each night with wine and dinner was perfect!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t miss this well appointed, comfortable, unique space with amazing views! Being on the water was magical! The views of the capital and Mt Rainer from the deck were inspired. We kayaked and also enjoyed the restaurant at the marina. It was a fabulous experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in Olympia for a memorial service and staying on the houseboat turned a sad trip into a sweet memory. The host was lovely and generous. We appreciated all the attention to detail. Loved being on the water with a view of the Capital dome.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This floating home is a dream. Beautifully decorated and furnished, with everything you need, and you're on the water! I loved the gentle rocking every once in awhile, seeing seals out the window, and the gorgeous sunsets. Great experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay on the houseboat was pleasant and easy. Plenty of communication from the owner and the living space is comfortable and well organized.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay on the houseboat was unique, cool, fun, and ultimately too short - I was just beginning to enjoy the marina life when I had to leave. Great views, comfortable bed, super clean, good layout. I enjoyed sitting out on the deck/patio and seeing great blue herons and seals, plus the amazing view of the water and state capitol. Parking was easy, and the marina folks were friendly. I will repeat something mentioned in other reviews - Marian is a thoughtful, caring, and excellent host. I would love to stay on the houseboat again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so much fun and Marian was a great host!!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not say enough good things about this wonderful Houseboat!
It was spotlessly clean.
Kitchen was fully stocked with all the dishes, cookware, etc
The outside deck is the perfect spot to enjoy the sunsets, watch the wildlife, relax, enjoy morning coffee and a good book.
The owners have obviously put a great deal of thought, planning and creativity into the design of everything on the houseboat. Beautiful inside and out!
Super quiet at night.
Would be a perfect place for a vacation or remote workplace."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This boat house is amazing! It is immaculately clean and the attention to every detail is incredible. The home also has A/C which was a god send during the time I spent there. Highly recommend, the owners are very attentive and the location is super!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing boat, great location! We had such a good time and can't wait to come back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were traveling for 2-weeks and were mostly looking forward to our stay in the boathouse - and the boathouse did not disappoint! The small sea life in just the immediate area was really fun (i.e., jelly fish, seals, and various fish). Having a great and friendly restaurant and some local boat owners nearby proved handy when needed and added a sense of security to the quiet area. Marian was helpful and very generous. We hope to stay again in this beautiful, unique, and creative boathouse, only longer! We couldn’t get enough of it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Marian’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighborhood the houseboat is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This houseboat was perfect in every way, it was spacious, clean and had everything you could possibly want for a stay. The outdoor deck was beautiful, perfect for meals looking out over the harbour with an incredible view of downtown Olympia."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The floating house was an amazing experience! Clean, spacious and had everything you needed! Only thing is, boat would gently rock when walking around so if you get motion sick easily, take meclizine! The comfort and uniqueness of this home made the gentle rocking worth it. Not to mention, our host gave us a gift card to the pizza place la gitana and we got to try some yummy pizza. overall, I loved this houseboat and would def come back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay on the water! Kitchen and bathroom has everything you’ll need! Peaceful getaway!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house boat in a great and quiet location. Perfect for a weekend getaway.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! It was different to stay in a houseboat but very comfortable. Had a fully stocked kitchen, living room, nice views, easy access to the house. Close to downtown Olympia but far enough where it was quite peaceful in the marina. Would highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Clean and quiet will definitely be back.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for two days at the houseboat for a fun break for our drive to Seattle. It was definitely a unique experience and fun way to see the Puget Sound and the capital (there’s a great view from the upper deck at high tide). The boat was very accommodating will all supplies you could want or need. The shower surprisingly had great water pressure but as Marian instructed, the showers need to be quick due to the size of the hot water tank. Marian was a wonderful host and had great communication during our stay! We had one issue with the smell of gasoline inside the houseboat and Marian sent his business partner immediately to inspect to ensure everything was in working order. The marina does have some unique smells at low tide. We were able to enjoy dinner right at the marina at Tugboat Annie’s while there and also Anthony’s hearth fire grill which both had wonderful views of the water! We would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is heaven on the water. It’s a very very cute, modern, and clean house that’s also a boat! Waking up to wildlife was so joyful for us- the bird life was abundant. We loved the deck and seeing the full moon rise over the capital. The bed was cozy and the couch was just paradise! We loved the little electric fireplaces, the unique shower, and the views!
I will be real and say, it’s a boat- you can feel the motion of the tide at times. That wasn’t a problem for us at all- I find myself missing the gentle motion now that I am firmly back on land. Just want folks to be aware as it could be an issue for some…
Also, I rarely say this but one of the best parts about this Airbnb was the host! Marian made us feel so welcome and offered real kindness that made our stay super special. It’s obvious that the hosts love this place and care about making it feel like a retreat.
We can’t say enough good things about this place. Until next time…"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were visiting friends in Olympia and decided to try something different. The houseboat was perfect for us. It is beautifully decorated with great finishes. Everything is as described. Marian always responded promptly and was great to work with. I would recommend to anyone who wants something other than a basic hotel room.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, comfy bed, wonderful host! Unforgettable experience."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great !!! I would do it again 😇
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marian was very friendly and responsive and although we didn't need anything during our stay, I know she would have helped with whatever could have come up! The house boat was the perfect size for two and in a great location!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Get thee to this houseboat, folks! As an avid traveler, I have experienced everything from Exceptional to ""Turn Around Now"" Scary! This place exceeds expectations. From the moment we arrived, the well-designed, well-equipped and very inviting, newly renovated floating vacation home is a delight. To add to that, you're floating! We were constantly drawn to the ever-changing water and wildlife around us. It's an unforgettable experience.
Finally, our hosts were thoughtful and responsive. They anticipated our needs and made us feel ""Welcome."" Be assured that the atmosphere, location and hospitality are at least a 10 out of 10!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little cottage right on the water! Great for a romantic relaxing stay
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This is a cute cabin right on the water. The patio sits directly above the beach. I wasn't expecting the steep stairs and lack of yard for the dog. The cabin is a bit dated but quiet and definitely off the beaten path. I would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Million dollar view! It’s such a quiet and peaceful location. A great escape from the big city. Highly recommend staying here.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend Meagan's cabin! We stayed for one night, and I just wish we could have spent longer to do some kayaking and wildlife watching.
The bed is incredibly comfortable, the kitchen is impressively well-equipped, and the views from the deck (and whole cabin, really) are top-notch. It's quiet, private, surrounded by nature, and cozy.
Definitely recommend staying for more than one night if you get the chance to book this magical cabin. :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying right on the water, it was beautiful!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful!! The place is right on the water...the deck actually hangs over the water when it's at high tide. Tons of natural light with beautiful sunrise views. So appreciate the two kayaks being provided for use. Great shoreline for sea shell hunting too. Would definitely go back for a longer stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful little get away. Right on the water. Private and peaceful with the sound of waves to lull you to sleep. Just perfect.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Meagan was very helpful in answering all of my questions. We were coming into town for a wedding and she was very accommodating with an early check in which was crucial. She brought us some champagne glasses to celebrate our anniversary and the stay was seamless and wonderful! We are counting down the days to come back!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful bungalow on the water. It was clean, spacious and secluded. Would love to stay here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what a slice of heaven! my pup and I were able to rest and relax after our big move, and the fast Wi-Fi worked great for working from the cabin. it was lovely hearing the waves under the cabin at night and walking the beach was fun too! we will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed twice at Meagan’s place and have had a great experience!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is beautiful and private. Had a fantastic time using the binoculars to look at Mt. Ranier, eagles, and seals from the balcony. If you are looking for a nice, quiet place to enjoy the Puget Sound in private, this is the spot for you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"How do you even begin to summarize getting to stay in the closest thing to heaven on planet Earth? The pictures don't do it justice. Meagan is an amazing host and a fantastic communicator. If you're thinking about getting this place, do it. It's by far the most peaceful AirBnB I've ever stayed in."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Meagan was wonderful and even had the house ready early for us. The pictures do not do the home and view justice. The setting is private, peaceful, and romantic if that's what you're going for. We would have loved to stay longer."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great hosts. Very helpful and supportive and a special location. Absolutely recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is awesome! Even with some unpredictable spring weather we still got enjoy the great views from the porch and the beach at low tide. It is a perfect weekend getaway spot to just enjoy a book or watch the sound. The host was very responsive and check in was easy. It was very clean and comfy, with plenty of kitchenware for cooking."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location! A little slice of paradise hidden away and also reasonably close to town. There’s something special about staying in a place that’s been apart of airbnb for such a long time. We really enjoyed ourselves and appreciated the little slice of heaven that’s shared by Meagan.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very private cabin on the Salish Sea. In room fireplace and deck overlooking the water.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location. Great amenities. Would book again if in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was beautiful and peaceful. we would definitely go back!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is technically in town and only 15-20 minutes to downtown but feels like a total getaway hideaway type place. When you stay here you don't need to leave and in fact make sure you book this place for a couple nights because you won't want to leave. Very nice and cozy place with everything you and the main highlight is the water which youre right on top of which is very soothing and very beautiful view from all of the glass windows and such. Wifi and TV for streaming worked great, all appliances you would need and take full advantage of the beach when the tide goes out in the afternoon. Any time of year this place is super awesome, nothing like a sunrise over the puget sound. Host was also great communicator was very friendly. In conclusion top marks on this place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful property. The pictures are good but the reality is even better. Very picturesque and very quiet. Literally right on the water and in a beautiful forest. I hope to go back soon! Very relaxing.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place! We enjoyed a beautiful valentine’s! We’ll come back on summer for sure!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic location! Right on the water, very private, amazing views. 10-15 minute drive from downtown with plenty to do. Lots of great walking trails nearby. If you're looking to stay in/ near Olympia, you won't be disappointed staying here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to de-stress! The instructions to the place were detailed enough to find my way there even at night, and the steps down to the cabin were well-lit and easy to navigate. The beach cabin setting right on the water was so beautiful and peaceful, a great cozy place to just hang out and talk all day if you don't want to go anywhere. Inside was tastefully decorated, with a nice kitchen and good heating system. Thank you, and I hope to stay there again soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful little spot! We definitely plan on returning when it isn’t the middle of the PNW winter to enjoy that deck. Regardless of the rainy and cold weather (which we knew was likely in January) we were warm, cozy and comfortable. The cabin is small but very well equipped and smartly arranged- we had everything we needed.
Watching the fog and rain roll through and the tide changing was beautiful. We even lucked out with a perfectly timed break in the clouds our last morning. The sunrise is INCREDIBLE at this little cabin with Mt Rainier visible from bed! Super secluded and private but close enough to town if you want to head out for dinner. We also took the drive up to Hamma Hamma for oysters for the afternoon.
Already planning a return, which I think says it all!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I got away for an overnight, what an amazing beautiful space! It was pure magic!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Megan's place is a little piece of paradise. It's a cute little studio with a small kitchenette and a separate bathroom. It has lot's of glass windows so that you can enjoy the breathtaking views of Mt. Rainier and the Salish Sea! It feels very private and you are right down on the waters edge with a private deck. We loved everything about this place. The bed was very comfortable and the gas fireplace added such a nice cozy feel during the colder weather. Megan was very responsive whenever we had any questions or concerns. We are 75 years young and did not have any issues with the stairs. We would love to come back for a longer stay. We would highly recommend.
Thank you Megan!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome stay again! Despite the record cold temperatures, the space remained cozy. The surroundings of the water and acreage are tranquil and wondrous.
Meagan is very kind and responsive. Thank you for opening your space to us again. Wishing you and your Ohana a fruitful 2024! 🤙🏾📿🧘🏾‍♂️"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very excellent experience and beautiful place to stay. The host was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Megan helped me pack all our stuff to the cabin and made me and my 2 year old feel right at home. I highly recommend this place to stay that is if I haven't already booked it! 😊
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful little place right on the water, instructions were super helpful to get there. It might be a little tight getting out if you have a truck like we do but we made it work. The inside was adorable and the porch is awesome!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying in this gem of a place. Wonderful to have coffee in the am looking at the Salish Sea. Our dog did very well here as well. Try to pack light as there are many steps to navigate. Well worth it. Deb & Jose (Bend, OR)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute peaceful a one right on the water. Stayed here for a weekend get away for my partner’s birthday in December, was great to cozy up next to the gas fire place and look out over the inlet. Would love to visit in the summer to make use of the paddle boards- the beach is just steps away!
The cabin is tucked away down a private road but Meagan provided helpful directions to find the cabin."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and peaceful location! My husband and I spent a wonderful night enjoying the amazing view and scenery! I highly recommend!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the most amazing opportunity to get out of the city and spend quality time with my daughter! Meagan was responsive, friendly, responsive, and fully invested in ensuring we had the perfect stay. The view is absolutely incredible and cannot be beat. This little cabin is such a sweet oasis. Thank you so much for a perfect weekend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This listing was amazing. The views over the water and of Rainer were incredible. The listing is very comfortable with outside chairs and a small couch. Its not very big but would comfortably house two people. I absolutely loved watching the sun rise while in bed. The giant windows looking out over the water were amazing.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan is Awesome!
Great Host.
We keep coming back! (4x)
Love her place.
And she’s super sweet!
Thank you Meagan"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This place is peaceful, charming, cozy, private and has everything you need. The views are to die for and under rated in descriptions. Even tho the stairs are spoken of and pictured, didnt realize how steep they are. Were in our 70's and active, otherwise I dont think we could have been able to manage them. There are another 10+ stairs to get to the beach. All is workable and the place is pet friendly, but I would think twice with big dogs. Megan is a wonderful host, was easy to reach and stayed in Contact for any questions we had. We enjoyed the visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a relaxing stay at Meagan's place and loved having the beautiful waterfront views right at the balcony. Having the kayaks to free to borrow made for some fun outings on the water too. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is absolutely stunning. Its incredibly quiet and peaceful. The ocean is right underneath the balcony at high tide! It's cozy little peaceful space.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a beautiful special space to stay! Meagan was a great kind host!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Beverly Beach cabin is one of the best airbnb I visited.
Very relaxing and peaceful settings, tastefully decorated, spotless.
Maegan is a wonderful host, accommodating and responsive. I couldn't have asked for more."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Beverly Beach House was one of the very most relaxing times we have ever had, anywhere! The location of this studio cottage is on a beautiful bay of the Puget Sound looking directly across at Mt.Rainier and also down to the State Capital building. The deck juts out over the beach and, when the tide was in, we felt like we were on a ship. We also had the feeling of being in a tree house, with the privacy that the trees provided.
The apartment had everything we needed and was very tastefully appointed. The bed was perfect.
Lazy days and kayaking ( supplied by the host), what could be better!
Also, Megan was very helpful and, though honoring our privacy, was very responsive to our usual kinds of requests. I enjoyed our satisfying conversations.
We WILL be back!!!!!!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I booked a random solo trip with my dog for my birthday! This place was exactly what I needed! Felt a deep sense of tranquility, wonderful scenic views from waking up in the morning and reading on the deck! So much wildlife passing through, loved seeing the seals poke their heads out of the water!
Just a few minor maintenance issues but Meagan was very quick to respond and addressed the situations.
And as the description says there are a lot of stairs! Very steep and big incline. I’m in ok shape but the stairs reminded me I need to keep working out. Haha!
We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place that we would definitely come back again to. accurate description of everything and the setting is amazing next to the water with mountains in the background.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super host! Checked in but allowed you your privacy!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our weekend at the beach house! The studio is exactly as described and very affordable considering the water front access. We loved bringing our dog along and even took him out on a kayak for the first time. It was so cozy and we’d definitely recommend it to friends!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! The location is very quiet and peaceful. It’s such a cozy little spot with an amazing view. Bed was quite comfortable too!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! We had a wonderful time and would love to go back! If you are looking for a peaceful getaway this is the place! Plus definitely go down to the beach and comb for some shells!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at this hidden gem. Thanks Meagan!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great private space. Save time to read the guest book as we did because some guests left local recommendations and it was fun to read about a couple marriage proposals that happen there.
I think I recall the listing stating that there are steps to get to and from the cabin and there is a picture showing those steps, but make sure you are comfortable with LOTS of stairs because if you have bad knees, the steps will take its toll, especially with luggage. That being said, even with my less than perfect knees, I would stay again. Such a unique place :-)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, quiet, peaceful and relaxing cabin with an amazing view. This place was clean and had everything necessary to make you feel at home!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is an absolute gem! We had a wonderful stay.

Our stay couldn't have been better - would definitely recommend to others!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely will be back!! The perfect getaway trip. I still have dreams of waking up to coffee & morning yoga with the ocean☀️pure bliss!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are so happy we canceled our hotel and found Meagan’s place! The property is very private. The kitchen space was perfect for us. Our dogs loved sitting on the porch. Bed was comfortable and Meagan was so helpful. Amazing value!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful spot right on the water. You even get a straight shot of Mt. Rainier. It’s also 15 minutes from downtown Olympia, so it is the best of both worlds.
We can’t wait to come back during the summer and kayak on the sound."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely amazing to fall asleep listening to the sound of the waves on the beach and wake up to the sun rising over the water and mountain. It was a lovely surprise to watch the sail boats racing by Saturday morning and the holiday boat parade the previous week. Cupboards were full of plenty of spices, coffee, and tea. Meagan was a very friendly and thoughtful host. 100% would stay again and will be telling all my friends to stay here!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This studio was a wonderful spot to stay for a few days. The view of the bay was incredible, especially at sunrise. We loved watching the harbor seals and birds. Easy ~15 drive into downtown Olympia. Also appreciated having access to kayaks! Lovely spot - thanks for sharing it with us!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Must stay. We would sit on the deck at night with the light off just listening to the sea lions eating and swimming around. such a cute place that was so well designed and equipped.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a relaxing getaway this place is it.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Right on the water with great views of Mt. Rainier, sunrises and sun sets. The deck is a magical place to hang out with great views of Mt. Rainier, sunrises, sunsets, and all of the cool wildlife that lives in the water. The location of this place is awesome, too. 1.5 hours from Seattle, 2 hours from Mt. Rainier, 1.5 hours from the base of Olympic National Park, and 1. 5 hours from the ocean. Meagan is wonderful. She is a prompt communicator and someone who truly wants your stay to be the best it can possibly be. This is truly a slice of heaven."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beverly Beach House is magical! Perfect place to relax, enjoy the beautiful views from every angle. Spectacular sunrise and deck views perfect all day. Lovely accommodations, perfect place to unwind and forget your daily life. I will definitely return. Hostess was always available for any and all questions. Loved my stay !"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan and Peter’s place is magical. The setting is so peaceful and gorgeous! It is best to be aware that you may want to pack on the light side as there are 36 steps down ( and therefore up ) to and from the cabin!. There is good storage space and the decor is as lovely as the hosts are. Great communication. The absolute best part are the views from inside and from the deck! Great location, comfy bed,.we hope to go back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great waterfront location with a fantastic view and deck, saw seals and ocean birds, lots of shrubbery and trees surround cottage, adjustable blinds cover front windows, sliding glass with screen at back entrance door, nice bathroom vanity and shower, nice kitchen set up, smaller refrigerator, well equipped, nice recessed lighting above kitchen area, convenient outside steps lead down to water, switch to control outside lighting that illuminates parking area and steps down to cottage for after dark, very peaceful and enjoyable stay, hosts are very kind, respectful and in providing privacy,"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome cabin right on the water! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the house had everything we needed. Meagan is a great host who is quick to respond and provide detailed responses, whether it is for directions or local restaurant recommendations."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cosy little cabin right on the water's edge. Great views of the ocean. Far enough away from the city to be serene and silent, but close enough that we could drive to downtown for dinner. The cabin had everything we needed - right from cooking implements, books, and tea for lazing indoors to kayaks and rain ponchos for adventurous jaunts. Meagan stayed in communication with us throughout the trip in case we needed anything. Would definitely visit again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So many good things to say about this place. The view was so beautiful, the cottage was cozy, the beach walks healing. We had everything we needed and we highly recommend this little magical place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved our stay at Meagan's place. The location was sublime and so quiet and still; the deck overlooking the sound was very private and comfortable. We appreciated being able to be downtown in about 15 min by car and then back in our sanctuary to watch the moon rise. The bungalow is beautifully appointed and very cozy, and Meagan was one of the kindest hosts I have encountered. I cannot recommend the space more highly, and we look forward to returning."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay here! Meagan was helpful and responsive. If you’re looking for a place to get away and relax, look no further. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much, you were so accomodating!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place for two! Everything you need to have a wonderful weekend! Honestly, not a single thing to say bad about this place! Sitting on the deck was the best, hearing the water under us when the tides were in. <3"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a spectacular little cabin!!! We LOVED our stay! It was the perfect spot to take day trips to Olympic National Park and the coast. But our favorite day was spent on the deck of the cabin enjoying the view and watching the sailboat. Meagan was so great and responded quickly with any questions we had. Thank you Meagan! We will certainly stay again if we’re in the area!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views! I rented this cabin for 3 days and already I can't wait to return. The views can't be beat, and only 12-ish steps from the water so it made for nice afternoon walks. The cabin was nicely appointed and very clean and quiet. everything I wanted and more!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful stay! The cabin was well-kept, well-furnished, and clean. Meagan was very helpful, making sure I had everything I needed and recommending some great local spots."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view, very comfortable, great location!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at a studio on the water before somewhere and knew this would be perfect for me and my husband. Had everything you need: view, sunrise/sunset, comfy bed, bathroom with necessary supplies already offered, towels etc , kitchen had everything you need. Very easy to find too. Fabulous peaceful place to relax after a long day of adventure. Owners communication is fantastic. Thank you again for a first time stay in Washington from us Georgia folks. Also for exploring travelers: we stayed for 3 days. Seattle was only an hour drive. Mount Rainer a two hour drive. Olympic National park an hour- went all the way to Forks & La Push total of 3 hours there and back. This was a perfect middle ground and downtown Olympia is also super cute."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Meagan's place. It was small but had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and it was a treat to wake up to the sunrise over the water each morning. We enjoyed the amazing view from inside the cottage and on the deck overlooking the water. The private beach was great for taking walks along the water's edge. The path down to the cottage is so pretty with all the lights. My only concern was parking our vehicle because it was a tight squeeze getting into the space. I was worried we might back into something but there were no problems! I would highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and relaxing stay on the water. Beach is rocky for much walking, but Evergreen State College is close by with some really pretty trails."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful spot, peaceful & private!! Great communication with Meagan - she was super helpful! Having the kayaks really made a lovely day on the water! Definitely returning!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, private, quiet getaway on Budd Inlet. Host was very helpful, easily communicated with, quick to respond or relay needed info and was a pleasure to rent from. The property is an excellent opportunity if you are looking to get away for a few days and disconnect from things. Your ability to do so to whatever level you desire is real here, with an excellent host! Much appreciation for our time spent here and looking forward to another trip some time in the future."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One could not choose a better rental. Small space that uses every inch and doesn't feel small. The view is mesmerizing. Already booked our return.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was THE perfect place to go as a solo traveler or couple - and your pup! Being so close to the water/beach, having access to kayaks, and watching the sunrise over Mt Rainier were some of the best parts of my stay. The full (smaller sized) kitchen was a big plus too in case you want to just stay put and enjoy the surroundings. (There's a great hiking trail from the Evergreen State College campus down to Geoduck Beach that was a nice find close by.) Meagan is a wonderful host and was always easily reachable during my stay. I would highly recommend staying here (I've already told many friends about it!) and would definitely stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found what we were looking for-privacy, quiet, close to the beach, access to kayaks, cozy and comfortable. perfect get-away from Seattle for two nights."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location with incredible views. This adorable little bungalow is a true gem. Amazing panoramic views of the sound and conveniently close to downtown Olympia. It was cozy, clean and private. Couldn’t recommend it more!! Meagan was a wonderful host!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan is an amazing host!, she’s very accommodating and understanding! And on top of that, the location is beautiful! It’s perfect for a relaxing getaway. We’ll definitely be staying again in the future!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredibly relaxing weekend at this Beverly Beach home. The privacy this property offers is the true value here. The windows overlooking Bud inlet provided great views during the sunrise/sunset. The kitchen has everything you would need to cook a meal and the coffeemaker with complementary grounds was an added plus. And when the tide is low, walking along the shore was quite fun. Would recommend even for a winter getaway."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable, amazing views, warm, and quiet. My husband and I were looking for a quiet place for our anniversary to relax and unwind, and this was it. Meagan is amazing and so easy to get a hold of when needed. She was also great at reaching out when the weather was getting a bit rough and about possible power outages. Thankfully, no power outages! We loved our time here! Thank you, Meagan!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looooooved it!! Absolutely beautiful view. Amazing place
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely comfortable stay with the sound of ocean right out the back door. Meagan is a great host, and her clear instructions make for a stress free stay. If you need a weekend by the water to relax, this is the place to stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely beach house is the perfect getaway. The view is amazing, and the coziness is unmatchable! If you’re near Olympia or on vacation you should definitely consider staying here. Downtown is only 15 minutes too, and theres some great places to eat nearby like Well 80 brewhouse and Uptown to name a couple."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan’s place is perfection. Meagan helped us out in a big way and met us before we even arrived to help jump our car when the battery died when we stopped to stock up on food. Getting there after dark, we were met with a glorious sunrise and a view of the mountain the next morning. Meagan was incredibly helpful and communicative the entire time. Our pup loved lounging on the deck, getting in some great sniffs, and going for some great swimmies right outside the place. We loved Meagan’s spot and hope to be back again soon!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Totally wonderful place!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"directions to the place we're easy to navigate, Meagan is available anytime for communication and she was a great host. the cabin is exactly as described and a perfect get away for any couple it's not very big but it definitely fit perfectly for our needs w will definitely be booking here again next time!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Meagan's place and would stay again. We were in town for a trip to The Ridge for races, so our only complaint is we were gone all day and didn't get to enjoy the place as much as we would have liked. But, it was more than enough and comfortable to come home to shower, enjoy the sunset and moonrise over the water from the porch, and rest after long days! Meagan was very communicative when needed and accessible. We happened to travel during record breaking heat-she and her husband did what they could to keep us cool. We would recommend and stay again! Thank you Meagan and Pete."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, excellent accommodations, and fantastic communication.
This place is what airbnb is all about. Cannot recommend it enough. 😍"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, clean, right on the water to enjoy. Quiet community with great view of the stars. Even better than the pictures. Everything you need for a relaxing getaway. Meagan was communicative and responsive, and friendly. Gave great detailed instructions. Will be returning and recommending."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was exactly what I hoped for. Cozy, quiet, and beauty.
Enjoyed being tucked away in the cabin and easily venturing out for a quick hike or run to town.
Thank you for having a beautiful spot!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Meagan’s place was a great getaway and the views are certainly worth it! We enjoyed exploring the beach and watching the wildlife from the deck. If you’re looking for a place to relax this is a great spot.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed a three night visit which did not disappoint in this cozy little cabin on the bay. It was January and the weather was a little too cold to just sit on the deck, so I really appreciated the wall-to-wall windows for enjoying the spectacular views! The little cast iron fireplace provided the perfect ambiance in the evenings. The cabin decor is stylish and the bed/bedding is very comfortable. The full-size bath tub was sparkling clean and nice to relax in. My husband appreciated the tall, wide shower head, (which is sometimes an issue for him when we travel). Our hosts went above and beyond by promptly assisting us with a dead car battery on our first day there. I’ve never had a host answer messages so quickly, also offering lots of suggestions for places to visit in the area. We enjoyed the local Bayview Thriftway store for our groceries. But those views though! I had many of my Facebook friends ask me for the listing just based on the pictures I was posting. It’s rare to feel like you’re literally staying right above the water with the sound of the waves! 🌊"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect for what we were looking for. Wonderful get-away from Seattle. Great location, kitchen had everything you need to cook at home, and Meagan was quick to respond to any questions/needs that we had. Loved the free use of the kayaks and that the place was dog-friendly. Morning breakfasts on the deck overlooking the water were heavenly."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, very cozy. Highly recommend."
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The deck and views from this little beach cabin are wonderful! Access and parking are challenging so be ready to navigate your car down tight roads and be prepared to negotiate lots of steep, uneven steps to get down the slope to the beach house. Our host, Meagan was kind, communicative, and gave us ample privacy for our short stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Meagan was an amazing host! She was prompt with communicating and we arrived to a very nice clean space. The view was beautiful and it was nice to have a warm fire to turn on after star gazing or walking on the beach. I would highly recommend this place to others and would come back myself!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,What an amazing location! Absolutely beautiful. And Meagan was a great host. She even offered me a jacket and boots in case I needed them :)
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views and a super cozy beach house!!!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views from the beach house were stunning! We were amazed at how quiet and peaceful it was. There was a Tv with a DVD player, and hotspot internet. Though we didnt use either much as the views and surround area were spectacular. Meagan had many thoughtful touches in the beach house. Small kitchen items and equal exchange coffee were a few. The space is small, but perfect for making small meals and enjoying each others company. We enjoyed our stay and will be back if our travels ever take us near the area again. Thank you Meagan!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and cozy studio right on Budd inlet in Puget Sound. Fantastic deck right over the beach. Enjoyed morning bird watching and evening views of Mount Rainier with the full moon rising. The place was well stocked; we had all the kitchen equipment we needed. Meagan was an excellent host."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"World class views at moderate hotel room prices! I had to book this trip at the last minute due to unforeseen family events and I couldn't have found a better deal. In the same price range as hotel rooms in Olympia, the Beverly Beach House provided a quaint and private experience with the aforementioned views just 15 minutes away from downtown. Meagan was attentive but not obtrusive and her flexibility and understanding allowed me and my visiting family to connect and enjoy our time together. Your neighbors include plenty of deer and the occasional seal swimming on past while you get to take in amazing views of Mt Rainier over Budd Bay. If you're looking for a quiet oasis from the traffic and noise, this is the perfect place for you. Thank you Meagan!
Will Leque

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and special place near the water. We would always come back. Very recommendable. Great hosts. Thank you very much for special days.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Beverly Beach House! We enjoyed the spectacular view of the water with Mount Rainier showing up some days when not covered with clouds. It was a great place for relaxation for me and my wife -- very peaceful and refreshing. There are many beautiful parks with wildlife around the area for hiking. Our wonderful host, Meagan, was very responsive to our needs and very quick to answer our questions. The studio is very clean and the kitchen is well stocked for cooking. We liked the wall-to-wall windows along the water view and deck. This place is highly recommended!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When staying at Meagan's cabin, you can expect great views, a great host, and an awesome place to stay. Everything you need for your trip to the Seattle area is provided in the cabin. If you are considering staying here, choose this place!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sooo relaxing didnt want to leave. Excellent host
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan was a thoughtful host, quick to respond and very kind. The beach house was delightful with a view of Mt Ranier that was to die for. Strongly recommend this little gem!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magical!!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AWESOME! Meagan contacted us prior to our trip to let us know the weather conditions. Asked if we needed anything before we arrived. The pictures do not do any justice! Growing up in Washington and now living in California this place almost makes me want to come back home! The view and the water and on the final day of our stay Mt. Rainier showed herself. It had been snowing and raining the days before. Do not pass this little gem up! Meagan thank you again. Btw. I never got to read what my girlfriend wrote in the book. But she did take a picture of it. So maybe one day I’ll know
Mark"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great peaceful and quiet location. We loved watching the seagulls and few boats pass by. We enjoyed walking the waters edge with our dog while the tide was out and sitting on the porch listening to the water as it hit the barrier wall below us when the water was in. Mount Ranier greeted us in all her glory when we arrived. The mornings were foggy but brought another level of serenity to this special place. Highly recommend it if you want peace and quiet. Olympia is a short drive and we headed over to the farmers market for some fresh steelhead and oysters. Meaghan our host greeted us with some lovely local wine! We will definitely come back again.
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and peaceful place and easily to get to downtown Olympia as well.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful spot and hosts! The view here is amazing. Loved watching the tide and boats going by from the glorious deck. Meagan and Pete are super friendly and responsive hosts. I was lucky to spend 3 weeks at this studio, and hope to return sometime. Great experience."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures are awesome but dont do this place justice.
It's absolutely breathtaking.
This place is a gem.
Floor to ceiling windows to not miss a moment of the views from inside or sit on the deck with bay doors.
LOVED IT!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not hesitate to book this beautiful relaxing space with amazing views! It is exactly as pictured and well stocked if you like to cook while away. An added plus was the small BBQ on the deck. The deck is also the perfect space to unwind or relax and read a book. The beach is very walk-able and if you kayak there are many enjoyable areas to see launching right from the cabin. Lots of bird life on the shore with the occasional seal swimming by :)
The town of Olympia is a close drive to stock up on what you need during your stay. Don't miss the great Farmers Market downtown!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Treat yourself to this beautiful space. It was perfect in every way. Just can’t say more than that.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan was wonderful at communicating with us all along the way. Her directions were detailed to perfection. Beverly Beach House is incredible. Tiny, cozy, warm, with an incredible view. Everything you need is there and it's close enough to town if you need a little civilization. But truthfully...we never wanted to miss a second of the peacefulness of this place! Thank you, Meagan!!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely perfect for our wedding night. It was peaceful and secluded and the balcony overlooking the water was fabulous. The view of Mt Rainier across the water was really nice. I'd like to say something negative so the place is available for when we go back again, but I can't."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is hard to overstate how perfect of a romantic getaway this place is. It was our second time here, and I didn't know how it could have been better than our first visit, but it was! We had been in December, and even though it was cold outside we had the amazing fireplace going to heat us up. This time, the weather was perfect to have the double doors open with the fresh air rolling in. Honestly I don't think we've ever stayed anywhere that was more conducive to unplugging, relaxing, and just spending quality time together. I HIGHLY recommend Beverly Beach House! Bring a book, a bottle of wine (or enjoy the fantastic wine that Meagan has waiting) and unwind. We will absolutely be back!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,this was the most beautiful place I've ever stayed and THE MOST delightful airbnb experience I have had to date. Thank You Megan
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a getaway from our overwhelming electronic world that we live in. Come escape for a few days to a place of peace and privacy. The views are breathtaking, along with the walks on the beach. Have fun."
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy house was perfect for a romantic two-night getaway! We walked in to a very clean, adorably decorated place with a bottle of wine to welcome us! The gas fireplace was wonderful and heated the room up very quickly. When the tide was up, we felt as if we were sitting on top of the water. There were games, movies and cds to play. We walked along the beach and met some nice people who had just purchased a home down the way. It's a quiet, friendly area. We would go back for sure. Thank you, Meagan!"
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first airbnb trip, and honestly, we couldn't be happier. Everything was even more amazing than we had hoped. The room was perfectly clean, and had everything we wanted and more! It was very private, cozy, and quiet. Down to every detail in the cabin, everything was of high quality. From the super warm down comforter on the bed, to the awesome espresso machine (I'm desperately going to miss). Meagan was great, and happily accommodated our requests to make sure we were comfortable. The view is absolutely incredible. Even though it rained most of the time we were there, we barely noticed. We just cranked up the fireplace next to the bed and sat out on the balcony. We were even lucky enough to be there on the weekend they had a Christmas boat parade! This is truly a gem, and we will most definitely be coming back!"
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Beverly Beach House was amazing! Great views, cozy atmosphere, and everything we needed. Meagan was a great host and was in communication all the way up to our visit. We knew she was just a text away so it was not necessary for her to check in on us. The perfect amount of information and privacy. I would definitely stay again and recommend to friends/family traveling in the area."
2015-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I (and our puppy) recently spent a couple of stormy nights at Meagan's lovely Beverly Beach house. The house stayed warm and cozy and we loved listening to the rain and watching the sound. The home was well equipped for our short stay and we would enjoy staying there again.
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome property, very clean,
cozy and well equipped for a getaway. Quiet location in the forest yet 15 mins to downtown Olympia. Towels, shampoo and basic kitchen items provided like salt, oil, coffee and napkins. Exceeded all expectations."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was wonderfully tucked in to the trees of this peninsula and then opened up just enough along the beach to place this perfect sized small cabin-like home. The driveway is one of a kind and beautiful - only to be matched by the long walkway of 35 ivy covered steps to the doorway of this clean and comfortable small, one room cabin. The cabin is made up of one comfortable queen size bed in the center of the room but it is surrounded by a small dining table in the picturesque windows over the bay, a modern kitchenette, and an electric wood stove for chilly nights! The full bath is clean and stocked with essentials! I loved finding a bottle of local wine on the table with two wine glasses ready for visitors to enjoy and relax. Venture out onto the patio and enjoy the bay views including wildlife and sailboats and evening city lights. A magnificent find for a quiet calm weekend or vacation getaway! Perfectly set above the water and the sound can lull you to sleep! Loved this location and plan to visit again!"
2015-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little beach house! All the comforts needed, right on the water. We loved walking the beach during low tide. Would definitely recommend to family and friends."
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it! So beautiful, I felt as though I had fallen into an oil painting. Everything was perfect, right down to the Super comfy bed. Meaghan even found a local gym we could train at & was so helpful offering to assist with the kayak should we wish to venture out. If I ever make it back, I'll definitely stay again."
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Beverley Beach House is wonderful and a lovely stay. We will be coming back!
2015-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I love the beach cabin. It is well taken care of and has everything I needed for a week long stay. Meagan is friendly and helpful and I will return for sure.
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend trip here was fantastic. We were looking for a place where we could completely unplug from the world around us. The home is very well put together - an adorable deck with a duo chair, a cozy bed with a stunning view, and wonderful dimmable lights.
Meagan was friendly, easy to communicate with, and provided us with just the right amount of privacy. We would recommend this getaway to our family and friends. We can't wait to go back!"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our short stay here. The 180 degree view is fantastic, and the neighborhood is incredibly peaceful. We hardly saw anyone else during our midweek visit. Meagan is very friendly and helpful, but respects your privacy as well. It's a cozy little cabin with just about everything you could possibly need and some unexpected extra touches too! We enjoyed taking the kayaks out on the calm waters, picking blackberries along the beach, reading and relaxing on the deck and watching the tide come in and out. Less than 2 hours from Seattle and just minutes from downtown Olympia, but we felt like we were another world away. We'll be back!"
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great. It was the perfect way to end our trip through the Pacific Northwest. Quite and cozy and very relaxing. Everything was so clean and the view and sunrise was amazing
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meagan was very welcoming and even helped me with my baggage. She has every single thing you could want or need available, even an expresso machine and snacks and wine. Believe it or not, the accommodations and setting are exactly what you see.....absolutely gorgeous! This is the ideal get away. Yet, it is easy to get to and accessible to town, even though you don't feel like it while there. On a clear day, Mt. Rainier is an added treat."
2015-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great house- it's just like the pictures (other than the rain, which I really liked). The kitchen is well stocked, bed is really comfortable and a really quiet location. It was exactly the kind of get away needed for 1 or 2. The steps are not for the faint of heart.
Thanks for the great time!"
2015-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Beverly Beach House was even more beautiful than described. It was the most romantic, cozy setting. We really enjoyed sitting out on the porch and watching the tide come in and out. The view is spectacular. We walked the shoreline, we played board games, and we grilled our own dinner. It was the perfect getaway. Meagan had a bottle of wine waiting for us and a beautiful fruit basket. She was great at communicating with us throughout the trip. We also tried two of the restaurants recommended by Meagan and they were both wonderful. We will be coming back for sure!!!!"
2015-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is small, cozy, and situated in a near magical setting, through the forest to a private waterside nook on a perch, facing east so you can see the sunrise behind Mt. Ranier, fog permitting. Listing is accurate. Meagan was a fine host. Would visit again."
2015-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a lovely time at the Beverly beach house. It was beautiful peaceful and magical. It was the perfect little getaway.
2015-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I spent New Years Eve here and it was such a great getaway! We lucked out with the weather and had an amazing view of Mt. Rainier from the house. The space is very quiet and cozy and while it is a small space we were very comfortable here. We would definitely stay here again.
2014-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute and quaint cottage on the Sound hit a special spot in our hearts. We could spend all day sitting on the deck that overlooks the water, walking along the seashell filled beach, or warming up by the fire. Honestly, one of our favorite places we have ever stayed. Thank you for the wonderful hospitality, which even included a bottle of wine, coffee from the Olympia coffee company, oatmeal for breakfast, and lavender shower essentials. We will be back very soon and dreaming about it until then."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A private oasis nestled among gorgeous trees & flowers, but within minutes of walking distance to downtown. Pantry well stocked for cooking meals. It’s a lovely place to relax comfortably both inside as well as outside on the patio."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,So comfortable!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy stay in the chill Eastside neighborhood of Olympia. About a 15 minute walk to the heart of downtown and very convenient to I-5. The space is rustic and feels a little bit like staying on a boat (in a good way). Great for two people, or a clipper with one kid."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place that is close to town. No problems and the Host was very nice! I would be happy to stay here again if I was in town.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The gardens are just lovely this time of year!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very sweet, boat-like, cosy, hideaway walkable to many nice parts of town."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ellen's bungalow is a gem! We love the cozy rooms and hand-crafted woodwork. Her decor is thoughtfully selected to reflect the period of the architecture. Absolutely loved the recycled chalkborad slate used as tilework. The only potential drawback I can see for others is the low ceilings, but we were charmed by the small spaces. The abundant garden makes it feel more private. Very comfortable beds!"

We enjoyed the almost two weeks spent there and hope to be able to return the next time we're in Olympia."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place walking distance from downtown Olympia. Kitchen had almost every cooking/food prep essentials you could need. The beds were very cozy and the overall feeling in the place was peaceful. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Olympia!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little bungalow close to downtown. Unique and peaceful accommodations that had everything we needed for a short stay. The grounds are beautiful and there’s even a friendly cat! Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Olympia.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bungalow is simply sensibly set up. I stayed there several times for multiple reasons - it has a room that can serve as a separate bedroom for my kid, while I have the master bedroom. It has a well-equipped kitchen with everything you need to cook - there's not just a full gas stove, but a toaster, a toaster oven, etc. You can supply yourself here if you want that. There's a spacious shower that works well. There's air conditioning to keep the place cool, a gas oven to keep it warm if needed - fit for all seasons. Washer and drier - this can be a real home base away from home.
The place is also nice, with opportunities to sit outside, shielded by apple trees and bamboo from the street - and it's not a busy street. And yet you can walk on foot to downtown Olympia or uphill to shop -it's a nice neighborhood, we walked it many times.
Ellen herself has always been responsive on short notice when we needed something, a friendly host that respects your time there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place and so much bigger than we expected! Such a great deal too, would happily come back!"

Spot right in town thank you"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This little house is lovely! We had a quick night here and truly enjoyed our stay. Ellen was responsive and helpful when needed (even popped right down to deliver an iron when asked). The property feels secluded while also being walkable to downtown and there’s plenty of street parking. And the added bonus of meeting Dinah was a welcome surprise as we had coffee on the patio. Definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very cozy and sweet bungalow.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ellen's bungalow was a treasure to find! The unique architectural features and comfortable space were just what we were looking for. I was able to get my toddler setup in the twin room just fine and he slept great! The outside patio area was perfect for socializing with family after the little one was asleep. We were able to walk downtown no problem and took the free bus back when we didn't feel like walking. Will absolutely be staying here again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little bungalow in a good location.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying with Ellen in Olympia and both times she has been a great host! This spot is well situated to walk to downtown but still on a quiet, peaceful street."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, peaceful retreat near downtown that feels like it is worlds away from town. The bungalow was spacious, and was plenty of room for our family of three.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! As soon as you walk in, the house felt like a warm hug. It was the perfect place to recharge after a lot of traveling! Ellen was awesome and super helpful. Would 100% stay again."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,g
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow was so very charming, the landscape gorgeous. Out if all the airbnbs I have ever stayed in this was hands down the most comfortable bed.

Ellen was very communicative and welcoming. I look forward to my next trip to Olympia!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stay was wonderful, comfortable and clean."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Ellen responded quickly to all my questions. The Bungalow has an authentic Oly vibe with many separate spaces. My daughter could work remotely in one room while I read by the fire. We were there in January and the gas fire was so nice to sit beside on a cold winter morning.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A comfortable private place in a great location for downtown or the capital.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Easy access to all that we needed. Cozy, comfortable and plenty of space. It did not have a TV which was a bit of a bummer one day. That’s not something I double check when looking at the description or amenities. So it was my fault for not seeing it, but would have been nice to have a small one in the living room. Ellen responded very quickly when asking about check in. Also, a friend rented the cottage behind us, that Ellen host, and it was super cute and spacious as well. I recommend staying here when traveling to Oly!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ellen is easy to work with and very communicative. This is a lovely place to stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for letting us stay at your place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is just a fun place to stay in general very fun just to go sit in all of the different little rooms and cute spaces with lots of pillows to snuggle up and read a book! It’s similar to the back unit too which I’ve also stayed at in the past which is just as awesome too! Very cozy all around and very awesome in the summer with a lot of rustic spots to hang out outside! Highly recommended and Olympia is great!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The bungalow was very charming! My family of four only stayed for one night but it was perfect for us!

The place was clean and comfortable!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Bungalow was such a cool experience and unique place - it was very clean and also in a great location. Ellen was also a fantastic host - she was communicative and very helpful. We left an item at the place and she mailed it back to save us time! I would highly recommend this Airbnb for everyone!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hidden gem! When we stayed, it was hot, so it was like a little oasis with all the lovely plants around the place, and the AC was a welcome relief! Super cute bungalow. It has everything you need and it makes the best use of the space. Loved it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a cute clean place to stay. It is surrounded by bamboo and trees which kept us fairly cool and secluded. The bathroom is very nice!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with lots of character. Ellen was really responsive and helpful. Would stay here again without hesitation.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful cottage, nestled in a lovely garden. The entire living area is surrounded by window seats. Very clean and every convenience is provided. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This bungalow is so cozy and cute. The garden is beautiful and makes you feel like you're in a botanical garden somewhere. Loved all the windows and the bathroom. Just a short walk away from some fun restaurants in downtown Olympia so we got a nice feel for the neighborhood. Definitely a perfect spot for a couple on a road trip through Washington or just a weekend getaway.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed for a night during the weekday. Ellen's place was super cute! The front had a beautiful garden. There was 3 of us, and there was plenty of space! The beds were comfy, and the bathroom had a large shower. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The location of this place is good for our needs. It utilizes green cleaning products and practices, which we admire. Two of us stayed here, and while I would stay again under certain circumstances now that I have seen the place, my family member would not. To be fair, I got the main bedroom with the luxury mattress, pillows, and linens. The main bed was extremely tall, and the ceiling was extremely low. I am 5'4"" and had to jump/climb into bed, and I was able to touch the ceiling while standing on floor. I think low ceilings make me uncomfortable. I also felt really squeezed in while using the toilet. I did appreciate the lack of fragranced products in the space, as they cause headaches.
My family member got the uncomfortable twin bed in a cramped room which was missing window coverings on half of the windows, including the mostly-glass (frosted) door to the outside. They were counting on the room-darkening shades listed on the ad, and had a hard time sleeping in that room. They also thought the place smelled weird, which I had to agree with. Apparently raw douglas fir wood can give off that weird smell. Unfortunately, the smell, which was reminiscent of urine, was strongest in the small bathroom. There were two fans available for use, which helped them to sleep a little.
Kitchen and dining area had all you would need. It was stocked with beautiful dishware. It was a twist and squeeze to get into the fridge/pantry area. The bar stools did not seem to match the countertop height they were set to, unless you were a small child. The living area and library had built-in seats, made more comfy by many nice pillows.
The tiny AC unit, located in the farthest corner from the bedrooms, seemed like it would be a struggle on a very hot day. We arrived later and eventually made use of the cooler outside air.
The outdoor garden had several areas to sit and relax, with beautiful plants all around. The neighborhood was nice to take a stroll after dinner. It was a quiet residential area and we felt safe staying there.
This place is generally recommended unless you are tall or wide, or have a very sensitive sense of smell."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Ellen was so helpful and accommodating
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, charming and private with soft beds and strong hot water."

Lovely space my kids want to return!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ellen is the perfect AirBnB host. Her communication was always timely and detailed. The bungalow is absolutely adorable -- the decor is inviting and truly feels like home. Though quite close to downtown Olympia, the property feels so secluded and private because of all the plants, trees, and bamboo (and also being slightly up off the street). We stayed for a week and could have stayed forever!! The beds were comfy; the towels thick and fluffy; and the kitchen has every apparatus you could possibly need. All in all, PERFECTION. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,This little nest is perfect for 2-3 people. It is situated in a garden-like hideaway. We loved being able to play games on the table outside. Ellen has provided all the amenities a visitor to Olympia could possibly want!

Everything was extremely clean and small touches made the place feel special.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot for our girls getaway to Olympia. Sweet, warm and cozy sanctuary surrounded by trees and birds, peace & quiet. In lovely walking distance to and from town. Comfortable and good vibes. Will definitely be staying here again! Great find!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a lovely, cozy, well appointed bungalow close to downtown Olympia. The host was quick to respond and the place is sparkling clean. The gas fireplace and many windows, surrounded by flowering bushes and bamboo add to the general, warm feeling of being tucked away in a quiet enclave. We appreciated having a very comfy bed, huge shower, and being supplied with coffee, tea, milk, cream, spices, etc. The covered patio tables were an added plus. Thank you."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great visit at the bungalow for a weekend in Olympia. The home is as advertised and is small but still very comfortable.

We were just a few minutes away from the Farmer's Market and the Children's Museum. We would definitely stay again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful cozy place! Truly one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed in.
Just a note to anyone nervous about street parking: We were apprehensive about street parking at first, just considering the area’s homeless situation right now, but it’s right across from a church and we had no issues at all. It’s close to downtown, but tucked away from the main areas."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really cool spot in Olympia. We were just a couple minutes from downtown with a ton of restaurants and things to do. The home was situated in a private neighborhood and felt very comfortable. Inside was quite charming, with a lot of good seating and quiet reading nooks. Super well stocked kitchen with utensils and appliances, we'd definitely recommend this place."

It’s been craftily remodeled using secondhand materials, which I adore. The bed was so comfy and we slept like babies. Next time we’re in town, it’s going to be one Ellen’s places!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I've stayed at Ellen's place. It's cozy and comfortable, and I look forward to visiting again."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The bungalow is a great place to stay in Olympia. Close to downtown, yet in a cute, quiet neighborhood. Easy parking right in front. The bungalow is quite roomy inside.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The bungalow is a fantastic retreat! We ended up needing to extend our stay by 1 night (thankfully it was available) so this is my second review for the bungalow.
If you see this one first, I will tell you that this place is even cozier than the pictures show! We had everything we needed on our stay and felt so relaxed just walking through the door."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ellen's bungalow is just wonderful! My husband kept saying that he felt transported to serenity being there and I can't agree more.
The bungalow was clean, had every amenity we needed on our work trip, and felt like we had a lot more space than the square footage listed. I only wish we would have spent more time there instead of working, but we would definitely stay there again if we're in the area again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location & sweet space, had a great time!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice cozy spot close to downtown. The little library and game corner were so especially well considered. Bedding linens were very soft. Host helped us find the perfect spot for an Italian dinner.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a fun little getaway. Well stocked and comfortable.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Bungalow is a lovely little space, beautifully decorated and appointed with the feel of a quiet cabin, but in the heart of the city with a wonderful view of the State Capitol from the deck. A big comfortable bed, an upscale kitchen and bathroom and several places to lounge, eat and enjoy a glass of wine. Comfort, coziness and warmth are just a few words that describe this vacation get-away. Perfect place for that first, relaxing, morning cup of coffee and a book..."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Ellen’s place was great. House was very clean, great location, and well equipped. It felt a bit rustic( in all the right ways) while still being right in town. 10 out of 10 would stay here again."

Kitchen, bathroom and beds were all great and just what we needed. We wished we stayed another night!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, cozy and great location. Ellen was very helpful and kind to arrange an early arrival."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cozy and rustic, like a cabin in the city. The twin bed was comfortable, but you should know a taller person might not be so comfortable in it. Seems like a perfect place if you wanted to do a lot of cooking. Easy to get to the historic downtown, easy on street parking. Several steps to get up to the house. There's no TV but the wifi worked fine for our needs."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay! Was looking for something quiet yet close enough to downtown and this was both. Simple and clean. No issues!

2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet neighborhood. Nice private outdoor seating area. Comfy bed.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cute, very tiny space. Well stocked with amenities and most were earth friendly which we appreciated. We also appreciated the recycling bin! The gas heat stove in the living room was wonderful. And the privacy all around the bungalow was terrific! Loved the tall bamboo that surrounds the front patio. Perfect place for a glass of wine. Great little place for a couple."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Her home was very warm and inviting and close to down town. We would definitely stay there again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a typical old NW home. It’s a bit funky, solar powered, perfectly located, and had great vibes."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had another fantastic stay at Ellen’s cozy place. So glad we had a chance to come back and stay, and we hope to do so again many times in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy house close to downtown Olympia. I would highly recommend staying here.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was incredibly lovely and architecturally interesting. Very comfortable and had all the amenities that were needed. It was in a great location and close to downtown with a resident kitty which we name Lily. If we were to ever visit again we would definitely try and stay at either of Ellen's properties.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cute little cottage in Olympia! Very unique design and lovely outdoor space. The bed was comfy (and bedroom dark-huge plus in my book), great shower, and several private outdoor spaces to sit. Would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ellen’s place was so adorable!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed for eight nights in the Bungalow. It is shielded from the street, shielded from view by fruit trees. So much so the Uber Eats driver missed it twice!
Everything is as listed. A wall mounted AC unit keeps the main space cool, a gas heated fireplace gets it warm in no time. Kitchen stove works by gas, too, so does hot water.
There's a spacious shower, much appreciated. Two areas near the entrance have garden furniture to enjoy sitting outside. The home has been decorated with art and feels cozy and a bit quirky due to the many corners and storage areas, likely added over time.
As stated in the listing: no TV. Wifi works like a champ, though. You can wash and dry your own laundry on the premises, just coordinate with the host.
Speaking of host, Ellen was always quick to respond and helpful. She stocks the home well in toiletries, towels, cleaning and laundry supplies, better than other hosts.
As for noise, the street is rather quiet. If you keep the window open in the bedroom, there's some noise, maybe the AC unit in the other house on site next to it?
Area is in ready walking distance to downtown - five minutes - yet feels removed. Easy to walk to a grocery store in ten minutes. Free street parking, not overly busy.
It's good value for money overall, a great location, combining convenience with being less busy, good host, and good amenities."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very cute and cool spot, great location"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy place, and a particular benefit for summer is the outdoor dining area and the separate seating area in the evening shade. Well-stocked kitchen, which is important when still avoiding dining in public."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfy, and clean. Communication was great with quick response time to any inquiries."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great landing spot for a busy couple of days with 2 littles. Was able to be flexible with us which was helpful. No TV which was wonderful for us! Adorable little place. Loved it
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend for a quiet place centrally located in Olympia. We were close to everything but the house sits away from the road and is secluded. Chalkboard was fun and amenities were nice. Easy to self access and just a lovely little place.
2021-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The chalkboards were fun for the littles. There were also games a puzzle for them. Plenty of room for a family of four. The location wasn’t my favorite. However, the the plant life in front of the house it does feel more private. I think with a little more tlc it will be even better."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Ellen's Bungalow is very comfortable, central location for Olympia and clean."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location not only in the Olympia area but for the greater Puget Sound area as a home base while we visited family in Washington. The comfortable cabin like feel met all our needs when we needed a break from people. It provided a great little retreat while still being close to shopping and restaurants. It also had a couple of nice small patios that we used when family stopped by for a visit. Thanks again for the use of your property!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful peaceful inviting space in sweet East Oly. A real glimpse into a kind generous community. Ellen was a wonderful host and very attentive to our few needs.
