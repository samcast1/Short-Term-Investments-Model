2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous wonderful space! Very well organized and comfy as well. Close enough to things but far enough away to relax and enjoy the view day or night. Hosts were responsive and helpful .Highly recommended for anyone staying in Branson!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!! We came with plans to do many things in the area but enjoyed the house so much we choose to spend more time ‚Äúat home‚Äù‚Ä¶just the best time! Had small problem w lighting fire pit and host came right out and fixed it! So much attention to detail in this home, like heated floors in bathroom, everything so spotless it felt like brand new!! We could have stayed forever and would love to return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay is a little pricey but worth every cent. It was by far the nicest Air bnb we‚Äôve ever stayed at. They were incredible with any questions and telling us places to go. We would give them 10 stars. Awesome place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place with breathtaking views!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a getaway with my husband. The view was absolutely beautiful and secluded, yet a short drive to fun things."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful. Quiet. Peaceful. It was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. We are already talking about going back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay and are looking forward to booking again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and it was beautiful
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best Airbnb stays I've ever rented. The entire experience was so well managed. Check-in and out were well-explained and didn't ask us to do too much. It was super clean and comfortable for friends and family to stay. The only complain I have is the fire pit didn't turn on. I'm not sure it was out of gas or we just didn't know how to use it. Overall I loved our stay and we'll be coming back for next year!üòÅ
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful and serene, so well thought out and designed"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super beautiful location with an excellent view!! Directions on how to use the multiple remotes, easy to find, and saved us ALOT of time! Very cozy and comfortable especially since it rained the whole time we were there. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with, and the response time to our questions was fast and efficient. Plus she provided extras like coffee pods/creamers/snacks! All the conveniences of being at home, but in a treehouse. Will recommend highly as well as return visits! Thx Elizabeth!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time there. Home was beautiful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was such an amazing place to stay. Booked it for my honeymoon and it exceeded my expectations. The view was amazing and all around a perfect stay. Recommend 100%
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was the perfect getaway! Super unique with a gorgeous view! Would definitely recommend and cannot wait to book another trip.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunningly beautiful Airbnb tucked away in the mountains of MO. Check in was a breeze and every question we had was answered promptly. The bed was nice and soft with plenty of luxury linens provided. You can‚Äôt beat waking up to the view of the lake! We‚Äôll be back!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Far exceeded our expectations, and they were high based on the lovely photos and description! The view really is best in person and the attention to detail is wonderful! The proximity to Silver Dollar City is very convenient! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will book in future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Was pretty close to everything, you‚Äôre not exactly as alone as it seems. There will be traffic right behind your house. Which wasn‚Äôt a problem to us, we just thought the house was more off the road & more into the woods. Other than that it was a nice stay! Very pleased"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing for our little get an away. Very peaceful with an amazing view. We are already talking about visiting again. Elizabeth was amazing and answered every question quickly when getting ahold of her. What an amazing experience.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably the best airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Highly recommend for an anniversary getaway. You will not want to leave. Book it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing and this place was perfect for our anniversary weekend getaway. Close to everything but felt so private. The back deck with amazing view, comfy chairs, and fire pit table was our favorite spot but everything inside was a close second. Comfy, beautiful, private, nice amenities, and comfy beds too! We are already talking about when we might go back!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,We visited the treehouse on our 1800 mile family road trip. And the proximity to Silver Dollar City was the highlight but it is really close to the highway so it was quite noisy throughout the night. There is also another property nearby and they were having a party the evening we stayed so we couldn‚Äôt enjoy the outdoor area as we had hoped to.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse of sweet! Great view of the lake , and it was a. perfect
location for us as we planned to go to silver dollar city. My husband and kids loved the game console too."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a couple of nights - we were a group of 4 adults. The lack of counter space and storage in the kitchen would be an issue for a longer stay. We really liked the location. It backs to a, somewhat, main road, but the road noise wasn‚Äôt bad and the view couldn‚Äôt be beat! The house itself was exactly as described and looked just like the pictures. We were not disappointed in any west and would highly recommend staying here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and views !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect view--I'll definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with a lovely view. Loved the wall of windows although it did certainly heat the place up during the day. However, the windows with the view was the reason I chose this place. The heated bathroom floors were a nice surprise! Would love to stay here again in the future."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was beautiful! Exactly as pictured and perfect for a girls getaway (3 of us). Coffee on the deck over looking Table Rock was the perfect start to the morning. We enjoyed blankets and the tire table at night. The rain shower head and heated bathroom floors were a cherry on top! Also appreciate that the host already has a Netflix account logged in on the TVs.
Very close proximity to Silver Dollar City, for our purposes we were glad to be visiting during the off season. We enjoyed visiting Dogwood Canyons and other nature offerings within ~15-30 min drive.
As noted in the listing description, the stairs to the loft are fairly steep. Something to keep in mind, but a fun place to wake up over looking the water! (Loved the remote to open and close the shades with ease)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at the Tree+House! It is exactly as pictured and such a neat experience. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent secluded getaway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect, easy to find, quiet with an incredible view.
Everything was clean and looked just like the pictures.
We really enjoyed our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing. Everything was wonderful. We loved it. We will be back. Thank you so much
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay! Elizabeth was a great host and loved all the Treehouse had to offer! Amazing views even in late January and with it being off season for Silver Dollar it felt very private. Highly recommend this for a nice getaway! Also loved how close we were to coffee shops and cute boutiques to walk around and shop! Thank you! üòä
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It was clean, decorated well, the heated floors in the bathroom were really nice, and the view was great!! The hosts went above and beyond with answering questions and getting us dry firewood after it had rained. I wish it was set back a little further from the road, but this was the only negative and small one. I would highly recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of the nicest places we have stayed at and would love to come back again. The location is very near major attractions and the structure is immaculate to say the least. The windows and the lighting were great and while the overall structure is small, it didn't feel cramped and was very well thought out from the architectural and decor choices. While we visited, it was very cold, so we didn't make use of many of the outdoor features, but they were very nice and looking forward to going back soon.
The host was very helpful with the check in information as well and we had no issue with our stay at all."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, relaxing, close to everything"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, we had amazing days."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view and great area!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a unique stay at really cool location. Our family loved the large windows and view of the lake. The peace and serenity were exactly what we were looking for!
I would suggest bringing food that can be grilled. Most effective way to cook at this location."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay! Perfect place to spend our anniversary! Had slight trouble with heat but Elizabeth and Mark responded immediately and we had heat! Loved everything about the place. Also try the outpost up the street for great pizza and sandwiches!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful experience!! We spent New Year‚Äôs weekend at the Treehouse and loved every minute of it! With reservations at Osage Restaurant and a show in downtown Branson, the Airbnb was perfectly located to travel to each while still providing us with a very private, quiet location and a breathtaking view. With sleek, modern decor and extra special benefits such as a fireplace, remote-controlled blinds and a heated bathroom floor, we couldn‚Äôt have been more comfortable and cozy. Elizabeth and Mark were immediate with their responses answering any questions we had and were always pleasant/helpful. We can‚Äôt recommend this place more!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a dream come true! So peaceful and cozy, just what we needed after Christmas. Far enough away from everything yet just a few minutes away from everything one needs. Very clean, great views (we were up early enough to watch the sunrise from bed, gorgeous!). Definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful, modern home, loved the heated bathroom floors. It was spotless! The Christmas tree looked gorgeous with all the windows! It‚Äôs a great place for a couple. I would not recommend for 2 couples as it‚Äôs an open lodge with not a lot of privacy but it‚Äôs great for a couple or family with older kids. Thanks Elizabeth, lots of great memories made on our Christmas trip!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our visit to the Tree house. With two adult children it was cozy but promoted togetherness. Such a unique stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem of a place!! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. The view of the lake is great, the house is immaculate, and it has so many thoughtful touches. You have everything you need and nothing more, so it feels cozy and not cluttered. The beds were so comfy too! I will definitely be back!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place-loved it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and I greatly appreciate mark did accommodating us. Thank you again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was amazing! So peaceful & quiet with an incredible view. The entire setup was done so well; from the furniture to the heated floors in the bathroom. I absolutely loved the lil Frame TV. Thinking I need to get one for my house. Silver Dollar City was right down the road as well. Will definitely refer to friends & family. Thanks Elizabeth!
Best regards,
Dwain"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot for a weekend getaway. Nice, clean, modern space with excellent views, would definitely stay here again when visiting the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love the place and the view. Disappointed it was so close to a busy street. I did not want to hear any traffic. The inside was beautiful and perfectly appointed and complete for all our needs. For a 67-year-old, the technology was a little difficult, but could be overcome. The beds and the linens were very nice and comfortable. Just a suggestion, my husband wanted a reading lamp in the main room and better ones in the bedrooms. Thanks"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My little family stayed in this tree+house for 3 nights and it was amazing. The house was just as pictured. The view of the lake was beautiful. Close to the Branson strip. Very close to Silver Dollar City. Easy door check in. Easy to find during the day. I liked that it was hidden during the night. Tesla charger really helped us get home to OKC on a stop charge. Everything was perfect!
Only thing I will mention, that isn‚Äôt a negative thing at all, is that the drop off from the main street to the driveway was a little bit high. I only say this because my car is lowered and my front bumper scraped every time we left. Yes, I‚Äôm the person who drives the lowered car in the mountains. Haha.
No negatives! All positive!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay with the most beautiful views. Would recommend this home to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend this to everyone we will definitely be coming back this place should be voted #1 Airbnb in Missouri
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection all around! What you see is exactly what you get. Cleanliness was outstanding. Thank you for a wonderful, relaxing stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place! We already booked for next year! Everything you need is right in the house. The view is incredible yet it‚Äôs super close to Silver Dollar City. Can‚Äôt wait to come back next fall!!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"No oven or dishwasher, so not the best for baking if you‚Äôre looking to stay in. Excellent view and gas fire on deck. Additional bonfire at ground level. Steep stairs can be tough to navigate at night for single bathroom. Comfy beds, heated floors, nice linens. Can even hear the nostalgic Silver Dollar City train every once in a while. Peaceful & pretty quiet considering it‚Äôs right off a busy road. It looks like more units might be going up eventually? Responsive, great host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stunning place like no other. Incredible views. Very clean and as advertised. Would love to visit again someday!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the treehouse. It was perfect for our annual girls weekend. We enjoyed both fire pits, were able to cook pasta on the small cooktop, and the sunrises and sunsets were perfect. Great location to pop over to silver dollar city to walk around and see the Christmas lights and a short drive over to big cedar for our spa day. We‚Äôve already booked our stay for next year!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we hoped for and more! Very clean, cozy, and the view was outstanding."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Views were amazing!!! Enjoyed the fire pit area and privacy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I rented this house for a sabbatical. It was perfect! Quiet, peaceful, yet close enough to other needs.
Great spot!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place to spend a peaceful weekend! Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was very clean, the place was easy to find. Very close to SDC and not far from shopping and dining. The Lakeview was stunning !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a beautiful tree house with an equally as beautiful view! we had a wonderful, relaxing stay here. a great unique place that feels secluded but not too far from all the branson fun."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse was perfect for our family of four to get away from the hustle of normal life. It was easy to find, clean, and everything matched the description! The view from the back deck is spectacular! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and everything about our stay was amazing. It was a perfect distance from everything, yet felt so private. The view is gorgeous, and we saw so much wildlife out the huge windows! I would suggest staying here to anyone. So so worth it !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. Everything was exactly as described and you cannot beat the location. The property is easy to find, the view is spectacular, and furnishings were quite comfortable. The hosts even had snacks and coffee available for us to enjoy. Our girls loved the loft area and watching the birds each morning. If you are in the Branson area and want a relaxing get-away, this is the place. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a weekend at the treehouse and I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about this place. We wish we could have stayed longer and we enjoyed every moment there. First of all, I was surprised by how close it is to the road but yet you feel completely private and isolated. Yes, sometimes you do hear the cars passing by but that didn‚Äôt bother us at all.
Then, you walk through the door and it is absolutely stunning with all the light and the floor to ceiling windows. It is beautifully decorated and very clean. The bathroom has heated floors which we loved and the two shower heads were magical.
Everything was very clean and the bed that we slept in on the main level was quite comfortable. The deck and the surroundings are so nice. We loved the gas fire pit on the deck.
I could go on. We would return here in a heartbeat. Mark and Elizabeth are wonderful hosts and were very responsive to any questions or concerns that we had. I would HIGHLY recommend their home!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was so beautiful! Great local restaurants. The home was immaculate and clean. Really enjoyed the space! There were only two things I‚Äôd change - the hot water didn‚Äôt stay hot for us to both shower back to back. The other thing is the street noise can be loud at times. Otherwise it was gorgeous!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous! We celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful time. This place is just minutes from Silver Dollar City and other Branson attractions, but feels so secluded when you‚Äôre inside. And the view! Wow! If you‚Äôre considering booking this place, do it. You‚Äôll be so glad you did."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning treehouse home with beautiful grounds and impeccable lake view. Very clean and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceeded our expectations. Very modern and great views
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to celebrate our anniversary! Even better than we thought it would be. Very clean and comfy. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy place with an awesome view of the woods and lake beyond from its balcony and inside through the enormous floor to ceiling glass windows!
Close to awesome trails and activities.
Comfy bed, small but well organized kitchen and plenty of towels in the nice and clean bathroom!
And to top it all a Tesla charger! Made our trip much easier!
Just couple of things ‚Ä¶ blinds on the 2 side upper windows would be nice during hot days.
And a way to recycle.
But overall really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend! üòÉ"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could rate this place a 10 star I would. I really don't have the languageto describe how beautiful, peaceful an Ah-mazing our stay. my husband and I had the mostamazing time here. The pictures do this place no justice, it's
even more beautiful.
Elizabeth was a great and responsive host.
I will definitely recommend and stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth & Marks place was a dream! We were lucky enough to celebrate my boyfriends birthday here as a getaway & we both loved it. The home itself is well thought out, clean & exactly like the photos. I appreciate the coffee & extra blankets. The scene of the lake & woods was stunning and a total change up from our day to day in southwest Florida. We were able to see lots of birds & deer while lounging outside. Elizabeth was extremely helpful for the few questions we had during our stay - mainly just questions due to me being new to Airbnb & wanted to make sure we checked out properly. She was so kind & helpful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a treehouse getaway. Branson Missouri is somewhere I‚Äôd love to visit again & would choose to stay with E&M!
10/10"

For the perfect stay in Branson, the Tree+House is the ultimate spot!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tree house was spectacular!! Stones throw away from Silver Dollar City but tucked away and out of the fray. Amazing views and immaculate housekeeping! Thank you for sharing this beautiful spot. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Treehouse looked exactly as it did in the listing photos. Had everything we needed. Views were incredible! One of the coolest places we‚Äôve ever been!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love short get aways and this has been the nicest and neatest place we have stayed at. Everything was better then described and pictures don‚Äôt show how nice it really is. Had to about drag my wife out of there on the last day. Communication was great from the time we booked all the way to the end. We are 8 hrs away from this place, but can‚Äôt wait to go back anytime there is an opening for a few days."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very unique! Extremely clean and beautiful view of Table Rock Lake. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect mid-week retreat! Close to food and entertainment but nestled amongst the trees with a lake view. Everything was exactly as pictured, and just what we needed to reset from our busy lives."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay for a family of 4. Stairs to loft were steep but nothing my 6 and 8 year olds couldn‚Äôt handle. We didn‚Äôt want to leave. Beautiful view of the lake and spacious patio to relax on. Just minutes from Silver Dollar City. We were surprised how close it was to everything!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, cozy place to spend the weekend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was a fabulous stay for us and very romantic and private. The views of the lake front the deck while having morning coffee were amazing. We did not want to get up an get going, could have sat and enjoyed that view all day. Great wildlife viewing as well. Birds and deer abundant. We will definitely be back. Thanks Elizabeth and Mark!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay here. Felt like we were all alone on that hill! Really clean! Great amenities!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location! It was close enough to everything we needed, yet felt very private. The house is very very cool. It was a great place for my wife and I for a few days!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazingly peaceful and serene. The view is incredible and better than scenic views on the highway. We found ourselves wating to stay at the house when we had places to go.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were had a good time at Miss Elizabeth‚Äôs place. It was beautiful house. Nice, clean, calm and neat. The view was beautiful. You have to see yourself! ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Miss Elizabeth was nice and helpful.
We were so pleased and my daughter was so excited about the house. And said, mommy can we go here again please üòù. (Nice family house ‚ù§Ô∏è)
Thank you so much for having us! ü•∞"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely LOVED the place! We would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. I really enjoyed sitting by the fire each night. The view from the entire cabin is amazing. We rented our boat from the marina down the street - only 5 minute drive. The hosts are outstanding. We left our e-reader on the nightstand and the host is mailing it back to us. I also broke a glass and offered to pay for replacement but they declined. Just a really nice host and beautiful property. We took our Tesla which would not have been practical without the Tesla charger on site. Nice bonus!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place very peaceful clean
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Tree+House is an amazingly beautiful property! As beautiful as the house is on the inside, my wife and I spent most of our time outside on the patio enjoying the breathtaking views! We definitely plan on returning in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We chose this particular place for our honeymoon and it was worth every penny! The location was serene and so peaceful. We enjoyed watching some of the wildlife while we relaxed on the deck. I especially loved the feeling of being away from busy parts of town and yet everywhere was an easy drive!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was the perfect getaway for a birthday sister trip. Great location. Easy to find. Felt safe. Our favorite place was on the balcony with the spectacular view. And we loved waking up to that spectacular view. The weather couldn't have been better. Only wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded expectations in every way. The setting, view, and attention to detail in design was impeccable - very true to pictures. Hosts were quick to respond whenever we had a question. Despite being so close to Silver Dollar City, you feel far away from the noise of Branson. This place was a peaceful retreat and I can‚Äôt wait to return! My only critique is that I wish the bed upstairs was a king :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view the view the view!!!! Beautiful location! The Tree House is ‚Äòcompact‚Äô - but honestly, there‚Äôs a place for everything‚Ä¶ and once you‚Äôre settled in‚Ä¶ it feels just about perfect!Immaculately clean. And very comfortable.
Elizabeth was fabulous to communicate with, and we loved staying here.
Grocery store just up the road.
Seriously‚Ä¶ this is a beautiful retreat. 20mins (max) in to the main drag of Branson.
Hope to come back one day.
For the view the view the view!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. It is beautiful and modern. Indian Point is a quaint village with lots of great local dining. It is also close to Branson for a lot more options for fun and food. The treehouse was beautiful and has great amenities like a heated bathroom floor and comfortable loft. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really, really wish I‚Äôd booked a longer stay. However great you think the pictures look, I promise you, this treehouse looks better in every way! That view? Whew, that view is something! Waking up to that view from the top loft is an experience I‚Äôd always remember. Sitting on the deck, by the fire pit with my partner and just soaking up THAT view! What a trip, I can‚Äôt wait to come back.
Amenities wise, great Wi-Fi, really comfy beds, fantastic and easy to operate blackout curtains, very comfortable outdoor furnishings (you can sit for hours). Small, but efficient kitchen setup.

We loved the gas firepit on the porch and spent much of our time outside enjoying the views of Tablerock Lake. The kitchen was small, but functional and good for guests who plan to eat out or carry in. We'd recommend this place to friends and a great weekend escape to relax and step away from the hustle and bustle."

We loved the little fireplace for taking the chill off in the mornings. We also loved the heated floor in the bathroom. Everything was clean and comfortable. It was so peaceful and relaxing yet close to Branson and the activities we went to while visiting. We also enjoyed sitting on the deck listening to the birds, watching squirrels, and seeing a deer stroll through one morning. We highly recommend it and definitely want to return. It was truly hard to leave! Thank you!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth‚Äôs Tree+House on Indian Point was an absolute charm for the perfect weekend getaway! My wife and I love to travel and this Airbnb is definitely our favorite we‚Äôve ever stayed at! I could talk about it forever but, what you see in the photos is exactly what you get! Pristine clean, modern and stylish (which is very hard to find in Branson area), super inviting and cozy, and the bed was very comfortable! Literally had everything we needed and so much more! The privacy and the feeling of being secluded yet so close to Silver Dollar City and city of Branson really was a treat! One of the best parts about this Airbnb is obviously the amazing views of Table Rock Lake and just how well thought out and designed this home was! Loved the huge glass wall that allowed tons of natural light but also had electric shades if needed! Host was super easy to communicate with and very responsive in matter of seconds! I could rave forever, but we‚Äôll definitely be back and Elizabeth outdid herself!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The location felt so disconnect from civilization but yet you were not far at all from anything you wanted to do, eat, etc. The treehouse was so nice and felt way bigger than what it was.

We recommend anyone considering this place to stay WITHOUT HESITATION! It‚Äôs literally 1 minute from SILVER DOLLAR CITY and so close to so many restaurants and things to do. It‚Äôs extremely private and the views are second to none! It couldn‚Äôt have been a better stay! Loved it and will choose it over and over again as we visit Branson often.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cozy treehouse was by far my favorite bnb I‚Äôve stayed at so far. The pictures do not even do it justice honestly. It is absolutely stunning!!! It was well stocked with everything we needed. The host even had makeup wipes.. like WHAT. I know that sounds so extra but honestly it was much appreciated! There were so many small details in this sweet little space that most bnb‚Äôs don‚Äôt have. I cannot recommend this place enough.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved out stay at the treehouse! Clean, modern, and beautiful views.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot recommend this place more! We absolutely loved our stay there this past week. The location is close to all things Branson but the setting makes you feel like you are no where near anything. The house is set up perfectly and truly is welcoming and a home away from homes!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are not words that can explain how magnificent the house was. Waking up to the beautiful view of the lake made me want to stay forever. Every little touch made our stay that much better. The heated floors in the bathroom were a great surprise. The space was just right for me and my husband.

The heated floors in the bathroom *chefs kiss*. It sounds silly but everything was labeled sooo well it took no time at all to have the fireplace on, blinds open, and be snuggled up enjoying the amazing views! There is a washer and dryer y‚Äôall!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is just perfect and somehow even better than the photos. The location is so close to everything and yet feels secluded. No small detail was left behind in this Airbnb, you can tell the owners really thought about what a guest would want/need and went above and beyond that. The bed was extremely comfortable and the heated floors in the bathroom were such a nice touch. By far my favorite part was sitting on the deck and enjoying the lake view. If you get a chance to snag a couple nights here, do it! It was worth every penny."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Little noisy road traffic but it‚Äôs Branson. Easy access; everything‚Äôs within 15-30 minutes. Accommodations are first class. Enjoyed coffee on the porch overlooking the lake.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this space! It was perfect weekend getaway! 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è ! If you are sensitive to light, you might want to bring a sleep mask as it doesn‚Äôt get completely dark at night! Would stay here again!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"breathtaking! this space amongst the trees is a much needed respite. the unit was as pictured. it was clean. quiet and the views and the sounds of nature are priceless! go when you need quiet and to recharge. after a busy busy work load, it was good to be able to hear myself think (along with the sounds of the forest) they have built this space with respect to the environment. the unit is filled with thoughtful details that just make your stay next level without being over the top. the hosts are responsive and timely! we loved the natural waking with the day's light as it's truly a wall of windows! we will be returning. brava!
side note- the ozarks area is a treasure that we hope doesn't go the way of vegas or any other overdeveloped natural wonder."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can I just say ‚ÄúWow‚Äù ‚Ä¶
Before arriving and booking the stay we read reviews and most said they did not want to leave, after our stay I now see what they meant by that. We also didn‚Äôt want to leave and we can‚Äôt wait to have another opportunity here!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our Tree+House stay on Indian Point in Branson was better than wonderful! We greatly enjoyed the view of the lake & being right in the middle of such a beautiful natural setting -you could easily see the thoughtfulness that went into making it a comfortable & enjoyable place - the amazing two-story ‚Äúfloor to ceiling‚Äù windows give it an open & spacious feeling -more so than any other airbnb in which we have stayed - We visited Silver Dollar City (SDC) on a date that extended to a 10pm closing time - The close proximity to the park made it so easy to cruise home after the SDC fireworks - We also found it helpful to use the washer & dryer since we were at the midpoint of our travel - Our final day we were enjoying a quiet morning on the deck & were delighted to catch sight of a little doe having breakfast on some nearby foliage - It was truly both a relaxing & memorable stay!
Ps...If you are trying to map & view the Tree+House (as we were before our trip), please know this is a newly built place & not
available yet on some apps - we were a little concerned about it at first but shouldn‚Äôt have been - It is a very REAL place - The property manager is very kind, responsive & quick to answer any questions we had before /during our stay -
Easily 5+ Stars! highly recommend!
Gary & Michelle :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was exactly what we hoped it would be and more. The cabin had exactly what we needed! The beds were comfortable, kitchen had everything for making breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and we really enjoyed the patio space.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We searched for a long time to find a secluded unique stay for my husbands 30th and the Treehouse did not disappoint.
The location is amazing. Secluded enough from everyone, yet close enough to run into town and do things. We went to the Titanic Museum and ate ate the famous Billy Gail‚Äôs (cannot go wrong with 14inch pancakes).
We asked for some recommendations for hiking trails and was given a bunch to try, while it was a little too warm for us to hike we still appreciate the guidance.
The treehouse is decorated like a perfect Instagram picture. The beds were so very comfortable, and the views are amazing, plus we were blessed to see a firework show across the lake.
HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend‚Ä¶ we will absolutely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite stays! We loved the detail of the high end perks- great shower, heated floors, fireplace, decor, snacks, it was perfect.

Will absolutely be back!"

The property is close enough to all the things you want to do in Branson yet far enough to feel some seclusion. The property smelled and felt just as new as when first came back in August of 2023, it‚Äôs so well taken care of. You can tell they take pride in their property and making you feel like family. We just love the feel of it all. The house is great. The supplies are what‚Äôs needed for a stay to cook and feel at home. We can‚Äôt recommend this property and these hosts enough! We look forward to our next stay."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Emily went above and beyond to ensure we felt at home. From turning on the outdoor Christmas lights prior to our arrival, to the treats in the kitchen, and special touches throughout the home, Emily is a top host who thought of everything.
The treehouse itself is beautiful and well appointed. The location feels remote and secluded but you are only 10-15 minutes away from all the big attractions.
The home was absolutely spotless too.
We hope to return soon and will be recommending this home to all our friends and family."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, that was my favorite thing about this place. Secondly, just how well stocked the kitchen was! There were actually bread and eggs in the fridge. I‚Äôve never stayed anywhere that has that. But there were spices and so many things you could make in a jam. Emily also gave great local food recommendations!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time in Branson and our time at the treehouse just put it over the top. Emily went above and beyond with her accommodations and hospitality. I highly recommend Emily‚Äôs treehouse if you‚Äôre looking for a beautiful and private getaway. Thank you for everything Emily.

The treehouse was clean and beautifully decorated. There were lots of small touches we appreciated like the books in the reading nook, chocolates, and fresh eggs in the fridge."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great experience. The photos matched very well of what it looked like in person! It was very peaceful and nice to be able to sit outside and just stare into the trees and watch nature.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Can‚Äôt say enough great things! Emily was extremely responsive and gave us several local recommendations that we enjoyed. Her place felt like home and she thought of everything. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and hope to stay for longer! 12/10 experience.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tree Hugger Hideaway is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! The location was perfectly nestled in the Ozarks just a few minutes away from everything Branson has to offer. The treehouse was designed with serenity and modern accommodations in mind. The luggage lift was so awesome!
The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. Emily went above and beyond to welcome us with treats. Her hospitality is top-notch.
The bedroom was so cozy and comfortable. The pictures on the listing are just a sneak peak as to the true tranquility the view has to offer. It was so private and just perfect.
A few little things that my husband and I appreciated are the little details about the treehouse. The host has used top-quality products and appliances. They didn't cut any corners when designing this gem. I recommend checking out the custom designed wooden signs as you explore the property and trails to the pond.
The cell service and Wi-Fi signal are great. Perfect for streaming movies."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Only our second AirBNB stay, and expectations were high because some friends recommended it! The house was over-the-top clean & so, so cute...We felt right at home! The surroundings are beautiful, we loved our coffee on the porch among the treetops! Enjoyed the walking trail and hearing the chickens in the morning. Emily answered every question we had, was totally helpful & pleasant, and anticipated every need. Also, the location is convenient to everything! This little Treehouse is a GREAT find, and we will most definitely try to stay here on our next Branson trip!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place. I would highly recommend and hope we get to stay there in the future.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful get away retreat. Has their own trail to a beautiful pond! Very clean and presentable treehouse. Steep driveway for anyone who has a small compact vehicle. Personally I would have liked to see better and more comfortable seating outside for the enjoyment of scenery and sounds of nature. They do have picnic table by the pond which was relaxing to enjoy lunch at. Overall great experience would love to visit again!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The setting was great, and availability of the walking trail was so nice. We did not get to enjoy the trail to the fullest because we were only there for a couple of days. The house itself was very comfortable and cozy. It was secluded but easy access to all Branson has to offer. There is nothing I could say negative about our stay except that it wasn't long enough!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute little treehouse retreat! The hosts were very kind and even went the extra mile to help us get back up the hill to our car when it was raining. It was very clean and decorated very stylish. The location is about 5-10 mins from the Branson strip attractions but is private enough to have your own peaceful stay away from the vacation crowds.

We loved how secluded it felt but yet it was very close to all we wanted to do in Branson. We will definitely be staying here again‚Ä¶and again and again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is honestly one of the coolest Airbnb‚Äôs my wife and I have EVER stayed at!! Such a great location, just 5 minutes from the strip and beautifully secluded. There were some storms in Branson that took out the power and Internet for the beginning of our stay. Emily and her family were so quick to act and hooked up a generator right away. They were so kind and wonderful! The way this Treehouse is set up makes you feel like you‚Äôre 10 stories high while on the second level. It was so cool to be completely immersed and the tree canopy while hanging out in bed. We will be coming back very soon!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emily was an outstanding host! Very accommodating. Lovely place! Highly recommend!

It was so nice to get out of the crowds of Branson and be in such peaceful surroundings where our kiddos could run!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This treehouse retreat was even more spectacular than we anticipated. It is beautifully decorated, furnished, and so comfortable! It was such a treat to find fresh country eggs in the fridge for breakfast‚Ä¶we were able to enjoy the surroundings while enjoying breakfast at the same time‚Ä¶without having to get out in the Branson traffic to eat! Worth every penny and more!!! We‚Äôd love to return!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible - truly like no where else we‚Äôve ever stayed. It‚Äôs beautifully done, and feels so open and comfortable. They thought of every detail to max out enjoyment of the space and to make the stay as comfortable as possible. (Even our hard-to-impress teenagers were in awe of this place!) Everywhere we wanted to go was a short drive away and it was such a treat to come back to the treehouse after being in crowds all day. We sat on the porch just enjoying the surroundings and peacefulness. When I did have a question for Emily, she responded immediately and made sure we had everything we needed. We are already making plans to go back. I can‚Äôt recommend staying here highly enough!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my wife and I were very excited about this rental. it was like moving into a new home. Emily provided everything that we could have ever wanted. she even had a dozen fresh eggs in the fridge along with other goodies. they even shared their own grill at our request. we highly recommend this rental to others
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse. The location is off the beaten path, yet close to everything you would want to do in Branson. The house was exactly the way it was pictured, kitchen was stocked, and had plenty of other supplies if you somehow forgot yours.
Emily was nice enough to text us about a few things that we forgot, and then Hunter met us to bring them to us. Just over the top service.
If your looking for a spot away from the hustle and bustle in Branson, yet close enough to get to it fairly quickly, this spot is perfect.
We will be back again,
David & Becky Bryant"

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this brand new property just minutes from Branson Landing, 76 strip and all the activities on Table Rock/Lake Taneycomo. We enjoyed the kid-friendly yet quiet neighborhood. The scenic view of the lake from the balcony was amazing and it was so relaxing watching sunrises and sunsets. Property was clean and well stocked with toiletries and cooking essentials, especially for our family of 5. The brand new house provided firm beds (personal preference is softer) and en-suite bathrooms which we loved!! We enjoyed the grill and private hot tub as well. Checkin and checkout was seamless. We travel to Branson often and this is definitely 5 star worthy. Highly recommend this property!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an incredible time at the A Frame. We used Chat GPT to build an itinerary for our short vacation and all the spots in the area were incredible. We hiked Lost Valley Trail, toured Cosmic Caverns, ate at the Ozark Cafe, and more. The A frame was such a unique experience.

It was even better than the pictures! Justin messaged me the same day to let us know a hot tub was getting installed and we would have access to that as well. The place was spotless, the deck views were beyond incredible, and Justin was super responsive. They even left us a little gift bag of treats to kickstart our anniversary weekend. We have already recommended this listing to several friends and family and certainly will be back for another trip hopefully sooner than later. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"

Halley and Chris made me feel right at home and were kind enough to give me a tour of the property. I spent the morning hiking trails and taking a swim in the natural spring fed swimming hole.

When we didn‚Äôt want to venture out, we hiked around the trails at the property and lounged on the porch. Halle surprised us with a gift basket and family sign which was such a sweet item to arrive to.
Being April, we were expecting it to be chilly, but the fire pit was perfect while playing games on the patio. There was also a heater inside the tent for the cool night. Honestly this trip was just so perfect!
We are already figuring out how to plan our next trip down here with our family and friends."

I wish we could have stayed longer and already looking forward to another stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED our stay!! Everything looked at exactly like the pics and was clean. The first day it did nothing but rain and we chose to stay in rather than go to Branson. We completely enjoyed listening to the rain and took the best nap ever. We enjoyed Branson and all the activities but we were anxious to get back to our tent. It was beautiful and peaceful and we enjoyed every moment. The welcome sign was so cute and appreciated. We can‚Äôt wait to go back and enjoy being outside more.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We selected this Airbnb for our wedding anniversary get away and it did not disappoint. The outside temps in late November were chilly but the heater and heated blankets inside made this glamping experience as cozy as possible.

The location was easy to find and was convenient to the Branson Landing area.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"First time glamping! We showed up at night and I knew it would be cute but wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect- was lit up with cute lights and was just magical walking up and so pretty. The fireplace is awesome, cozy and relaxing. Toiletries and feminine products provided, which is insanely kind. We also walked in to a piece of wood with our family name written (which was above and beyond adorable). We are already talking about coming back because this was a relaxing,gorgeous night. it got down to probably 40 degrees and stayed warm inside, with a heater and a heated blanket. Waking up was so peaceful to go outside and drink coffee (also provided) on the deck by the fire and looking out into just TREEs. 1000% recommend and will be coming back for sure! Super super sweet and obviously very well thought out, there‚Äôs even an awesome wall heater in the bathroom. S‚Äômores stuff and skewers, easy access, and completely worry-free checkout/cleaning instructions."

You can tell that the hosts are thoughtful and extremely considerate when it comes to the experience of their guests. My Type A husband was amazed. And that is no easy feat! Typically I feel like airbnbs over advertise and it doesn‚Äôt live up to the expectation‚Ä¶I feel like this place is under advertised! It was 1000x better than I even expected! Comfortable at night in 40 degree weather, a personalized sign and snacks to welcome us, clean, functional, communicative hosts. I could go on but this review is way too long. Book this place at your earliest convenience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Total serenity. We loved it. We even enjoyed a nice evening walk in the trails. The treehouse tent was perfect. Subtle country elegance. Nice touch on the welcome sign and the smores.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful. Halley and Chris are very welcoming and respond to every need. The tents are very clean and inviting.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay. I was traveling for business and decided to do something different than staying at a hotel.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a person (the wife) who does NOT enjoy camping, I was not looking forward to this. However, this experience was above my expectations! The inside of our tent was immaculate and well cared for. The sweet personalized sign she made for us was so welcoming and added the perfect touch of homey-ness for us! The bathroom was good and clean and had extras for us in case we needed them. The rocking chairs out front were my favorite parts! Sitting out in the beautiful woods next to the firepit was next to perfection.
We got to meet Hailey and talk to her, and she was super sweet and personable. I wouldn't want to camp, but I would happily glamp here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Treehouse was beautiful and a great camping option for somebody who doesn't go camping. My husband was delighted. Several trails to walk. Close to nature and the Branson strip or lakes. We will stay at Ozark Mountain Adventures next time we come to Branson.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely was the best choice of places to stay I‚Äôve ever made! The place was quiet and peaceful and just felt like home! For sure gonna go back next year!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Glamping tent was outstanding. The thought process of every inch of this adventure was perfectly detailed. Amazing is not a strong enough to describe our experience.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I hate writing a glowing review of Ozark Mountain Adventure because I want to keep this hidden Branson gem all to myself. It has everything....
Activities + Relaxation
Adventure + Peace
Simplicity + Luxury
Tourist + Nature Lover

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in Branson in over 5 years. Part of the thrill of coming to Branson is all of the attractions and activities that are surrounding the area. Coming back in the evening, and starting our day surrounded by nature was not only beautiful, but a great way to recharge. Staying at the Treehouse was our first time here, one of three sites, with TWO more planned to be built. It‚Äôs safe to say that it certainly won‚Äôt be our last!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and hope to come back soon! It was the best glamming experience!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Hallie reached out to us as soon as we booked. She was very helpful as this was our first time Glamping. Her place was as described as was a welcome Change to the everyday AirBnb. I would highly recommend this location if you want to try something different.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our trip was very nice and a clean fun place to visit will definitely come again soon
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay! The only complaint I have would be I didn't stay up long enough! This experience by far exceeded our expectations. We loved our time here enough that we've decided to come back within the next week or two! I highly recommend this place to anybody seeking a peaceful, serene, romantic getaway to unwind from the everyday hustle and bustle most all of us face on a daily basis."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a place to relax. We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary and we didn‚Äôt want to be in the hustle and bustle of Branson. We got exactly what we wanted and we were still close enough to downtown for dining and shopping.
The bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was CLEAN! Like super clean! The deck area was relaxing. We stayed in the Treehouse.
This will be our go-to place anytime we‚Äôre in Branson from now on."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed the weekend here for her birthday, as well as our anniversary. The tent it self was great. The little things the host did made it feel like home. The snacks and drinks left were nice as well. The bed was very comfortable. The property was amazing and nice during our hikes. Sitting out on the deck was very quiet and peaceful. I would highly recommend staying here. We talked about making it a yearly thing for us to go and do. I would also like to note anytime I needed something small from the host she was very helpful and didn't make it feel like I was bothering."

We stayed at the Tree house, as soon as we walked in & had the personalized sign the kids were so surprised. They loved everything about it, had some s‚Äômores by the fire, played jumbo uno , & sorry. We had A/C which üòÖwas the Best thing for mom & the bathroom was big & clean."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! We came here to celebrate our 27th anniversary and we made the best memories here. We were so excited to see the treehouse when we pulled up. We came in the rain, but still had the best time. We were able to sit on the deck in the rocking chairs by the firepit & make s‚Äômores & listen to the peaceful sounds of nature surrounding us. It was perfect! We are telling all our family & friends to come glamping here! We will def be back! Thank you for creating this place! ü•∞üèïÔ∏è"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I took my Fianc√© here for a short overnight mid-week getaway from Springfield, just about an hour away. When we arrived, we were immediately surprised at how well orchestrated the property is here. It‚Äôs without a doubt an unforgettable and adventurous experience as soon as you drive through the gates. It was very easy to find the campsite and our tent. The hosts have made it a walk in the park to enjoy the remote pleasantries and experience of camping in the outdoors, while retaining the convenience and luxuries of at-home comfort.
Upon entry to our tent, we were surprised to find a personalized wooden sign with both mine and my fianc√©s names written on it. This is a novelty item we will have forever as a symbol of a short-lived but treasured memory. All thanks to Chris and Halley. The tent sealed nicely, and they give you an AC unit in the tent to cool off which worked surprisingly well. We also very much enjoyed the swimming hole on the property. We will 100% be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb experience and I was not disappointed! Halley set up the tent to be welcoming and she achieved just that. Immediately set at ease by the quiet and beautiful grounds. She made us feel at home with her small touches such as a welcoming sign and even vegan marshmallows. I would highly recommend this place if you are a fellow Glamper!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a beautiful place to stay. The setting was beautiful for such an important part of our life. We couldn‚Äôt of asked for a better spot for me to propose to my girlfriend. Thank you both so much!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We celebrated our anniversary at Halley's. We were amazed at how quiet and peaceful it was during our stay. Halley was great with communication throughout the entire process. She even let us know we could check in early as the site was ready sooner than expected. Everything was clean and exactly as the photos protrayed. We have already let friends and family know about our great experience. Thanks, Halley, for a great time of making memories."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the tent camping and the cute setup they had, and the hiking trails were awesome and all the work they put into the property. it's well worth the stay. Going to recommend to my friends and family."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Everything was seamless from check in to check out. Hailey had our room ready early and let us know we could check in. There were so many thoughtful details. It rained the entire time and was so relaxing. The bed was warm and so snuggly comfortable. The view was incredible. We left the tent flaps open all night even though it was 25 degrees by morning. We were still comfortable! We can‚Äôt wait to come back when it is warmer to enjoy the rocking chairs and fire pit! Loved every minute Hailey provided.‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had another great stay! This is our second year here for a birthday weekend getaway to relax and recharge as parents. Its so peaceful and calm and just what we need. Seriously the best! Can't wait till next time!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great stay. I really loved how they put our name as a gift , the cleanliness, heated blankets, snacks, fire pit everything. I really loved it, it was more than what they advertise. I would highly recommend anyone looking something peaceful far from busy city life yet a few minutes drive to city. It was a wonderful experience for us."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing stay for us and our dogs! There were a few great personal touches.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was a great experience and we really enjoyed ourselves. We loved getting there and finding a little welcome sign with our name on it. All the person touches and unadvertised extras exceeded our expectations.
The location is close to the ammenities of Branson Landing and any tourist attractions you might be interested in, but secluded enough that you can enjoy the quiet."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was me, my husbands, and our dogs 2nd stay here and we absolutely loved it again!!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay in the ‚Äútreehouse‚Äù. It was so nice to get out of town and relax but comfortably. Everything was so clean and ready for our stay. The bed was very comfortable and the mini fridge has some waters and things we had forgot to bring!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Halley‚Äôs glamping treehouse was the perfect little romantic getaway! My husband and I stayed on a crisp autumn night but we were so cozy by the fire pit and in the warm tent!

There was a tarp covering the tent and we were also able to get to the bathroom without getting wet. We highly recommend!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to unplug from social media and reconnect with your spouse! (But still have cell reception to attend your college class seminar lol).

I am so glad we did. my husband was working in the area and its his birthday week so I told him to pick where we go. Very Relaxing. The host were very fast to reply when messaged. offered us a jeep tour wish we would have taken him up on it.

We spent the morning next to the fire enjoying our supplied s‚Äômores! The crickets were a perfect way to fall asleep. Not far from the landing so we spend the evening walking around, and the location was so secluded that we got to watch 5 deer just hanging out! Couldn‚Äôt have been better."

The campsite is unique and intimate with a fire pit on the deck and rocking chairs! The hosts provide snacks, games and supplies to make s‚Äômores. The property is gated and the area is beautiful!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved every minute of our stay here for our ‚Äúbabymoon‚Äù! The location is far enough away that we could relax but close enough to everything that it‚Äôs not out of the way. The personalized location was amazing!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and quiet stay. Just enough away from town to feel secluded but still close enough to get to fun activities within a small drive. Hosts were very polite and communication was perfect. Seeing the wildlife while making s‚Äômores was surreal. Will glamp again!

I bought an extra package that included roses, wine, and chocolate covered strawberries which made the trip even more romantic for me and my boyfriend of 4 years. I was pleased to see that the treehouse was air conditioned which was amazing. Thank you guys for such a good time I‚Äôm hoping to come back this winter. 10/10 would recommend!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pure perfection!!! 10/10. This place is clean, cozy, and comfortable. Will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome experience.. 5 stars all the way around
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"YES üëèüèº THIS üëèüèº WAS üëèüèº EXACTLY üëèüèº
WHAT I NEEDED!!! ü§© üôåüèº
This was my 1st ‚Äúglamping‚Äù experience AND now I‚Äôm prob ruined for all others because they set too high a bar!
4 Things I Was Skeptical About (BUT oh so glad I gave this a chance)‚Ä¶
1. I love nature BUT hate bugs & dirty areas! AND lemme tell you‚Ä¶ both sites I stayed at are regular treated & I had no issues the whole week. + from the ceiling to the floor of the ‚õ∫Ô∏è‚Ä¶ so clean & fresh feeling!!!I couldn‚Äôt believe how immaculate they keep things ü§Ø!!! I didn‚Äôt know that was even possible for a tent!?!?
2. I love nature BUT I also like a good shower after all the hiking & kayaking, etc. These private showers üöø üòÄ üëåüèº. They have better shower heads & water pressure & temp control than most hotels! The sink is beautiful as well. I usually bring my own toiletries but they keep it well stocked with the basics.
3. I love nature BUT I also knew it was gonna be 100+ degrees during my stay this week. I didn‚Äôt know you could even pump AC into a ‚õ∫Ô∏è!?!? I was very skeptical. Yet again, incredibly surprised. Even during the hottest parts of day the AC unit kept the temp tolerable in the tent and at night I had to turn it off because I was getting too cold!!!
4. I love nature BUT was this worth the 8 hour drive from Dallas area? yes. Yes. YESSSSS!!! I have never treated myself to a sabbatical and knew I needed one. I was craving nature & something to force me away from busyness, business, TV‚Ä¶ etc. (Plus‚Ä¶ while the location is remote & separated from the busy Branson area‚Ä¶ it is also within 15-20 mins of the city‚Ä¶ best of both üåé‚Äôs).
Also worthy of noting‚Ä¶
- The hosts are exactly as promoted by AB&B, ‚ÄúSuperHosts‚Äù. They are on it & you can feel the love, warmth & pride they take in what they do. An absolute joy to interact with.
- I wanted a to do a lot of hiking, kayaking, etc while here & at as many different places as I could. THERE WERE SO MANY spots & all within 1/2 hour or less from this location. (*Not to mention, this location also has a wonder hiking trail themselves that I enjoyed my 1st day there. üòä)
Hahaha I‚Äôm already discussing my return trip with family üòâ
Currently this is the ONLY real game in town for glamping‚Ä¶ get ready for the new trend in Branson AND this place is leading the way AND setting the bar VERY high!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a very short stay and we already are trying to figure out when we can come back for longer! This was a really peaceful and relaxing place. Halley was so welcoming and helpful!!! We loved the personal touches that they added like a sweet welcome sign, anniversary flowers, snacks, and s‚Äômores supplies!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thought and care that went into these glamping sites is unsurpassed. We thoroughly loved our Tree House stay! We got to share some special memories that we will treasure forever! We took our 4 year old and she was just as excited as we were! The property is beautiful and the amenities are more than you would expect from a glamping site. This was the first stop on our trip out west for a 2 week tent camping vacation and it was hard to leave the comfort of the soft and cozy bed, and the forest view with beauty all around. We played games, laughed and loved the whole time! Conveniently located in the heart of Branson with the Ozarks just as near as your backyard. This will be a place we return to often! Thank you, Halley, for everything! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Happy Glamping,
The Zimmermanns
‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! My husband and I love travel and this is, by far, one of the coolest places we've been able to stay! Halley and Chris included multiple personal touches, which made us feel comfortable and at home. They gave us several great tips about what was going on locally, and they even told us about a cool route and place to eat (the Cliff House Inn in the Arkansas Grand Canyon) on our way to Hot Springs on the motorcycles! All advice turned out great, and we definitely plan to come back in the cooler months!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This perfect location is slightly out of Branson, in the middle of beautiful scenery, with absolutely wonderful hosts, personally willing to bend backwards to make each guest‚Äôs experience perfect!

The personalized welcome sign and snack basket, complete with s‚Äômores and all, was such an incredibly thoughtful touch and made our experience even more wonderful!As a newly wed couple this little get away from it all was the perfect time to connect and make memories that we will cherish for a lifetime! We will definitely be back soon! üèï‚ù§Ô∏è"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great stay in ‚ÄúThe Tree House‚Äù site 3. The hosts were so easy to communicate with and very responsive. This was our first trip with our puppy and it was a perfect location because we could easily contain him on the deck. We stayed on property during our stay and enjoyed the trails and the swimming hole. It was a wonderful quiet getaway out in nature. The bed was extremely comfortable, and we‚Äôre picky about our mattresses! There was a mini fridge, microwave and keurig coffee maker. The bathroom was very nice. There were many little touches that made the whole experience even nicer. Glamping is definitely the way to go."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first experience glamping, and definitely won‚Äôt be our last. We stayed in the treehouse, and everything was very clean, the bed was super comfortable, and the handmade welcome sign & bin of snacks was such a sweet touch. All the details and hard work they put into everything really shows! We loved hanging out on the deck area with the fire pit, it feels like you‚Äôre immersed in the trees. They are super kind and personable, and I‚Äôm already reccomending to all my friends and clients! Definitely will be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect combination of a relaxing and fun filled stay in Branson! The Glamping site is cozy with privacy and less than 10 minutes to The Landing!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had never heard about Glamping until we stayed here, and now it is probably my favorite way to camp. The location was amazing and the set up for this was great. I really cant think of a single thing that would make this better."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is so special! You sleep under the stars, in a beautiful wooded mountain, while having all the comforts of a beautiful hotel! There were s‚Äômores supplies in the tent and an easy to start fire pit! A short walk from our camp we enjoyed a beautiful creek swimming hole! This property is truly amazing!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our time glamping at Ozark Mountain Adventure. It was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. We were able to unplug while still being close enough to town it wasn‚Äôt a hassle to drive! I wish we could have stayed longer. It was very clean and they had the cutest welcome sign and basket! We will definitely be coming back and recommending to our friends!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Me, my boyfriend, and our service dog came down for my birthday, and we ALL enjoyed it! The hosts made it SO WELCOMING, and were great all around!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cant say enough great things about this airbnb! it was cozy, warm, scenic, quiet, etc... everything we wanted after a long day taking in branson. even though it torrential rained the night we stayed, not a drop of water came in. halley was gracious to provide snacks and a binder of local things to do. hopefully next time we can enjoy hot smores on the porch with the fire! we can't wait to come back!"

Will 100% be booking again in the future."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute glamping tent! I was a bit nervous heading there because it was cold and rainy. However, a space heater was already turned on before my fianc√© and I got there along with a heated blanket! Overall, it was a fun experience!"

Exactly as described in a serene location with beautiful sunsets, on a tulip and apple farm! 100% will be booking again in our future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Jessica's charming cottage for an anniversary weekend. We have two children, including an infant, and wanted to use this trip as a chance to relax and SLEEP. The location was very private with a small gravel road being the only traffic and the house itself was immaculate, we were lucky enough to be staying while the tulips were in bloom (early April) and they were quite beautiful. The kitchen and bathroom were clean and fully stocked and the living spaces and bedrooms were extremely comfortable. The cottage is only a short drive from Branson and several state parks making it easy to grab a bit to eat or go on a hike. We had the smallest of issues checking in, the host responded within minutes. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 had a great time. We were looking for a peaceful getaway with beautiful views. This place was exactly as described, very responsive hosts, great location, and we felt right at home. We enjoyed everything about our stay. Thanks again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica was absolutely the sweetest host! Our kiddos and selves included really did feel right at home! It was the perfect spot for privacy, but close enough to go into the city and have some fun! It was the perfect home away from home to have fun and just relax with the family! 10/10 recommend. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my most favorite Airbnb stays! Our weekend took place in Mid March, when the outdoors can look pretty drab, but this cottage is nestled on a hill and surrounded by beautiful green pines. Not drab at all! The interior of the cottage was absolutely gorgeous. Jessica was lovely and very gracious when we presented her with some scheduling snafus. We will definitely be back. Hope to take advantage of the back deck and the firepit next time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are wanting a peaceful weekend to get away from everything this is the place. All weekend the only visitors we had were deer and it was amazing. The nice thing is, too, if you are hungry there is a cool place right down the road or you can drive into town only twenty minutes away.
I also love that they provide puzzles & kids toys. We played with all that was offered. Also super nice that there was a full kitchen as we decided to make most our meals at the cottage."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica‚Äôs Place was perfect! I used it as my Bridal Cabin for the weekend while getting married at the nearby winery.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was FANTASTIC! Hands down it was the cleanest and nicest property we‚Äôve stayed it. It was beautiful and decorated so nicely! Jessica was very communicative and friendly. Overall, a very warm, welcoming home. 10/10"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we were looking for to celebrate our birthday‚Äôs. Peace, quiet, secluded, and pretty views.

Will recommend this cottage to others looking for a place to stay. Thank you for your hospitality."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt at home and Jessica went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. Would definitely return for another stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was our 2nd stay at the cottage. Once again, the cottage was so clean, relaxing, and peaceful. We loved being right next to the flower farm to visit. We will definitely be back for another stay in the future."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica‚Äôs place was amazing and unique. It was not only beautiful but it was private and surrounded by trees. The home felt and even smelled brand new. The decor and furnishings were stylish and luxurious. Even the hand soap and shower soap were impressive. This is definitely one of my favorites. If you are looking for a modern home in the middle of the woods, this is it. So quiet and peace."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it! Secluded little cabin for a night on our honeymoon
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place, very clean!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute hidden gem off the road with a beautiful view and a beautiful little house!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a little home/cottage around the Branson area it‚Äôs absolutely perfect! super clean super up kept I have zero complaints!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay, I wanted to find a private place to stay that wasn't far from the city if I needed to go shopping. The cottage was very clean and easy to get to, the farm was also very beautiful to walk through in the mornings, almost every morning I woke up to deer in front of the cottage! I recommend staying here if you'd like a private place to stay while being close to town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here while visiting Branson.The cabin is very nice and was spotless clean.I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing vacation this year!!! We usually go to Branson every year and this time we wanted to do it different and spend more time just hanging out and relaxing. This is the way to go!! We were just 20 minutes from everything on our agenda and we didn‚Äôt have to be in the midst of the crazy traffic on the strip. This place is beautiful!!! It was so nice that the kids had their own spot for hanging out as well, although they hung out with us most of the time. We wanted to be able to come back and just enjoy playing games and relaxing. We also brought breakfast food so we could just cook our own and not rush to go somewhere. We will defiantly stay here every time we go."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica was a responsive host that literally thought of everything. Not only was the property immaculate‚Äîdown to the cleanliness and decor, but she also provided kids dishes, any and all towels that you would need, and a cute little welcome basket with snacks (which my 4 year old loved). The beds were super comfy, the AC units kept the house cool (it got up to 95, not including humidity when we were there), and the kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, cutting boards, oven, toaster, etc. It was the perfect spot for our family of 5 to stay when we were in town visiting my daughter‚Äôs birth family. I highly recommend this property to anyone staying in the area that doesn‚Äôt want to get caught up in a super commercial, touristy hotel near Branson."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sometimes a mom and her best friend need nothing but beautiful flowers, a gorgeous sunset, a visit from a groundhog :), and no sounds but birds and hawks. We absolutely LOVED this place. Being able to be out in nature with a firefly light display at night, but sleep in cozy, comfortable beds was just perfect. The cottage was spit spot clean, amazingly designed- modern but cozy and warm. It is such a unique experience to rent a flower farm for a few days and we were so grateful for the ease of location, entry, privacy and clear warmth and love that is being put in to the property. We can't wait to see it grow as we plan to return !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly what we were looking for. It is the perfect get away for a few days. I do lots of AB&B and hope to come back and stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so perfect! Super peaceful and relaxing! Will be staying here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this cute farm cottage. The location was very quiet and peaceful yet so close with just a short drive to Big Cedar and Branson. The cottage was exceptionally clean, well stocked, and comfortable. The flower farm and orchard are an added bonus. Marissa is just the sweetest and i enjoyed visiting with her at the farm a few evenings. Marissa and Jessica were wonderful hosts and we are ready for our next stay at the cottage.
Jessica"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Amazing views!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was the kindest host I‚Äôve ever had. Her cute, modern, and homey cabin in the woods is well worth it. She could charge so much more! It is private, beautiful, and everything you could ever want in a rental home. I took my wife here for our first two days of the honeymoon and it blew her away! We grilled, cooked, and relaxed. It had EVERYTHING we needed! What an incredible house with an even better host. If you are trying to decide on a place to stay‚Ä¶ STOP‚Ä¶ this is it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is great for any couple looking for a clean, peaceful, and private getaway in the woods near Branson, MO. Less than a minute up the road is Bear Creek Winery/Brewery which is a great hangout away from the busyness of Branson. There is also horseback riding nearby at Bear Creek Riding Trails. Driving distance into Branson is not bad‚Ä¶around 20 minutes."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful views and very clean and beautiful inside
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A ‚Äústill smells new‚Äù cabin! Very beautiful and peaceful place. Owners were supper sweet!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! It‚Äôs located right next to a beautiful Winery. The cabin is secluded in the woods but also a short drive to all of the shops and restaurants. This place is extremely clean and we felt just like home. Highly recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was absolutely perfect and location was excellent. It was exactly what we were looking for to rest and recharge. The winery a half mile away had good wine, pizza and live music. We will definitely return again. Everything about it was amazing!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This cottage was by the the BEST Airbnb/VRBO we've ever stayed at! It was just as described, extremely cleaned, and just so dang cute!!! We loved our stay here and will definitely come back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably one of the best airb&b‚Äôs we‚Äôve stayed at!! Jessica was so nice and friendly! Will have to come back for sure!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the cottage! We travel to Broken Bow, OK often, but we were looking for something a little different. We loved how the location of the cottage was the perfect mix between country and city. The cottage itself is stunning! It has been very well maintained. We will definitely be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! The cottage is beautiful. It‚Äôs new and clean and they have pretty much everything you could need. The beds were comfy. The mirror in the bathroom is great for getting ready. The sunset view was so pretty off the back deck. You drive past a little garden and pavilion to get to the cottage, which is directly behind it. I‚Äôm not sure if events are ever hosted here, or it‚Äôs private, but it was vacant while we stayed. The loft gets pretty warm, which I know is normal for lofts because heat rises. It‚Äôs about a 20 minute drive back into Branson. They had board games for you to play, which we did! My 8 year little girl thought that was a great touch. It‚Äôs really a wonderful place to stay. I would 100% recommend it. We hope to go back. The hosts were generous and left snacks for us in the cottage. There were detailed instructions on how to use the coffee machine, the air/heat units and anything else that needed an explanation. Just go stay here, you won‚Äôt regret it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for anyone who wants a stay that is secluded, yet feels very modern."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and clean little home. The beds and pillows were so comfortable! We haven‚Äôt slept that well in a while! I love to cook and the kitchen had everything I needed. Lots of utensils and cookware. The backyard had the most beautiful sunsets. I would like to go back and bring a couple next time!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Country Cottage is a beautifully decorated, cute cottage. A well-stocked welcome basket greeted us upon our arrival. Jessica was kind and kept us informed about possible bad weather conditions moving in that might affect the next part of our trip. The setting is a beautiful and peaceful country setting. We would love to return when the flower gardens are in bloom."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was absolutely beautiful! Jessica was so helpful and her recommendations were awesome! The whole place was beautiful and so peaceful! Highly recommend!!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will be coming back here again and again! We had the most relaxing and peaceful time at this cottage. I‚Äôve been to Branson so many times but this felt totally different. I was surrounded by the Ozarks and even in the dead of winter, it was beautiful. Even though it‚Äôs in the mountains the location is perfect. 15 minutes from the landing.
The inside of the house was cozy and clean. Everything is done so well and it looks and smells brand new! If you‚Äôre wondering if you should stay here, you definitely should. Jessica was so nice and helpful for everything we needed. We wish we could have stayed longer!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was absolutely perfect! Beautiful surroundings, extremely well stocked kitchen, wonderfully comfortable beds, and great style! Everything was new, but incredibly comfortable too! The hosts even decorated for the holidays and provided chests of toys for kiddos. The back porch view is ah-mazing. We wanted to move in! The pictures can't even do justice to how beautiful the surroundings are or how immaculate the cabin looks. Loved every minute of our stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great private location within twenty minutes of all local attractions! Will be returning in the future!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most delightful stay. It had everything we needed and everything was so clean and perfect. The property was breathtaking and we felt like we were in the Rockies having a campfire in the back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for our stay. It was beautiful little cabin. I loved how quiet and peaceful it was. I enjoyed a nice morning work out and walk through the beautiful garden. The view on the back porch was a lovely place to sit and drink tea and catch up with my best friend. It was a wonderful location and easy to check in and out. I would definitely go back.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was beautiful and clean. The host had great communication about everything!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend staying at this home if you are looking for a private, peaceful sanctuary in nature. It had amazing view of the trees on the mountains changing to fall colors. The fire pit and propane griddle were great for the cool fall evenings with BBQ and s‚Äômores. We even cooked eggs, hash browns, and toast on it for breakfast. We saw quite a few deer in the yard early one morning. The beds are comfortable, the towels are thick, it was clean, the dishes in the kitchen were good quality (not hodge podge yard sale finds like most Airbnb‚Äôs).
The beautiful fresh flowers were a welcoming touch! The owners are very quickly responsive and helpful. You can tell it has a woman‚Äôs touch with all the beautiful fall decor sprinkled tastefully through inside and out. I‚Äôm sure it will be amazing during the Christmas season. It was well stocked for families with small children as far as dishes go. There‚Äôs a Walmart about 15 mins away in Branson if you need anything.
My daughter who loves to write felt inspired by her surroundings to work on a setting for her stories while we were there. It‚Äôs THAT tranquil. Even my 10yo noticed. It‚Äôs the perfect getaway for relaxation and peace. The sunset between the trees over the mountain top above the fire pit was picturesque!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect in everyway!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at this cottage, it is such a nice place in a great setting.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for our honeymoon & it was perfect!! It was truly breathtaking! It was clean, beautiful, spacious, and had everything we needed. We loved how it was tucked away in the woods, yet just a 20 minute or less drive to Branson! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic stay! There are no few adjectives to describe this beautiful cottage‚Ä¶warm, quaint, charming, stunning, peaceful, and altogether quite lovely! From the warm message we received welcoming us with specific directions to the cottage, a quaint door awaiting us with a lovely home just behind, to the kind note with flowers, and a comfortable bed to sleep in‚Ä¶all in all this stay truly was magnificent. We had no bad experiences whatsoever and there was nothing that we didn‚Äôt absolutely love‚Ä¶the cottage was warm and inviting and crafted for hospitality. The details of this place were amazing‚Ä¶beautiful flowers to greet you upon your arrival to a stunning balcony view at sunset‚Ä¶anyone who stays here will not only enjoy their time at the cottage, but will also be blessed by the stunning and warm hospitality of the hostesses! The experience they have is the very definition of hospitality! They were such warm, inviting, and caring! I‚Äôve never had a more perfect stay anywhere in my life! Thank you for such a wonderful experience and for the kind and warm hostesses that you both were!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very peaceful hidden gem. The perfect getaway for our family of four. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. We will definitely be returning!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most peaceful and relaxing little get away!!!
This cottage is ideal if you like a QUIET country setting (still close enough to town, less than 30 min to Branson Landing). Great place to stay if your visiting Howler Bike Park (less than 10 min away).
Beautifully decorated and has everything you would need for the perfect get away. More than enough room to have some quiet time to yourself. Sunsets right off the back porch, plentiful flower gardens, fruit trees, your very own hiking trail and wildlife (deer) all on the property.
Thank you for having us. Hope to stay again on our next visit!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay for our honeymoon. I thought that there must be a catch when I saw how good the pictures looked and that it was on a FLOWER FARM. Nope! No catch! Just an amazing stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing, perfect little getaway. secluded, but not too far from fun stuff to do in Branson. the little cottage is absolutely adorable, we really enjoyed our stay and would book again when in the area. Jessica & Marissa are amazing hosts, their communication is top notch. thanks for having us, ladies! :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really loved this place! It‚Äôs close enough to everything in Branson, yet secluded and surrounded by nature in every direction. We woke up to deer in the front yard every morning. This place truly has it all. Highly recommend!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, inside was very clean, instructions were clear.
There are two windows in front of the bed that have no coverings on them so if light bothers you while sleeping you‚Äôll have a hard time sleeping here. I always bring my eye mask but my husband didn‚Äôt sleep too well and has never really had a problem sleeping with lighting before.
Overall I‚Äôd stay again for the price, the things we were dissatisfied with were very very minor and didn‚Äôt truly impact our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our honeymoon here! The cottage was amazing and the private hot tub just added to the experience!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous weekend we had at Sadie‚Äôs Cottage. It was a great location as it was peaceful and quiet and away from the busyness of the town but only 10-15 min easy drive from anything we wanted to do in Branson.
The cottage was tastefully decorated and was very welcoming and clean. We loved the personal, private hot tub on the secluded back deck of the cottage. There was an abundance of towels and other amenities (coffee, waters, shampoo). We would highly recommend any of the Sunset Hills Cottages for a couples getaway. All the directions and instructions were spot on."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, private spot for two!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a lovely time at this beautiful and cozy home! We are looking forward to returning to make more memories! Thank you so much Blane & Lacey!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my girlfriend went for her 21st birthday, it was beautiful around the cottage and having the private hot tub and small fire pit was a very nice plus. We went shopping at the outlets and landing and we went to dinner at black oak. It was a perfect and relaxing retreat. Thank you for letting us stay, hope we were able to leave it clean enough for yall."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were only in Branson for a weekend but we frequently visit. We loved finishing new things to do, and loved trying places Blane & Lacey mentioned to us via the app. The bed was so comfortable, loved that the hot tub is right on the back patio. The space heater was a great addition as it got a little cold in the late evening hours. The additional blankets came in handy as well. Plenty of towels and location was close to everything but not too close. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again in the summer and try the swimming pond!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. I loved that it's adults only so was quiet and peaceful. The personal hot tub was quiet and private and very relaxing. Can't wait to go back..

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a short stay in Branson to celebrate our anniversary. It rained while we were there so didn‚Äôt get to enjoy all the place offers. The cottage was quaint and cozy, very clean and conveniently located to Sight & Sound Theatre. The one lane drive is paved and winds up a little hill, and, the cottage is clearly labeled along with the parking spot. The cottage has a coffee maker, small microwave and small fridge (no kitchen sink). Bring TV tray if you want a table to eat or play a game. There is a small armoire to hang some clothes and a suitcase stand. The home has fantastic lighting both inside and out. The stay was perfect for us."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was close to Branson Landing, but seemed like we were out of town. Nice, private location. When we first go there we could not get in with the instructions we were given. I called the host and she answered immediately and took care of it! The hot tub and gas fire pit were a great addition!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very private and quaint place. It was so nice to be within 15 minutes of Branson and Silver Dollar City. We love the private deck with hot tub and fire pit. We also enjoyed the community outside fire pit and natural pool with the water falls and Koi fish. Was a little too cool to swim in the natural pool, but would definitely like to come back when the weather is warmer.. Blane and Lacey were great hosts and responded quickly to our questions. In fact, we had an issue with our gas fire pit and they came out the next day and brought a new one so that we could enjoy it for the last few days we were there. We would highly recommend this cottage for a quick,easy and relaxing getaway!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the cottage. Super cute, peaceful, and clean. The pool was beautiful even though unable to use this time of year. Would definitely return!"

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the stay here was great and the surrounding area was beautiful. It was 10-20 minutes away from table rock and downtown Branson. The cottage itself was super cozy and the hot tub was great. The cottage was super clean, the only downside was the bathroom floor was cold with the tile, I think a small space heater would‚Äôve helped that. Other than that I‚Äôd give this a 10/10 stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place! Very clean!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was a beautiful slice of heaven that was private and in a wooded area yet so close to all of the local attractions.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sadie‚Äôs Cottage was absolutely perfect for our first wedding anniversary! Our favorite part was the private deck which included a propane fire pit and hot tub! The quaint space was intimate, quiet, and very relaxing. The swimming pond is breathtaking. Traveling into Branson‚Äôs attractions was quick and easy. Our favorite attraction was the lost canyon cave golf cart tour and eating at Florentina's Ristorante Italiano.
We can‚Äôt wait to come back!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome private honeymoon get away here. It was perfect!

2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We are a retired couple and August is our usual vacation time each year. We wanted a small cozy place close to everything to do in Branson, so we chose this location as our 4 day getaway. First, the photos are misleading. There is a picture of cabins by the pond. Be aware that not all cabins are by the pool/pond area as ours is not in the picture. The cabin we were in was pretty small. It‚Äôs a bedroom with an attached bathroom. So we were a bit disappointed in the size. The inside was decorated nicely and it was very clean. We did use the Hot Tub which was a nice amenity to add to the cabin. The pool is a pond. It was super adorable and very clean. But we wanted more privacy and alone time. Be sure when booking a cabin here to ask for a map if they have one, this will definitely help when deciding if this is what your looking for and the price your willing to pay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything matched the description, it was well maintained, lovely, and we were glad we chose to stay there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful and relaxing. Very comfortable and cozy. Loved the private clean atmosphere.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! Such a nice little place. Very quiet yet very close to everything without feeling like you‚Äôre in the middle of it all. If I could change anything it would be the size of the bed in Sadie‚Äôs cottage. It was very comfortable but it was small for two people. That won‚Äôt stop me from returning though.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in Sadie‚Äôs Cottage was amazing. Everything was exactly as described. The location was perfect. Away from the hustle and bustle but a short drive to all the fun things. The pool was just amazing. I highly recommend a stay here. We will definitely be back again.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it! Would definitely stay again
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a great very private place to stay! The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is that the ac/heater unit didn‚Äôt stay on and when it would kick back on it makes a really loud annoying noise. I‚Äôm a light sleeper so it woke me up through the night. Other than that it was amazing and I would stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Sure beats staying in a noisy, crowded hotel. Definitely will stay again when visiting Branson!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location. Middle of woods feel but also 2 min from the interstate and easy to get where you‚Äôre going. Private back porch sold it for me. Loved the string lights and of course the hot tub and fire pit.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage close to everything! We loved the hot tub and fire pit. The bed was also super comfortable. Previous reviews mentioned no curtain on the window, but there is a curtain now so that‚Äôs not a worry. Beautiful place!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely! You are close to all the Branson activities, but off the beaten path enough to feel peacefully secluded. The weather did not cooperate for use of the natural pool, but it looked amazing! We will definitely recommend to friends, and we hope to be back to try out the pool!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay . Private hot tub is nice ‚Ä¶
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little cottage is right on the outside of everything, so there's not much of a drive to explore Branson, but not right in a super busy area while you're trying to sleep. The place was stocked with basic things you would need. The hot tub was so wonderful to rest in after a long day of touring. The outside pond was beautiful to look at and I'm sure would have been great to swim in (it was colder when we visited)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the property, not far from the strip at all, and its nice to have the privacy."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sadie‚Äôs cottage. It was so cozy, beautiful, and nice and quiet. A different change of pace from the craziness of life. The location was so convenient also. Though the temps were cold, we sat by the the pond briefly at night, and it was gorgeous all lit up with the waterfalls. A very nice place to stay."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Me and my wife went here for our honeymoon and had a great week there! Perfect cabin for a couple. The hot tub and fire pit were Both a great plus in the cold weather. Definitely eyeing to come back when it‚Äôs warmer to try out the beautiful natural pool they have. Can‚Äôt recommend enough if you want an isolated spot still close to Branson.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't possibly go wrong with this place! It is THE CLEANEST cabin we have EVER stayed in. Smelled amazing! GORGEOUS landscape with the pond and waterfall outside, and absolutely beautiful decor inside. We rented this getaway for our 1st Anniversary and I was VERY pleased with their accommodations. They went above and beyond in providing everything I had requested, and that hot tub and fire pit on the porch were just the perfect added touch to our romantic stay. 10/10. We can't wait to go back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny gem was private, clean, and so very fun to stay at. The fall weather was so enjoyable for us to sit outside by the fire pit and spend mornings + evenings in the hot tub. The location was also just close enough to go to the fun things in town but far away for you to feel secluded. I highly suggest this Airbnb stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect little couples spot. The waterfall pool is super relaxing and beautiful! It‚Äôs the perfect distance from all the things you might want to do while on vacation!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you want to be a little secluded from Branson.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay. Close to town but far enough out for peace and quiet. The natural pool was amazing! Loved having a hot tub to relax in at night, but also for the cool morning hours! Will stay again."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, definitely will be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed the location and the price. The host was easy to get in touch with. We will most definitely be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This a great property for a couple. Very scenic, and the natural pool is amazing. We did see 2 deer on the grounds and 2 tiny perch in the pool.
To note: as of this review no curtain or blinds were covering the sliding doors to the outside. If you don‚Äôt want to be awakened at dawn bring a sleep mask.
The Netflix option took 10-20 min to load and was sketchy once loading. Our phoned worked fine for Netflix with our own accounts.
Bring sturdy shoes for walking around the property. Lots of rocks.
Otherwise this property was just what we needed for our anniversary."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Such an adorable little place. Perfect for an anniversary getaway. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and swim in the amazing pool.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to get away! Coolest room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Everything was as they said it would be and the location is excellent. Only a couple minutes from downtown. Would definitely stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED this place. Its quiet, cute and cozy. The view was gorgeous and honestly spent most of our stay in the airbnb because we loved it so much. One thing I would note is the entrance is quite steep and scary in my opinion. Other than that, I definitely would recommend."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome getaway for a couple! We went for my 30th birthday and enjoyed the quietness and seclusion this home had to offer!! It was such a nice escape from our crazy life. We highly recommend it to any and everyone!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were extremely nice and the cottage was clean, smelled good, and well kept. Was off in the woods a little ways and felt like it was off away from everything but was only 10 mins from the landing. Will definitely be going back again and would recommend to everyone for sure."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy place! Easy to find. Easily accessible to everywhere you‚Äôd like to see in Branson.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our trip very much. Much needed privacy with only minutes to all of the Branson attractions! Will consider this place for future getaways!

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Was difficult to find in the dark. GPS takes you to a different neighborhood entrance than you need in order to get a parking pass and get through the gate. Porch light was not on and not many street lights so it was challenging to find the house.
House is cute and was clean. Screened in porch was lovely.
Coffee not provided so be sure and bring your own."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice accommodations. Felt like home and a nice place to relax after long days in Branson. Would definitely consider rebooking next time we are in the Branson.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very private and had beautiful surroundings. There is a trail, sand volleyball pic, and basketball goal all within walking distance. Adam was very helpful and responsive in answering any questions that arose."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay! Adam was super helpful, and saw to our every need. We‚Äôd definitely come back sometime!"

2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My Husband and I really enjoyed our honeymoon experience. üòÅüòÅüòÅ

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful lodge that was located in an amazing private wilderness setting!
It was great to be close to Branson, while staying in such a relaxing area.
We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adam was a great host and the cabin we stayed at was just as described and very clean. He was very responsive to your questions and the area is beautiful with the small lake and walking trails. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Adam as a host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Adam‚Äôs cabin! It was very peaceful and exactly as expected. Adam was a very proactive and responsive host. We would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! We loved the house and everything with it! No coffee or K-cups available to go with the machine tho. also, there are 2 entrance gates to the subdivision! the resident entrance gate was broken when we got there which caused a lil bit of confusion but after we figured out where the visitor gate was, it was a breeze"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful. Just what we needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great stay. We‚Äôll be sure to stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin and quiet surroundings. Our time here was exactly what we were hoping for, and we would highly recommend Adam‚Äôs place to all future guests!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable stay
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a pretty place to stay. I felt it was a bit pricey and the cabins are right on top of each other. The porch light was out and the steps were wet so we were worried about slipping outside. Inside was clean except the bathroom tub. The cold water on the tub didn‚Äôt work so if you wanted a bath, it was very hot. The drain plug was completely moldy and the bathroom shower creaked and felt cheap. Overall it‚Äôs clean (except the drain plug) but over priced for the quality. I‚Äôd rather stay in a clean hotel and saved some money."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay in every way. We look forward to going back. Our second stay in one of Adams rentals. Loved our stay!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,. loved the cabin second time staying in Adams cabins
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The lodge was clean, attention to details was made, quiet, private, and as described/pictured. They even had the towels folded like swans on the bed. The only downsides are small things like the cold water handle on the bathtub not working (which host said he would have looked at asap!) and the fireplace had no instructions on how to use it so we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy that it was there during our December stay, black out curtains would also be nice to have in the bedroom instead of sheer white ones-there are nice blinds though throughout the lodge. Overall, great area in which we felt safe and peaceful! Loved the seating on the screened in porch. Bed was comfortable. Getting in and out of Stonebridge was a small trek and took 8-10 minutes just to get out to the highway, but once there it is easy to get anywhere you want to go!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adam was very helpful and was upfront about the extra parking fees from the beginning. He answered any questions I had very quickly and always wanted to make sure we were having a good time.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adam was a great host! The cabin looks exactly like the pictures. We could not have asked for a better stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful visit for several days at our 15th anniversary. For the week after Thanksgiving, the cabin was beautifully decorated for the Christmas season and had a wonderful cozy feel. The fireplace kept the whole downstairs warmed to the perfect temperature. Even though it was a duplex, there must have been excellent insulation as we could not hear the neighbors when they were in the unit next door. The resort community was very serene, hilly and much more beautiful than the ‚Äúgated neighborhood ‚Äú I expected. I loved the screened in back porch, walking around the pond, and seeing the deer. I‚Äôd love to stay here again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! Adam was super helpful and reached out to us on check-in and check-out day. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but it just makes it that much more peaceful! Place was super clean, stocked with plenty of towels, and was overall a very enjoyable experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful cabin. So cozy and inviting. Adam was helpful and a terrific host! A goto if you are staying in Branson ‚ô•Ô∏è

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay for our little family. The closed in porch was so nice to sit out on and relax. It was clean and had everything we needed. Loved being so close to a little park, too. I had a few questions once we got there but the host was quick and helpful with a response! Would love to stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adam was so helpful and friendly. He responded to me very quickly anytime I needed something. We would love to come back just to rent from Adam!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. The cabin was very cute and nicely decorated with attention to detail. Loved the back screened in patio and the cozy bedroom.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and neat and check in was very easy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying here! Very clean and well kept, description and photos are accurate. The screened in porch was perfect for early mornings and evenings. Location is close enough to everything Branson has to offer.
Our only complaint was we were having issues with the wifi. Once we let Adam know, he gave us an alternate wifi network.
We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was spotless when we arrived. We had a toddler and they installed door covers for him before we arrived. We greatly appreciated that. Adam was extremely nice and always responded to questions. The resort itself was absolutely Gorgeous. Our toddler loved the lake and fishing as-well as the multiple play grounds. All around this was an amazing house. We will be renting from Adam again. Possibly this same cabin.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful place to stay that is close to Branson and all of its attractions yet far enough outside of town to be super peaceful and relaxing! ! I thoroughly enjoyed my morning coffee and afternoon wine on the screened in back deck! We will definitely stay here again! Thanks Adam!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the home! It was so beautiful and clean and peaceful! We felt so at home and comfortable! The screened in porch was awesome and I really loved the Jetted tub!

Thanks so much!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I went for our honeymoon and we didn‚Äôt want to leave! The screened in back porch was perfect for sitting outside listening to the thunderstorms! The place inside was clean and cozy. It was located on a beautiful golf course and conveniently located near downtown Branson. When my wife and I go back we will definitely be staying here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam‚Äôs cabin (and the entire Stonebridge Resort) was even more beautiful than expected and at a very reasonable price. We loved hanging out on the screened in porch in the morning, going for a stroll around the lake & playing pickleball at the golf/tennis club.
The property was close enough to enjoy the offerings of Branson, but disconnected enough to offer a welcomed respite.
He was a great host and the cabin was stocked with lots of great amenities.
We would absolutely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adam was very responsive whenever I emailed him. The cabin was awesome and in a great location. Will definitely be back
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was absolutely beautiful close enough to all Branson has to offer as well as distant for some peace and quiet we will definitely be back .
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Adam‚Äôs place was perfect. We weren‚Äôt too far from the busyness of the city but were also tucked away in the quiet with a great view from the porch and enjoyed walking around the lake. Highly recommend!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in the lovely, homey cabin! It is a perfect location (loved walking around the lake one morning and even fishing right off the bank behind the cabin)! Absolutely beautiful view...and loved the screened in porch!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Waterside Retreat was a beautiful cabin that exceeed our expectations. It was fully furnished (especially the kitchen) with all that we needed to make our meals and live as if we were at home! The scenic view over the water and the walking path around the pond were so enjoyable. Having coffee in the screened in porch was the perfect way to start each day! Other guests were very friendly and it was a very safe place to be! It was a great location to get to and take in what Branson has to offer but also a great get away from all the busyness and soak in the atmosphere.
Adam was a fabulous host! Anytime I had a question he got back to me right away and from the start of our reservation he was very courteous and willing to assist in any way! I would highly recommend staying at any of their locations. We will be reserving again on our next trip down south. Thank you Adam!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay! Perfect place to get away with the kids! We have two toddlers and we enjoyed the pool/playground that was in walking distance! We also fished every evening at the private lake! We felt right at home!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First off, let me say, this was my first airbnb rental as was quite nervous. However, I was blown away at how easy Adam made the process. Communication was awesome and we were blown away at how perfect our stay was. The cabin was adorable, clean and so close to the things we did in Branson. We were very impressed. Thank you!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great weekend getaway. The space is great, was easy to find, and has a great private location. The host communicated everything we needed in a timely manner, also checked in and made sure we had what we needed. Can't wait to visit again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The drive to the cabin was beautiful. We loved the stunning location by the lake and enjoyed eating meals on the screened-in deck, listening to the birds and looking over the lake. The facilities were perfect with a large jet tub that was really nice to soak in, a super comfortable bed, an inviting fireplace to sit by while lounging in the living room, a nice kitchen to prepare meals and keep snacks in, and a washer/dryer to keep our things clean during the week we were there. We enjoyed our evening walks around the lake. It was a wonderful honeymoon setting for us, and was in close proximity to everything we wanted to see in Branson. Thank you, Adam!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this cozy cabin everything we needed was provided to start our stay. It was very clean and decorated so well it made us feel right at home. This was our first rental experience and we will look for rentals from Adam again.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My best friend and I wanted to meet in the middle of where we live and have a girl‚Äôs weekend and we chose this place because of its location- close to trails so that we could be outside but also near a town that we could eat in! This place was a GREAT choice! Adam‚Äôs instructions were really clear and helpful- and when I didn‚Äôt read them well enough and got a bit lost he was immediately responsive and helped me with the info that I needed. The place was so cozy- it had kitchen stuff that we needed and was a perfect temperature with a fan in the room that provided the white noise I can‚Äôt fall asleep without! We watched a movie on the couch with the fire going and drank tea and ate movie snacks. The actual residential area where the cabin is located was just as beautiful as the trails we hiked!!!! It was a great place. Such a blessing. Would go again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adam was friendly & responded to questions I had. We had stayed at another place near here & like the area.

Jacuzzi was our favorite spot
The TVs didn‚Äôt have the ability to cast from your phone to play content but we brought our own cable and it all worked out great üëç
Would definitely stay again"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at one of Adam‚Äôs cabin. My wife and I wanted a quite little place to celebrate our honeymoon and this was perfect. I was a little nervous when I saw it was a duplex when we arrived. My fears were put to rest because I never heard our neighbors. The cabins are well built. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed the privacy at the cabin.
All in all, a great place to stay definitely recommend to a friend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the homey feel of this cute little retreat! The Christmas tree was a splendid touch of season cheer upon arrival! We choose Branson as a destination for our 10th anniversary because of activities and entertainment.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! The place was very clean. The bed and couch were comfortable. Lots of kitchen supplies! I liked that there was a keurig and a normal coffee pot as I use a keurig and my mom likes an actual coffee pot. Close to the pool. Only a few stairs to get into the cabin. Had extra batteries in a drawer which came in handy when the smoke detector battery ran out so that was nice! The tub was large and actually filled up faster than most jacuzzis! We didn‚Äôt need to communicate much with Landon or Adam as they provided most of the information we might need prior to our arrival and then more info in the welcome book. We had a great trip and will plan on staying here again or another one of their properties as they were great hosts! Thanks for a great trip!

We had a minor heating issue, an issue that arises normally over the course of an HVAC operation. We had assumed this might be problematic as it was late in the day on a holiday weekend. Yet, we were pleasantly surprised to have the issues resolved promptly and on a weekend night no less. Thanks to the owner we had a pleasant, stress-free weekend at a beautiful property."
