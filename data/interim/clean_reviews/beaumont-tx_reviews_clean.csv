2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a quick visit to Beaumont and Richard’s place was perfect. It was easy to find, access, and very peaceful. The cottage its self was just as described and pictured. I didn’t take advantage of the pool but it looked so refreshing and I hope to next time. I will definitely stay again when visiting the area. Try it for yourself, you won’t regret it."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! And let us check in early when our schedule changed.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"It was nice staying for 2 nights. Just the barking from the neighbors dog at nights and the rooster at 6am. From there, we didn't had any problems, mostly because we live on an area where there's no external noise and we definitely know it's not the hosters fault. We will probably reserve again if we need to."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a nice stay at beaumont

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay there two weeks a year for 4 or 5 years now, and as always, it is a very pleasant experience.."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our hosts were amazing and thought of everything when stocking the place up. From the spices in the kitchen with even butter in the fridge to the earplugs just in case noise bothers you at night. They were very responsive and we’ve very appreciative of their hospitality!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly what I needed for the 2 nights of rest I needed. Place was clean and very private. I definitely would recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice host, comfortable bed and extra pillows. Even had a book of recommendations of what to do around the neighborhood. I was there only for a night for a business trip but would definitely stay again. Host had plenty of apps to watch shows."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard's place was in the perfect spot for me and my husband. Less than 10 minutes from every activity we had planned in the area. So cozy. Had everything we needed. The only thing we didn't like was the weather not being warm enough to use the pool area! So we have to come back when it's warm for sure!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous place, really homey
Loved the stay here
Honestly such a lovely place!!"
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, well appointed, and in a beautiful neighborhood. However, the windows were extremely dirty, in contrast to the rest of the garage apartment, which was extremely clean. Paint drops on the original hard wood floor (maybe from painting the beadboard ceiling) didn't give a good feeling of a well cared for accomodation."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and comfortable space in a beautiful historic neighborhood. Well stocked kitchen! We slept great and had tasty coffee in the morning.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are local, but needed a place to stay for a few days during home repairs.
It was a quaint, peaceful garage apartment with a relaxing deck.
It's an older home but thoughtfully remodeled and presented with a nice bathroom and kitchen.
If you don't enjoy this place... well, maybe you're too picky."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Perfect for what we needed.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! Super clean, warm and cozy. Safe neighborhood! Thank you!!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall, Richard's place was a safe stay for an evening. The PoolHouse is not level, though it felt like a very stable building.
Beautiful neighborhood, full of lots of historical homes, and southern charm.
The listing states the mattress is fairly new, however it was a rough night. I'd suggest one person sleep on the bed and one sleep on the couch- if you're traveling with 2 adults.
The place was in a safe location and gave us a place to stay for the evening."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great economical stay, and a beautiful historic district… All the amenities needed with just the right amount of historical charm!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was comfortable and the pool was nice and clean. Spacious enough for three people with the pull out bed. Unfortunately the wifi didn’t work as advertised
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything a quaint pool house should be! I feel very comfortable while staying during the week.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay when I had some work in Beaumont. Would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found this cute apartment to be as represented in the pictures and description. It's located in Beaumont's Historical Section among other lovely homes. It is clean and neat. The kitchen has most everything you might need including a variety of spices and condiments. What we loved the most was the availability of the outdoor space - the pool, floats, outdoor furniture. The local attractions listed on this rental included Tyrrell Park which we visited and enjoyed. We may not have found it otherwise. This apartment accommodate two people comfortably. It was perfect for us!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,Nice people
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only had a short stay but would have loved a longer trip. Its has a beautiful view of the pool from the private deck. We enjoyed the history of the home and the beauty of the original hardwood floors. The place is perfect for a longer stay with all the included amenities. I'm a light sleeper so the neighbors dogs were a bit loud for me but the host mentioned that in their post and provided ear plugs if needed. My friend had no problem sleeping right through it. The neighborhood was quiet and great to take a stroll and see the historic homes. Richard was great host and provided great instructions before arriving. I will definitely like to book a longer stay in the future during a warmer season so I can enjoy the pool as well.

I was emailed that morning with instructions on checking in.

The stay:
I really had a great time at the cottage with my one-year old. This was more than a regular hotel stay—this was a cozy and private stay with the amenities such as a kitchen to give a tiny-home feel.
On my second night, my sister and her boys visited. We all gathered around the fire pit, located under the string-lit sitting area. THIS was THE highlight.
I made a quick stop at the grocery store and bought items for s’mores. We all gathered together and enjoyed pizza, pasta, sodas, hot cocoa and s’mores.
Fire Pit: After messaging a request to use the fire pit, Richard responded and came by within five minutes. He was kind enough to light it and provide skewers to use.
iPhone and Android charging cables:
I forgot to pack mine. Richard provided both charging cables to use.
Pool: pretty, but due to the cold weather, decided not to enjoy this offered amenity
Upper Deck: nice for stargazing, chit-chat, and morning coffee"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place! Has everything you need. It was great that there was a little kitchen. The only minor complaint would be the noise of the train when you’re trying to sleep. The host does provide earplugs but I had to put in my headphones because the earplugs weren’t cutting it. I’m also a light sleeper, so that doesn’t help. Besides that, the stay was great!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!!!
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The mattress was so uncomfortable that I wasn't able to sleep on it by the 2nd night. A good night sleep is key when you stay away from home.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Pool House is a charming slice of Beaumont history hiding beside an exquisite pool. Nestled at the back of the property, with one wall covered with greenery, it’s a private oasis with comfort in mind.
I arrived well after dark and, as promised, the area was very well lit and I was easily able to find my way to the stairs for the unit.
The kitchen boasts full-size appliances, assorted cookware and is stocked with a variety of spices and condiments for your use.
A few beach towels are stored above the fridge for use by the pool, which is absolutely beautiful and I am devastated that I didn’t have time to take a swim.
Maybe next time!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was perfectly as described and very clean. We loved learning about the historical nature of the home, and got to see more history through the neighborhood as we walked to a nearby breakfast spot. Richard thought of everything to make our stay comfortable!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my first time using AirBnB and I was kind of nervous. It was a big difference staying here compared to staying at the Hilton but it was honestly the best experience me and my husband could have shared. It was so nice to be able to just relax and forget about our normal life.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There were some dogs barking and a adolescent rooster trying to crow (very funny) close by. It was not constant. I live in the country so if felt like home to me.

2024-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Ramona is lovely. However, their place needs maintenance badly. The garage is gross and dirty and had holes in the walls. The refrigerator has a smell as well as the freezer. The main bedroom bed frame is literally falling apart. There is a hole in the garage which allows loads of hot air up in the main bedroom closet and affects the inside temperature. The water pressure is very low. All of the bathrooms needs the caulking removed and replaced and basic maintenance. The main bathroom upstairs toilet wobbles. The powder room downstairs door doesn’t stay shut or lock easily."

The home provided everything we needed !! Ramona & Andy were super to deal with and even let us buy some of their personal artwork to take home to California where we will continue to enjoy their charm & serve as a reminder of our lovely trip to visit family in Texas. Southern hospitality at its finest !!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable & cozy stay with a unique flavor. We really enjoyed the decor and the vibe it gives to the house. There was plenty of room for our family of 5. We ate dinner together at the table and spent time surfing the various streaming services that were provided. The neighborhood was quiet. Everything we needed was with a 5-15 minute drive. Ramona was very responsive and a great host. We would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ramona's place is great! Highly recommended.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Aloha from Hawaii 🤙
Traveled to Beaumont to visit family and friends, we're so satisfied for booking with Ramona at her artful abode- felt like home away from home. Her hospitality and quick responses to inquiries made for peace of mind, the cozy, eclectic atmosphere provided us a sense of place in an otherwise uneventful town.
Happy was my wife and happy was my life, for deciding to stay here.
Mahalo nui Loa, much Kokua and Aloha from our Ohana to yours.

said it was a nice place. The kitchen was fully stocked and it had a grill. They enjoyed barbequing. The patio had a nice couch they could relax outside after work.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay! I was in town for a week on business. And this place lacked nothing.
1) Texas is hot and humid a lot of the year. The AC was cold and powerful. I’m not one to sleep hot. If it’s over 70 while sleeping, I’m not in a good mood. This place had great AC.
2) Bed was very comfortable. I especially liked that it wasn’t overly stiff. Blankets and sheets are breathable and nice.
3) Kitchen is EXTREMELY well equipped. I stay at BNBs often. This one was by far the most equipped with cookware, appliances, knives, etc. You could’ve cooked nearly anything and had the items to do so.
4) Clean. Place was very clean and the decor touches were so nice. I loved this place. Will book again when I’m in town."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really don’t know how to completely describe Ramona’s place. It’s something you really need to experience. It’s like walking into movie and art land with all the beauty and amenities of a a great AirBnB. Fully stocked kitchen with water and treats in every room. The bedrooms are beautiful with very comfortable beds. Art and movie posters fill every wall space and several bookcases filled with amazing books. I needed more time to explore her collection.
Looking forward to booking again in the spring."

If we ever come back to Beaumont for a lengthy stay, we will definitely come back to stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to town for a weekend wedding. The home was comfortable and conveniently located to everything we needed.

The third bedroom is upstairs and has its own bathroom. It is in a finished attic space that has narrow stairway. Third bedroom also has a window a/c unit plus central HVAC vents. For those with mobility concerns, there are steps leading up to front and back doors, and a handrail at back door. There is a nice, clean, large drip coffee maker in the kitchen.

And they provided a nice snack tray and waters in the refrigerator!"

His home is exactly as pictured. So cozy and quaint. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. All adults and children agreed. Large kitchen with breakfast nook was a great spot where my mom and I enjoyed coffee several times during our stay. Office area as well as a desk in one of the lower bedrooms where my son was able to do homework. Centrally located in Beaumont, just around the corner from a popular local restaurant.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Roomy and comfortable for a family of six. The upstairs loft provides a private space for older children. The large, fenced backyard provides a place to run and explore. The house shows its age, but that only adds to its cuteness and character."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alvin & Bethany's home was very comfortable and met our needs for the weekend. The beds were great and that is the most important to me. The entire house was very clean including bathrooms and kitchen. Everything was in good working order including the tv and wifi. The window seat in the kitchen is charming and very cozy. My son enjoyed parking under the attached carport as the weather was cold and rainy. The neighborhood is nice and we felt very safe. We would stay here again on a future visit to Bmt! Alvin is a great communicator and host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! The upstairs feels like a suite you would pay the nightly price on its own so you get an amazing deal with the whole house!

Wilson's restaurant. We found the mattresses very comfortable and the neighborhood was pretty quiet for a good night's sleep. Alvin is a great host, and he was very responsive when I had questions.

A handwritten welcome note, fresh cut blooms, snacks, drinks, and great communication made our stay feel effortless. Alvin & Bethany are the quintessential hosts!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thoughtful touches, like toothbrushes in the bathroom made this potentially stressful trip a joy. In town for our son's wedding. I had a place to finish sewing vests and plenty of areas for quiet and socializing. The only negative is that it seems that whenever my daughter comes to TX she brings rain, so we didn't get to enjoy the pool as much as we would have liked.
Sarah had no control over that."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time! The pool is perfect, plenty of outdoor space for the kids. The house was well equip, clean and beautiful! We’ll definitely be staying again as we come in to visit family often."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time in the house so much. Everything was clean and convenient. The updates were so nice and I have the feeling that lots of thought went into them, whether it was for those living there at the time or thinking of those who would be staying there later.
Either way, we loved it and highly recommend this rental.
Thanks so much. Renee Pepper"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a good experience; the host in Beaumont, Texas, were the best that we had in a very long time, ￼ the people that stayed in the place right before us ruined the couch (pets) and the host s replaced the couch in one day; just crazy awesome with their hosting. We felt so bad that they had to do that because it really made a big burden for them, but it was so kind of them that they did it so quickly. Incredible experience!!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We are a group of ladies who have been lifelong friends and travel together. Sarah’s place was as described and accommodated all of us comfortably. We like to explore during the day and Sarah nicely provided suggestions as to where to eat, shop or visit on her reservation site. At night we cooked our own meals and Sarah had a well stocked kitchen and space to move around. A plus for two of us that used the master bedroom was the beautiful, updated large walk in shower. Although we did not use the backyard pool this trip, it would be nice for families and others to enjoy, especially in the Summer. The neighborhood was peaceful and close to a well used community park, as well as grocery stores, restaurants and the mall. For us, her home had the room, the sense of being safe, the ambiance of a welcoming space and overall a pleasant place to relax and enjoy our girls trip time together. If we visit Beaumont or the surrounding area on another adventure, we would stay at Sarah’s place again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cost a little more than we usually pay, but was the perfect spot for the extended family, including a preschooler and a newborn AND a dog, to spend a week enjoying each other.

There was even a high chair and a crib which was so useful for us to have! Not only was the pool fun but there was also a little playhouse in the back and lots of space on the back patio to grill and for kids to play. The kitchen was one of the best stocked kitchens I have ever seen in an Airbnb. We loved the location because it’s close to lots of things like H‑E‑B and Walgreens to pick up last minute things. The host is so responsive and friendly. This is definitely a place we would rent again. All the money is well worth it.

2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Paula is an excellent hostess as communication was excellent. However, the house needs work. Many aspects of the house are worn out and need replacement or improvement.

The upscale safe and friendly neighborhood was a very appreciated bonus. The secure garage to park in made unloading and loading the car and luggage such an ease, (especially in the rain).
The home is very large, all the rooms have comfortable furnishing and is very clean.
The appliances all work and are extremely appreciated. The thought out fruit and goodie basket was a tummy pleaser.
The T.V works well with plenty of channel choices.
We traveled with our small dog and having a fully fenced back yard that is safe & secure was a highlight. The lawn is lush and well manicured.
This home has everything we could ask for and we would gladly pay a higher cost per night to stay here - it deserves more $ for the peace of mind and amenities Paula offers with her home. It’s a bargain price for luxury."

Check-in was a breeze and Paula was very responsive, and she even gave us some great recommendations for local places to eat when we asked.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simple and spacious was exactly what we needed. Luxurious stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph was an amazing host! He was extremely communicative and ensured we had all the instructions we needed to enter the home, connect to WIFI, etc. He was prompt to respond to any inquiries and was proactive in letting us know if there an additional item we needed to be aware of. The townhome is in the middle of a grouping of townhomes, so it felt very secure and safe, with not a ton of traffic coming in and out the neighborhood. The townhome was just as described and was very comfortable for two people staying. It's easy access to get out and around that side of town.
If I had only one thing that would be a minor challenge it would be parking was hard in front of the home, just due to where the home is located on the curve. There is a garage, but you would need a way to have a code that could be switched each time if someone wanted to utilize it without having to close it and then go back out the front door. I would definitely stay again for on next visit!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was as advertised. It could stand some updating. The bed was way soft which we were not used to. It was a relatively quiet neighborhood. Street parking was available. The master bedroom and bathroom are locked off which is sometimes common, but would be a plus. Overall it was fine for our week stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay affordable only thing is I don’t like parking my car on the side of the road bc ppl like my car a lil too much they break into it but besides that great place would stay here again :)

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,home away from home. Great stay comfortable
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend Joseph’s place if you are looking for clean, affordable, reliable, private accommodations in an accessible part of town. Uncovered street parking was readily available just a few houses down from the unit and the neighborhood was clean, quiet, safe, and quaint. The bed was very comfortable with fresh, clean, quality linens and I appreciate that the room had sturdy furniture and multiple surfaces to use for un/packing our bags. We had the whole place to ourselves which made for a comfortable stay. I would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joes place is very cozy and clean. The location is excellent. He is always available by text or phone. Joseph is a Superhost. Very nice guy.

Outside light was out, and with me coming in well after dark each night, that was a little disconcerting. Reported it to Joseph & he indicated he’d get that fixed.

A++++"

Anna is an outstanding host and the nicest lady ever :). When we needed to extend our stay in Beaumont, she was so kind and helped me modify the reservation. This was my first AirBnB experience and I got to say Anna and her beautiful home has set the bar extremely high."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super charming house with a great backyard!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautifully decorated and easy access to all necessities.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the layout of the house, especially the little office space and having some separation between the kitchen/dining and the rest of the house. The privacy-fenced backyard was fantastic for our dog and relaxing with family. We really appreciated being able to park in the garage. The only drawback was not having living room seating other than a couch. Would definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Anna was a great host! We had a Wi-Fi issue and she was so quick to resolve it for us. The house was exactly as described and the neighborhood felt safe and quiet. She had some nice coffee amenities and the towels and sheets were high quality.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this house and host!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna and Michael we were so comfortable here. We want to thank you so much for the attention to details. If I needed it you had it. Just little simple things and allowed me to continue as I do at home. The bed in the master is absolutely completely comfortable and we slept like babies. It made my reunion event much enjoyable after a wonderful nights rest. Thank you for the beautiful neighborhood and the tranquil atmosphere. You guys truly Rock!!! ❤️
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute house and quiet neighborhood!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna was a fantastic host! Everything was as advertised!! Her home was beautiful and very comfortable. Perfect for our stay in Beaumont.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very nice, well decorated and super clean. It was a comfortable experience."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The only downside is that there is only one tv in the place, which is located in the main living area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place! One of the nicest air bnbs around!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place is an absolute hidden gem! I was in town for a work event in Beaumont and had the absolute pleasure of staying at Anna’s place. I travel frequently for work, and 90% of my stays are in AirBnB’s. I can confidently say that Anna’s place is hands down THE BEST AirBnB I’ve EVER stayed in. From making my initial reservation, and throughout my stay, Ann’s communication with me was prompt, thorough and delightful. Anna even went above and beyond for me and took time out of her weekend to help me get a crucial overnight FedEx package. As far as the place itself, the pictures are EXACTLY what you’re getting…except BETTER. Anna’s place is extremely well kept, gorgeous, very clean, and immaculately decorated. What impressed me the most was her attention to detail. This place isn’t just bare bones with random decor. It’s obvious that Anna put a lot of time, thought, and love into this place. It truly feels like a comfortable HOME. It’s modern, clean, and has great little touches everywhere. Beds are comfortable, with plenty of blankets and extra pillows. Bathrooms are big, immaculate and very well decorated. Two sinks in the master and one in the smaller bathroom. Unlike a lot of places, the water pressure in the showers is PERFECT!! The kitchen is fully stocked with new appliances, and even a small basket of bottled water and snacks to welcome you. We didn’t have the opportunity to use the backyard, but it is also immaculate with two great areas to kick back and relax on the deck or around a fire. Cute little lights are strung overhead which gives off a really cool vibe. The lawn was freshly cut, and clearly well maintained. One nice touch was the access to the garage. Anna let’s you park your car in the garage and use the garage opener. This is something you don’t get with other places, and is great for families, and anyone who wants to keep their vehicle covered at night. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet and close to everything you’d need. I could go on and on about this place. To put it simply, Anna’s place is perfect and I’d recommend it to anyone and everyone who might be visiting the area. I wish Anna owned homes in every state I visited because I’d never rent from anyone else. Thank you Anna for a great stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a quiet, safe place for your stay in Beaumont, TX, Anna’s place is where you want to be. My family of four (2 adults, 2 children) stayed at Anna’s 2BDR, 2BTH home for a month while waiting to purchase a house. When we walked through the doors, the excitement on my kids faces meant everything to me. I knew we were in the right place and would enjoy calling Anna’s place our home for the month. The home was beautifully decorated and included many amenities that we needed for our stay including cookware, dinnerware, washer & dryer, and things that you may have forgotten. 😊Although there was a spacious backyard with two seating areas for a fire pit and a deck, our favorite past time was snuggling on the couch binge watching Netflix movies and shows on the weekends together as a family! In addition, this home is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood that is centrally located to supermarkets, gas stations, restaurants, and shopping centers. Anna provided excellent customer service and communicated with us before, during, and after our stay. Looking forward to staying at Anna’s 2BDR 2 BTH home in the future!"

If you’re thinking about it, just do it! It’s worth it!"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,a good place for a weekend stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great at this location! The neighbor must have gotten a new puppy because you could hear barking while inside but it never lasted long. The bed is REALLY tall now, I saw reviews saying it was low, now it’s really tall I’m 5’6 and the bed came up to the top of my stomach. Everything else was as described and it’s in a great neighborhood! The place is clean and beautiful! Would stay here again!"

Kayla's attention to detail, cleanliness, and ideal location make it the perfect choice for any traveler. I would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Read before you book! This place is not worth the $100+ a day that I paid. Here are some pros and cons of this place.
Pros: A/C works great, bed was super comfy, good location for me, great TV options.
Cons: -NO OVEN OR STOVETOP (what?!), they provide a one small burner, but as I went to get a skillet it was covered in layers of dust 🤮. Only options for cooking are microwave or small toaster oven.
-light in the living room didn’t work
-no trash can in the bathroom (very needed for me at this stay)
-small thing, but water pressure in shower was very light
-water and ice in fridge didn’t work, so I had to go buy a jug of water
-there was food in fridge that expired in Nov of 22…
Cleaning was not top notch like you would expect for this price. Upon leaving, she sent a list with 12 things to do before I checked out. Most that should be covered under the cleaning fee?"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla was able to get me in last minute while i was in town for a family emergency. Really nice place with great air conditioning during the heatwave. Easy all around, highly recommend if you are looking for safe and affordable!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful house in a quiet little neighborhood. House was very clean, all amenities that I needed were there. Felt warm and welcoming.
My one and only frustration was that the windows in the bedroom are very thin which allowed me to hear the 8 hour rain storm that passed through in the middle of the night. But it’s only a complaint because of the weather. I likely wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.
Would definitely stay here again if I’m in Beaumont!"
