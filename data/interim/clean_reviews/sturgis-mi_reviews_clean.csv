2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I brought my kids for the last hurrah before going back to school and we had a BLAST. France was very awesome and let us use paddle board and kayak. The pier was great for swimming and the water is awesome.
France, thanks for opening your home and allowing us some GREAT memories.
Peter"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,France was an amazing host! We loved the house and the lake. Everything was so clean. We will definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing week on the lake! I stayed with my extended family of 8 adults, and 3 kids. We loved having large tables inside and out so the whole family could eat together. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed, including an extensive spice drawer.
All the furniture and beds were very comfortable and AC on the 2nd floor made it very easy to get a good night's sleep.
It was great having plenty of deck furniture and shady spots to relax with a view of the lake. We enjoyed using both the kayak and paddle board to explore the lake, so much easier than trying to rent from the marina. The water was perfect and super shallow with a sandy bottom--great for the kids to swim and play! There were also 2 drying racks for hanging swim suits and towels that came in very handy.
There are a LOT of stairs from the road to the house which made carrying luggage and groceries difficult. However, we were glad the house was down close to the lake. Hoping to be back in the future!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage is our preferred destination for our annual girls’ weekend! It allows us to relax and take in the amazing views but also for us to kayak and walk. The deck and fire pit are in use almost the entire time with exception of when we are on the dock or doing activities.
The view of Fish Lake and all of the wild life is breathtaking.
Chris and Missy are the perfect hosts and are extremely friendly! We will definitely be back again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here for Labor Day weekend and it was PERFECT. Chris was extremely helpful and friendly. The property was immaculate and had everything we needed to have a perfect weekend getaway. The beautiful views, countless amenities, and private location made this a gem of a property. Will definitely be saving to hopefully return in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cottage. It was immaculate, beautiful and cozy. The lake is peaceful and relaxing. We especially had fun using the kayaks and the huge floating raft.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love this cottage so much we have stayed three times. It has a beautiful view of the lake and it is so peaceful. It is a great place to relax and leave your worries behind.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super host Chris was fantastic! So many amenities in the house, which I wasn’t expecting, coffee, tea, snacks, water, plus others that were advertised. His communication skills superb, including a binder with all pertinent information. Missy, his wife, has great style. Home was nicely decorated.
I felt like I was right at home! We got to meet their great family too!."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect size for the 4 of us. We loved the area. Perfect retreat if you are looking for peace and serenity. We were in the lake every single day. Fishing was good and we loved the kayaks. Beds are comfortable as well. After a long day in the sun, we loved sitting on the deck over the water and starting a fire. All in all we would definitely come back. On a side note outside of the property. Just know most restaurants are closed on Sunday-Tuesday, so be sure to pack food to cook. Chris was very kind, helpful, and quick to respond."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Cozy and clean cottage. We enjoyed the lake and fishing. Our kids had a blast!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I needed a little weekend getaway, and this was the perfect place for it! It was quiet and peaceful and we left feeling recharged and refreshed! We had everything we needed! Chris and Missy were very welcoming and kind, but let us do our thing while still being around if we needed anything. I’d love to come back to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I have been staying on Fish Lake for years and love it. This house was perfect for 4 of us. We prob could have even fit another with the couch pull out. It was clean, comfortable and they had everything we needed (and more they thought of everything right down to a first aid kit which we needed!). This part of the lake is amazing…shallow, clean, warm and full sun all day. Thankful for this house rental!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay on Fish Lake. The cottage is small but perfect for us. Chris was a great host and we’ve already talked about going back again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay on Fish Lake! Cottage was clean and comfortable and was stocked with all the necessities. We had a great time swimming off the dock, sitting on the deck, and kayaking around the lake. The flat top griddle grill was perfect for cooking out. We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was very last minute so I was afraid we wouldn’t be able to find a place to stay at all, and then we found this gem! We had so much fun on the kayaks and on the big floaty by the dock. We had a few fires for s’mores and even got to see a beautiful summer storm. The house was clean, cozy, and had all the accommodations listed. Chris lives next door so he came by to introduce himself and bring over a new coffee pot since the old one was cracked during the previous renter’s stay. He was very communicative and overall really wonderful to work with! I hope we can rent this magical little lake house again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, can’t wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was just what we were hoping for. Beautiful, peaceful lake, very swim-able, great deck and lake view from the house. We mostly stayed right there at the cottage. We really appreciated the abundant beach towels and fun snacks!
Highly recommend Trojan Timbers park for a great wooden shaded playground."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cozy cottage on a clean and peaceful lake . Everything you need and then some to make it comfortable. A place to retreat to where there are no other expectations than relax, enjoy the lake and cook food . It’s the best !
Second time I’ve stayed here and I love it.
Super nice and helpful hosts."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, beautiful home on the lake! Love to be extra surprises from the host-snacks and bottled water! Super easy to get in very communicative! We only wish we had more time to enjoy the home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and beautiful hosts. They were right next door and were incredibly friendly! They even went out of their way and surprised my 16 year old with a treat for her birthday. It was clean, enough room for all of us and very reasonably priced for a cabin right on the lake. We had fun and we’re able to relax. Win win in our book!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view beautiful home and so peaceful! I would recommend to anyone who wants small cozy and tight at home feel all in one! Chris was an amazing host and was super respectful!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for weekend get away peace and quite
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We named this the Fish Cottage as it is perfectly decorated with all things fish and was so bright and fun! This is a place to relax, enjoy the incredible views day or night, or go out on the water in kayaks. I normally like to unwind at the end of the day by watching TV, and there was a nice TV with firestick that didn’t get used! We didn’t want to burn any daylight or miss out on the cozy fire pit.
There are options for going out for meals but we didn’t want to miss out on staying at the cottage and either eating by the fire or on the back porch with tremendous views at either. We will be back!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"cut, comfortable bungalow"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place lake access was wonderful
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are repeat visitors and we loved the cottage like we did last year. Chris is a gracious host and all our needs were met.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest little cottage. It is clean and beds are comfortable. The outdoor space is wonderful with a deck and a dock. The water is clear and the kayaks add to the fun.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the cottage! Everything was just as described/pictured. It is a quiet, dead-end road/area of the lake. It was a nice area for walking or a run further along the lake past many cute cottages/homes. Our favorite spots were the deck and the screened-in porch, which was a great place for meals and games. We appreciated the kayaks, the inflatable, the deck chairs... all the amenities and lovely decorations. Communication with Chris was terrific. We had 4 adults - me, my husband and a grown son/his wife - and we wouldn't have wanted any more people as the cottage is cozy. The space works well, though, and had everything we needed. The beds were super comfortable. Ceiling fans and screened windows let us enjoy the cooler temperatures with fresh air day and night, but the air conditioner cooled things off in a hurry if needed. S'mores at the fire pit were also a highlight. Fish Lake has beautiful clear water and we enjoy the area. We would love to come and stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Nice lake and well equipped, Chris was easy to work with."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just wanna give a shout-out to Chris for being an awesome host while we stayed in his cottage. Our little family really enjoyed our stay here. It was so cozy, very comfortable, and definitely relaxing. Not to mention having lake access was absolutely amazing. We will definitely be back for another stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Have been here twice now and still LOVE it! Very relaxing and sweet little cottage, amazing view of the lake. The kayaks are a great perk and the raft is so relaxing. Love this place!!! Chris is also a very helpful host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cottage was great. Great golf course nearby as well as the food recommended. Would definitely rent again only longer next time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 3 had a wonderful stay at the cottage!! The cottage was nice and cozy, felt like home away from home. The lake in front of the house was perfect for our 2 year old to play in, not too deep. The Blackstone was awesome to cook on, nice touch. Chris & his wife were friendly and helpful- communication was a breeze, Chris was prompt to respond to any questions I had. We would consider coming back here again!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as listed and was a perfect place to sleep between rounds of golf. Easy coordinating with owners on arrival and departure.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for having us. The place made for a perfect little getaway for our family. Chris was proactive with providing all the useful info to make our stay as smooth as could be. The lake and inflatable raft were a hit with our boys and the neighbor-kids were very friendly, even inviting our boys to play. Thanks again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was an amazing host, and this property was quaint, clean, and lovely. The view off the deck overlooking clear and beautiful Fish Lake made for a couple days of fun, peaceful relaxation. Taking a morning paddle out on the kayaks was wonderful and the lake was quite warm overall in early July when we visited. Plenty of fun floating off the dock and there's a flat-top grill to use too! (now I want to get one!) Overall a great stay if you want to spend some close time with your friends or family."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a rustic cottage that is nice, but could use a bit more attention to detail from the owners that would really enhance the guest experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage on the lake. Very relaxing and peaceful.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was a great host and very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The place had everything as stated. It is a cozy cottage with kayaks, fire pit and screened in porch overlooking the water. It was a great place for a getaway. Shaded deck and a dock for sitting in the sun. Would def go back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable little cottage on a nice private lake . Was perfect for my 8 and 6 year old kids . Chris was available and helpful .
Everything you need is already in the cottage. They thought of everything. If I didn’t have to be back to work I would have absolutely stayed one more night .
It’s cute, cozy and comfortable. Definitely one of my most favorite places I’ve ever stayed .
Tucked away from traffic and noise but there’s a store and a DG and a gas station about 7 minutes away . Can’t compliment this place enough . I’m already looking to go back very soon ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved our stay! Very clean, full of amenities, hosts were great! Will definitely be back, and will stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Everything was perfect. Chris was an excellent communicator and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. When we told him we wouldn't arrive until after midnight, he made the pull-out bed, and left the lights on for us. Gorgeous scenery, quiet mornings and nights, and a perfect spot to either be in the sun or enjoy the breeze in the shade. This will be our go-to spot for future trips to visit family and friends."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Quaint cottage on a beautiful lake. We loved all the personal touches and the cottage was very well stocked with everything you might need, down to a first aid kit. Chris and his wife were lovely and responded to our requests and an unavoidable issue we had with hot water very promptly. They offered the use of their bathroom next door while it was being repaired. My kids loved swimming in the lake, the kayaks and fishing. We had a wonderful break. Thank you Chris and Family."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend getaway! Will definitely be back (hopefully) when the weather is nicer

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a blast! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great, it had everything we needed for a little weekend get away. Being right on the water and a spacious deck overlooking the lake was a great way to relax. Chris was great with communication, was always quick to respond, and gave some great info about the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a quiet getaway. Located close enough to Chicago for a quick trip, but far enough away to get away from it all. The cottage is immaculately clean, comfy and well stocked. The host really did think of everything. The deck overlooking the lake is the perfect place to relax with a fire after spending the day in the water (inner tubes & kayaks). The home also has lake access with a pier (bring your boat?). The water off the pier is not deep and crystal clear, perfect for families with younger children. The location is tucked away so prepare for a short drive (15 - 20 minutes) for groceries etc. We totally relaxed and enjoyed ourselves and look forward to visiting again next year."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! All amenities provided were used and helpful. Loved the view every morning, wish we could have stayed longer."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This little cottage was the best place for a little get away. We loved the interior decorations. It was very cozy and perfect for our family. The view of the lake was stunning. Chris was very accommodating. We can’t wait to visit again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I absolutely loved our stay here! The house was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We spent a lot of time swimming and sitting on the deck the weather was perfect for a nice fire in the evening. Chris was very friendly and easy to get ahold of. Couldn't have asked for anything else out of the experience truly a little piece of heaven. Can't wait to go again next season!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The cottage is super cute and clean. We have two boys. They had a great time. This is the perfect family setup. The cottage is equipped with everything you will need. The lake is clean and safe for kids to swim. We hope to return soon.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cabin and the beautiful surroundings. Great location, right on the clear and warm Fish lake. We swam off the dock and used the kayaks provided at the dock. Enjoyed watching the boaters go by on the lake while sitting on comfy chairs on the deck (under the shade from the oak tree). Played games on the screened in porch. Porch to the deck was only steps away, everything very convenient. Cabin is updated and stylishly decorated. Chris let us know we could check in early and also let us know we could stay later than 11 due to the schedule that day, which we appreciated. We want to return soon. Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to get away
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have many wonderful memories from our stay on Fish Lake. Perfect weather helped provide an opportunity for us to unwind, relax, and take in all that summer at the lake has to offer. Fishing off the pier and kayaking around the lake were highlights of our time there.
Chris was a great host and the cottage was equipped inside and out with everything we wanted and needed. We were also grateful for the comfortable beds and pillows."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay included some severe storms, and power outages. Chris kept in contact with us and the neighbors kept checking on us to make sure we were OK. Despite mother nature having other plans in store for us, we did enjoy our stay! The cottage was beautiful- cozy, clean and with amazing views. looking forward to revisiting again in the future!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"An absolute gem! The lake was fantastic, cottage was spotless and super cute… beds were so comfy and the kitchen was well stocked. The Blackstone grill was a fantastic surprise and so useful. Everything was perfect with lots of thoughtful touches. Chris and Missy were very friendly and accommodating. I can’t wait to go back!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Small fishing cottage. Not much to do in the area so if you’re looking for a quiet stay by the water this will be a good fit for you! Enjoyed access to the kayaks and swimming.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here for a 3 day girls getaway. The lake is beautiful and so clear. Chris and his family are great hosts and neighbors! He truly meant that if we needed anything to let him know and he was right there. We will book this stay for many weekend getaways! thank you!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was great! We enjoyed the lake, the kayaks, and the campfire. Thank you, Chris, everything was wonderful!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Chris' cottage. It's great to be right on the lake. This lake is quiet and relatively small, which makes it great for kayaking and probably swimming (we were there in October so we only kayaked). It's incredibly peaceful and beautiful.
Chris is a responsive, responsible host. The cottage was lovely with so many cute stylish touches. Beds comfortable. We had a lovely visit. We visited Plumb Lake County Park for some hiking and enjoyed checking out Shipshewana with its cute stores and Amish countryside. I would love to return."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The cottage is so cute and very comfortable. It’s decorated very nicely with lots of nice little touches that go together beautifully to create a fun, cheerful vibe. Chris and Missy were absolutely perfect hosts - they were available and friendly if we needed anything but gave us plenty of space and privacy. The weather was beautiful the day we arrived and Chris even set up an awesome inflatable raft in case we wanted to use it (it ended up being not quite warm enough but was such a thoughtful and generous thing to do and so appreciated)! The couch and beds were comfortable and we slept great. The cottage had everything we needed. There is no oven but there is a two-burner stovetop, a toaster oven, a microwave, and a grill, plus any utensils one could need, as well as a coffee maker and coffee. They seem to have thought of everything, with a little snack basket set out, information about nearby stores and restaurants, rafts, a bags set, books, and board games. The view is great, we spent most of our time on the deck which is right on the water, and the fall colors were lovely. The sunroom was also very cozy and a great place to eat, color, etc.,
Every aspect of our experience was great, and this place was very nicely and thoughtfully our together. I can definitely see is returning here for future relaxing getaways."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Chris’s place was amazing. We had such a relaxing long weekend. The cottage was sparkling clean when we arrived. The view of the lake is amazing.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly a hidden gem. Like literally. It’s easy to miss a turn so drive carefully and safely especially at night. Love that it’s remote and the lake is a few steps from the cabin! Gorgeous view. Warm and friendly hosts. Hoping to return. ❤️
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic find! Such a beautifully decorated place - the pictures do not do it justice! Tons of amenities including kayaks and an awesome propane griddle, puzzles and games, well supplied kitchen, snacks. The beds were so comfortable and sheets smelled nice. And of course the lake - clear and warm water, great deck overlooking the water. Wish I could have stayed longer! Very small place but set up perfectly to make use of the space."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was great! He was super responsive to all our questions. It was a girl’s bday weekend and he even left us some beer ❤️. Would recommend!!

We would definitely stay again! The cottage was very clean, which is extremely important to me. They left little snacks for us and had things for the family to do, such as games, kayaking, and a raft to float on. Chris and Missy were always available should we need anything. They were quick to respond and we enjoyed chatting with them in person too! It was perfect for our family!
-Lisa"

This place is great for a couples getaway as well as a family weekend with kids. Neighbors are very friendly & helpful with recommendations for area supplies. Most restaurants are a good 20 minutes away so bring some food with you or cook/grill your own here. We enjoyed our stay & wouldn’t hesitate to come back.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a fun girls trip at this wonderful location. It was clean and comfortable with a quiet and tranquil setting. Great communication with the hosts. The only thing I need to let people know about is if it's hard for you or anyone in your group to do stairs you probably would want to find a different location. Other than that the place was wonderful with lovely added touches and surprises!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time enjoying the campfire and the hot tub was wonderful. We had a very relaxing visit and would love to come back again sometime soon. My hostess was very communicative so that was a big plus!

The property is very easy to find and looked exactly as pictured. Here are some highlights:
- Streaming services on the tv were top notch.
- Fully equipped kitchen. There were even fancy snacks, and the coffee provided was delicious.
- In-unit laundry with laundry supplies (even laundry sanitizer).
- Ample cleaning supplies
- Spacious shower with very hot water (huge plus for me).
- Super friendly dogs that greeted me after work and were excited to play fetch.
Anthony and Lisa were very responsive and open to suggestions as well. They even brought me a Clorox toilet wand and dropped off extra toilet paper when it was needed, which was the icing on the cake for this experience. They were also flexible with me when I needed to shift my arrival or departure times.
Lastly, I loved the smell from the smoker in the backyard."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anthony and Lisa are AWESOME hosts and all-around good people. Their Upper Room apartment was the perfect place to stay for the 6-weeks I was assigned to work in Sturgis, MI. I loved the ample windows and natural light.
The apartment was also fully equipped with everything needed to feel like you are right at home. Since I was in town during winter months working on a construction project, I'd often return dusty from the job site. Having cleaning supplies on hand to be able to tidy up was a huge bonus.
I can't wait to come back to visit. I left feeling like I made new friends!"

After selling our home and quickly needing a place to feel like ""home"" during the transition into our new place, they were quick to respond and eager to help. Their place is easy to find and get in and out of. We had a private entrance and the space was absolutely perfect. The right size for my husband, son, and I to nestle in for a few weeks. I work remotely, so being comfortable where we go is really important to me and I love the sun streaming in the windows while i enjoy my coffee and get my work day going in the morning. Throwing a quick load of wash in mid-morning, and having little else to fuss over. Thanks again Anthony and Lisa... We appreciate you!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location a little difficult to find. It’s the red house. You stay over the garage. We loved that because it was very private and very cute. Bed is comfy and shower had great water pressure. Nice to have a full kitchen as well. We plan to go again. 🥳

Thank you for everything!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s place was spectacular. This location has so much to offer - truly a playground of fun on a private lake. Scott is an extremely gracious host and we hope to be back soon for another relaxing weekend.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Scott's. It was perfectly located for the wedding we attended. We got to kayak and have bonfires. It was the perfect retreat for us!! We had everything we needed. Shoot was very kind and friendly. The outdoor shower is so cool!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My two children and I stayed at Scott and Becky’s trailer and it was more wonderful than I could have imagined. We received a warm welcome and was walked through everything we had access to. The lake is breathtaking and the beach area was so clean and lovely with so many different activities. And it’s only steps away from the trailer! The kayaks and paddle boards were very nice and easily accessible. Slides, toys and floating docks. We were even able to use the smaller fishing boat to explore on our own. I have never driven a boat before but Scott helped and make it clear for me so I felt comfortable. It was such a wonderful trip and every single one of my questions/needs/requests were answered immediately. I would 100% recommend and urge anyone (especially families with kids) to stay here. I promise you will be overjoyed by the experience. It was above and beyond anything I could have expected! Scott and his immediate family and grandchildren were so much fun and we will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place was wonderful. It was a last minute booking, and he was completely accommodating. Absolutely beautiful lake. Scott was super friendly and helpful whenever we needed. 10/10 recommend and we hope to visit again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for me, I found the quiet and water (lakeside) I was needing. Scott is responsive and I had everything I needed. Very quiet at night for sleeping—with a good bed. Loved getting out on the water where the lake wasn’t busy or crowded."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great get away! We look forward to more stays! 😊
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time. Everything was wonderful, we enjoyed the kayaks and paddle boards and fishing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott is one of the best Airbnb hosts ever.
The camper van and the area exceeded our expectations! The van is extremely comfortable. On the site, you can take an e-fishing boat and kayaks, use a local beach, firewood, and if you have a kid, a trampoline and other toys. All the listed are for NO additional cost.
This was an ideal weekend! Highly recommend! Thank you for hosting us, Scott!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is truly an outstanding little getaway for the price and the host was just the nicest guy and nicest family ever. This would be a slice of heaven for a family with younger kids and really anybody it was a great time. Highly recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Quiet and pretty.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Scott was great and his family made me feel like I was one of the family! Great place to stay will be back!! Would definitely recommend to someone traveling to this area!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott is an excellent host. The location is beautiful with plenty to do. Scott made his boats available if I wanted to use them, there are hiking trails nearby, and there is plenty of firewood to build a campfire next to the lake. Scott is friendly and he makes you feel comfortable. I enjoyed my time at this AirBnb."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely a wonderful experience! I would give 6 Stars if I could... because they exceeded our expectations 100%! I would definitely recommend them (as long as you're not trying to book them for a weekend we want to go lol 😂)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating and beautiful lakeside spot!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m making this review in case there’s anyone like me thinking of renting this place out. It was clean and very pretty aesthetically. Although, if you’re looking for a nice private getaway with your significant other, I think you should pass this one by. Becky was very aware of us wanting privacy and was extremely friendly. Scott was someone with good intentions but seemed to have a hard time discerning what a respectable time was, to interact with guests. With the camper being decently close to their house he would come to it several times a day and talk to us. They can very easily see you and what you’re doing from their house. He came and knocked on the door the first night, later in the evening and a lot of the other different interactions felt intrusive. With all that being said, we decided with the lack of privacy and not feeling like we were having a very restful weekend, we left the night before we needed to. To go home and try to rejuvenate from all the different interactions."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a relaxing time. The view was wonderful and my friend even ventured out on a paddleboard, to try them out. Scott made sure we had everything we needed and was readily available if we had any questions. Perfect little weekend get away!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb experience we ever had. Scott and Becky are the best hosts. Their property is so beautiful and the atmosphere is very serene. We had a great time and thankful for all the amenities they provided like fishing boat, kayak and paddle boards and many more. We have been wanting to experience paddle boarding and Scott helped us do it. He was a very good teacher. Also, the lakefront camper was perfect for the two of us. We had our own dock, firepit and picnic table. We already are planning another trip for next year. We are thankful we found this place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most beautiful place with the most beautiful family - wow!!!
This was our favourite place in our road trip, over 15 air bnbs and this was stand out by far. We went elsewhere after and we definitely peaked coming here!
Trailer is a great size, so well equipped - Scott and Becky are THE best hosts we have ever come across. Couldn’t have done more for us, they are just wonderful humans!
The place is truly sensational and like a little slice of heaven, we will be back - we could easily come here and stay for weeks."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really amazing place. The lake is incredible. If you want a beautiful peaceful low key spot, this is it. Hosts are kind, friendly and eager to share all the interesting things to see and do in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Relaxing quiet location!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Scott's RV.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There are not enough words to describe this vacation. The location,, amenities were all beyond expectations.
The camper is simple and perfect. Because we were all worn out from the day’s activities that sleep was easy and peaceful.
The lake was beautiful and we enjoyed even on some rainy days.
Scott and his family welcomed us, included us and made sure we had all we needed. We are already planning a mini trip again for this year and a long one for next year. Don’t overlook this hidden gem"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely lake and LOVE the generosity with the water crafts.
Scott is very personable and helpful during your stay.
Definitely coming back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place. We loved paddle boarding and the cool race car paddle boat. Scott was a great, very attentive host. Sitting on the dock after dinner was our favorite way to end the day.
Scott says they are getting new WiFi soon, but as of now it does not really work— just a heads up.
Not too much in surrounding town, but plenty of activities at the camper. The lake is beautiful and serene."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Well worth the price for views and amenities!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The camper experience was great. Scott was a super host. We had everything we needed. It was comfortable, relaxing, and fit our needs. I would book again without any hesitation."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott was a great host with a wonderful location. He welcomed us well when we arrived and explained everything about the trailer we needed to know. He was also available to answer any questions we had during our stay. The trailer had everything we needed for our stay and the lake provided a great view and fun entertainment.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a peaceful and beautiful retreat on the lake. I enjoyed my stay so much: lots of swimming, kayaking and reflecting.
The hosts are amazing: caring people. Such a lovely family.
This Airbnb is highly recommended. I will plan to come back.
Thank you, Scott and Becky"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I were looking for peace and beauty and that is exactly what we got. When we arrived, we met Scott and he showed us around. There is so much to do without leaving the property. The camper is small, but perfect especially when you get to roll out of bed and see the lake. My mom and I were able to float on the lake, make fires, play games outside, etc. It was everything we wanted and we hope to book again. To sum it up- Scott is great and the lake is amazing!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,can't ask for a better place you got all that you need in the camper or at your fingertips
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! Fun amenities, beautiful location, and an overall peaceful getaway. Every detail was thought of and Scott was so helpful and welcoming. Would recommend to anyone!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful is the word I would use to describe our stay!!! Our host, Scott was welcoming from moment we arrived!!! The property has so many amenities you will never be bored....I highly suggest the large swing!!!! We enjoyed a campfire each night!!!! The lake is so quiet and private, aside from the bass jumping at night...hahaha!!!! We enjoyed a relaxing boat ride around the lake where we even got to see a couple swan and their babies!!! By the end of our stay we absolutely felt like family just staying at a lake house!!!! I very high recommended this perfect place!!! We'll be back!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a valuable experience!
The host communicated really well.
It is a gem where you can do a campfire while looking at the lake. The camper/RV was convenient with all the heating, shower, and kitchen. When I had a reservation, I only camped when I had a reservation, and it seemed like there was a little bit of a spoken part. (Whether it was a melting shauer, an electronic blanket, etc.), and the owner's (dong) Mme (sheep) (sheep) people (dong) (Mme (sheep) () people who don't think it was short, so I felt a little more. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh, it was nice that I even enjoyed kayaking, swimming, table tennis, etc. The ramen I cooked here really tastes like life."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Theres lots of activities to do even if it rains but look forward to returning another time when the weather is nicer
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Scott is an amazing host he went out of his way to make sure my husband and I had an amazing trip!!! The access to the kayaks makes for a perfect day on the water..... I've got to publicly state this.. Scott cooked my husband and I steaks for us last night and not only did he cook them for us and teach my husband how to cook steak he did it perfectly the best t bone both of us have ever had..... He is quite literally the best host we have had to date!!! just an amazing family amazing property and beautiful scenery!!!! We will be back for sure!!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A family emergency prevented us from staying and resulted in a late cancelation. Scott was awesome with communication from start to finish. He went above and beyond to help us get a full refund. We hope to reserve a lake stay in the future.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"They are both amazing hosts. The location was perfect being right by the lake, everything was just as described, and the camper was very clean. Communications were clear. Scott and Becky are wonderful people. I highly recommend their place."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my introduction to RV life (as I’d never been in one before)! Was a great place to come back to after long days of fossil-hunting on the coast.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The owners were great. They made us feel very welcomed. They treated us like family. Highly recommended. Great place to relax as it is right on a lake.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had grate time..!! Camper was clean and cozy… Lots to do on a lake.. fishing, swimming, tubing… owner gave us boat to use for free… very nice, considerate family…. My nine year old had a blast…."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was absolutely great! It is a small camper but our family of four fit well. Scott was quick to respond to any questions we had or things we personally forgot to bring with, he was quick to help us! The kids loved the game garage and my fiancé and I had a great time fishing each night. Although we had a storm knock the power out while there, Scott brought us some candles and lanterns so we could enjoy our board games. Our kids are far apart in age (13&5) and they both had a blast! Thank you for everything! This quiet camper was exactly what this “go go family” needed before the school year begins."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Scott's place, it was just what we needed to end our summer! I have three boys ages 12, 13, and 7 and there were many things for them all to do. It was like being at a summer camp, but on a quiet and peaceful lake that is surrounded by many beautiful farms! On our short stay we fished, kayaked, paddle boarded, swung, swam, slide off the new slide on the beach, trampolined, used the floats, played ladder ball, carpet ball (a fun new game introduced to us), ping pong, and spent quality time relaxing around the fire at night. Scott even let my youngest ride around on his electric John Deer riding toy. Scott provided unlimited firewood for us which was much appreciated. However the highlight of the trip was for sure going out on Scott's one of a kind pontoon boat! This is a must in the warmer months! My boys had so much fun jumping off the platforms, and Scott was so kind to let them take turns driving the boat and even took awesome pictures for us. We also received a beautiful tour of the lake and learned some of the history. The camper was very clean, and although a little tight with 5, with an extra mattress provided, it worked well for our family! There were lots of nice extra touches like coffee and some snacks and water, soap, shampoo and conditioner, and a book with all kinds of information about the area. I am sure the area is absolutely beautiful in the fall too. Scott and his family (especially his sweet and adorable grandkids we got the pleasure of meeting) are warm and wonderful people and you will leave feeling like you made new friends. The value for what you get at Scott's place is unbeatable! My boys asked if we could come back every year. I am sure you will love Scott's place as much as we did. Don't hesitate to book!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This camper was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had. It’s the perfect spot for a weekend getaway, just steps from the lake. Scott and Becky are so friendly and accommodating! I utilized the kayaks for both a sunset ride and again in the morning. I went on this trip solo and felt super safe on the property. My only regret is not staying more than one night! I will definitely visit again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place is perfect! This little slice of heaven was exactly what my husband and I needed! I couldn’t think of a better way for us to have celebrated 11 years together. Scott, Becky and their family were great! Kind, exciting, thoughtful, fun, welcoming and just all around the sweetest ppl. And the view! Forget about it! It was perfect. The water and surrounding trees and flowers, the peace you get in this place is unmatched. Definitely can’t wait to visit again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! We couldn't have asked for a better way to relax and spend time together. Scott and Becky's camper had everything we needed to relax and unwind. They were welcoming and available whenever we needed them. Beautiful quiet lake. Kayaks and paddle boards, trails, bikes, and a camper with bed, kitchen, bath, and room for our stuff. Great stay. Recommended!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had excellent and very occomodating hosts at this airbnb location. This place is a sweet little slice of paradise on a lake. We had access to kayaks, swings, a trampoline, and plenty more amenities. The RV felt very private and had plenty of space. We would gladly stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic stay at “Lake Life”. The amenities were fantastic. We grabbed a hot lunch at Yoder’s and sandwiches for dinner to take back to the lake. We enjoyed floating on the lake and playing some carpetball. Scott was very helpful on letting us know all that we could do to enjoy “Lake Life”. We had a bit of rain but it gave us a rest time in the afternoon. We recommend this stay for any couple or small family.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely one of our favorite Airbnbs! The host and his family are the salt of the earth and went out of their way to make sure that we were having a nice time and enjoying ourselves. The location is stunning and there is so much to do that it was hard to fit it in in one weekend! We are already checking our calendars to see when we can stay next and will be booking for longer this time!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view to relax to or have fun with the variety of activities on the property. The beach was perfect for our toddler who also loved the kid sized water slide, swing set, and trampoline. Toddler happiness = mom and dad happiness. We also appreciated the pack n play that he had on hand for nap time. Scott also offered a high chair, but it wasn't necessary for us. It was a great getaway for our family."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is exactly as described, clean, functional, and overlooking a peaceful lake. The Kayaking was definitely the crown jewel of the trip. Enjoy all the recommendations Scott provided for the nearby trails and restaurants. Will visit again to relax and recharge."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little getaway! Scott was more than accommodating and was there to help us with whatever we needed! Thank you!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would say this is a diamond in the rough but there was nothing rough about it! The camper was very clean and very roomy. There was an outdoor shower, small beach, kayaks, pontoon boat and so much more. Can't recommend this place enough."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location and personal attention from the host were greatly appreciated. Enjoyed connecting with their family and liked how the location was family friendly and centralized to a nearby park area for our 22 month old, lakes for fishing for my husband, and Camp Amigo for hiking trails."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Hosts are super warm, detail oriented and genuinely care about your experience. The lake was serene and gave us great views for a peaceful getaway from the city."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Lake Life. Scott and Becky were amazing hosts: very attentive, informational, thoughtful, and friendly. The lake and property are beautiful and we enjoyed kayaking and taking the boat out. Scott had a fire ready for us and we were welcomed with a warm greeting. I would recommend Yoder’s for an afternoon lunch and don’t forget their delicious donuts for the next morning. RV was clean, functional, and comfortable and everything the property had to offer was easily accessible. Can’t wait to come back with the kids in the summer to go swimming, fishing and to play carpet ball."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 1 year old daughter and I stayed at Scott's Lake Life camper for a 2 night weekend getaway while in town visiting family. We absolutely LOVED it! The host was beyond attentive and hospitable. He was extremely quick with responding to messages or any issue we had. He made sure we had anything and everything we needed our entire stay! The camper was so nice and roomy! Even with our pack and play up at night we had plenty of room to move around! The bed and sofa were super comfortable as well! Overall, we had an amazing time despite not spending much of our days there. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. Our first morning there was pretty chilly so we played carpet ball in the garage just feet from the camper. Such a fun game! Our last morning was beautiful and warm so we enjoyed the relaxing water and fisherman. Wifi is provided on the deck of the hosts home, but at the camper we had no wifi or phone signal and we really enjoyed that! It was great to unplug for a few days! Definitely intend to make it our go to spot when visiting family and are already planning our next stay, hopefully this summer! 10/10 would reccomend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The miller’s hospitality was second to none from check in to checkout was an absolutely amazing experience the lake was gorgeous and literally steps from the door the weekend was absolutely incredible 10/10. Yoder’s doughnuts are a must try as well as the amigo center for some beautiful trails will definitely be booking again!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Millers are wonderful hosts and the location is awesome. The camper is cozy and right on the lake. It was so nice to have kayaks, access to a fishing boat, firewood, and indoor ping pong as a part of the package. The Fall is beautiful here and this is a great location to explore all the rivers and streams in the area. We definitely look forward to returning in the summer for lake fun."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four (two little ones) had a blast at Lake Life! The pristine lake is mere steps from the RV, with a campfire ring and an awesome dock just in front. A perfect beach is adjacent, with inviting sand and a super handy launch pad/dock (I made up this term) for the kayaks and paddle board (I've never gotten in and out of kayaks so easily). The RV is comfortable, clean, and complete with all the camping amenities you could want (even coffee filters, wine bottle opener, can opener, a night light, etc etc etc). Is it the Ritz? No, but it is truly perfect. I brought our own blankets, but didn't even bring them out of our car, as the linens and comforters provided were clean, fresh and warm. My kids enjoyed everything about this slice of heaven: the beach, the kayak rides, the unique swings, the giant trampoline, the animals on the neighboring farms, the roaring campfires, the bike trailers, and they even got a such a kick out of sleeping on the full size sofa bed. We did not use the pontoon or other boat on this trip, but did have a great hike in the neighboring trails, and were so taken by the entire experience. We will definitely be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to kick back and relax!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The peacefulness and comfort of this place far exceeded our expectations. Scott was super kind and personable, and accommodated changes in our arrival time without issue. Very communicative and friendly. Arriving to a campfire and the brightest stars we’ve ever seen was the perfect way to start our cross-country move."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great 1 day trip. RV was located less than 50ft from from the lake. Suite of options for guest to use makes this property truly unique.
- Several kayaks and paddle boats. They also had couple of others boats.
- kids have options galore to enjoy there time. From trampoline to slides and swings. Scott, the owner of the property was gracious enough to offer bikes and stroller for local exploration.
- Full marks to Scott to keep the guests engaged. He was always available for any help. Took us on fun ride on his pontoon boat shared some interesting tit bits on some local fun options. When we showed some interest in hiking option, Scott and his wife picked up a map for us while on their evening walk. That was a touching jesture. We enjoyed the hiking route that Scott suggested.
All and all a great place. Too bad we only stayed for a day. We will surely revisit next season."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s place is really pretty and you have a great hospitality at this place. I strongly recommend this place for the weekend.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There is no better location, than this spot. Right on the lake, trampoline, playground, beach, pier. My little one caught her 1st fish here! Outstanding location & hospitality! Absolutely beautiful pontoon rides! All was just amazing! We cooked outside, but full camper kitchen was inside. The fridge was bigger than we expected. DVD player with some movies included. We heard owls, coyotes, cows & saw sandhill cranes, turtles, swans, horses, frogs. We will definitely be back!!!!!!!!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect lake retreat for anyone that wants to slow things down without compromising any creature comforts. The lake is beautiful and quiet with lots of wildlife; swans, cranes, hawks, fish and other little woodland critters all make an appearance. We used the kayaks and paddle boards and had a blast exploring the lake. We stayed two nights, one of which was rainy, but we had a great time, making a camp fire the first evening. Our host even offered extra time after scheduled checkout to enjoy the lake since one of our two days was rainy. He and his wife were extremely welcoming and available for questions. The country roads are also great for long distance rides; there are quite a few small towns and lakes that can be explored on bike. We had a great time and will be back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To anyone feeling extra stress, consider a midweek daycation. I took my 1 year old for some special time with mommy. We swam at the beach, played on the swings. Napped and had meals in the camper. We went to the nearby hiking trails, where there is also a playground. It was very beautiful and peaceful. However, if you're looking for more adventure they have kayaks, a trampoline, various boats and party pads. Hosts are very hospitable and down to earth. I will definitely be back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott was a great host. We enjoyed all that his place had to offer (especially for the kids)

Scott took us on a boat ride around lake. While not a big lake, it was perfect as it was not crowded like other lakes during summer. A funny incident where the pontoon ran out of gas about 100 yards to the shore and Scott was ready to jump into the water, swim to the shore and get some gas. He made one last attempt to tilt the gas tank and the boat got enough gas to get us to shore. It was a lot of fun.
We will be back next year!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We cannot get over how much fun we had just disconnecting and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere here! Scott was a fantastic host and had great tips for places to go and things to do. We took the kayaks out a lot and with Scott’s directions found the most peaceful spots on the lake to relax in take in the beauty. It’s a clean camper right next to the water. We enjoyed a campfire almost all day everyday with lake views. Overall amazing experience!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time at the RV on the lake. Loved kayaking, paddle boarding, swimming and fishing at the lake (just a few feet away from the Airbnb). The hosts were great and even invited us on their pontoon boat! Would highly recommend this vacation rental!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and his family were responsive, kind, and enjoyable to talk to. The RV was clean and adorable. We kayaked many times and the lake was perfect! The space is pretty close to the house (as mentioned in the post and pictures) but we really enjoyed some socializing :) Also very kid friendly!! We had an amazing time, adore Scott and Becky, and will be coming back!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lake life is great. Scott is an amazing host. He is super friendly and helpful. Our family had an amazing time. Definitely recommend.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time here. Scott and family were fantastic hosts; super friendly and hospitable but also gave us all the privacy we needed. The kayaks, bikes, and paddle boards made the lake a lot of fun, we didn’t have time to take the pontoon out but it looked like a blast. Thank you Millers!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our one night on the lake on Scott's beautiful property. The camper was comfortable and clean, and had its own little sitting area next to the lake. Scott's hospitality was amazing. He even had a fire going for us when we arrived. The lake offered swimming and kayaking, and Scott generously offered use of his kayaks. Thanks Scott!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a relaxing time, even though my weekday two day trip was short, I got so relaxed in that span of time which was the goal. Using the kayaks at will to enjoy the clear cool water any time I wanted so such a bonus. The natural wildlife in the early morning or later day so beautiful to watch. Fish, birds, frogs, lily pads, etc. Trying SUP for the first time with the Hosts encouragement so cool! The water, oh, so clear and fresh just wonderful. As a female solo traveler I liked having the Hosts nearby and the residential feel of other adults/children along the lake doing their thing made it homey. The camper is cozy and just right for getting rested, cleaned up and out again for more fresh air and beautiful lake life nature adventures. It was also perfect for a late afternoon book reading/nap sesh. I have told several friends to look up this listing and I hope to return myself. Thank you Scott and Becky"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed on a few lakes in Michigan, and this is probably my favorite. It's quiet enough for kayaks and deep enough for ski boats. The camper was great for 2 of us, and we were supplied with everything we needed (fire wood, A/C, lawn chairs). The kayaks and paddle boards are such a nice treat. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Just keep in mind it's a camper, and you'll have a great time."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott's place is AMAZING! He is such a good host! We got to go out on his specially made pontoon boat, take out a small bass boat and had free access to kayaks and paddle boards. The RV is literally steps from the water. I was worried the AC wouldn't keep us cool enough in this 100 degree heat but it worked fantastic! The lake is nice and secluded and yet every store you could need is within a 10 minute drive. This is that little hidden gem that you don't want to tell anybody else about so that you can keep it all to yourself!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough good things about Lake Life and The Miller's. They are probably the nicest people I have ever met. The scenery there is enough to make you want to look at real estate! Alot of wonderful memories made and many more to come. I can't see any enough good about this, try it for yourself!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There's a handful of things to here, come and enjoy the place 😀😀"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean! Awesome lake and a cozy camper. Scott was a great host.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott was very helpful and greeted us as soon as we arrived!! He showed us all we needed to see and know about the place!! We were able to bring our fishing boat and my husband caught lots of Blue Gil. The lake was beautiful and calm and the view was exactly as we imagined. We definitely will be back for another visit.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Scott and Becky’s camper for one night, our interaction with both of them was great, they were very proactive in communication, regarding the checkin process or otherwise. The location is wonderful, and kayaking on a private beach definitely was the highlight of our stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""Lake Life"" is Fabulous in September. Kayaking on Perrin Lake and an evening campfire were highlights. The Hosts Scott and Becky were open and helpful. It is camping, but it's really nice trailer camping with good facilities and stunning nature."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great lake spot!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Becky were absolutely wonderful hosts for us! They were more than happy to give space when wanted, and also more than happy to chat, help, and host when wanted! It doesn't hurt that the property is gorgeous. It looks nice in the pictures but they still won't do it justice! This was a really great spot for a weekend getaway on a lake and we lucked out with people as kind, accomodating, thoughtful, and proactive as Scott and Becky! Thanks again to you both!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott was a very helpful and welcoming host. He greeted us and made sure we were all settled in. The location right by the lake was perfect and it was nice to have access to the kayaks. There are even some nice walking trails right up the road. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an amazing experience. Scott is an excellent host, he made everything for us to feel comfortable. The property is incredible, the trailer is super cozy and it was one of the best experiences we had. Great place for kids, we went with our 3 year old boy and he had a blast. Thank you, Scott and Becky, for a wonderful weekend. Hope to see you again."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway - super relaxing
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very family friendly and peaceful_ Scott was extremely helpful and invested in our enjoyment of his place👌
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a one of a kind stay. Great place extremely clean and beautiful views make for a great stay. If your looking for a place to have great service so you can sit on your phone this is not the place for you. But if you want to make amazing lifelong memory’s and to be engulfed in nature this is your spot. 10/10 would recommend and go back. Don’t waste your time looking elsewhere just book this amazing place and Scott will not let you down.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott’s RV is a wonderful place to relax with a comfortable bed and kitchen, super hot water, and all the amenities. Who needs a tv with the beautiful lake view from the dock right out the front door?! Everything inside was sparkling clean and cool, and Scott was there to greet us. We wish we’d had time to kayak on the lake... maybe next time!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Extremely clean. Great hosts. Great extras like kayaks and a great campfire. Beautiful view and very cozy.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott and Becky are incredible hosts! They graciously shared their little bit of heaven on Perrin Lake with us. We enjoyed rv camping with none of the work and all of the perks! There was a firepit, a great view of the lake, kayaks and paddle boards. I have great memories of learning to canoe on this lake (I'm grew up in the area), so it was a particularly memorable experience. Highly recommend!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful place to relax! We loved the area. Scott was so helpful and welcoming...we felt like his personal houseguests. Bike rides and kayaks and campfires and Amish country....Perfection.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a relaxing and super fun stay for me and my two boys!The lake was beautiful and quiet. We all loved walking out our door and hopping into the water! The RV was the perfect space, clean and we all slept so well. The hosts were so gracious and welcoming. What a gem this place was!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott and Becky were great hosts. They made our family feel like their own. This was our first time trying airbnb, and it will be very tough for anyone to compete with the Millers.
They're top notch!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for everything. had an amazing time!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott, who is very friendly, promptly welcomed us upon arrival and helped make us feel at home.
The camper was very clean and very comfortable.
The lake views are extremely relaxing.
All day fun in the lake...do you really need more commentary?
Quotes from my 6 y/o sum up our stay: “It’s the best place EVER!” “I want to live here.” “I wish we could stay longer.” “We’re coming back, right?”"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best value on Airbnb! Looking for a great location to relax and enjoy the lake?! Look no further. I had my qualms about staying in a camper, especially with two kiddos, but I shouldn't have worried. The camper was just the right size for a family of four and was clean, comfortable, and cozy. Scott and his wife have thought of everything and are great hosts. They went above and beyond even providing local coffee & a basket of snacks. The camper is surrounded by beauty (tons of wildflowers in bloom and a gorgeous lake right in front of your door.) They offer FREE!!! use of the kayaks and paddleboards on site and was so kind to give us a ride on the pontoon, even letting our daughters take turns ""driving"" the boat. Our stay has been the highlight of our summer road trip and we are already talking about returning again on our next visit to Shipshewana.
PROS: easy communication and quick responses, beautiful location central to lots of bigger cities, use of kayaks & paddleboards, swing set, trampoline, beach, garage with games inside, comfortable bed
CONS: None!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to spend a weekend (or even longer).
Scott was very open-minded, kind and welcoming host.
Hope could visit again sometime."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, this is a camper with room for 4. It is clean and there are plenty of activities for children. I relaxed, read, and did some swimming. The air conditioning works great! Nice visit."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott was great, very nice guy. The location was amazing. I would definitely come back."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed having Lake Perrin steps away. Beautiful setting and peaceful. Close to many Lakes, to Fawn River and town of Sturgis. Our hosts were delightful."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Keep in mind this is camping in an RV. That being said, you will not find a better location or hosts. Scott and Becky are the kindest humans I've met in a long time. The waterfront locating is on private lake which means no crowds or noisy neighbors! They have every waste amenity you could want from pontoons to kayaks to paddleboards. They even let my kids play on the swingset and trampoline in their yard. Reception on my phone didn't work until we got into town, and I was completely ok with that. My daughter (8years old) demand we do this at least yearly. I agree."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you like to live almost on the beach and enjoy water activities, this is the right spot for you. Great hosts and a lovely area to stay in. Highly recommended!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott was incredibly welcoming and went out of his way to make sure we got settled well and knew exactly how to find anything we needed. Everything in the camper is clean, stocked, and labeled, so there’s no confusion about how to access the amenities. The location is beautiful and quiet, and Scott was more than helpful in giving us access to the waterfront and making sure we got a cozy fire in the evening. He also had great tips on what to do in the area while we were there and let us join him for church on Sunday. We’ll definitely be staying again in the summer!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best interaction I have ever had with an AirBnB host, and I have had some very good interactions. The Millers did everything they could to help us enjoy the place, including getting us out on the lake in their Kayaks. This is a great place to stop on way east or west."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Becky were wonderful hosts. Such a beautiful and peaceful spot. Perfect for my teenage son and I to unwind, fish, and hike. Would stay again!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute and cozy little place! We came with three little kids and loved all the outdoor amenities and space for them to run around in. Camper was cozy with the five of us in there, but not too small, and the rural area was a nice reprieve from the busyness of city life. The hosts are fantastic, very kind and caring people. Would definitely recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cottage on a gorgeous lake that is very clean and has a nice firm sandy bottom. Roomy bedrooms and large bathrooms. It was terrific for our family gathering. Highly recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at this lakefront Airbnb was an amazing experience that far exceeded what we were expecting. Jeff really took care of us, making sure we had plenty of towels and bedding to make our stay super comfortable. The place was spotless when we arrived, and being right by the lake added such a nice touch to our trip.
One thing that stood out was the farm-fresh eggs they left for us. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made us feel really welcome.
The house itself had everything we needed, from a well-equipped kitchen to cozy furniture. Waking up to the view of the lake each morning was just breathtaking.
Overall, we were blown away by how great this Airbnb was. It was the perfect mix of comfort, cleanliness, and natural beauty. We would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s a beautiful property. A lake house in MI in March is not the ideal choice for many families. Our family members were coming from 3 different states so the cousins & siblings could spend some time together. The older they get the harder it is to make that happen. Having time to play games, laugh together & make some memories was our goal and we were not disappointed. Jeff was great to work with, very helpful & friendly. Being on the lake with a dock, kayak, and lots of water paraphernalia would make it a fantastic summer vacation spot but we thoroughly enjoyed our less hectic stay in early spring."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff was a great host and the home is absolutely beautiful. Amazing views of the lake and a very quiet neighborhood. The place was very clean and a lot of labels across the entire home making things a lot easier. Very clean and a ton of amenities in the entire home, photos are spot on of what this home looks like. Our entire family and friends were very happy and felt right at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay! Beautiful location right on the lake. Jeff was a great host! Highly recommend this property.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was beautiful! Jeff was super responsive and very attentive. The place has everything you could need. Would definitely love to return in the summer the enjoy the lake!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice place and a great host. I recommend it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff is an amazing host and the home was nothing short of perfect. Best home we have stayed in, by far! Super clean and a lot of space for 8 adults. The view is beautiful, even in the winter. Jeff was super responsive and helpful."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renting with Jeff was a very seamless and pleasurable experience. Jeff made sure all of our accommodations were taken care of prior to our arrival. The house was in clean condition and filled with essential items that were at our disposal and made our living experience more convenient and enjoyable. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. My family and I had a wonderful and restful vacation and Jeff made that easy to achieve. Anyone else that looks to book with Jeff can rest assured they will be taken care of.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jeff is a wonderful host! His home is beautiful; we appreciate all his attention to detail. We can’t wait to return!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff's cottage on Klinger Lake is truly a spectacular AirBnB. It's spacious, comfortable, well appointed, super clean (and does NOT reek of air freshener the way some AirBnBs do which is a HUGE PLUS!!!!), and has plenty of bedrooms and lounging space so that the whole family can feel comfortable. We rented over the Thanksgiving holiday and could not have been happier. The kitchen is extremely well stocked with pots, pans, utensils, etc. This location cannot be beat -- in the summer you'll be able to walk to Blind Island Brewery and the Marina. There's ample parking, and a fantastic outdoor porch and screened porch. Jeff was communicative, kind, and helpful. I would 100% recommend this cottage to anyone and everyone!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay. The house is very clean, comfortable, and everything you will need to enjoy your stay on the lake. The host was great to deal with and would highly recommend renting this house to anyone that is in need in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. It is located on a beautiful lake. The house looks and smells brand new. You won’t find a better place to rent. The host is the best we have ever had. Everything was perfect for our weekend getaway. Will definitely return if we go back to that area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovey home, breathtaking view of the lake! Jeff was very responsive and has given great accommodations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very understanding of last minute cancellation. Thank you

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ross & Jennifer's home was welcoming, very clean, and beautifully decorated. Very scenic landscaping and thoughtful touches throughout the space. They created a very helpful binder with information on the area (we wish we'd had more time to explore). We highly recommend their place and hope to visit again sometime!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Neighborhood is so calm

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ross and Jen's place was just what we were looking for and more! The place is spotlessly clean, very neat and organized, and adorable! Jen made us feel right at home, super flexible and kind. The place came equipped with everything we needed and we appreciated the thoughtful touches that were above and beyond. Thankful for the time and space and accommodations. 10/10 will recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly people and the house is so cute
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a lively guest suite! It actually felt like we were in a private place! We would recommend this place!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved how everything was labeled as well as In the binder, a great place to go for a night away."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second visit here- snow and strong windchill had nothing on their place. Comfortable as last time and there was a shovel for the walkway! Someone had left a cord behind in a drawer that matched what I forgot, that was nice too 😊
The Airbnb is just a short walk to a beautiful cemetery and park, good for stretching the legs!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a quick overnight stay and was very clean and quiet.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tried this lovely place on my trip and was thrilled it was available on my return trip! Very homey and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was a little slice of heaven after a long day of driving. It was clean, comfortable, and affordable. I look forward to when I can return!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience --- Owners greeted us at the Door on Arrival - I was impressed --- and they are soooooooooooooooooooooo friendly !!! We will go back at some point!!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful Airbnb with welcoming hosts. A favorite place I keep returning to.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were extremely pleased with our stay. We would recommend it for 1 or 2 people. It was very clean and neat and the hosts were great. We would give it an 11 out of 10 anytime.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a great stay. It was a great location for us. We appreciated having the sitting room for when we were back at the house in the evenings. And the attention to detail (like snacks, bottled water, coffee maker etc) made it even better. Great location for striking out to nearby towns like Middlebury and Shipshewana. We just enjoyed it very much."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful accommodation. The hosts are welcoming and accommodating. We needed a soft place to land after spending days caring for a dying loved one. Hawthorne Place and the hosts delivered.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best places we have ever stayed at. everything was clean, well decorated, peaceful, cozy, and comfortable. You could really tell that our friendly and caring hosts thought of every detail as all instructions and amenities were provided. Even some snack, water and coffee. The suite smelled great, and we felt right at home and safe the whole time. Another big plus was that the place was located very close to the highway. We highly recommend this stay if you are in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we were delighted with our accommodations. Rooms looked like a designer furnished and staged them. Every detail was thought of and included so that we didn't have to contact them with questions.
we loved the small notes blended into the environment so that just when we had a question, there would be one or more notes artistically blended into the area answering our questions ... kind of like our personal FAQ list.
the property is located in an immaculately landscaped garden-like, perfectly mown lawn. We watched a black squirrel stroll through and listened to birds chirping in the tall trees on the property - the effect was meditative and relaxing. We will return ... thanks Ross and Jennifer"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place and hosts, would definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best stay I've had!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this airbnb! Perfect for a quick overnight stop on way home from ND! Convenient, cozy and great correspondence! Look forward to staying again."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The listing lists AC, but doesn't specify that guests have no access to the controls. When we arrived, the book informed us that they keep it at 78 during the summer, which is a big problem for us. Fortunately it was a cold September night.
Other than that, we had a perfectly comfortable stay. If the temperature thing works for you, we recommend it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely time at Hawthorne Place. Ross met us at check-in; both he and his wife were friendly and very helpful. The suite was extremely clean and nicely decorated; they also had tea, coffee and a few snacks for our enjoyment. The outside of the home was beautifully landscaped and in a nice neighborhood; very peaceful. We only spent one night as we were driving through the area, but one could easily spend more time in the town of Sturgis. Would love to stay there again on our travels. !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hosts are a happy lovely couple, their smiles make me very welcomed…. the deco is neat and perfect, feels relaxed instantly. Very private and quiet….. they let me charge my tesla, which saved me some trip time and enabled me to drive home directly. I strongly recommend all hosts doing the same, only costs a dollar per night, adds 20% of battery, but a big convenience for EV."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for work, and needed a space to sleep and get some work done. Ross & Jennifer were very kind and helpful. The price was very reasonable and was very clean and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing!! Thank you so much!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay in Sturgis, MI was one of the best airbnb experiences I've ever had! Very comfortable, clean, and a real pleasure. No hesitation at all to highly recommend..... Ross and Jennifer were superb!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ross and Jennifer's home was perfect for our overnight stay!! The pictures don't do it justice. It was very spacious and private. The sitting room has a beautiful window, couch, chair (very comfortable), desk, large dorm size refrigerator, Roku TV, coffee pot, french press, and tea kettle. Then down the hallway is the guest closet, spacious bathroom, and finally at the end of the hallway is the bedroom.
We were very pleased with our stay! The space is impeccably clean with helpful notes and snacks.
We truly enjoyed 5 Lakes Coffee. It was a great coffee shop with an awesome vibe. We also ate at DaVinci's. Great food!!
It was a very easy and scenic 20min drive to Shipshewana (which was our destination)."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at Ross & Jennifer's place! We appreciated the friendly, welcoming atmosphere and were able to relax and rest. Everything was extremely clean and comfy! Hopefully we'll be able to stay with them again sometime in the future!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place inside and out! Super duper clean and very quiet. Also quite spacious feeling with bed, bath, and the bonus sitting room. Hosts are friendly and responsive - we happened to meet in the driveway and chat a bit. Lovely all around."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was easily one of our top few experiences and stays at an Airbnb. Ross and Jennifer's place is well appointed, clean, comfortable, and stylishly furnished. What more can one ask for? I'm looking forward a return trip!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay. Hosts were friendly and accommodating.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful place to stay very quiet and their yard was gorgeous! The suit was perfect for my fiancé and I. We met Ross on the way in and he was very sweet and personable and we would love to come back:)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ross & Jennifer's place was a beautiful & clean place! It was easy to access and very private even though the hosts live on the property. The space included a nice sitting room separate from the bedroom with snacks, coffee, and TV. Our schedule included a couple of late nights, but the lighting and entrance were easy and we did not feel we were disturbing the hosts. We did not meet our hosts until we were leaving, but glad we did. They were very friendly and we had a nice chat.

It’s seems like an apartment, since you have a separate living room, bath and bedroom. Jenn is very responsive and provides clear instructions. The “apartment” has a separate entrance and you can come and go as you please. I can’t say enough good things about it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a quiet place to land for few days while visiting family nearby, and the suite at Ross and Jennifer's was perfect! We knew nothing about Sturgis before arriving, and were delighted to find it a charming little town. The food at El Taco Loco was amazing, and walking to drink coffee in the corner window at Five Lakes Coffee was a great way to begin the morning. Ross and Jennifer were gracious hosts! We'd highly recommend their place!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, quiet location, good walking but not super close to stores. Park nearby. Nice refuge when staying a few days, the sitting room is a huge bonus!
But the only running water is the bathroom (as listed) so no cooking or really washing of dishes. The bed was comfy but also a little squeaky if you are sensitive to noise, nothing too out of the ordinary. Also give the water in the shower plenty of time to adjust, it can get super hot and adjustments can change the temp drastically.
So grateful for this place of refuge in my hometown where I am now a visitor the past 20 years ♥️"

Great location too!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As described. Jennifer and Ross were there to greet us when we arrived. It was nice to meet our hosts. The unit was prefect for our overnight stay in Sturgis.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful apartment in a quiet, safe residential neighborhood. We give it an enthusiastic 4 stars (where 4 stars is our highest rating). It was nice to have separate rooms for sleeping (in a very comfortable bed) and for hanging out (on comfy furniture) -- and all the rooms, including the bathroom, were nicely furnished and decorated. It was a very calming environment, especially appreciated after our long drive from Ontario. We stayed only one night and wished we could have stayed longer. Especially appreciated the hard copy instructions for making coffee (with two options -- a drip coffeemaker and a French press) -- it took the guesswork out of making a good cup of joe in the morning! Highly recommend!"

There was more than I needed for a one night stay - mini-fridge, microwave and snacks. These are definitely the hosts with the most. I plan on staying here on my next visit."

Holly and I met by chance as I returned home one night and she was such a pleasant and kind person. The bed was great, very comfortable and everything was very clean.

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The room was very clean and private from the rest of the house. We found the room itself was very hot even with the air on. The door to the outside had a screen door but we couldn’t get it to open no matter how many times we turned the lock in either direction. My husband and I both found the bed ( a Murphy style) very uncomfortable and hardly slept. There was a lot of extra clean linens in the closet. It’s important to note there is no Tv in the room. Overall it worked fine for what we needed.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Jill’s place was quiet and clean. It was a good place to rest for the night, but as noted in her description, not a major “destination” spot. Safe roads for walking/jogging. Worth the value!"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed a place to stay for a night as I was driving across country. Holly was flexible with me plans and allowed me to come whenever was convenient. She left clear instructions on how to get in and for anything I might need. The room was in private area of the house so I had plenty of quiet and privacy but still felt safe. Everything was clean and cozy. I would definitely stay here again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect destination if you were looking for clean, quiet, and reasonably priced. For all intents and purposes, you have a private bathroom despite the listing indicating it is shared. Provided you aren’t hanging around during the day, there will be no other person accessing the restroom. For my purposes, which was business in the surrounding area, I could not of asked for a more value-based stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room is just what Holly says it is. No surprises. Spotless. Comfortable mattress. Would stay with her again any time.

Quiet neighborhood and perfect location for our planned activities. Highly recommend Sam’s place."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean house, quiet neighborhood. Was exactly as described. Thanks"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sam's place is in a quite peaceful neighborhood. I found his house not having internet to be quite relaxing from this modern world we live in. Sam was always polite and very responsive.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sam's house was everything I anticipated. I was travelling from another Country and he was always responsive and accommodating. Would stay here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely house with a comfortable bed in a nice quiet neighborhood. Just what we were looking for!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam’s place is right in town Sturgis; close to everything. The place had everything for someone to utilize if they needed to cook etc. THERE IS NO WI-FI. It’s 2023, let’s get some Wi-Fi people. There is also no cable. There is a DVD player with a selection of old DVD’s. We attempted to hook the tv up to the hotspot as recommended by the post, but we weren’t able to figure it out."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house, nice and clean. Great to be able to share Holiday with local family and not be in a motel. Would for sure rent again fro
Sam.
Brenda"
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Overall it wasn't awful but.. my husband was the first one to arrive as I had to work late. When he arrived the front door was wide open and propped open with the nutcracker by the door and the music was really loud. There was left over food in the fridge and the shower was full of hair and clogged. I contacted Sam to make sure someone wasn't still checked in or something and he advised he was just at the home at 1pm and checked everything so that was strange to us. He did offer to come relook at things which we appreciated. Other than that things weren't awful it just wasn't really our vibe. The place was quite dusty and not the cleanest. There are also personal family pictures hanging up on the wall which just was not really our vibe.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,More than perfect for me!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was clean and quiet. There was a good selection of condiments and spices available for cooking. I also very much appreciated the large capacity washer and dryer. I wasn't there long enough to check out all the titles in the book or DVD collection but from what I saw there was something for everyone.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Me and my family loved it. We felt right at home. Definitely recommend this place and hopefully can stay more times in the future.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We could not have been happier with our stay at Sam’s place. We felt right at home. The kitchen was well equipped with food, extra goodies, and anything we could possibly need. Extra amenities in the bathroom if you needed it, and the bath towels were so soft!! The piano is nice and there are tons of books to read. Would stay again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a nice stay, and it was a cozy small house. One major plus is fireplace heater in bedroom."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place peaceful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed at many houses on Klinger lake over the years, and this was by far the nicest. The house was perfectly clean and very comfortable. We will be retuning for another stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Beautiful home-hard to believe it was better than the pictures-it was! We stayed here as we had a wedding at Twin Gables. It was a 15 minute drive to the venue and it was a great place to stay.
Loved morning coffee on the deck overlooking the water, and then followed that up kayaking with the kayaks in the garage.
We really enjoyed the individual temperature controls in each room. Everyone loved how comfortable the beds were. The kitchen had plenty of cooking supplies.
Host was very responsive when texting/calling and was helpful.
Downside: Reading the departure rules was overwhelming when we had a tight schedule. We always try to leave a BNB as tidy as when we arrive, but to read we had to strip beds and start to wash our linens/towels was not something we typically have to do at a BNB-especially when paying a cleaning fee. However, we happily did so.
We would delightfully stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great. Comfortable beds and linens. Very beautifully decorated and felt like home. Had what we needed and was a nice weekend getaway.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay immensely. All the amenities of home. Beautiful setting. Comfy beds. Quick response when we had questions. Thank you!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. It was great having access to kayaks and tubes to use on the lake. The place was nicely updated and very clean and tidy. Sitting on the back deck looking over the lake was just very relaxing.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed for the weekend but it was very relaxing. We spent the majority of our time just sitting along the canal, and it was so peaceful!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay - wish the weather was a little warmer but that’s not in anyone’s control. The lake view was peaceful and we were able to enjoy the deck on a warmer afternoon. The best part was the beds; the beds felt like home! It was so nice to finally stay at a place that invested in their mattresses. We find that many places are great but after a long day you want to lay down and get a restful nights sleep and the beds seem to lack but not here! We would definitely rent from them again - all of your basic essentials were there and the finishes just made you feel right at home! Thanks for the great mini vacation!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place! The check in process was simple and easy, the house was very clean and nicely updated. It had everything we needed. Great place for the winter, Swiss Valley Ski Resort only being 35 minutes away! and looks like a great place to be in the summer with the nice open deck out the back door over looking the water."

,,,Both Air BNB and Sam have not addressed our issues. The house smells of mold. Mold and cockroaches found under the sink area and by the front door. Host refuses to contact us. Air BNB has done nothing.
