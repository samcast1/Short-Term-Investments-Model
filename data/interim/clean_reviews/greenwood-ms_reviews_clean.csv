Benny and Ashley."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is attached Elizabeth's home which met the description and more. Trey & Elizabeth are great communicators and offered different options for check-in. Trey gave us a tour of the unit & welcomed us like we were out of town guests in their home. He informed us that he would provide breakfast (famous homemade muffins). I like older homes, so this was a treat for me with tall ceilings, pocket doors, great wifi, & comfortable furniture. Lots of room to relax and enjoy! There were even pictures of their beautiful daughters around the apartment. Coco stopped by a couple of times to check on us to make sure we were good. We felt secure with our hosts next door. This is our go to rental in the Greenwood area!"

Nice home, great people and very helpful!
Thank you all so much 🖤"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly located beautiful apartment that was exactly what we needed for our anniversary getaway. We attended a Viking Cooking School class and ate at a few of the many places downtown. Elizabeth and Trey were perfect hosts and the apartment was quiet and comfortable. We would highly recommend staying if you need a place in Greenwood. The blueberry muffins were delicious!!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great rental. We were in town for the Viking Cooking School. Great location, just a few minutes from downtown Greenwood. When we arrived, Elizabeth came over with warm homemade blueberry muffins. Would definitely recommend this rental in Greenwood."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I must say that I am very pleased with our stay at Elizabeth's place. Elizabeth is a fabulous host. The house is inviting, clean and gives a home away from home feel. We usually stay at The Alluvian hotel near by, but boy if i would have known of Elizabeth's place the previous times we visited Greenwood I would have stayed there. The rental is in a lovely part of town..quiet and a safe neighborhood. Her daughter made us a delicious treat that we had for breakfast. I must also add that the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This is something I am highly critical of because I am professional in the lodging industry and travel quite a bit for work...it's a rare find!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re in the area, STAY HERE!
Beautiful, quiet, clean, comfortable, convenient apartment …

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I travel quite a bit following my grandson's college baseball season. We love staying at airbnb because we normally have more room for our 4 to 5 day stays. This place was one of the best we have ever stayed in! Elizabeth was a great host and was easy to communicate with when we had a question. We definitely recommend it and will definitely stay there again if baseball takes us that way in the future.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a needle in a haystack find! Elizabeth was a terrific host and gave me excellent recommendations on where to eat in downtown Greenwood, MS. Her airbnb was stocked with snacks and drinks, spacious, and a very comfortable mattress. She didnt cut any corners with this unit and it shows! If you can still see this booking you are in luck. BOOK NOW!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Communication with Elizabeth was excellent. The unit has its own entrance from the main house. Parking is on the side of the unit, an area on the side street. There was sufficient lighting. The unit has high ceilings which make it open and inviting and is as photographed. I booked the unit for one week. During this time the weather was warm but then a cold front moved in. The air conditioning worked well and the heat radiated throughout. The rocker in the bedroom was very comfortable. Snacks & drinks were available. The kitchen allows plenty of area to cook if you do not want to eat out. Elizabeth brought over some hot blueberry muffins that most of the reviews comment on. I agree they were delicious. I would not hesitate to book this unit again should the need arise."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth's home is sooo special. It is warm and inviting as her family is aslo. Her home as everything you need. It is located close to many historical places.

Your home is lovely, clean, comfortable, located in a great location.
You have added many comforts of home and special touches to help ensure your guests stay is more comfortable from - the board games, homemade muffins, snacks, fruit display on the kitchen island and great places to get a bite to eat list on the refrigerator, washer and dryer, option to use a steamer or an iron for removing wrinkles from clothing to the handwritten letter with detail instructions. Thank you for welcoming us to your home and making our stay delightful."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was perfect for me and my husband on our visit to Greenwood. The space is very nice and we had everything we needed.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth and Trey are great hosts! Very comfortable, clean and roomy. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Elizabeth’s place was one of the nicest AirBnB’s that we’ve stayed at. It was very spacious and nicely decorated. My husband and I were in Greenwood for the Viking Cooking School and the location of Elizabeth’s home was ideal. About a 3 minute drive. Elizabeth and her husband greeted us upon arrival. Their daughters made blueberry muffins for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would definitely book again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was awesome! Elizabeth and her husband greeted us when we arrived and they are a true example of southern hospitality. Communication was great. We were welcomed with homemade blueberry muffins which were amazing! Elizabeth left us a list of some of their favorite restaurants which was much appreciated and the ones we tried did not disappoint. We plan to stay here again when we go back.

My family will be definitely stay again. Thank you, Elizabeth"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect stay at Elizabeth’s. Very clean & comfortable. it’s a complete apartment. good sitting areas throughout. well located just across the river from downtown in a quiet neighborhood. Elizabeth had fresh muffins made for my arrival. there’s coffee and snacks available. The bed is quite comfortable. the bathroom large and well lit. i will look forward to staying again .
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best airbnb I ever stayed in. Upon your entry, there is a welcome basket filled with fruits and goodies and items in the refrig for your enjoyment. The place is large, clean and make you feel like home. In the bathroom, you are provided with lotion, soap, shampoo and others items that you may need. Off from the bathroom is a large washer and dryer and a walk-in shower. The kitchen has everything needed to cook whatever meal you want. The living room has a flat tv on the wall and a comfortable rocking chair. The bedroom has a large closet and a very comfortable queen size bed. Anyone who is looking for an airbnb, this is one of the best in the U.S., so don't let this one get away. You and your family will have a great experience that will have lasting memories. Enjoy your stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trey & Elizabeth are very welcoming! This quiet, clean and charming location was perfect for my week long visit. It had all the amnesties one could ask for. Homemade muffins and other unique treats were a perfect surprise! Looking forward to when I can return for a more relaxed visit. My family will definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Elizabeth's place was idyllic! From the communication that accommodated my circumstances on the front end to the follow up afterward - just a breeze! The location was perfect and picturesque with just the right touches to make you feel at home in the MS Delta. The space was so open and roomy with natural light beaming in. The bed was particularly comfortable, with soft sheets and a bedspread that seemed weighted, and I was able to snuggle right in for a much needed sound sleep! The photos really don't do it justice. Additionally - b/c of Covid, I took wipes and spray with me, but it was super clean and I felt completely at ease. When I think about what I would have paid to stay in a box of a room, with no personal touches or feel, compared to what I experienced for this stay, I'm confident in telling anyone that they just must try this out instead. They won't be disappointed!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectations, easy to book, great communication and look forward to using again in future."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, and great Southern hospitality. Located less than 5 minutes from the Viking Cooking School."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Remarkable accommodations.
I almost asked to be a permanent guest. Extremely safe; beautiful neighborhood; huge tree lined street. Every now and then you are fortunate to encounter an individual who models the person born to be in the hospitality business: Elizabeth. Very responsive. In my over 3,000 miles of traveling from New England to Arkansas, the best AirBnB."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is so cute and quaint. The pictures do not do it justice. Elizabeth was amazing with communication. She also made us feel very welcomed with little touches of hospitality. We hope to stay again when we are in the area.

Will definitely be staying with them again."

Everything was very clean. If we ever need a place to stay in greenwood again, Elizabeth’s will be the first place we check for an availability!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"QUALITY CARE, ATTENTION AND CONCERN that is genuine. They are legit. Their kindness is only matched by their non-stop generocity. I absolutely love the fact that these two know exactly what they're doing and it is evident in the upkeep of their property and their attention to ensuring you the best possible experience you can have in an Airbnb. Also, it is comforting to know that they are very much on top of all COVID-19 regulations, protocols, etc the works. And whatever you may have heard about the blueberry muffins is the truth. Man they were some kind of good. Simply is you are looking for a championship Airbnb experience, then this is a no-brainer. 6-Stars."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth’s home was perfect for our weekend in Greenwood for a wedding. We were located within minutes of all the wedding activities. The home was so cute, spacious and clean. We brought some other wedding guest over to show them how cute this place was. So much more than a hotel and actually cheaper!! Can’t wait to have a reason to go back to greenwood and rent this home again."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well, this place is a real gem if you are in the Mississippi Delta. Elizabeth and family are extraordinary hosts who will take care of you from start to finish."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was an amazing host and her guest house is just as amazing as she is!! I have to admit when I read all the reviews about the blueberry muffins I couldn’t wait to try one. Elizabeth brought them over straight out of the oven and Oh My Goodness,,,I may or may not have eaten more then 1!!! They are worth your stay all by themselves lol. As long as Elizabeth’s place is available when we travel to greenwoood we will not even consider anywhere else!"

The location is near town, and easy driving distance to many Delta attractions. The kitchen and bath are well appointed for longer stays. Highly recommended, would definitely stay again!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,‘Spacious’ does not do it justice. After several ‘cozy’ Airbnb this is a breath of fresh air! Loads of room to relax. Comfortable bed and fantastic amenities. Elizabeth was so helpful and accommodating. There’s a lot to learn about in this region. Wish we’d stayed longer than our one night...
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best Airbnb experience we’ve had yet! Elizabeth and Trey’s warm, inviting space matches their above-and-beyond hospitality perfectly.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Elizabeth's home. The house was spotless, quaint, and in a great neighborhood. Elizabeth did a wonderful job ensuring all of our needs were met. She was even thoughtful enough to gift us something for my family as we were in town for two funerals. I would recommend this home for all travelers."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Elizabeth's home is absolutely beautiful and in a gorgeous tree-lined community. The pictures really don't do it justice!!

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoy our stay. The place was very nice in a neat neighborhood.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is spacious, stylish, spotlessly clean and has everything one would want for a comfortable stay in lovely Greenwood. Elizabeth is a very warm, welcoming host, who goes out of her way to make sure guests have everything needed, without ever being intrusive. I would recommend this apartment, and Elizabeth as a host, to anyone."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No need to look for a better location, cleaner, or more perfect home away from home to stay! There was nothing negative about our 3 night experience at Trey and Elizabeth’s Air BnB.
Hospitable, comfortable and well worth the price!
When traveling this way again, we would definitely choose the O’Brien’s BnB"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay in Greenwood immensely. Not only were Elizabeth and Trey wonderful hosts, they are so personable, great people, and I now consider them friends. The space is immaculate, beautifully decorated, and has all the amenities that you need. You will feel right at home. Greenwood is a fantastic place to visit. So much history, WONDERFUL food, and hospitality is plentiful! Go check this little place in the Mississippi Delta out! I promise you won’t be disappointed!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect house & hosts, the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful. This was our first Airbnb, but definitely not our last. If we are in the area again, it is 5 hours from home, this is the first place we will try to book. We were in the area for the wedding of a friend’s son, who will be residing in the area. His parent’s live near us, and we have told them this is definitely the place for them to stay. Very spacious, very clean and a very quiet neighborhood. No elevator or ice machine noises. The muffins are the Bomb!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a travel nurse you never quite know what to expect when moving to a new town, but Elizabeth and Trey have welcomed me like family. I can’t thank them enough for their hospitality! If you’re visiting Greenwood (or living here temporarily like me) this is absolutely the place the stay!!!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful local home with an amazing charm! Trey and Elizabeth were amazing hosts and their daughter made amazing homemade muffins! Definitely a “go to” place in the future!!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A steal to have a private entrance, upscale modern amenity, total safety, and friendly helpful hosts that genuinely care about you and your stay. This is a beautiful home and a privilege to use. 150% satisfied!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, lovely family, beautiful space, couldn't be more pleased."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book it!!!!! This was my first Air BnB experience, and I’m pretty sure all the future ones will lead to disappointment because Elizabeth & Trey do such an amazing job.
The apartment is even cuter than it looks in the online photos! It’s like a 900-1000 sq ft mother-in-law quarters with a cozy living space and kitchen. There is a nice stack of board games. There were bananas, bottled water, coffee/tea, and even some spaghetti noodles and sauce.
They are also the sweetest couple. I saw the other reviews about homemade blueberry muffins, but Elizabeth actually makes HOMEMADE blueberry muffins. There are whole, fresh blueberries in them.
We also asked about directions and she graciously offered to pick us up since she would be out and about herself. We were floored at the above and beyond hospitality!
Upon initially booking the trip, I was originally disappointed the Alluvian Hotel was booked, but after staying with this family, I think we got the better deal.
Everything was perfect, and they are absolutely wonderful."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the best AirBnB experience for us, thus far. Elizabeth and Trey are amazing hosts! The apartment is spacious and comfortable! They have thought of everything to make your stay wonderful. It was my birthday and I was even greeted with a birthday balloon. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth is a great host and was so personable and made things comfortable for you while visiting. Her family had muffins waiting for you upon arrival and other little snacks. You can tell she places value in ensuring the guest have the Best experience and we did just that. She made sure she meet you upon arrival and showed you around your living quarters which was something that has never happened and it was well appreciated. GREAT HOST!!!!!!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is a super-host hospitality beyond measure she is a hundred times better than any super host that I have stayed with and I have been all over the country. and she was attentive to all of our needs communicated with us our entire trip We were in town a Funeral . we drove from Florida and she had everything in place . the house was clean all the amenities you needed the refrigerator stocked with water and soda goodies and snacks ,and fresh fruit. it was amazing awesome experience! Homemade blueberry muffins the best in town. Her Family made our family our feel comfortable and comforted in our time of need. Elizabeth and Trey our new in Greenwood!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. Located close to downtown in a quiet quaint neighborhood. Loved the tree lined ave. Private parking space and entrance.

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was absolutely amazing from the moment she first contacted me. My stay exceeded any expectations I had. Elizabeth and Trey met me as I drove in and helped me park. They both assisted me in getting my luggage in. Fresh blueberry muffins awaited me (I had not had dinner and was very hungry) on the counter as well as snacks and drinks in the fridge. The Apartment was sparkling clean and very spacious. The space was large and comfy with beautiful views. The space contained a stackable washer and dryer hidden away, hair dryer, soaps, etc. in case something was forgotten. Detailed notes, instructions, contact numbers, area tips were all laid out for me. I have severe allergies impacted by strong fragrances. Elizabeth went out of her way to make sure I knew all the cleaners used. I woke up well rested and migraine free. I felt safe in the neighborhood. I will definitely return when back in town. Every little detail was carefully thought out. Here you will find the southern hospitality you read about."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is wonderfully equipped & furnished. The yard is beautifully landscaped, the perfect place for a morning stroll with a cup of coffee. They have thoughtfully included every creature comfort you could want. Trey & Elizabeth embrace you as if you are family. We were so comfortable there we hated to leave. In saying goodbye we felt as if we were leaving our best friends.
This is the place to stay!!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome host!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nick’s place was great
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nick was so welcoming and very communicative. My partner and I were weary after a long drive from Memphis and this was the perfect place to relax. We made use of the kitchen in the evening and morning which made the place even more homely.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nick is a wonderful, caring Host. I was at a family reunion. Each time cousins would drive me « home, «  They exclaimed how charming the home was.
Look forward to another visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nick is a great host. The room is in a beautiful historic home that is well located. Full use of the kitchen is a big plus. Quiet neighborhood. Only downside was a musty (cat urine?) odor in the bedroom. Overall great value for the price. Recommended.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nick's place was, spacious and very comfortable. Perfect for what I needed"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"I wanted to stay one day at the heart of the Mississippi delta and got exactly the experience I needed. A wonderful house by the river, with its porch and swing chairs. The location inside Greenwood is just perfect: central, quiet and safe. I unfortunately didn't have the chance to meet Nick, but he replied very fast to everything I needed. Would recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed staying here and will likely stay here in the future. Nick was great to communicate with about this stay. I recommend this place to anyone coming through Greenwood.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,It was a great stay. Thank you Nick.
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nick was great to work with. Things were as stated. He responded quickly. It was easy in and out.
The place was clean. The bathroom, it is a shared space being used every day. Cleaning is adequate, but not exceptional.
It is in a run down neighborhood. The house is remarkably old and fascinating, but with that comes some mild odors the owners worked to mask with candles and such. There are cats around the property. If you have allergies I would suggest a different place to stay.
The price is amazing and Nick is working hard to make this a good spot to stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place for a close relative to stay for the weekend. We found Nick's place right in time. He was very easy to work with and super friendly. He made my family feel at home. I'm a host as well, and I felt as though Nick really rolled out the red carpet for me. Thanks a million, sir!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"good room to sleep in. cool, very comfortable. for my purpose of a place to sleep nearby the event I was attending it was good."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,if you like to go off the beaten path this is the ideal countryside and quiet place I am sure that when the work is finished it will be a very beautiful home the hosts are very pleasant and warm very friendly place to discover
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Our hosts were very kind and it was a great place to stay!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The potential for this location is pretty high. When it’s completely done it’s going to be nothing short of amazing!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nick has a house with charm that provides a unique experience. I really liked the main bathroom and the bed was comfortable. The couple is friendly and loves to chat and genuinely get to know you. They have a roommate staying named O’brian and he’s got a cool story to tell about his experiences as a semi-pro bike racer. All around a memorable stay that I’ll look back at years from now. Thanks for the humanity 🌈 Nick! I’m happy to know people like you are out in this 🌎 doing good work 🙂
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay with a great couple. Very friendly and hospitable. The house was so unique with the classic Delta charm. Recommend to any and all travelers!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a unique and fun stay. It’s a beautiful old home (partially renovated) right on the river and a short walk to anywhere in Greenwood. Nick was an extremely accommodating host who gave tons of great information and recommendations. The room is basic and comfortable. I recommend this stay to anyone who wants to experience a unique slice of the south!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to crash. Older house so you get what comes with that. But would definitely stay again if I’m in the area

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just like the listing and very nice people as well. Great front porch and love love love their cats! Definitely would recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a nice, quiet location. As some have noted, this is not a totally renovated 1905 home. However, as the former owner of an older home, I can totally relate. Older homes are endless work. My only wish would be for a lamp on the desk.
Charlotte and Nick are lovely, and we had a great conversation about life in the south and their teaching experiences. Their kitties are sweet and tolerated my dog eating some of their food."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Appreciate the warm welcome and comfy bed!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nick and Charlotte were awesome - location is great, walking distance to some very nice bars and restaurants in the center. Loved my time here and will definitely stay again when I’m in Greenwood!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable room nice people very accommodating good neighborhood
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"The host was very gracious, patient and understanding! The room could’ve used a bit more sprucing up. The room had a cat odor, I don’t care for pets, so this was unpleasant for me.
The home was vintage and had a great antique look, but had a very bad odor. I assume the odor came from the home being so old. The home odor was my biggest issue.
There was a carpet stain in the bedroom that I did not care to see.
My honest opinion, I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. However, the host was exceptional!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay. Great hospitality and very friendly. Love the stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ms Maggie’s place was such a pleasant surprise. Tony has thought of every detail to make guests feel welcome and at home. The house was spotless and incredibly comfortable. We loved all of the personal touches, such as the story behind the house and its owners. We felt honored to have enjoyed this home. The beds were comfortable, kitchen well appointed, and we did not want for anything during our stay. Tony was a superior host, and I would recommend his place to all considering a trip to Grenada!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the house and Mr. Tony was very friendly & nice. It's right off the road and can be a little nosy depending on the time of day with cars placing on it. The bed is comfortable and the shower is nice after a long hot day. Cute home that reminds me on my Grandparent's home.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Tony. I really loved your house.

I cannot think of anything else that someone would want that was not supplied. Plenty of towels, TV, internet, dishes, some spices, sugar, coffee, foil wrap. Just little things that you may have forgotten all made it a wonderful stay. Very peaceful and relaxing. I went for a fishing trip , but would be a wonderful trip just to get out of the city and enjoy a peaceful Surroundings. I plan on revisiting later this year."

The house is in a fantastic location, minutes from good restaurants. Also if you want beautiful scenery and a peaceful place to go Grenada Lake is a must. Only took about 10-15 minutes to get there."

We were there for my sons baseball tournament and it was just minutes away. Between games we were able to come back “home” relax and cook/grill.
It was so cozy and comfortable.
Sitting on the front porch brought back many fond childhood memories of sitting on my grandparents front porch.

You WILL NOT regret staying here and will want to stay again and again.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The house is beautiful and set up great. Master bedroom downstairs with 3 bedrooms & 2 full baths upstairs. Cozy living room area upstairs and down made for a very comfortable and relaxed weekend. Quiet neighborhood. Perfect place to stay for our girls weekend to the Viking Cooking School!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An overall comfortable and accommodating experiance, Mischa's home is located in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood and it was prepared clean and pristine prior our arrival. There was ample space for my entire family to either spread out and/or gather close together for quality time. I would definitely say that this stay qualifies as one my ""Guest Favorites""
Thank You again, Mischa for sharing your space with us!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home exceeded our expectations. Our family of four plus grandparents was very comfortable and had more than enough space to spread out, relax, and play games."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Mischa’s home is beautiful! The neighborhood is quiet and inviting. We were very pleased with everything.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Will definitely stay again if we are ever back in the area
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Such a pleasant surprise. They are truly full size bedrooms and bathrooms. Some of the rooms are en-suite which was great. The rooms are very large and he has thought of everything that you could need for your entire stay. Sam’s response time is excellent.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place to stay for a private business event. Great kitchen with top shelf Viking range, with a large enough seating area adjacent to kitchen to entertain a crowd. If your a TV lover, they are all over the place, you can’t count all them.
Excellent responsive host that catered to our every need. Will definitely be back for our next event."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"way better than the pictures, very secluded, private and peaceful, host responds within minutes"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this secluded cabin and the gorgeous view!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice cabin in the woods. We had a family getaway and it was peaceful and quiet. We were able to enjoy the kayaks and canoe for time on the river.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Finding the place was not the easiest, but Daryl made everything easier. He bends over backwards. And he is in the process of adding wi-fi, which eliminates any downsides.
The cabin is beautiful, stained, tongue-in-groove with a nice, well stocked kitchen and all the comforts of a nice cabin/home.
It sits on a beautiful lot, nice to the water, with LOTS of porch space, outdoor griddle, fire pit and grill. It's in the country and a good fifteen minute ride to any restaurant. Very peaceful.
Simply put, what you see in the ad is what you get. It strikes a wonderful balance of primitive (location) and modern (solid construction with modern conveniences). Loved the stay and wish it could have been longer."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to unwind. Everything from checking in, communication, cleanliness, and checking out could not have been easier. Very pleased with the whole experience."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Daryl’s place is fabulous, pictures don’t do it justice. Peaceful, quiet, well stocked, comfortable beds and Daryl was very quick to answer any questions. We will definitely be going back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great time !!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very secluded, peaceful stay and beautiful cabin. Make sure to follow Daryl's directions, not the GPS and you'll have no issues finding it. Bring your fishing poles!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to spend a quiet weekend. we went for our anniversary to unplug and enjoy a peaceful place and that's exactly what we got. We enjoyed sitting on the deck and the porch swing was perfect to enjoy the surroundings. We will be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location to go somewhere that is private and peaceful. Good fishing location also. Would recommend!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great spot about 20ish minutes outside of Greenwood. You have to pay close attention to getting there as it is a bit remote but Daryl’s instructions were clear to get there. The cabin is great - very comfortable and clean. Well kept for being out in the woods! The cabin has bayou access and we enjoyed the kayaks available to use. Would definitely stay here again if I am in the area.
One flag is that cell service is very poor, so take that into consideration. We were unable to access or identify any wifi to connect to."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great guy
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryl’s place is beautiful and so relaxing. It was just what we were looking for. My husband and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary there and it was perfect. The cabin is very clean and the dock out by the water was nice to enjoy the mornings and evenings on.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best of both worlds…modern cabin but has rustic feel with access to hunting, fishing, hiking but yet has nice amenities for those that prefer the indoors. Well furnished kitchen, great fire pits and wonderful wrap around decks for viewing."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place and wonderful for a place to rest after a big day of hunting!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and very peaceful
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Daryl was a grea host. It was amazing to get off the grid and spend time as a family.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, love everything about the place. The pictures do not do this place justice, wonderful cabin, quite and fishing off the dock. Loved the back deck fire pit and tv. Enjoyed the use of the canoe. Daryl is a great host. He checked in on us, welcome us and made us feel at home . Hated to leave definitely coming back again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was amazing! Very peaceful but never boring. Lots of fish right of the dock and they gave us a show every morning, jumping out of the water. The kayaks were great to check out the lake and to fish from. The cabin also holds lots of history and is well stocked. Great find!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great and had everything we needed. Perfect location for a private get away or family trip. We will definitely be staying again when we come down to visit family. Thanks so much for the hospitality!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply brilliant!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, secluded and relaxing. We had a great weekend and Daryl was a fantastic host!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a quiet place and beautiful surroundings, this is your spot! Huge trees, the lake in front! Screen doors in the cabin for a nice cross breeze! Well stocked kitchen! Comfortable furniture and beds! Felt very safe. Left the key in car and we didn’t even lock the doors! I’d go back in a heartbeat! A little out of town but so worth it. Daryl is a fabulous host!! This place is quite the jewel!!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin is great. Has everything you could need. I was staying there while working in Greenwood and it was so nice to go to the cabin at the end of the day rather than a hotel.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Third time here, coming back again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,GPS directions get you close but follow his that he gives!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Booked this great cabin for a few days of celebrating our son’s birthday. It was a perfect size, comfortable and fully stocked. Our dog had a great time chasing balls over the large yard and splashing in the water’s edge..(we may have lost a few balls there) The carport was really convenient to store the boat under, as we arrived in the middle of a storm. Made s’mores several nights and enjoyed every minute. Can’t wait to come visit again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We will certainly be back
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to relax, fish, sleep, just enjoy each other. All of the porch area gives you many options of where to sit and enjoy the views"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Getaway with a great host.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin tucked away in the woods! Nice and quiet location, great place to get away for the weekend and enjoy the outdoors! Everything you need is there available to use!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cabin is great! Close enough to town, and great amenities at the cabin as well."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful and comfortable home that had everything and more. Daryl was extremely responsive and his property was one of the best I’ve seen in the Delta. Looking forward to staying there again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is out in the woods so my reception was hit and miss but that was the point. Beautiful house on a beautiful piece of property. Daryl was very easy to work with and was very patient with me. I did have some trouble finding the place on several occasions but I dropped a pin and that problem was solved. I will definitely be coming back to visit this Mississippi Gem ASAP!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect getaway and great hospitality. This is the best hidden gem around! N
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home and location.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daryl’s cabin is set on river way that opens to a lake. The water levels might change the experience some during the summer, but still enjoyable I imagine. As a marker for us, Yazoo River was at 22.1 ft @ Greenwood. We were able to navigate a 18ft canoe down river for a couple of miles with more to be had. If you are any kind of fisherman, this will be a delight. The river is bordered by cypress trees adding to the scenic views. I should note we saw no one else on the water while we were there, which was nice for us. The cabin gives you great access to the water with a small boat landing.
As for the cabin, it was cozy. We brought much of our own stuff, but it seemed well-equipped to hand most any kitchen or leisure tasks. If you are here for the ‘country escape’ or the fishing/water, you’ll be in heaven.
We took our dogs and placed a kennel on the back porch. They had a ball.
We took a bike ride down the county road one morning, which was fun.
The phone coverage is very iffy, but that was nice too. We did not need much, but daryl was very responsive and checked on us one day (I see that as a nice gesture since the cell phone coverage is iffy).
We plan to come back as I hone my fishing skills. :-)
If you are looking for a chill place that offers fishing or kayaking on a peaceful lake/river and don’t mine getting a little dirty at times, book this place. It’s obviously a piece of Daryl, and Daryl is a nice guy that’s down to Earth.
Thx,
Casey and Jay"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to get away from everything! The cabin exceeded our expectations.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,About 20 minutes north of Greenwood. Just far enough away to relax and enjoy nature.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our visit. Great opportunity to refresh and enjoy family time.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! what a great place! This is by far the best set up cabin I have ever stayed at. Between the lake, boats, grill, outside tv, the lighted pier, rap around porch with lots of seating with wooded views, bug lights, etc, and a cabin with more comforts already there than I've ever seen. If you want a place to get away and enjoy the outdoors this is your place. A Jewel! Thank you Daryl !!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this cabin! cozy and quiet and just what i neeeed!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're searching for peace and quiet, cranes, plenty of fish, cicadas lulling you to sleep, a beautiful home and amenities, you've found it. This is my 2nd time being at McIntyre East, and my family and I were not disappointed.
Thank you, Daryl!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you are looking for beautiful, peaceful, and restful this place is it!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryls place is awesome! Super rustic cabin with everything you need for a relaxing week or weekend ! We brought our great Dane and 4 adults we had so much fun even in February. Will definatley be back to utilize the lake when it is warmer . beautiful view and totally secluded .
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great setting and hospitality... very peaceful and very nice!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great camp for the Mississippi outdoors. My buddy and I stayed there during hunting season. The cabin is really cool, comfortable, and very much in the middle of Mississippi wildlife. Every night we would see deer and other various animals around the camp. For hunters, numerous WMAs are very much within driving distance of the location."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED everything about our stay at Daryl’s cabin...the location, the cabin, the lake, the fishing, the kayaking, and the great host! It is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of life and just relax! It was just what our family needed! We can’t wait to return!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A good place to unplug and get away. Very peaceful and quiet, but close enough to a town that you can get most anything you may need or had forgotten to pack."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place for fishing and relaxing!!! Beautiful cabin and the best host!!! Come check it out!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Hidden treasure. Will recommend. Definitely will return
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a hidden gem! Beautiful cabin on a lake filled with fish. Super clean and felt like home. Daryl is awesome and makes you feel like family. We are planning to go back very soon! Bringing more family! You won’t be disappointed if you book here. I didn’t want to leave. Just an amazing place!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Photos do not do this place justice. It was a perfect family getaway with no cell service to interrupt the calm and serenity of being in the middle of nowhere with nature, a fire pit, and water for fishing! Enjoyed “camping” at Daryl’s McIntyre East!! Cabin is nice and has everything you would need for a short or long stay. Definitely hope to stay again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful and so calming the surroundings were very peaceful. Will definitely refer out.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a well taken care of property with loads of character! Darryl had everything you could possibly need in the cabin. The layout of the cabin is fantastic with a huge deck, the kitchen was set up with everything you could need to cook or grill, plenty of towels and extra linens, and kayaks to take out fishing. There’s a great dock overlooking the lake, fire pit, plenty of solitude and wildlife. The pictures don’t do this cabin justice. Darryl was great at communicating and made sure we had everything we need. We would definitely go back! Thank you, Darryl for a great trip and letting us stay!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"McIntyre East was fabulous! Plenty of wildlife, the lake was cool, the cabin was phenomenal, and Daryl was attentive. Everything you need is in the cabin; it was a terrific holiday."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing stay! The lake is beautiful, only made better by the fire pit and grill. This place has everything you need for a relaxing, rural trip."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I rented this home searching for peace and quiet and that is exactly what I got. The host is great. I liked that he had kayaks to use so I didn’t have to haul mine down there. Make sure you get directions in advance. The gps with that address took me an hour out of the way. Cell service isn’t good out there which was fine by me. I didn’t have much luck fishing (unless you count trees). The serenity and beauty made up for that. Mosquitoes will be looking forward to your arrival so pack extra bug spray. His house is furnished perfectly, inside and out. He has the most exquisite table in the living room. It truly was a work of art. The decor was perfect for a cabin. I loved the signs. The sheets in the bedroom were nice. I didn’t even have to use the ones I brought with me. The owner had to come meet me because I couldn’t find it. He is a very likable guy with great stories. I went by myself with my dogs. I think this place would be awesome for couples and families too. The fact that he had Direct tv out there was a nice surprise."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a WONDERFUL stay! It was everything we were looking for and more. We took our baby and two dogs and they were all at home the moment we arrived! The kayaks were great to take out on the lake with the dogs swimming behind. We tugged our baby behind the kayak in his own little boat! We were afraid before arriving that there might be alligators but there weren't and also Daryl said he has never seen one at the cabin. Bring bug spray! For some reason, we got eaten alive. Totally still worth it though.
One thing - Dont follow the GPS directions that AirBNB gives. Just head into Money, MS instead and then follow his directions.
Enjoy!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Daryl’s cabin. We spent the weekend fishing off the private dock, kayaking, and cooking out. You won’t be disappointed!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You definitely wont regret this peaceful place.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a hidden treasure! We had a wonderful time on the water and relaxing on the fun dock. Daryl was an excellent host!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Solitude with all the accessories you could possibly need. Pet friendly is a plus
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and my husband I weren’t disappointed. The pictures just don’t do this place justice! The property is beautifully maintained and it’s obvious Daryl is constantly working on improvements. Bring your fishing poles if that’s your thing! I honestly have nothing negative to say about this trip and can’t wait to visit again.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryl is a great host and will do all he can to make his guests happy.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I went to Daryl’s place to celebrate our anniversary. The cabin is located in a rural area with little cell reception, but we didn’t mind. It was a great escape from the real world for a few days. If you love nature I cannot suggest this place enough. The deck was an amazing place to hangout and watch the wildlife. Kayaking on the lake through gorgeous cypress trees was a singular experience that I won’t soon forget. We will happily return if we ever get the chance."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s exactly like the pictures! Get ready to reconnect as a family and disconnect from work, social media, email, and other internet activity...because there is no WiFi and little cell signal. Perfect!!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away. The long weekend was amazing the dogs loved the water and kayaking the lake was a blast.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend getaway from the city, where we enjoyed the beautiful scenery and nature. The place is exactly as pictured and had everything we needed, plus more! Very homey-woodsy cabin feeling. The kayaks were a huge hit with my son and we spend hours on the lake before coming back to relax by the fire or swing on the porch swings."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A totally modern cozy cabin in a beautiful setting.
Very responsive host.
Peace and quiet"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything you want and need in a little cabin in the woods. Awesome weekend get away! Daryl was easy to contact and I will certainly be back again!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect setting for a weekend getaway is the MS Delta. The pictures do not do it justice. It had that perfect cabin feel with plenty of woods and water. We had all cooking supplies we could ask for with a fully stocked kitchen and grill. Daryl was a great host with outstanding communication. Look forward to coming back soon.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Ernie’s home! Clean, comfy and in a very quiet location. He is always very responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family had a wonderful time staying at Ernie’s place! We came into town for a family reunion and there were no hotels or other airbnbs available in the area and we booked this place and I am so happy that we did! I was skeptical at first because I was not sure of the location, but it was the perfect place for our family of 6! We will definitely be back soon! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Ernie’s secluded home. It was very clean and he was very accommodating. Will definitely be staying again next time we are in Greenwood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,great property will be renting again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was clean, spacious and very comfortable. It appears to have been updated recently and was well done with regard to decorating touches, materials, and amenities. The ONLY improvement I could suggest would be to move the shampoo and body wash canisters into the shower rather than at the sink. All in all, our stay was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend this property to anyone staying in Greenwood."

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The hostess is very friendly and helpful. We couldn't reach them for check in and had to wait about 1.5 hours after arrival. Her phone was empty. We used the time and ate dinner, then it was ok. She then apologized 1000 times and was always available from then on. She gave us great tips.
The surroundings were a little unusual for us, but very quiet. The neighboring house is empty, windows broken, looks abandoned and decayed. That was weird at first."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Felt right at home. Shavonya was very responsive and helpful. Will definitely return when I come back to Mississippi

Very nice couple, fun to visit with and very helpful if you need anything! I highly recommend and would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The property was very nice. Being in the south, it was unsettling to see a cotton plant inside of a vase at the entrance of the home. There was also a movie poster of “The Help” framed and signed by the actors hanging up by the entrance as well. This was not included in the pictures posted on Airbnb. It did make us feel very uncomfortable and uneasy staying for the weekend. The property also has ants. We left my son’s burger on the counter and when he returned to eat it he could not because it was covered in ants."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This guesthouse is charming with personal touches including a stained glass sun hanging in an octagonal window in the bathroom and a beautiful glass swan dish for the shampoo. There was a heated tile floor in the bathroom. It felt like a home away from home.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This rental was the best in the area. It was convenient, clean, nicely decorated, quiet, and spacious. The owners have everything you can think of, even for the pool and outside play. Before we arrived they set up a toddler bed and a pack n play for my baby to sleep in. When we did see them outside they were so nice (and respected our privacy as well) and we had quite a few things in common. Small world. I would def rebook with them!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! So peaceful. Bill was very flexible when our baseball tournament kept changing from rainouts. We were thankful to have a great place to rest and swim!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mr Bill went above and beyond what was expected of him. My arrival time was late as I am a truck driver who needed a place to stay for the night. He very graciously offered to pick me and my son up from where we had to park my truck and trailer. If in the area again I will most certainly be looking to stay with him again and many more times I hope as I’m out that way quit often with the work I do. Thank you again to Mr Bill and his kindness!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect cottage for two moms to get away and relax! The hosts were so sweet and welcoming. I highly recommend this location!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s is a guest house, back of the main house, very peaceful. There is a lake that you can walk to on the property. It’s very private, I saw a couple of bald eagles flying around by the lake. Would stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this beautiful oasis in the Mississippi Delta. Clean, relaxing, and just what I needed for a week of writing and reflection.

Peaceful place outside of the city! I wish we had more time to spend at the house and definitely hope to stay here in the future for longer than just a weekend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so glad the Alluvian was booked because it brought us to this gem of a place. Everything was just as described. Bill has a very clean, accomodating space supplied with all the amenities. (Heated floors in the bathroom and bath robes in the closet were a happy plus.) The bed was very comfy (after a Viking Cooking School class about 15-20 minutes away in Greenwood). The hosts were so easy to communicate with. (Thanks Bill for the restaurant recommendation.) We definitely want to go back in the near future to enjoy the pool and the beautiful grounds and anything else we may have missed. Thank you again for your hospitality."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great and luxurious place with all the amenities you could wish for. The salt water pool is a real relief after a hot day. The hostesses are very warm and welcoming and you’ll feel right at home.
Very relaxing time we had there even only it was for one day."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax and be cozy. Peaceful location a short distance away from the city of Greenwood. The pool and outdoor shower were awesome! Already missing Schlater.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely home. The outdoor shower was a huge perk, and the breeze coming off the lake means you can enjoy the porch even in hot weather. The pool was big, deep and partially shaded…absolutely perfect! The hosts are so kind and quiet and give you all the polite privacy you could want."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect setting to unwind after a long day on the road. The hosts were friendly and unobtrusive. The guest house was well equipped. The pool, outdoor shower, hammock and patio were hits with everyone. My wife and I both had a great night’s sleep in the king bed—would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this properties pool house was more than sufficient and very comfortable! Plenty of towels, comfortable bedding, kitchen dishes, ice, bath robes, etc., were provided! plenty of seating inside. Very cute and nicely decorated. It feels very homey. Our one time needing communication was promptly available and they were super nice to speak to! The pool is an awesome bonus . We spent our Friday walking downtown Greenwood shops, ate at the Crystal Grill, our Saturday in the pool, and Saturday evening with a Viking cooking class! Great location to stay as an alternative to the Alluvian hotel. My only notation is that the outside area was a tad bit unkept adjacent to the pool and was “junky” and the porch furniture was pretty dirty and could have used a blowing off. It did not affect our stay in a large way - this was our only notable negative. There are also plenty of fans set i’m up so that you may still enjoy the porch in the Southern Delta Summer! this was a huge plus! I would definitely return to this property again& recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Cypressbend! It’s a beautiful oasis in the middle of the delta. Peaceful, secluded but still close enough to Greenwood for our activities. The guest house had everything we needed (even fresh flowers!) and the porch and pool were perfect.
We will be back!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming & rustic pool house with all the comforts of home…well-appointed, comfortable, and clean. The outdoor shower was a unique and wonderful experience."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars, all around! The place is cozy, perfect instructions to find, hosts are welcoming and helpful. Cottage was well stocked with creature comforts, ones we knew about and ones we didn't. Perfect home away from home - Would ABSOLUTELY recommend!"

Always extremely well kept, clean and beautiful. Truly, its the host for me. They are so accommodating & kind. If the home isn't available, I reconsider my dates, unless I have to be there..."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,This is a nice cottage for a reasonable price. The owner was very nice and helpful. There was some noise from loud music from a nearby park at night but not unbearable. We would stay here again if in the area!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This bnb is so lovely and Bill is the most welcoming and helpful host. It was a breeze checking in and checking out. The lake and areas to walk are just incredible. Stay here if you’re looking for sunshine and breath.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in a handful of Air B&B’s and while we haven’t had a bad stay yet, this place was the best. If you are going to be in the area I don’t think you could find a nicer place. My wife and I can’t wait to come back, so very clean and comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom just makes it feel like you are in luxury. Perfect for an overnight stay or a long getaway!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cozy cottage
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely cozy house. The heated floors in the bathroom were a welcome addition given the snow storm. The kitchen is well equipped and we were able to cook dinners with everything there. Fridge is only a small bar fridge though. We found this to be a good base for a few days of birdwatching in the Mississippi Delta with some good winter birds on the property too.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay in schlater. Not to far from Greenwood and lots of good amenities.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, well appointed guest house. It was a great fit for our family needs. The men hunted each morning and the girls felt cozy, safe and at home while they were out."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience overall! Absolutely beautiful place to stay, 15 minutes to Greenwood and wonderful hosts! We will definitely be staying again!"

The kitchen was fully stocked and we cooked a lovely dinner with our family. The beds and pillows were a dream! Best sleep!! Beautiful scenery, we look forward to future stays!!! Thank you so much!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To all who are thinking about booking this Airbnb, DO IT NOW! It is the absolute best. Honestly, if I could have stayed a day longer, I would have just to hang outside in the courtyard. The property is so beautifully maintained and gives such a calm experience. The cottage is perfect. It is extremely clean with all the amenities you need for your stay. It was so warm and cozy. I loved every moment of my stay.
Finally, Bill… Is the perfect host. He was quick to respond and so kind. I can’t wait to return and stay again. If this property is available during my visits, I will stay here over any other Airbnb or hotel."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this small cottage with plenty of room for 3. We were glad we arrived in the day time to find our way, just because we were unfamiliar with the area. A great relaxing weekend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"☆☆☆☆☆ Very quaint Air BnB! My friend Melynda & I enjoyed our stay for the weekend. Very organized, spacious, and the King bed is really comfortable. 20 minute drive into Greenwood for the Viking Cooking School experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. Bill had anything and everything you could possibly need. Much more pleasant and relaxing compared to a hotel. Will visit again soon! ♡"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful stay! Such a peaceful, clean rental. Would highly recommend if in the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mr. Bill was amazing to communicate with throughout my visit. The weather was crappy, but the cottage is so inviting that it didn't matter to me that I was ""stuck inside."" Read the directions to find the cottage carefully because it will take you around the world on your GPS! HA. Be mindful the owner's home is very close to the cottage, but it was quiet and not intrusive in the least. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the pool was clean! You will have everything you need such as towels, clean sheets, kitchenware, utensils, and so much more. Enjoy your stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this beautiful place for a peaceful and intimate getaway. The accommodations were cozy with just about every amenity you could think of. We will definitely be repeat customers!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great visit to Schlater! If you want a beautiful and relaxing home base to explore the Delta this is the spot. Bill and Jane go above and beyond to make your stay an enjoyable experience and couldn’t be friendlier. It was just the trip we needed to close out the summer.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and attentive hosts. Romantic setting.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Place makes you want to live there!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Go ahead and enjoy some of the wonderful restaurants in and around Greenwood. We went to Websters which was wonderful and heard lots of good things about the Crystal. The house had a wonderful kitchen and with a Walmart within 15 minutes, we were able to cook a wonderful meal in."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place. We enjoyed our time.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly, gracious hosts without being obtrusive. Good location for our day trips to Greenwood and Indianola. Nice, relaxing guest house to come back to! We also enjoyed the pool and the outside shower was convenient! Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay and we still love it. Everything is always perfect from cleanliness to hospitality, we hope to be back again someday soon."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely spot for a getaway. It's secluded and quiet but still close enough to town for groceries and/or venturing out to one of the few local restaurants. The bed is amazingly comfortable, the pool is fabulous, and the outdoor shower was a fun touch. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes and utensils, but be sure to bring whatever ingredients you need (there's a Walmart about 15 minutes away where we got our groceries)."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is quiet and comfortable in a beautiful setting. The interior was very clean, with some lovely touches. The outdoors was a lovely setting among the trees. I especially enjoyed the pool."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay and unwind a bit from the world and was not too far from town.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Bill's Grand Rentals was just that! GRAND! I haven't another name for it. Refreshing, new upgrades, beautiful textural decor, relaxing, and tons of surprising luxuries. Grand Rentals is small but very cozy and befitting. I would call it a cross tour oasis of the city and country vibe."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I don’t even where to start! We needed a place to stay overnight because we had a long trip home with a 16 month old. Bill was beyond kind and hospitable. Truly treated my son as if he were his own grandchild. One of the best hosts, if not, THE BEST, we have encountered.
The house is as beautiful as the stories behind the property. They have thought of everything to make this space perfect. Beautiful pool and garden area, outdoor shower, quiet porch and sitting area, and the inside was welcoming and comfortable.
We would recommend this place to anyone and we would love to come back and spend more time than we were able to."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! My family and I have stayed here twice now, definitely our first choice when we come to visit family in the area. Bill and Jane are great hosts, and keep their property so beautiful, and at night it is like a magical fairytale land! Thanks again for a great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived to the welcome drinks by the pool, we felt welcomed and completely at home. Southern hospitality at its best!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely guesthouse is large, comfortable and equipped with everything needed for a relaxing escape. It is behind the owners, Bill and Jane's house and has it's own large porch looking out onto the pretty garden, with pool and fountain. It is fairly remote so you may want to bring your own breakfast supplies and snacks. Restaurants in Greenwood are about 25 minutes away (Giardinas was very good). We enjoyed meeting Bill and Jane who were very responsive before our stay and nearby if you need anything."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cypressbend is perfection. Our family of four enjoyed the guesthouse and learning of it’s history from the most gracious southern host. We will definitely be back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you need a place to relax and unwind this is the place to be! We loved every minute of our stay and cannot wait until our return! Hosts are amazing and we could not have been happier with this AirBnB!!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Southern hospitality is alive & well at Cypressbend! This place is so beautiful & the hosts, Bill & Jane, couldn't be more accommodating. The house was sparkling clean & had everything you'd need to enjoy your stay. My wife & I felt very welcomed by our hosts but enjoyed absolute privacy while we were there. We felt so relaxed as we lounged by the pool & read our books in the oversized hammock in front of the fountain. The house is so tastefully decorated & the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept like babies! The outdoor shower is an extremely cool & unique feature that we very much enjoyed as well. The grounds are immaculately well maintained with a garden bursting with colorful flowers & fruit trees lining the back of the property. We loved taking walks in the evening down by the cypress lined river that runs in front of the main house. There is also a fire pit that Bill provided wood & fire starter for so that we could make s'mores! Our stay there was extremely peaceful & we left there feeling very refreshed. You know it's an amazing place when you're planning your next visit on the drive home, right!?"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing property with a great host.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a delightful weekend and really was impressed at this little garden escape. Completely away from the city and so peaceful! Everything was so nice and clean and had plenty of towels for the pool. First time swimming in a salt water pool. Not a big fan however I'm sure it has it's perks. Love how big and unusual deep it was! Would have preferred it to not have been so murky but understandable it's still early in the year for swimming. The outside shower was delightful and so enjoyable! Makes you want to stay there all day however the hot water does eventually run out. Our weekend went by way to fast! Would love to visit again! My nephew and son was so excited about their new friends they made with the wild life. Coming home from vacation with pets is an unexpected treat!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Friendly service, that truly makes you feel more like family than guests!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful oasis hidden within the Delta. We almost felt as if we had walked into a Southern Living photo shoot. The home is lovely, peaceful, and inviting. We enjoyed exploring Greenwood, Indianola, and Cleveland and then relaxing on the front porch while gazing at the fountain and pool. Plan to bring a few provisions as the nearest groceries and restaurants are in Greenwood. We would love to return to this property. Bill and Jane are exemplary hosts!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! My husband and I were looking for a relaxing getaway, and that's exactly what we got.
This was the first time I've rented an Airbnb in which the host was on site. I had wondered how the experience might be different, and quickly realized it was in all the best possible ways! Bill greeted us and gave us a tour of the guesthouse. He's put a lot of time and thought into every detail and it shows. Speaking with him was like visiting with an old friend. His place is just as warm and inviting as he is.
A short drive to Greenwood to visit the local shops and restaurants made this location perfect. Bill gave us suggestions on places to eat and visit that were spot on.
If you're looking for a place to stay as a couple, family, or a girl's getaway you've found it! We can't wait to visit again ourselves."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place and the hosts were wonderful!
2021-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,for that area it is what's expected.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the most stunning home I have ever stayed in. Bill and Jane were awesome, fascinating, authentic, trustworthy and such a delight!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bill, thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home with my family. The skill and work put into the house is astounding. Last night, we were able to relax before a funeral and look out unto the beauty of Quiver River. The garden, coy fish pond, wood ready for the fireplace... all of it! Thank you for hospitality!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great relaxing spot way out in the country. Enjoyed drinking coffee on the front porch & relaxing in the hammock. Easy access to Greenwood. Also thoroughly enjoyed visiting with the host!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The area is quiet and beautiful. The host was kind, attentive, yet respectful of our privacy. The lodge is close to Greenwood and one can reasonably drive elsewhere in the Delta. My family enjoyed our time at this lodging and would return again if we’re in the area."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was perfect for 3 of us to gather for a family girls weekend! The house is beautiful and the kitchen has a great supply of pans, utensils, and serving items. The space was immaculate with comfy bedding and lots of extra blankets, towels, etc. Spent the day hiking at Grenada Lake and then the afternoon playing in the pool, which was awesome! Bill is an awesome host and we would definitely stay again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a charming, quiet pool house! perfect for a three-day weekend: we stayed in and cooked and lounged by the pool!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our little family needed a break from the constant being at home this year, and this proved to be the perfect vacation. Our young kids loved seeing the frogs and koi fish and had a blast splashing in the pool the whole time! The house was very clean and had everything we needed. The hosts were very friendly and kind. Would definitely recommend and will be back ourselves I’m sure!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful and memorable experience at Cypress Bend. The clean and spacious cottage has a great front porch with a hammock and trickling fountain nearby. The pool and surrounding yard providing a relaxed and peaceful setting to waste the day away. The place also serves as a great home base to further explore the surrounding Delta with Greenwood serving as the closest major city with many fine restaurants and shops. The hosts, Bill and Jane, were so gracious and exemplified that famous Delta hospitality. We highly recommend and will definitely be back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very special that you will love because it has all the comfort of five stars
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish I can give 6 stars but I can only give 5. Just want I was looking for...right in the middle of nowhere. SPARKLING CLEAN! Hopefully, I'll be back sometimes soon. Thanks Bill."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at this cottage for our annual girls trip. The hosts were out of town but were easily accessible and checked on us to make sure we didn’t have any problems checking in and made several dining suggestions. We ended up just staying in and eating our meals in the guest house. We only ventured out to shop for pottery. The guest house was very nice, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the beautiful pool and sitting on the front porch under the fans. The hosts provided bug spray as mosquitos are bad this time of year. Fresh flowers from the hosts beautiful yard, comfy robes, and big beach towels were nice touches. We had a wonderful and relaxing time. We will definitely be back!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a wonderful time! Our kids loved the pool. We got to relax on the porch and watch them swim. The kids really enjoyed the spa robes too. We will be back very soon.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a relaxing and enjoyable experience. We wanted a quick weekend getaway, and this was it! Driving in was slightly confusing, but that’s no fault of the owners, it’s just tricky to find. The pool was so pretty and the surrounding scenery made for such a picturesque experience. We ate dinner outside and got to see some fireflies dancing around the yard as it got darker! So pretty! Check out the swing across from the house that overlooks the swamp area, it’s so peaceful and pretty. We would definitely come here again!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cottage is beautiful and very clean. My kids really enjoyed the pool and especially loved helping the hosts feed the fish in their fountain. We spent a lot of time relaxing in the hammock and sitting on the front porch. The hosts were sweet to our family and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. We'll be back for sure
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a gem of a place to stay. The people are so kind and welcoming. The place is amazing with a perfect pool and quiet! So glad my family visited.

Bill and Jane were excellent hosts, with great advice for exploring the area. We will be back for sure!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hospitality here is unmatched!! It was just the relaxing weekend we needed. The pool, ambiance, and guest house were perfect for relaxation. There were many extra touches that made the place excellent. The owners are friendly and very accommodating. Highly recommend!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the space and the peace and quiet. Cute and charming place in the delta. We went up to see the sky lake WMA and the petrified forest. Just a weekend getaway and this provided the perfect home base. Will definitely go back.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The rental is clean and well appointed. It is an excellent value.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and great space.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and nice!
Very enjoyable!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect home base for our exploration of the Delta! It was close to stops in Cleveland (GRAMMY Museum, BB King, Dockery Farms) and Greenwood (Bryant’s Grocery, Delta Museum, shopping district). This little cottage was the perfect spot to stretch out and unwind after a day of adventure. Beautiful and cozy space"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is just what you see in the pictures- beautiful, clean, and lots of amenities. Our families favorite, during our cold weather visit, was the heated tile floors in the bathroom.
Bill was a great communicator and very hospitable! We will be back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely home is hosted by some of the kindest, most gracious hosts. This was our second girls’ getaway here, and this time we decided to spend more at the home, choosing to prepare some of our meals there - easy since the kitchen is very well-equipped. It was quite cold outside, but we were toasty warm inside. The owners even made sure we had everything we needed to build a fire in the fireplace."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet location a few miles from Greenwood. Very nice comfortable style with privacy and host was prompt and professional.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Always great!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well what can I say? This is a wonderful place to stay.....the owners Bill and Jane welcomed us as house guests with magnanimity and hospitality which has been unrivalled anywhere on our wonderful road trip in the US’s Deep South!
I cannot recommend this property as a tranquil place to stay highly enough, it truly is off the scale.....rural and exquisite. So pleased we found it!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed this place and really truly appreciate the owners. I was able to make a memory here that I’ll never forget!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was one of the most beautiful and serene places we’ve stayed. We look forward to staying here again. The owners are very thoughtful and pay extra attention to detail. So relaxing!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow...walking out the front door, passing the hammock, and diving into a swimming pool--a pretty exceptional way to begin your day! Bill was the consummate host, supplying plenty of tips and local lore. At once feeling removed from the world yet lacking none of its comforts, this is the kind of place that begs more than a single night."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent spot & hosts!!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful gem in the middle of nowhere. A gorgeous southern getaway!!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a wonderful end of summer getaway at Cypress Bend. Bill and Jane could not have been any more inviting and friendly—they exemplified true Mississippi Delta hospitality. The cottage was beautifully decorated and well appointed. The yard and pool were a wonderful oasis from the hustle and bustle of our daily lives. We hope to come back and make more memories at Cypress Bend.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is an exceptional place to stay, I couldn’t have asked for anything more during my stay. Very welcoming, extremely peaceful and phenomenal hosts! You will not be disappointed. I’ve stayed at a fair share of air BnB’s, and I’m sure plenty more in my future. But I won’t forget this one. Lovely place. ❤️"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My expectations were high, and they were exceeded! This house is delightful and perfect for a trip to the Delta. Amazing, generous, and thoughtful hosts who know everyone and everything about Greenwood. Great central location if you want to check out Delta history or see blues sites around the area. The pool is not to be missed!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay!! Super cute, super cozy!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in loads of AirBnBs, almost all truly good experiences. Every now and then, though, one is an oasis. This was an oasis.
Beautiful grounds. Gorgeous space. The AirBnB is a mother-in-law cottage. A beautifully-appointed mother-in-law cottage.
Four of us stayed there. My wife and I stayed in the bedroom. My daughter-in-law and her beaux stayed in the sofa bed. Everyone had a good night’s sleep, and there was plenty of space to not feel as if we were tripping over one another.
We met Bill briefly on the front end. Generations-deep Delta resident. A delightful soul.
This would be an excellent base from which to explore the Mississippi Delta. Highly recommended."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this location. Everything was perfect!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect beautiful greenery and to be spoiled
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"True definition of an Airbnb! Quiet, cute and off the beating path so you get a true feel of the Delta. Perfect hospitality and Bill definitely went the extra mile to make us feel welcomed! Perfect place if you are in Greenwood for the weekend or go to the Viking Cooking School. Will definitely be back!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Phenomenal!!! Great space! Great home! Great host!!! We loved everything about it!!!!

2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay here. Highly recommend if you need a bit more space than a hotel room like our group did. Easy drive to get to town as well.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such an incredible guest house! So spacious, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom are completely stocked with everything you need and the hosts have special touches like fresh flowers on tables and complimentary drinks available. We loved staying here on our weekend trip to Greenwood and hope to be back again! Perfect hosts and perfect home! Thank you!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The guesthouse was cozy, yet had all of the modern amenities. Very clean and private. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Secluded, private, wood burning fireplace, spacious, more amenities to name. Amazing place to stay and recharge. Literally a home away from home"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great getaway. The hosts were great and very accommodating. Lovely house and area. Very relaxing. We will visit again.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bill and Jane’s hospitality was outstanding! We had an amazing stay in their lovely house and highly recommend.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Home away from home.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautifully decorated as described in the picture. Unfortunately the host has pets herself and didn’t disclose this information upfront and my daughter has severe allergies especially to pets and this caused a bad allergic reaction so she spent the weekend very uncomfortable during the trip. I did reach out to the host and confirmed that she does own pets.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely will stay again, family was very comfortable and LaToya was very professional and nice. Thanks for allowing us to stay in your home ."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Latoya was super helpful and the place was awesome. When traveling I like to feel at home and that’s exactly what Latoya’s home provided for my group and I. I would 100% do it again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"LaToya’s place was extremely clean. The neighborhood was very nice and quiet. The beds were very comfortable. She did not offer amenities in the description so do not expect anything. There were no amenities at all. Not even coffee. So don’t expect anything extra. She did want the guests to wear shoe covers which were very slippery on the floor. I felt with the cleaning price we paid that we should have been able to wear our shoes. If you are just looking for cleanliness and comfort, this is the place for you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LaToya is an exceptionally amazing host! The house was PERFECT throughout. My second time booking and everything was great. I try to book this location whenever I’m in town. It books up fast so I recommend booking early if you have travel plans.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome area, Awesome home, and Awesome! We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Easy access to stores and banks.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home in a great area. It is very comfortable, its decorated beautifully, the back porch/deck area was wonderful. Whenever I am in the area visiting relatives and need a place to stay I would not hesitate to stay here again, in fact I don't think I want to stay anywhere else. Highly recommend !"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house. Host was very accommodating.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LaToya’s house was spotless. There were two couples in our group, and, while the bathrooms are not en-suite, they are split along the hall so privacy was still good. We didn’t do much but get ready and sleep there so no other feedback. There is a nice outdoor area and a grill if you wanted to cook at home while there."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was Great! The hostess was available and accommodating. The decor was nice and homey. The outside area was relaxing, clean, and safe giving us a place to enjoy nature."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I reply back on email sent
Here a few things I’ll add to the review as well
Nice house, great location, entertainment, games, washer:dryer, nice backyard yo chill with friend n family
I did not like that I was not told about a camera 🎥 in the inside of house as the master I had run across to go to the bathroom so it’s a invading of privacy and I may have not rented it or you books have covered it as you had the one in the den turn around but still could have be on.
I text about closet space as I was there 5 days n had to hang clothes after iron them all closet was locked, front door made of glass not tinted n neighbors can see through they house when they sit on porch so I did not sleep 😴 well, pots n pans was old n dirty-I had to borrow from friends to cook, weather changed could not adjust it, my husband said pit bbq was not cleaned, we have to clean the house before leaving when you charge a fee
We slept things that we did not have.
Overall your booklet n layout is awesome just"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Everything was very clean and had lots of space.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The decor was amazing, the neighborhood was nice and quiet and home is very spacious! my family of 6 was very comfortable here! The backyard is fenced in and great for smaller kids. I also love the notebook she left for us to know what to do in town! Check out Latoya's place!!!!"
2023-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Suggest bringing your own glasses to use for drinks. There were not any in the home. When I messaged the host to see if I was looking in the wrong place, she mentioned the last rental guests had broken the glasses. Would’ve been nice to have Solo cups or something to substitute.
Spotlights in the front of the house shine into the windows and front door and there are no curtains. There was loud music with bass in the neighborhood when we stayed. Consider bringing an eye mask and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,No complaints. Good stay
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for opening your home to us! Everything was excellent! Definitely look forward to staying here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect. LaToya was a very gracious host. I wish I had more time to enjoy the home. There’s a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere in the home from the time you enter. I definitely recommend and will plan for these accommodations whenever I’m in the area.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Stay was amazing!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"I will surely book at this location again. This home exceeded my expectations. Soooo, clean an nicely decorated. I was not ready to return home on our final day.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great spot to settle in and enjoy Mississippi Delta hospitality. LaToya's home is just as described: clean, charming, cozy, and comfortable. Our family of four enjoyed our visit, rested soundly, and felt at home in the quiet and friendly neighborhood. The location was ideal; close to charming downtown Greenwood and just a short drive to some must-visit spots (Drake's BBQ being one!). The house was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our three-day stay. The backyard was an oasis, especially in the July Delta heat! A light breeze and the shade in the seating area she's created made it perfectly comfortable, especially in the early mornings and evenings. Our kids super appreciated Connect4 and UNO and it helped them feel welcome and at ease. LaToya was responsive, gracious, and friendly in all our communications. This is a great spot to land and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend to others!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Latoya’s home was as described. It was very cute and clean. Check in was very simple and smooth and Latoya made herself available to us during the duration of our stay.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space full of southern charm! All rooms were clean and the house was nice and cozy! I would highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting your home away from home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Probably one of our favorite places we’ve stayed at through Airbnb. Incredibly cozy and the place is so interesting and cool looking. There’s so many little extras that we didn’t expect, such as a stocked cocktail bar and breakfast for the entire stay. It’s in a quiet part of town and feels very private. This will be our go to place from now on when we visit. Highly recommended."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place! Every room tells a story. So unique and creative. This is a very charming cottage in a nice, quiet neighborhood. We walked to downtown Greenwood for dinner and shopping. Stopped at several historical sights on the drive to Clarksdale a music festival."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann was an amazing host. Her recommendations for restaurant choices were not only delicious but were also diverse. Ann went far beyond what is expected to have everything just right. The Art Bungalow is a work of Art. It was a real joy to stay there.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed every second of our stay! The house was so cozy and inviting with so many special touches. Ann had thought of everything you may need and was very responsive. It was in a very quiet and peaceful area yet close to many restaurants and things to do!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The Art Bungalow is absolutely adorable!! My husband and I felt so relaxed sitting on the porch and walking around the neighborhood remembering how wonderful my childhood was growing up there. I would highly recommend Ann’s place for a relaxing place to stay if you’re in Greenwood. The Art work and details of this place is fantastic!

We can't wait to come back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was amazed at Ann’s place .. She is a super host that really makes you feel at home .. the art work is exquisite , plus the way she makes it have a Delta/New Orleans feel is so cool! I give this place 5/5 stars no doubt 🙌🙌"

It’s a 10/10 based off of serenity alone. The fishing is spectacular also! I caught my personal best bass and what a time that was! I will definitely be returning!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To say the helped me in a “bind” is an understatement! They took me in as a very last minute reservation, even accommodated an early check-in! Lucky for me they had a last minute cancellation.
Incredibly beautiful location, that view from the patio and hammock is gorgeous. In home is extremely tidy and neat. The kitchen and bathroom incredibly well stocked. So thrilled I had to change my plans, and grateful they were able to accommodate. I absolutely hope to stay again when I visit family in the area.

We rented the boat for two days and it was perfect! Very sturdy and the seats were comfortable. We caught close to 20 large mouth bass so, if you love to fish, this is the perfect spot for that as well.
Really cannot say enough nice things about it! If you are looking for the perfect private lake front cabin getaway that feels rustic yet comfortable, look no further!"
