2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was a great space for our two families meeting for the new year holiday.
The carpets are stained, it needs a deep clean and a refresh but overall it was functional.
We couldn’t get the sauna to work while we were there but it could have been because of one of the 29,000 unlabeled light switches around the house being flipped in the wrong direction."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was amazing! It was secluded but still close to things that were needed. Natasha the property manager was amazing! She provided kids toys and a Christmas tree when she found out our daughter was going to be there. Alex was always quick to respond and very accommodating. If we come back to the area we will definitely rent here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an incredibly peaceful location where we were able to enjoy seeing wildlife, complete privacy, and spectacular views from every location of this home. We have a large family and everyone was so comfortable. Our hosts were so helpful and made sure our stay was 5 stars in every way. We will definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a very comfortable stay at this lovely home. We enjoyed the views of the wooded property from the home’s large windows.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to relax in nature and go back in time to the 70's. We loved the styling of this Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house where unique comfort was seamlessly blended into nature. We enjoyed grilling, having a fire, watching the deer and buzzards, playing billiards, watching the large TV and relaxing in the huge house with plenty of space to stretch out.
The house was very clean despite some of the reviews I read. The cleaners were leaving as we arrived and they seemed to take pride in their job as they even left their shoes outside to go in the clean house.
Beware of the many light switches and stovetop that seems to have a mind of its own but everything else was perfect.
Would highly recommend this unique stay to anyone that needs to relax in the Weirton Area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were looking for a venue to have a 90th birthday party for our aunt who lives in Steubenville. We had relatives coming in from all over the USA... as far away as Anchorage. It was perfect! It was spacious and had entertainment both inside and out (pool table, dartboard, foosball, hiking trails, deer watching). The vibe was Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water meets The Brady Bunch. The bedrooms were large with plenty of storage space. The beds were very comfortable. The master bedroom bathroom had a sauna as well as a step-down tile bathtub and full body shower. We loved the full frontal windows which brought in lots of sunlight and provided excellent views. The owner was extremely accommodating and welcoming. She even had a little gift bag and card waiting there for the birthday girl! We were just there for a long weekend so we didnt get to enjoy everything this bnb had to offer. We'll just have to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect in every way, this house will exceed all your expectations!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Very professional and amicable making us feel right at home during our stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex was very easy to work with. The wildlife was constant around the house and great to see from the main living area. The kitchen counters and table weren't wiped off and I don't think that all the rooms were swept/vacuumed before we entered as there were still things on the floor. All in all a great spacious house to stay at. If I could recommend anything, it would be to note or label what all the light switches go to. There are so many and it was a little difficult to figure out."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,As comfortable and equipped with nice amenities the house was the highlight for us was the daily parade of the deer herd and flock of turkeys! Bring a bag of corn and enjoy the show!!
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Large house. Great for families. Outdoor space is deceiving in photos.
Was able to have a space for my dogs to run without being close to the road."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating hosts. Very responsive to our late check out request.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is on a very lovely property. There are lots of trees and space. The house itself is very roomy. There are 3 separate rooms on the ground floor which was very helpful for those with limited mobility. My family enjoyed the billiard room. The laundry facilities are excellent. The kitchen is very functional with many small appliances and well stocked with plates, cups, etc.
Beds are comfortable.
The one drawback is that despite the large gorgeous front windows, the house was a bit dark. But overall we really enjoyed the house."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The home is perfect for a large group or family. Lots of sitting areas and dining tables. It is fully stocked and everything is provided. I will be booking here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a great time, very peaceful and loved appreciating all the odd choices this home has seen via renovations."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay - we were pleased with the house! It’s got a fun vibe and was perfect for a weekend with friends!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Spacious loved the deer and fawn outside beautiful window view. Very accommodating
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house itself was amazing, so spacious and cozy at the same time. I loved that the property it’s private worth tress around the house. The sauna was worth to try 🤗I’m definitely satisfied with the stay in this beautiful place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex provided flexibility and was very responsive to our questions. The house reminds me a bit of a Frank Lloyd Wright design and is very spacious, with kitchen upgrades. I liked that there was plenty of sitting space to either watch TV, and still have a room for quiet conversation in the next room. The grounds allow for restful and private sitting outside or short walks."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is super cool, great for larger groups due to the two levels and lots of space. The property is beautiful and it was so relaxing to have coffee outside every morning. Just secluded enough. Alex was a really helpful and responsive host and everything felt super easy and relaxed which was lovely. The dogs had a great time as well!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and comfortable home. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying here again in the future.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The place was great. The air did not work on our first night there and that was a little uncomfortable but somebody came the next day to take care of that. There was a little smell but I just took it as the place being shut up. The property itself was very peaceful and serene. Everything was as described. It did take me some time to figure out the stove as it was digital. Overall the stay went good.
2023-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"A unique home in a beautiful location. It's an old house so there is some wear and tear (stained carpets, out of order bathroom, lights out) but if you can deal with some minor issues, its a wonderful space for a getaway."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great hosts and comfortable home.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent hosts. Attentive to your needs. Dedicated to making you feel at home.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Phenomenal hospitality. Quick responses by host. Comfortable home.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here, mainly because my husband was raised in nearby Newell, and he has family in Steubenville, so it gave us a central location to be our home base for this trip. It was also a place where our family could spread out, relax, watch the deer, and just de-compress. The home was super unique. While the home is dated, it is appropriately dated and brings about a feeling of nostalgia as you walk through the doors. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay if you are ever in the area, our whole family loved it and quite honestly didn't want to leave. It will be our go-to place to stay for future visits to the West Virginia panhandle."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is truly home away from home. The location is phenomenal, the house is beautiful, and you’re guaranteed to have a wonderful time. There is an abundance of wildlife on the property, we saw several deer and a couple of turkeys roaming around which was amazing.
We did run into a few issues during our stay:
• The house was not as clean as we would have liked. My Mom spent the first couple of hours wiping down things down in the kitchen, picking up used q-tips in one of the bedrooms, getting rid of spider webs in the entry, etc. knowing that there is a $250 cleaning fee attached to this location you would expect it to be immaculate.
• The powder room toilet wasn’t working, we appreciated the sign they placed on the toilet but feel like it should have been fixed prior to our stay.
• The tv was difficult to figure out with all the random wires and everything everywhere. My Dad and Uncle spent nearly an hour trying to hook things up (mind you my Dad is an engineer at a tv station) but out of all the random boxes of wires nothing worked so we ended up going to Walmart to buy our own Roku to be able to watch tv during our stay.
• We discovered on our way out as we were cleaning the kitchen that the garbage disposal wasn’t working.
• We were going to bbq since we saw a bbq out in the patio area but when you open it up you can see that the panels where the propane comes out on the burner area is broken so we just covered it back up and left it alone.
•The day before we left there was a notice left at the door that the power was going to be shut down the day we were leaving. Luckily it didn’t shut down before we left.
• The bedrooms downstairs had bed sheets put up in lieu of curtains/blinds and it looks tacky and in two of the bedrooms they didn’t even cover up the entire window so people could see in, especially at night.
• The carpeting downstairs is stained and needs to be replaced
Even with these issues we absolutely loved our time there. The check in and check out was extremely easy, its a fantastic place to stay with the family, its about 10 mins away from Kroger and Walmart, and lots of restaurants nearby. We visit the area yearly and are definitely going to be coming back to stay."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, quiet location. We enjoyed our stay and the adequate space the house provided for our family of 5. However, the downstairs bedrooms need help with their curtains. One bedroom has a white sheet held up by 2 plastic hangers....?? The sheet is knotted around the clothes hangers is an eyesore. The other two downstairs bedrooms have curtains that are too small.
We could never figure out how to turn on the TV. The cords were all a mess under the television and quite frankly, we were afraid to mess with them too much. There are at least 3 boxes and a dozen cords.
We appreciate the 70s vibe, but the carpet downstairs is stained, the lamp shades torn, and the couch cushions ripped in some places.
The mattresses are very firm, so be prepared for that, especially if you're not used to such.
We would stay here again if some of these concerns were addressed. I still give this house a 4 because of the space, beautiful outdoor scenery and location."
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Wonderful retro house! Lots of space and beautiful location. Carpets are old -owners state they will be replacing in the fall.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this trip back in time! Seriously like entering a time capsule, we were in town for my Grandmother’s birthday so there was plenty of space for the 8 of us, 3 couples and one with 2 young kiddos. Our kids loved the grounds, I loved morning coffee and the views! A few areas of the home definitely need a little love, but overall we had a great stay!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very unique, very quiet neighborhood. The place has a lot of potential and id very well laid out. We would definitely stay here again"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! Perfect for our family, space to spread out, bedrooms were comfy, big bath tub was a win, beautiful views out the windows. I loved my morning coffee on the screen porch."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,truly spectacular. Would go back in an instant.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house on a large property so it was quiet. The house has great character and I recommend anyone visiting the area to stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely stunning mid century house tucked away in Weirton.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is perfect for a family vacation. We thoroughly enjoyed staying on this somewhat secluded property. Taking walks around the large property, playing in the pasture, and making snow angels in the snow kept us busy. When children aren’t playing outside, there are board games, a pool table, and a tv to keep them entertained inside. We were in town for my daughter’s wedding; the old ironing board and iron in the master bedroom closet were very useful for dress shirts. Our little boys enjoyed taking a bubble bath in the jetted tub. We would be happy to stay here again if we return to the Steubenville/Weirton area for a visit.
*Side note: One of the recent reviews said that the glass stovetop doesn’t work. It does. If the stovetop isn’t working for you, hold down on the lock symbol, and it should unlock the stovetop. There is an instruction booklet for the stovetop on the counter."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, 70s infused fun mansion/cabin in the middle of a gorgeous estate. Very private, with fantastic communication with the host. The sauna was a great touch! Definitely recommend for a weekend away from the city."
2021-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house is in a beautiful secluded location and it provided us with a lot of privacy throughout our entire trip. The host, Mary was very friendly and welcoming. However, the amenities and maintenance need a little improvement. Overall, a good stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great home to come and relax and visit with family. It was huge with plenty of room to enjoy. Loved the pool table and the fully stocked kitchen! The grounds were beautiful to take walks around. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This property is absolutely beautiful!! The house is old style and definitely quirky! The game room made our stay extra fun. The cleanliness of the house was minimal. The floors were not clean and dog hair and dead bugs were all over the carpets and tile. The listing says pets aren’t allowed so I wasn’t aware that there would be dog hair, and I have a child who is allergic so that wasn’t fun, for anyone who might also have someone allergic to dogs. For anyone bringing small children, the stairs are tricky. Other than that, the property was very cool."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Big spacious older home that works for larger families or guests, it worked for our needs but was very impressed, property manager was great to work with and helpful."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,A little piece of secluded heaven
2021-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"A unique home situated on a park-like secluded setting! Beds and linens were fresh but carpets could use a serious deep clean. The kitchen was our favorite part of the house.
Communication was a bit problem before we got to the house. It took the owners quite a while to answer any of my questions. However, once we were there, the point of contact was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed."
2021-09-01,4.0,Group trip,We had a very nice time! An interesting place to stay at! If it’s a hot weekend. Make sure u check to c if the ac is working
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time staying here! The kitchen was a great size for cooking with friends, the screened in porch was lovely for dinner or board games, and the bar area - featuring a pool table - was a riot. The AC was broken while we were there, but the house does a great job keeping itself cool due to the surrounding greenery. Would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a relaxing weekend retreat!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you want to step back and time stay at his lovely and unique home! We were in town for a family funeral and 6 of us stayed here very comfortably, it was a lovely setting to unwind and reconnect with plenty of space for everyone. The host did a great job of communicating. Two days prior to our stay the AC at the property was struck by lightning and we were notified, given the option of cancellation versus continuing our stay. Due to the circumstances we elected to stay anyway and take our chances on being toasty, but the host did everything possible to make the house comfortable. Because of its shaded setting and architecture it didn't get hot to start with, and they provided a number of floor fans which did a great job of making the house comfortable. We particularly enjoyed hanging out on the back screened porch in the evening. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of towels, sheets, etc. I would stay here again when we are back in the area."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Tons of space and plenty of bathrooms. could easily support large groups of people. very clean. bring your own cookware.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My wife, my good friend and his wife and I stayed at King Zola over an extended July 4th weekend this year and had a great time. The property was large and invited hiking and exploration. The house itself was also large and provided numerous spacious common areas to hang out in and was spread out enough to afford privacy. There were plenty of amenities, enough that there really was no good reason to leave the estate except for the purpose of obtaining groceries and the occasional meal at local restaurants. The property is also surprisingly close to Pittsburgh, so we ended up taking a daytrip there. We only communicated with Mary, the local host, a small handful of times, but she was always prompt and informative.
The only criticism we had was the general state of cleanliness. The sinks and toilets had obviously been cleaned, and I assume the linens as well (no evidence otherwise), but that seemed to be about it. The carpets needed vacuuming and there was enough mildew in the showers that it was clear that they hadn't been cleaned recently. Fortunately, there were brushes in each shower that allowed us to scrub off the mildew relatively easily and we ran the dishes through the dishwasher (the kitchen cabinets and drawers could use a good cleaning) and wiped down the counters and surfaces shortly after our arrival. it wasn't thoroughly disgusting or anything, but our curiosity about where the cleaning fee went became a bit of a running joke.
Long story short... We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and even with the lapse of (in our opinions) adequate cleaning we would highly recommend staying here. It was a wonderfully relaxing environment and had everything we needed. Very good value for the money."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for our group! Lots of space and the location was excellent! It was like staying at a resort in a park,
I would highly recommend booking here,
Mark"
2021-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"It's an absolutely wonderful space. Very retro (we felt like we were in the 1960s, which was fun!). Very private but also close to anything you could want to do. Mary was very accessible the whole time and even didn't mind us checking in early. I would suggest bringing your own pillow, but other than that, it's a fantastic place to stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. So unique and spacious. Amazing outdoor areas to enjoy and just overall really great. Good for families or a few friends who want to get away for a weekend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, lots of things to do inside. We liked our stay and would come back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Neat place
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"King’s Zola Estate is a gem of a place located in Weirton, WV with easy access to Franciscan University in Steubenville, OH, Pittsburgh, PA & everywhere in between!! It is a gorgeous, funky, time capsule in a beautiful, natural setting!! Plenty of space for a big family or group of friends to stay, large kitchen to cook & gather, outdoor deck, screened in porch, pool room, sauna... lots to keep you busy or lots of places to just chill out & relax looking out onto the property with the entire wall of windows. Our family truly enjoyed our stay!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is a slice of heaven. We were speechless when we entered the house and tried to cherish every moment while there. The house has everything you might need and it was sparkling clean. It was truly a vacation I will never forget.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a gem! If you want to stay in a real mid-century modern, this is it. Lovely property and architecture. Had everything we needed for a retro-inspired weekend! Enjoyed the pool table, sauna and outdoor space! Highly recommend! Hope to go back!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic weekend getaway spot for a group of people. Beautiful location in WV with many trails and state parks to explore. The grill and deck were perfect to relax and eat at after a good hike. The bar and pool table room on the first floor was another great place in the house to enjoy. Then sweat it out in the sauna on the second floor. Nothing but sunshine and blue skies and this place. Thanks again for a great weekend stay.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing property! We had so much fun there. We went for long walks, played pool, chess, cards, monopoly. The sauna was a nice touch. We used it for couple of times after long walks in the woods to get warm. We used both fireplaces downstairs an upstairs. They were really nice to sit by and look at the fire with a glass of wine. The view from the grand living room was spectacular! The house needs a little more TLC, but other than that, it’s a great place to be and spend a nice time with family and friends. We hope to be back one day!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful spot for a unique weekend getaway. We loved the decor, pool table and multiple fireplaces. Easy drives to local hikes and other amenities (be sure to visit the Wine Jug just down the road if you need libations.) Quick responses and easy check-in make this home a no-brainer for anyone looking to relax. We will absolutely be returning."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"I could be all wordy and descriptive, instead I will just say Wow! We had a great time. Can’t wait to return."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Love the architecture! Plenty of room. Convinced these awesome pictures don’t the home justice! Our group of 7 had a blast for the weekend!
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex’s place was absolutely incredible! What a spot! The place could not have been cleaner and well put together. The communication was outstanding! I really appreciate Alex for allowing my guests and I stay at their beautiful property and hope to come back in the future! Would recommend to anyone. Thanks again, Alex."
2021-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"This house was everything we wanted it to be. We had a 70s themed gathering for my husband's birthday and this place was a time capsule. So many cool things to explore. The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed, was so responsive, and the friendliest people. The pool table was in excellent condition, the sauna worked great and the kitchen had everything we needed for home cooked meals. There were a few items that needed some TLC around the house as some other reviews mentioned but nothing that prevented us from having a great time! Such a great property."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was interesting and spacious and at an affordable price. The surroundings after the snow were beautiful through all the windows. The driveway was a bit of a challenge after a significant snowfall, but it was plowed before we had to try to go up again. Had we not had to be someplace especially early, no doubt we would not have had any problem getting down either.
We were in Steubenville for a wedding, so we didn't get the chance to take full advantage of the many amenities--especially the game room.
Regardless, it was a great environment, a great location (for our needs anyway) and a great value."
2021-01-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place to come
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous architecture in a spacious home—looking forward to coming back!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a very peaceful time capsule mansion it very clean, stocked pretty well with necessities, we had no issues with internet, some of the switches didn’t make very much sense but that’s no fault of the owner and didn’t take anything away from the experience, it was absolutely stunning on the property in the snow, my kids had fun running and playing on the property, also there was a large family of deer that lives there as well, overall it was a great Christmas experience and there is a strong possibility we will book again, maybe even in the summer.
As far as cons go make sure you are well prepared if you book for a winter time holiday, the local snow removal business apparently do not operate on holidays here. And the water in the showers overall definitely could have been hotter other than those two things it was a very pleasant experience. And the hosts were super responsive, super friendly, and were willing to help with anything we needed to know or needed throughout our stay."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very large. We had a nice time cooking, playing pool, watching movies, enjoying the views from all the windows and each other’s company. The shower and tub were great too. The grounds looked beautiful even covered in snow. We had a very nice time."
2020-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The retro feel of this house was cool but the cleanliness was terrible! When paying this much to rent a property you expect it to be a certain way. The kitchen and bathrooms were gross! All of the windows needed cleaned you can tell it hadn’t been dusted in years the mismatched furniture and broken lampshades we’re disappointing. This house has a lot of potential if it was just being taken care of properly won’t be staying again!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for something unique, spacious, and private, this is the place!
Loved the 70’s decor throughout! The property is great and open (saw tons of deer each day). If you like to hike, raccoon creek state park has some nice trails and is about a 20 minute drive."
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful family get away here. Pool table is very nice and good movie watching space. We played chess and walked the grounds after a snow and it was beautiful. The house needs some tlc in the comfort area but the architecture is what brought us there and that did not disappoint. Thanks!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, you will enjoy your stay!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean home! Loved staying here."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place. Beautiful view and outdoor hangout spot! Loved the sauna! Would def visit again.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was incredibly spacious and comfortable. The internet was not a problem for us as some of the other reviews have mentioned. One of our guests was able to work remotely from the house without any problems. There was very quick and helpful communication between myself and the property manager who responded to any questions that I had. We are from South Carolina, and this house will be our first choice whenever we visit my brother in Weirton."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome house!! This house was spacious, clean, and exactly as described. The property is truly beautiful in the fall. We had a great time doing photos with the leaves in the background. The house was nostalgic but also updated, very cool vibe overall."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the retroness of the whole house. Sauna was great too
2020-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at Zola Estate! There was plenty of room for us to spread out and enjoy the house and the beautiful trees on the grounds. This house offers great value for the cost and was very clean upon our arrival.
The only detractors for us were very poor WiFi performance and quantity of dish-ware in the kitchen. We couldn’t find a cable tv box and the WiFi speed couldn’t even support playing tv over Hulu, etc. without good cell service, this was frustrating.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay a lot and had fun playing pool, enjoying a retro vinyl player, and lounging in the living room with floor to ceiling windows.
Thanks for a great stay, Alex!"
2020-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Relaxing, quiet home. Enough room for a large family. Large kitchen and living spaces. Nice picnic spot on property. Deer family visited every evening."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A big space, comfortable, a little tired, a little spare, lighting could be improved, a couple small places needed a little scrubbing. Very peaceful. T-Mobile phone reception was very bad, even with Wifi."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alex's house is lovely! There is tons of room to spread out both in and outside. Our family group of 5 adults and 3 children stayed there a little over a week. It was hot and/or a little rainy most days we were there. However the large trees provided enough shade that most days it was quiet nice to be outside. We especially enjoyed eating outside on the deck that has the table with umbrella built into it. The house itself does not have a large deck attached to it but the large deck with umbrella picnic table is just a few steps away from the screened in porch room at the back of the house. The house is built into a hill so there are exits to the outdoors on both levels.
Mary, who cares for the house, is a joy to correspond with. She lived for many years in the house and responded quickly and pleasantly, including to our curious queries about the history of certain decorations. 🙂"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"A clean, spacious, and relaxing house in the woods with lots of retro charm. Fully recommend."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Location and the grounds were amazing and peaceful. We spent most of our time outdoors. House was very spacious with lots of areas to spread out. The house overall could have used a deep cleaning and pool table was not available for use when we arrived.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Definitely a very interesting property! Plenty of space for 8 of us to have a great weekend. Would definitely recommend if you're looking to stay somewhere in this area!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was such a wonderful experience. The house makes you feel like you’re staying in an antique mansion. It was huge and so spacious and clean as well. My friends and I never wanted to leave this place! I highly recommend going and I will definitely be returning to this destination soon.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is very unique place and worth visiting. Loved the pool table, sauna, outdoor space, etc. Love the 70s style (please do not change it!). Some improvements can be made wrt cleanliness of the place, but still worth overall five stars considering the price/performance."
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The estate is bigger than we expected and the house is also much bigger than it appears in the pictures. It’s so private and does not feel like you are in the city. We loved the floor to ceiling windows and the wildlife that came to greet us :)
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay - the space was plenty big enough for our large group staying here!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex’s place is over the top a great place to stay. The secluded home with long private driveway was great. The 4 bedrooms with 5 beds comfortably fit everyone. The jacuzzi bath tub in the bathroom downstairs was an awesome amenity. Also with provided bedding and plenty of towels as well as toiletries. Right down the road from a gas station and dollar general, short distance to restaurants and stores. Overall this place was truly amazing! Definitely will be back!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is breath-taking, both inside and out. The beds are comfy, the sauna is exquisite, and the tub was lovely. I learned chess here! The kitchen was phenomenal to cook in, and the land around the property is stunning. I will definitely be back! Great hosts, clear directions, and perfect stay. Thank you so much!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex's place is maybe the most unique place I've stayed. The house is spacious and cozy. We had everything we needed there. We will be back again!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It's like a journey through time without a doubt a spectacular property.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks !
2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, huge place, tons of land, we will be back"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Clean and the host is very responsive to questions.
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very beautiful estate. Tons of space and a very affordable price
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic scenery! Beautiful home with all the comforts of home
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to unwind with easy access to surrounding parks, casinos, and downtown Weirton"
2019-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very interesting and intriguing space...wonderful for families or multiple couples. It's a lovely large private yard and property, but with many restaurants, shops and businesses nearby."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect house for a rural golf outing or if you ever need to fit a larger group. Tons of space indoors and outdoors, easy location to golf courses and some restaurants/walmart."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a blast at this house for a weekend getaway. Plenty of room, clean, super quick responses. When I asked if there was a grill there, the one there was broken, they brought me one the next day! Very unique and good location."
2019-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"This place is very spacious for family get-togethers, and there are plenty of activities nearby for a fun weekend."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house can accommodate a big group. Of all the times we have visited Weirton, we knew this gem was there. It is hidden and private. It was like walking back in time. We appreciated the vintage feel of the home! And we will be booking this place again!"
2019-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Tucked away off the main road, this cabin is a great getaway. It housed 8 guys comfortably for our annual golf outing. Great outdoor area where we grilled out and played yard games."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in many Airbnb's, but this may be the most unique. An absolutely massive house that feels as though it's out in the forest (although it's actually very accessible), its absolutely packed with character and really fascinating details. The living room with it's floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto lush, green trees is really a sight to behold. It's not the most modernized house in the universe, but for a family trip where we needed a lot of space to spread out and multiple places to interact, this was perfect. Also: the master bath with it's dual showerheads, sunken basin and massive window overlooking the garden might be the most luxurious shower I've ever taken. Don't miss it."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cool place, saw several deer outside! Several lights/lightswitches not working, but not a major issue. Plenty of space!"
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is large with plenty of different rooms to escape to. The beds are comfortable and the place feels clean. Some rooms feel outdated but kitchen appliances and bathrooms have been updated. Kitchen items are sufficient enough for cooking for a family but the pans are in dire need of replacing as they are warped, dented, and scratched. This place could definitely benefit from new cookware, measuring cups and spoons, and some basic items that guests don't want to have to purchase at the store. The exhaust fan definitely needs to be fixed!
Wifi internet kicked us off our devices multiple times a day, the power went out during a storm, and the washer was not working during our 12 days there, although Mary was kind enough to offer to have someone do our laundry for us (we declined).
The indoor lighting is poor on one half of the house, some light switches do nothing, and some fixtures hang low enough that 6'3"" me has to duck under them. The pool table was very disappointing as the cue tips are destroyed. If you are renting for the pool table as a perk, bring your own cue.
Overall, the place was nice and we weren't disappointed. This place could easily be a 5-star, highly recommend, if they put in a couple hundred dollars into my suggestions."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Huge house with multiple perks. You feel like you are in a treehouse a little bit. Super fun and cant wait to return!!!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is every bit as gorgeous as you expect from the photos, it’s a very relaxing and comfortable home and we will definitely be back!!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great weekend celebrating our son’s graduation from Franciscan University. The location is about 15 minutes from campus.There was plenty of space for our extended family to hang out and visit .The setting is peaceful and park like. The house was unique like something out of a James Bond movie.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is very cool and comfortable. The style and decor are very charming. The house comfortably fit our large family. Lots of room both inside and outside. The property is amazing.
We’d definitely stay here again. It was very clean and the sheets and towels were really soft.
The pool table is great for rainy days and the yard is beautiful with deer and turkey."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cool property. I stayed there with a few of my work partners and we had a very good time in Kings Zola.
2019-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex's place is incredible. Wonderfully eccentric and full of surprises, we loved every second."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt very homey at Alex's place. There are beautiful open glass windows and secluded enough to see deer around the house. The hosts were quick to respond to any needs we had and were gracious to extend our stay as well. There is enough community space to spread out with a large group, and also spend time together. Would recommend adding some more lighting in the common areas, but otherwise we were very happy."
2019-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"This is a huge place with lots of personality. Our large group felt like it had the perfect combination of places to gather and places to be alone. The wifi was great, kitchen equipped well, bedrooms clean, and location charming. We ran into a few plumbing issues while we were here which was tough, but Alex responded quickly and did what he could to help us deal with those problems. For the location and everything the house has to offer, it was well worth the money."
2018-12-01,5.0,Group trip,An awesome place to stay
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I don’t know why this home exists in Weirton, but it sure is beautiful. The property was lovely and the architecture alone is worth a visit. The home could use some updating, but overall we were happy with our stay!"
2018-11-01,3.0,Group trip,Unique and charming. Frozen in time. Rustic and cozy.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with nice views
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a Great time for a party of 8 men visiting for a Steelers game. Spacious peaceful clean.
2018-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"As other reviewers share, this place is so unique. Our group loved the space - the enclosed porch, the game room/pool table, the windows/open face of the house. It rained all weekend, but even with a large group, we never felt ""cooped up."""
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique, enormous home in a beautiful setting. We had a fabulous time - the house was exactly as advertised, so there were no surprises. Alex was very easy to communicate with. Highly recommended!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great. Spacious, clean quiet and well built. The sauna in the master bedroom bath and the pool table were unexpected treats. Alex and his wife have made sure their guests have plenty of towels, soaps and paper goods. They are very responsive and wonderful to work with."
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place to stay. Open floor plan, windows everywhere. Relaxing setting. Would highly recommend to group of adults. We had some small children with us and spent a lot of time following them around making sure they didn't fall down stairs or break anything, so I wouldn't say it's the best place to have toddlers around. But for a relaxing getaway weekend with friends or family, it's perfect. Host and local property manager were easy to communicate with. Would stay here again."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is huge, spacious, full of cool retro furniture, it was like living in art! The hosts were great and offered help with anything! Thanks!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A luxury home in a beautiful setting!! In a Frank Lloyd Wright architecural style, the space was fantastic. Comfort dominated the decor and charm the natural setting. We were able to easily house our family for an event that was held 20 miles or so away in East Liverpool, Ohio. We will book again if ever in the area. Hosts were very accommodating and logistics were quite smooth."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10. I would host it again
2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a neat place and the hosts communicated clearly at all times. Would definitely stay again.
2017-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Alex's home has a fun 70s vibe, plenty of room and was perfect for what we needed."
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,No complaints here. Well worth it for what you pay
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was amazing. Pictures do not do it justice. The home is absolutely beautiful, and ridiculously spacious. We loved how secluded it was."
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a long weekend with my small office staff of 5. Each fall we set aside a weekend for a staff retreat, and this location was ideal. Lots of bedrooms, tons of space to work and relax, and a fun setting in the woods to help us let go of the stress of work and concentrate on making our company better. Many thanks!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is an amazing place. If you are in the area you dont want to miss the opportunity of staying there. Its clean, comfortable and incredibly spacious. We had a wonderful stay!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had our extended family visit from CA and this home was perfect for their visit! The lay gave privacy for the parents from the kids! The outside was awesome for the littlest to run and play. The rooms were great sized and so much gathering space for anything you could need. The design was amazing and as it was designed in Frank Lloyd Wright style, it was extra special to our family."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place rocks the kasbah! Would happily stay here again. Plenty of space for guests, there were deer wandering the grounds, and the whole place contains décor that will make you smile. Furnished with everything you need including dishes, dishsoap, garbage bags, et cetera. Check in/out was a breeze. Everything was very clean. Host responded quickly to all needs. Had a great time."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded, private, surrounded by quiet nature. Hasn't been updated, so it feels like stepping back in time when you enter this beautiful, large, mid-century home. Lots of space, indoor and out."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house is very interesting, and the wooded secluded property only enhanced what was an incredible property. Couldn't recommend it highly enough."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing to know is that you'll never find another place like this one. The property is secluded, full of wildlife (we accidentally ran into a tiny fawn several times much to its mother's dismay), lush with all kinds of plants and trees, and has a great patio. The architecture is facsinating and really gorgeous. The furnishings are a bit outdated but maybe the place is in transition.
Our group of 4 was comfortable with bedrooms on different levels and private bathrooms. There is a ton of common space with great picture windows that bring the outdoors inside. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kendra was so responsive and very helpful when it came to check in! The spotlights outside really helped when it came to taking the dogs out at night. The house was so clean and tidy when we arrived! It was perfect for our weekend stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice place, quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet, comfortable home away from home with all we needed for our stay in the Ohio Valley. Comfortable beds, plenty of soft, fluffy towels, games and books for all ages, this house was close to the Franciscan University of Steubenville, where we were attending a graduation ceremony. Kendra was a great host!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. 2nd stay, will stay again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A absolute wonder in the peaceful hills of Weirton had amazing amenities and spotless rooms for me and my company and definitely cheaper than expected I only ever needed to text her that I was leaving I will be booking again 🙌🏽

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kendra was a great host! She was very responsive and her directions were clear. The house was a cute and clean older property and it was a short walk to the Weirton Museum and Cultural Center and the Mary Weir Library. Thank you for a great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, clean, quiet :) The parking is street parking which is fine but not quite clear in the listing unless I missed it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kendra’s place was warm, welcoming, & cozy. The perfect place to stay for a last minute weekend getaway!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra’s home was perfect for our visit to the Steubenville area. The kitchen was well equipped and the linens /towels were spa quality with an amazing scent. Kendra was incredibly kind and accommodating. I would highly recommend this spot ♥️

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visiting family in Steubenville and this location was ideal! Easy to get in and out, but we parked on the street bc that driveway was no joke 😅 clean and comfortable, we'd love to stay again when we're in town!"

The beds were comfortable and sheets were crispy clean.
Very affordable.
Kendra was very responsive and helpful.
We will be back! Highly recommend to future guests."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy booking. Excellent communication about entry and exit instructions (pictures with directions were very helpful!). We arrived late and the porch lights were on to help us find the house. Street parking in front of the house was available. The neighborhood was older and slightly rundown but it was quiet all night. The house was very clean, nicely furnished and not cluttered. Kitchen had updated appliances with some dishes (coffee mugs, glasses). Bathroom updated with a big shower head and towels. Beds were comfortable with crisp, fresh, clean sheets and plenty of pillows. Heat was on when we arrived. There are window AC units for hot months. House has carpeted floors throughout. There was a noticeable odor inside that we couldn’t figure out though. There were 4 adults and a baby in our group and it was big enough for us. We were visiting a relative who lived 2 miles away so this house was a perfect location for us. We were only there to sleep so didn’t spend much time there."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet neighborhood, no problems at all. Nice and clean with lots of extra towels. A washer and dryer installed would be a great added bonus. So appreciative that pets are allowed. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely flexible and responsive. Perfect check in instructions and a cozy little place that was very clean. It was perfect for a short weekend visiting family.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable house with space enough for our family. Appreciate it being pet-friendly. Window air conditioners in both bedrooms and living room were a blessing over the hot weekend. Quick response time from host. Convenient location to highway, with 2 major state parks less than 30 minutes away and Pittsburgh not much farther."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was easy to find, easy to enter. There are lots of steps to get in so some folks may have difficulty. The bed was very comfortable, shower was okay. Cute little place, kitchen well stocked with plates and such.
Neighborhood was older but quiet after dark.
Only wish there had been some Kleenex, but that was it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We went to a concert at Star Lake Pavilion and Kendra’s home was very easy to get to from there. Perfect for what we needed!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house! Great location! Great price!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first airbnb rental ever. Lovely little home for our stay! Professionally cleaned and felt very comfortable. Some furniture items have some slight cosmetic damage, but that is the reality of renting a home to many people over time. Hosts were very friendly and my initial queasiness disappeared as I kept some contact and asked questions as needed. This location is right in downtown weirton, and very walkable to the dollar store and the public library. Neighbors are very sweet and lively and even an ice cream truck visited the street during our stay. Thanks for making our Weirton stay so comfortable!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what we needed it for.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Host very responsive. Small home was perfect for the two of us to attend a nearby conference. There are air conditioning units in the living room, master bedroom and 2nd bedroom, and they kept the place cool. I'll be back the next time we come for a conference in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, nothing fancy but just as expected, thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I attended a concert at Star Lake and this was a perfect spot for us to stay overnight. Kendra was a great host!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra was a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, very great value for the price. We would definitely stay there again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,perfect little house in a nice neighborhood.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We mostly spoke with Sarah for our stay, and she was lovely. Very accommodating and responsive. The house was very clean, probably one of the cleanest airbnbs I have stayed in. The house is older, but kept up nice. The neighborhood does not match the looks of this house, though. It is a bit crowded and run down. It was a great stay for the price, and we did feel comfortable staying there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay, comfortable and very well stocked. Loved the bathroom and shower. There was no central air, but the window units were just fine."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kendra‘s place was exactly as described, close to some restaurants, and very close to the Pavilion at Star Lake, which is where we were going to a concert that weekend! Both her and her cohost were very available and very responsive to messages, everything was very clean when we arrived and check in, and check out were a breeze!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had nothing but positive things to say about our stay. We were here for a graduation and Kendra was kind enough to let us have a late check out so that we wouldn’t have to stress before the ceremony. The place was clean and tidy, and there were plenty of towels and linens. We would absolutely stay again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable, clean and accessible location"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! I would recommend it if staying in area.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hosts, very responsive, and clean home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Listing perfectly described Kendra’s place and the price was perfect with low fees. The location is also very close to nice restaurants and such a quick drive to Pittsburgh! Will definitely stay again, next time I’m in Weirton."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good spot
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute home and host was good. Only a few of neighbors were loudly fighting all night but not host fault.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean and tidy. The neighborhood was a little rough around the edges, but, relatively quiet.
Suggest that other guest park behind the house. As parking in the front is somewhat scarce. Other than a little inconvenience with the lock initially, we enjoyed our stay. Finally, the lock issue was resolved in a timely manner. We found Kendra and Sarah to be very courteous and professional. We are looking forward to staying with them again.
Michael and Victoria"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable, safe stay. The house has a great amount of space, perfect for me, my wife, and my son. We all three worked out in the living room together. The living room T.V. was large, the master bedroom had a good T.V. Usually the beds are not that great in more affordable AirBnBs, but my wife and I like this bed! She didn’t roll into me and we got some good rest. There we’re also some really nice blankets on the couch that we used. The kitchen was stocked good as well with pots and pans, salt/pepper, olive oil, and garlic. Knives, can openers, and cheese graters. The T.V.s had guest accounts on the Netflix accounts so you didn’t even have to log in to watch Netflix. I worked and played games out to the home and the internet was very fast and dependable.
Highly recommend this stay if your visiting the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for us to have a relaxing weekend. Clean and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonder and responsive host. I can’t say thank you enough to how accommodating she was. The house is welcoming and warm.
The only issue you may have is parking. The people across the street tend to park in all the spaces when they have ample driveway space.
Would definitely rent again"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra came through for us last minute. Unavoidable circumstances, we needed a place to stay immediately. Kendra was most accommodating and allowed our dogs to stay with us. The home is cute, cozy and comfy, and freshly cleaned even with our last minute booking. Plenty of room and felt right at home."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I used to work at the university and stay in area quite often. This was a very good airbnb with two bedrooms for the price. About 5 minutes from downtown Steubs in a quiet neighborhood with comfortbale beds. Like most homes in the area it has some wear but it's a better value than even the cheapest hotel rooms and was overall comfortable and well equipped. My friends and i were more than happy and kendra made herself quite available and even salted the steps for us, which was very kind. One suggestion I do have is to have mirrors in the bedrooms since there is only one bathroom and I shared it with a couple for a wedding weekend. That way people can get ready for events, which tend to bring in out of towners to the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and welcoming place! We will stay here again when we come to Weirton to visit family.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a great stay! The home was spotless and had everything we may have needed, from extra blankets to wine glasses. Any questions were answered in a very timely manner, and the check in and check out processes were very smooth! The furniture was comfy and it really did help feel like we were at home for the several days we stayed."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very clean. good size
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They were absolutely friendly and very helpful. They accommodated me in every way and I appreciate them for that. Would love to stay again when needed and very highly recommended!! Thank you ladies again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! We would definitely stay again if we were back in the area. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! We loved the hot tub and bathrobes provided. Will definitely be back! There isn’t drinking water provided, so make sure to bring bottles. There’s a grocery store close by that we stopped at. We were excited to use the Pac-Man machine, but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it and we didn’t bring any quarters. Small and quaint but has everything you need!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay! My husband and I wanted a quiet weekend away with no kids and this place delivered! The hosts thought of everything you might need to relax, from a private hot tub to super comfy lounge chairs in front of a large flatscreen. We loved using the pool table in the basement as well. I recommend this stay to anyone and would love to stay again.
Some nearby highlights:
**Rusty Bull Taco Co for quick but delicious tacos or nachos
**Pastaio Cucina for a lovely Italian dinner.
**Vocelli Pizza for late night meals
**Frankfort mineral spring and falls for gorgeous hiking trails. (It was a 25 minute drive into Clinton, PA but worth it!)
**Iconic in Weirton, WV. Vintage toy/souvenir shop with vinyls"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy cabin. We were not there to much as we love to drive the river. Very clean and accommodating. Hot was great to use very clean as well.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay, feels very private even though many stores and restaurants are very close. Felt like home and loved just hanging out there, multiple TV’s and places to lounge. The town of Toronto was lovely and its not too far of a drive to Pittsburgh.
Only down side is it is right next to the expressway so lots of road noise, and the whole cabin creaked all night. Sounded a lot like having an upstairs neighbor, but nothing too crazy.
We will 100% book this place again if we are heading in this direction for another trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little retreat in the woods. The amenities were exactly what you need, and everything was in good order!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying at one of Kevin’s listings and we’ve been really happy both times! We loved all the amenities at this cabin so much that we only left to go grocery shopping. It was a perfect place to get away for our anniversary!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect weekend get away . The hot tub was AMAZING ! It was quiet and peaceful . The cabin was VERY CLEAN . The bed was comfortable. We will definitely stay with Kevin again . Thank you !!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Cabin was very clean and exactly like the pictures. The hot tub was perfect and also very clean. It’s nearby a grocery and drug store, but tucked away in a nice private area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stopover day at this cabin. Everything we needed and more was provided, and the entire place was spotless. The kids loved the games and the loft bedroom! We will definitely stay again on our next trip east."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place very clean friendly host loved it!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was perfect for our family. The old school arcade game and pool table were super fun. Access to three smart TVs and the hot tub were both amazing. The location is in a neat spot to hit up three states! We had a great time exploring nearby sights - Beaver Creek State Park (OH), World's Largest Teapot (WV), and Raccoon Creek State Park (PA). For dinners and ice cream, we highly recommend Last Resort Riverfront Bar & Grille and Dairy Isle (excellent milkshakes).
One note: G-Maps will say you have arrived at the location a few houses too early. Drive a bit further down the road, then on the right side and up the hill is the cabin - can't miss it!
Thanks for a great stay! We will definitely be checking out your other properties."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing ! The place was exactly as described and pictured . Perfect for a quiet weekend away ! We will definitely be back !
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second stay! I love the amenities and the privacy! Will be coming back next year
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful, even the pictures didn’t compare! It was my husband, my two kids and I staying there, we just wanted a couple nights out of the house and it was so worth it! So clean, quiet, fun and comfortable that it just felt like a luxury vacation. Kevin and his co host, Rita were both very excellent. Any questions I had, they were both on it. Very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the hosts and the cabin!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very nice, cozy, inviting, and the perfect size for just my husband and I. There was a loft with another bed but I was scared of reenacting the famous scene from Christmas Vacation so we didn't go up but I'd assume if you have kids, it'd be a great place for a family of 4. There was every amenity you could need, comfy beds and furniture, hot tub was amazing, the game room downstairs was so much fun. It does get a bit chilly down there, but if you dress accordingly, you're good. You're near the highway but in the spring and summer, I'm sure the noise level would be fine, we couldn't hear it in the house. The driveway is very steep and gravel, so be mindful in the rainy or winter months. One more thing I was thrilled with was the tiny cat paws all over the concrete pad outside where the hot tub is. I know it wasn't intentional but it really made me smile. 5 out of 5 I would come here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place for a getaway! The small town had some of the best restaurants and stores. The cabin itself was extremely clean and had the best amenities that mad our stay worth it! Definitely will be staying at more of Kevin's properties in the future!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place! loved the cabin but it was also a steep driveway so make sure your vehicle can handle it. overall it was beautiful

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at this cabin. It’s private, well maintained and very clean. It had everything we needed and is very well appointed. Highly recommended!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet little town this is the spot for you!! The highway is close by bit its not a busy highway, you can hear the vehicles from the hot tub and outdoor lounge area. We had pizza from Gem City that was delicious but different! If you have never had or heard of ""Ohio Valley Style"" that is all the local spots serve! We had a GREAT brunch at Last Resort Marina!! There are some local shops downtown but we didn't have a chance to check them out. We were on a couples get away and highly recommend a couples massage at Mountianeer Casino that is about 30 mins away.
This is absolutely a great place to stay for a private weekend get away!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lil cabin on the hill is close to perfect. The cabin itself is cute, clean and has everything you need. It’s good that there is the hot tub and pool table as there isn’t too many things in the close proximity to do spur of the moment. Plan your visits ahead for parks and brewery’s.
The cabin is very cute but not as remote as the pictures originally looked."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always Kevin’s places are always spotless! The only thing that I would like at the Cabin on the Hill is a more comfortable couch. Maybe a reclining couch would be better in such a small living room. It was still very accommodating and the hot tub was perfect. This is the second place that we booked from you and you never seem to disappoint. Thanks, we had a great weekend."

one downside: i arrived on a rainy night. uneven steep gravel driveway not mentioned in post. took several attempts to get up in my fwd vehicle, kept getting stuck. was easy enough to get up once the ground dried up but caught us by surprise."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our third time staying at this location. We love it!!! A nice getaway not far from home. A great couples weekend. Our first stay was with another couple we had a great time but a little tight for four people. With four of us sharing one bedroom bathroom. However for a couple this is a great place to consider. Love the hot tub and fire pit. The game room is great with pool table and video games. Nice big TVs and a king bed in bedroom. Cabin is immaculate. Very clean! Me and my wife love it and will be staying again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at the lil cabin on the hill and it was as amazing as the first. Even though it was cold the fire pit and hot tub came in so handy, the arcade machine kept us entertained when we weren’t outside. Everything was as perfect as everyone says in the reviews, would definitely book again in the spring."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was impeccably clean, meticulously kept, and matched the description perfectly. It is set up on a hill and has a bit of a climb up a gravel driveway. It is surrounded by trees and the hottub location is private and surrounded by trees. There was a fire pit too. There were chairs on the porch to sit out and relax. Beds were large and comfortable and there were big screen TVs throughout the house. Kevin and Rita were responsive and proactive. Perfect spot for a visit to the Ohio River Valley region."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a very nice getaway for my husband and I for our anniversary. We loved the game room in the basement and the hot tub. Only thing was we wanted to have a fire while we were there & the provided firewood was uncovered so it was wet & we couldn’t get it to light. We also weren’t expecting a very inclined driveway but thankfully my husband has a jeep.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Peaceful place country feel with being in residential area
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, everything was clean and put together great! Kevin was very responsive."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great little cabin for a group of 4. Hot tub was fantastic, the area was pretty private. Driveway is steep gravel, but didn’t have an issue making it up, pushes the cabin off the road about 50 yards. Was super clean, relaxing, and comfy! Only bad part was the road was under construction next down the street and the crew was not shy with their noise. Not a single complaint on the actual listing though! Great time, recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice spot! We didn’t even leave the first day we were there because we had the pool table, grill and hot tub to entertain us. Thank you!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the most lovely weekend staying at Kevin’s cabin! We enjoyed the pool table and comfy sofa very much. Plenty of room for our family of four. The outdoor space was awesome! We cooked out and made s’mores, and we were are to enjoy the hot tub. Rita had several recommendations on local food and activities. We ended up driving the short distance to Raccoon Creek State Park and renting a boat for a little while. The cabin is very close to a grocery store and gas station but very private and quiet when you’re there. It was just perfect for what we wanted for our unplugged family getaway. Thank you Kevin and Rita!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin with everything you could need plus more! Feels secluded but only a couple minutes away from stores.

Thank you so much!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely cabin stay with my partner. The location was private. It was nearby a few small towns, so we were able to get food delivery. The jacuzzi was cozy and the bed so comfy. The place was absolutely pristine! I've never been in such a clean AirBNB.
One thing to note: there is quite a steep gravel driveway up, which might make it difficult to traverse in the winter."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! We were visiting our daughter at FUS. The cabin was perfect for a long wknd. We found some really neat trails and just sat back to relax. A perfect place to stay, especially if the weather is beautiful. We spent lots of time outside relaxing. We loved the firepit outside and had plenty of wood. Thank you for the hidden gem!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time, everything was just like the pictures! Kevin was very responsive, would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here for the weekend! We also loved the cabin feel & how cozy it was!! The cabin was spotless upon arrival and is fully stocked with necessities! It’s such a peaceful & private cabin. We also loved having the pool table in the basement! Unfortunately we never got around to using the hot tub, but it definitely is nice having that option. This was our second time at one of Kevin’s properties, & I will always recommend his properties!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Rita are definitely SUPER hosts! My husband and I needed a getaway. This ""little cabin on the hill"" was the perfect place! It was super clean, homey, and just the right size. Everything we needed was there.
The hot tub was clean and incredibly relaxing. We took full advantage of it.
We built plenty of fires in the fire pit.
It was the perfect place to unplug and unwind.
The king-sized bed was extra comfy.
There was only one thing we weren't crazy about... the highway. The semi trucks with their brake retarders were kind of loud. Although, it was not a deal breaker for us. We would definitely book it again.
So, if you're looking for a place to relax, unplug, and unwind, this is it.
Thanks, Kevin and Rita, for a wonderful stay!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this stay! The cabin was super cute and just like it’s pictures. The place was perfect, the hot tub was nice and clean and perfect temperature! All and all everything was very nice, clean, and enjoyed the stay very much!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great get away for my husband and I. Everything exceeded expectations. I was able to cook a full meal in the kitchen, enjoy a game of pool and cards in the lower rec area, watch movies and lounge & of course the hot tub was fabulous!
Thanks again for the stay, we’ll be back and certainly recommend to friends :)"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and relaxing
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very relaxing and everything looked just like the photos. Best part was the hot tub. It was very clean and well maintained. Location was private but close to stores and the little town. Loved our stay and would come again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so warm, cozy and absolutely gorgeous!!!! All the finishes were beautiful and very welcoming. The location was nice- wasn’t fully secluded but felt private. Super cute little oasis would defiantly stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at the Lil Cabin on the hill. We have nothing but good memories there. The place is always clean and the hosts are great people. We look forward to our next get away at the cabin.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and as described. The game room was a nice touch and the hot tub was very relaxing. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in that area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was clean and there was everything we needed and more in the cabin. The location is a little odd, but it’s Toronto. Luckily Pittsburgh is very close. Overall the cabin was great and it was a nice getaway for my husband and I. It is secluded but there is a gas station and grocery store two minutes away."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was clean, thoughtful, convenient, spacious, entertaining and perfect for our get away weekend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin’s place is beautiful, private, quaint and has everything you could need for a relaxing stay with awesome options of things to do (the hot tub, fire pit and pool table are great amenities). The cabin is clean, cozy, updated and not missing one thing! 10/10 would recommended booking."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin! Everything we needed for a quiet get away. The cabin is at the end of a neighborhood but the way they placed this cabin, you would never know. Once you're in the hot tub, it feels like there is no one around but nature. The good thing about this location is there is a grocery store 2 mins away that sells beer and wine also. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to just stay at a cabin to decompress!!! We went to Margaret's for breakfast. Very tasty and not expensive! Kevin was a great host and very responsive. We met Rita for a brief moment and she also seemed very sweet and helpful!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place 👍🏻
Easy proximity to Pittsburgh to explore the city. Felt safe and comfortable!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had high hopes & it was even better than expected! Had a great clean, comfy and cozy time. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my third time staying in one of Kevin’s rentals! They never disappoint. This was a perfect weekend getaway. The places are always so clean and the hot tubs are the best. Already booking my next trip!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing little cabin - so cozy, clean, and cute. Very thoughtful touches and we absolutely loved the hot tub to soak and relax in the evenings. Kevin is an amazing host, and we enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would 100% recommend!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As usual, Kevin's Airbnb's are beautiful! We have stayed at a number of Kevin's places and they are all gorgeous and super clean! Kevin is great to communicate and I highly recommend staying at any of his Airbnb's! You won't be disappointed!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is cozy and comfortable. Fully loaded with all the amenities you would need for a great stay. The hot tub is nice and private. We had an amazing stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin’s place was more than we expected. He has thought of everything, even down to two sets of plushy robes for the bathroom and the hot tub. Every amenity is thought of or available. The place itself is finely crafted, comfortable and lacks nothing crucial for a comfortable stay. The hot tub worked great, the kitchen had all the tools we needed, and everything seems quite new. We highly recommend this cabin and hope to be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's place was very well appointed and cozy. We enjoyed it very much. One comment (not a criticism): it's not quite in the 'middle of nowhere' as the photos seemed to imply, as it's the end of a cul de sac of a small neighborhood, and you can see/hear the highway from time to time. It's still private and we enjoyed the hot tub in peace. This location is great in case you forgot any essentials and/or need to be close to civilization, which was perfect for us."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is exactly as pictured! Check in was simple and everything was perfectly clean and ready for us. We booked a last minute night away and we are so glad we picked this place to stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely cabin!! Would absolutely recommend!! Hope to come back soon!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Lil Cabin on the Hill was perfect for what we were looking for since we wanted a romantic, peaceful getaway. We were able to disconnect from reality and enjoy each others company on this private hilltop. It was spotless and had a fresh, wooden smell that we absolutely loved. This cabin was equipped with everything we needed and more. 10/10! 🌟"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the cabin. The driveway was quite steep and narrow and the porch has two steps without a handrail. The jets in the hot tube were powerful. The sound bar for the tv was robust, and the kitchen was perfectly stocked with utensils. Worth the stop for sure!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, Kevin was very responsive and super nice. We had a great time, highly recommend for a nice long weekend get away!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy place. Would recommend for a short gateway.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time during our stay. The house was in mint condition, so clean and everything you need to make your self a home. One of the best relaxing vacations I have had in a while. We will definitely be back!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If I can describe my 3 day stay in one word it would be peaceful. Walking in for the first time and seeing it clean and look exactly like the picture made the one hour drive worth it. For anybody wanting to get away for a weekend or away from your busy life I will definitely recommend this cabin.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I took a quick get away without children. This place was perfect! Cabin is very well maintained. Everything was clean. Kitchen has everything you need to cook as well. We will definitely be back in the future for a quick get away….. if you stay here, be aware the fridge gets very cold so check the setting ;) we did have a can of pop explosion. That was our only issue and totally our fault!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice little cabin. Everything was great during our stay. Really enjoyed the hot tub. Kevin definitely is a super host.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice little cabin! Very clean, nice tv's, cozy fireplace, and great hot tub. This is the second time we've stayed at one of Kevin's places, and we were happy with both. Everything's easy for check-in and check-out, and the communication is fast and friendly."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean. Has everything you need. Would definitely recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a second visit at one of Kevin’s locations. (We previously stayed in the Henry Ford)
Both locations are extremely clean, well laid out, and well equipped.
Check in is a breeze and awesome at communicating quickly!
Very cozy. We had fun shooting some pool, but the best was building a little fire outside and the hot tub!
If you don’t want to venture out and like Sicilian pizza, try DiCarlos. They well deliver and it was very good. (Menu in the drawer 😉)
Check out is a breeze too!
Enjoy your stay! Kevin and Rita are excellent hosts!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin at the end of a residential street that feels like you’re in the middle of a forest. Clean, tons of amenities, & completely new. Absolutely satisfied with our stay & would recommend to anyone that’s interested!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely very cozy and comfy get away in a very nice neighborhood. Kevin was easy to get a hold of for anything you may need. Only less than 20 minutes away from West Virginia if you wanna border hop. I do recommend a fall getaway here the scenery is gorgeous with the leaf change. Be prepared to get a fast start uphill in your car to the cabin for it’s on a hill (my little car made it just fine ;-)
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super warm, cozy & clean. Will come again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,my stay was absolutely amazing and very peaceful
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was easy to find - parking was convenient - the inside was clean, cute, and inviting. Beds were comfortable and kitchen was even stocked with coffee for the morning! Kendra’s instructions were easy to follow, and she was very accommodating with our late check in time - couldn’t have been happier in finding this location close to our concert venue!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice home and a great host.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really liked this place.. so much so that I tried to reserve it again right away. It was nice and cool in the house. Perfect after a hot day of work. It smelled good and was really clean.. I would and hope to stay there again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean place, great interior. Parking was a little tight but overall the space was great"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kendra's rental was perfect for us. Nicely decorated, very clean and inviting. We will definitely look to book again when we are in the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nicely decorated space.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Kendra's house. It was exactly how it was described and very clean! We needed an extra table and she graciously let us use hers she had stored! She was always quick to respond with any questions we had.
It was a little farther away from the University then I realized but only because there is not a direct route or at least we didn't find one.
I would definitely recommend and would stay again should we need to!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra's listing was just as it said. The photos were also accurate and the cleanliness of the place was comforting. I liked the minimal decorating, the comfort of the one bed that I slept in (not sure about the other bed, it wasn't used by anyone) and the bed linens smelt like The balsam pillows you buy in the Adirondacks. That nice piney scent. Overall, I would definitely rent this place again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra's place was exactly as pictured! The place was immaculate. She was very responsive and very clear on expectations of the guests. Definitely worth checking out. I'd book with her again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable stay and great communication from host
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very clean
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here to visit family in Wheeling and to visit Pittsburgh. For the value, the location was perfect. The house was clean and being able to park in the driveway was nice. I traveled with my dog and there’s a small park right down the hill which was convenient. However, be aware the neighbor has two dogs that are often leashed in the front yard and they go off leash into the backyard of this property to relieve themselves. I kept my dog on leash and away from the neighbors. Overall, a great value and good stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy check in"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the stay exactly what we were looking for.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it! Great place, perfect for a quick stay in Steubenville!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kendra's place is quite charming and cozy; a home away from home, indeed! Kendra is a responsive host; friendly and personable. We enjoyed our stay at The Cedar House very much. Would certainly consider a stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay ❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, very cozy!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kendra’s place was a nice, pet-friendly option for our quick holiday visit with family. We had everything we needed inside the house and we loved the cozy holiday decor! She was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay at Cedar House. The house itself was beautiful, well decorated, great facilities (especially loved the coffee machine!), and in a peaceful neighbourhood. Kendra was an excellent host and always responded quickly to any messages.
The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept on! Maybe even better than my own bed at home!
Will certainly be staying again whenever I'm back in the area!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a good place! The loveseat is a little small for two people, very stiff and uncomfortable and there isn’t a toaster so those are the two things I would make others aware of."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was in the area for Thanksgiving with family. Wanted a space to just get away and rest from the very large family if needed. This home fit perfectly! When we arrived, I contacted the host immediately to get in, that was when I learned I had booked it for the actual day of Thanksgiving! I immediately started to panic but I was told the house was ready and available. Super accommodating, super fast responses from the start of booking, and super friendly. You definitely won't regret this choice if you need a place in the Steubenville area. An extra plus.... it's only 5 minutes from the bridge to cross over to WV, which is where my family was."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! Came home for a family funeral, extremely happy with the cost, cleanliness, and location. Children had a great time with the neighbor children playing tag. Beautiful home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kendra’s house was very clean and in a great location in Steubenville. My wife and I are considering a move to the area and we will be utilizing Kendra’s listing for future visits. Thanks!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kendra’s Air BnB’s are always spotless! Honestly, this is 100% the one thing I am really picky about. I want the house I stay in to be as clean as my own and she nails it every time. I have stayed in multiple locations and every time she and her team are always responsive and flexible and incredibly kind. They make you feel welcome."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank You Kendra for being such a Great hostess. Your Air b&b was beautiful, comfortable, and the decor was beautiful. the price was great as well. it was a beautiful peaceful place to stay. I give you 5 stars all acrossed the board."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nifty overhauled older home in a small neighborhood. Quiet area with a large front porch, and plenty of amenities for a long stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a cozy home for 4 people visiting Steubenville who want more space than a hotel room and plan to cook some simple meals. The main bedroom behind the french doors is comfortable and spacious but lacks clothing storage. The bedroom down the hall has ample storage, but the bed is very thin and firm. The neighborhood is fairly quiet, but like much of this town, it is a bit run-down. There were two huge dogs on the porch next door, but they were leashed and mostly quiet. Be aware that pets are allowed in this home, so this isn't a good option for guests with any allergies."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kendra's place was a perfect place for a stopover on a cross country trip. It was clean and well kept. Plus it had space for our dogs!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Kendra's place looks like the pictures. It was in a neighborhood setting with a nice little porch. The house was clean, but smelled a bit musty or maybe smoky. The windows don't open so maybe it had been closed up for awhile. We only stayed one night... decent for the price."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The home was perfect for a weekend in Steubenville with my dogs. Kendra respond quickly and made us feel welcome with this newly updated home.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracie and her husband were very attentive and friendly. They make their kitchen not only available but provide a generous amount of access to lots of details that you probably don’t think of.
I will happily stay there again. I understand why it is such a popular place to stay.
Very affordable and very close to Franciscan University, where I was spending my time"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s clear that Tracie takes pride in renting her place for visitors. It’s set up for that purpose and has everything you need, more than most hotels!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfortable, convenient, and homey. I stayed there after a concert at Star Lake, and it couldn’t have been more convenient. About a 15 minute drive.
Tracie communicated easily and quickly. I had absolutely everything I needed.

The other guests during the stay were quiet and respectful. The home is easy to get to, close to good restaurants in Weirton and Steubenville. The location offers relatively easy access to Pittsburgh as well. If you have not had it, check out Ohio Valley Pizza if you can find some. It will not be like you expect, but is good for what it is, a nice regional interpretation of a classic dish."

I had had a bad day, in a state i had never been, knowing no one, without a vehicle, or a real plan and Tracie, along with another good samaritan, Terri, saw my need for a little assistance, and support from a kind soul, and they jumped into action. She talked me through my ""destress vacation"" crisis with kind words, motivation, and a shoulder to cry on, after which she took the time to save me some of her dinner, and take me to the store to get some food for myself. She gave me advice on transportation, places to stay, and some direction maneuvering the cities. After i left she checked on me twice more before i was scheduled to fly out to male sure i was okay.
I truly appreciate everything she did, as a host, and as a kind person, i will not forget her.
Thank you!
I couldnt have asked for better hosts, especially when i needed a friend."

If they don't know the answer, they will help you find it. The room, bathroom and the house were extremely clean. I had the use of the kitchen while I was there and a space reserved in the refrigerator for me for food. The livingrooms were also available as common spaces where I could sit and do work, relax or watch TV. The shower was as good as any shower I've experienced in a high-end hotel. I will come back here if I need to come to the Weirton area again and I highly recommend staying at this location. It was an incredible value."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was traveling for work and the drive was too long for me to do in one shot, so I booked an overnight. The AirBnB was very clean and cozy.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracie and her husband were wonderful hosts. They were extremely accommodating And excellent with communication. Clean residence, clean room etc.
The only advisory I would give for people not familiar with the area, it’s an industrial area with many visible factories. So if you’re looking for a house or room with picturesque lake views, in the woods, or on the mountains, you may wanna look elsewhere.
Weirton does have a rich industrial and steel industry history. Scenes from the movie “super 8” were actually filmed there 10 years ago.
Weirton WV and this room is great if you happen to already be in the area and need a nice place to stay. It’s only a 40 minute drive from Pittsburgh, less than 10 mins from Steubenville Ohio. This place is conveniently located right off the highways to Pittsburgh and Ohio, Tomlinson run state park, the toy museum and the west Virginia penitentiary museum are short drives away. Plenty of gas stations and eateries close by.
If you love coffee houses, I strongly suggested Leonardo’s in Steubenville.
It was my first time visiting West Virginia and Ohio and Pittsburgh. This was a pleasant experience overall.
I strongly recommend booking here"

When, I arrived, I accessed the house through the keypad at the front door and went right to the room Tracie described.
This was a first rate initial experience for me. I highly recommend this property. And Tracie is a first-rate host who is a good communicator.
I loved how cheerfully the rooms were decorated. Everything was geared toward making the guest feel comfortable with the property and the host.
My room was comfortable and all of my basic traveler needs were met and there were extra toiletries if I had forgotten anything. I also had full access to the kitchen with all regular amenities for cooking and eating.

The property is lovely with peaceful and serene surroundings. Wish we could stay longer and enjoy the firepit and beautifully landscaped yard.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home and very comfortable stay! All the positive ratings are accurate and well deserved. The home is super clean and well stocked. My family, young to old, commented on how great the house was. My kids loved the foosball table and we all loved the kitchen/livingroom/dining room area. Kitchen had absolutely everything we needed to cook dinner. College daughter and her friends joined us and the home was plenty spacious for us all. My elderly mom who can't do stairs well was able to use the backyard sidewalk to enter which was a *huge* blessing. I saw a review that parking could be tricky, but we were able to park our passenger van on the street and were also able to fit it on the driveway (after letting everyone out first). We absolutely loved this home! So grateful! Thank you so much, Michael!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a lovely place to stay for the weekend! The house was very clean; kitchen and bathrooms were pristine. The only thing we didn’t like was the neighborhood and parking situation. The driveway is very steep and scraped the bottom of the car, but parking on the street is easy!

We found the house very comfortable. We were able to prepare our big dinner in the kitchen, the dining room was very spacious for dinner for six and playing games, and the living room was great for spreading out and watching TV. We also appreciated being in town and close to Fort Steuben and the Nutcracker Festival, which we really enjoyed. Michael’s property manager Sarah was very responsive and helpful. We had a problem with the upstairs bathtub and it was fixed in an hour. We highly recommend Michael’s house!"

Over all a great home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My father's family is from the Steubenville/Weirton/New Cumberland area. My husband and I brought our 16 and 12 year old sons and my parents to visit with family and see the places my dad remembers from his childhood. This home provided a very comfortable home-like place for us to relax after long days of walking. The living area had plenty of comfortable seating and between the breakfast table and dining table, we had plenty of space to eat. When we return in the future, we would definitely look to stay here again!"

House was beautifully furnished with ample space for everyone. Loved having the bedroom on first floor for my parents. Bathroom upstairs is a little small but it worked.

They made sure we had baking dishes and this house offered the perfect kitchen for such an event. They responded to any and all of our questions very quickly. Our family was thrilled with the foosball table in the game room as well. The house was incredibly clean, had plenty of space, and offered a lot of nice comfortable touches throughout. We will definitely consider staying again when we visit the area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great home that hosted two families traveling in for a football game. We loved the yard, and the home offered a great space for our family to catch up."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place worked out good for where the work lot was, 12-15 minutes away. It was very comfortable, was always able to stay in communication with Sarah. Price was a bit much for us but I rate it a 8/10."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a quick overnight stay on a road trip for ourselves and extended family. The home was very clean and had everything we needed plus some arrival treats. The parking is a little rough as there is hardly any space on the street due to the position of the home. It worked for one night but with us having a larger vehicle it could’ve caused issues if we were staying for multiple days. Other than that the place was perfect for us to crash and recoup from a days travel.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was conveniently located and our hosts communicated everything we needed before we arrived. It was well-equipped with all the needs of our stay - and we have a big family! The living room and dining area are spacious to accommodate large groups, the bedrooms are also roomy and the bathroom clean. Plenty of paper towels and bath tissue on site. The foosball table downstairs was a popular attraction with our kids for our stay. If you are visiting Steubenville, this is a fantastic home-away-from-home option, accessible to downtown and Franciscan University."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, convenient, and spacious with warm touches and lots of charm. Will definitely be back next time we pass through the area!"

It's so peaceful and we always feel right at home. The kitchen is well stocked, the house is very clean. I cannot say enough great things about his place"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely home in a quiet area. The pool table downstairs was an added bonus for our downtime during our visit. The only thing I would recommend is an eye mask for those that are sensitive to light because there are skylights in the bedrooms. It was so nice to see wildlife walk through. You feel you’re out in the middle of nowhere but really just a few minute drive into town. Would definitely try to stay here again if we are ever in the area!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The house was fantastic! My family stayed for over a month and we felt right at home. The house is great and it's is so peaceful.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin’s retreat had everything we needed to unwind and relax. Details throughout the home were thoughtful and allowed us to laugh, chat or think: perfect decor, books, pool table, grill, fire pit, perfectly appointed kitchen, every conceivable utensil, serving dish, with spices and all!
We were so close to the Burgettstown Star Lake Pavilion, had came to town to see Willie Nelson and John Fogerty! Awesome even with a tornado watch!
So quiet in the woods, we played guitar, painted watercolors, watched the deer and turkey and heard woodland birds at night…enjoyed lifelong friend time in a secluded space. Even caught the Perseid meteor showers thanks to the weather cooperating.
I recommend the salads at Deejays Ribs! You cannot go wrong at Robins!"

As a side note, the water pressure in the showers was amazing. Would stay here again if in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love her place!!! So peaceful and quiet. We had my 88 year old father from Florida, and he loved all of the wildlife. We enjoyed the back patio.

Robin responded quickly to questions and communicated very well. We appreciated how well-stocked the kitchen was and had everything we needed to make our Thanksgiving feast. Our family absolutely loved watching the turkeys and deer just outside the window and enjoyed the pool table downstairs almost every evening. Perfect place for our family to spend time together! We will definitely be back!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic retreat for relaxing yet being close to area attractions. This place is very clean and definitely has a well stocked kitchen.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great time we had in the wonderfully decorated house in a beautiful, rural setting with wildlife abounding....from the deer that strolled though the yard daily to the occasional turkey. Robin was a great host, from communicating prior to our arrival to having everything perfect when we got there, making our stay truly enjoyable and one we plan to repeat many times to come."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest homes we have every stayed in via Airbnb. A quiet, lovely, rural neighborhood. slept well because it is so quiet at night. The two bedrooms are very separate with their own bathrooms so we had great privacy. The kitchen fully equipped and not only a good sized dining room table but a nice table on the deck. Nice rural roads to walk on with spare traffic(June). There was a fire pit and chairs in the big yard. Robin communicates rapidly. We would rent here again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house and property. We visited to attend a family baby shower and did not want to get 2 hotel rooms where we would have little space for the kids to play and crawl. This home was a perfect alternative. My son enjoyed looking out the windows for wildlife and saw raccoons, cats, birds, deer, and his favorite... a squirrel of all things. Robin is accommodating and responsive. The home is beautiful and very nicely decorated. Thank you for sharing your home!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home. Especially for a weekend getaway. Very clean.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed staying here! We just loved the atmosphere is beautiful, and the deck is a great spot to drink a cup of coffee or a glass a wine before dusk. Robin did a fantastic job at decorating the home with giving her guest a place to retreat to. We felt quite comfortable staying here! The couches and beds were very comfortable. The shower head gave a great massage when showering! The location is a convenient, quiet with great views. Robin is quick at responding to you during your stay when needed. She was so accommodating to allow us to check out an hour later. A few downsides: there is no dishwasher, We loved the skylights in all the rooms except for the bedrooms, it definitely is a good alarm clock though, and the neighborhood cat who we had to continuing shoe him away from desperately trying to get in the house was a bit annoying. So, if you like cats he is friendly but, not allowed in the home."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was looking for a non-hotel place to stay for when we visit the local college our child goes to. Found Robin's place and it was perfect. Everything we needed was in the kitchen. Comfortable furniture and beds. Good hot water in the showers. Lots of hangers in the closets. What is nice too is that there is a Walmart, Aldi's, and Kroeger less than 10 minutes away, as well as some decent restaurants should you feel like not cooking. One night we enjoyed a fire out in the backyard. Saw a herd of dear one night, and some pheasants walking around close to the house. The pool table and dart board in the lower level was nice. Looking forward to staying here again when we are back in the area."

The is a well kept, clean, and extremely comfortable place to stay. While you sit out on the back deck, you will see a flock of wild turkey and a herd of deer.

We just relaxed as we walked in and saw the spotless new kitchen, living room and porches off each room. Then it just got better and better. Pool table with doors that open up to enjoy the beautiful view out the back. Another porch. Great place to relax and enjoy who ever you brought with you or relax by yourself.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robin's home is spacious and immaculate!! The location is excellent!! Very close to restaurants, grocery, pharmacies, etc. Yet amazingly you feel that you are out in the woods and nature once on the property. I only wish we had had more time to enjoy the property itself. This home was perfect for our family of four. The master King Bed was super comfy with thick-soft-quality linens. We really enjoyed the open spacious floor plan, with a kitchen I only wish I had at home. :) The extra quilts and blankets around the home and the super comfy furniture was an extra bonus!! The Game room is awesome. We will have to extend our stay next time to enjoy it more. But its really like a freebie.....Not only do you get a great home, but a big game room too! We are hoping to visit Pittsburg in the future and this would be a great place to stay for that visit too!! We obviously can't say enough about Robin's awesome home!!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house and location was beautiful. It was well equipped with everything we needed to have Christmas dinner with our family. We were snowed in the driveway but Robin was quick to get someone out there to help. We can’t wait to book our next stay!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin's home was perfect for a weekend escape, especially right now.

We couldn't have asked for a better spot to spend a few lazy days away from reality!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed spending Thanksgiving here. The kitchen was so well equipped! We were able to make our turkey and all the fixings. The house has so many little extra touches like cloth napkins on the table and Q-tips in the bathroom, that make it feel very homey. Very clean and beautiful interior on a gorgeous piece of property. We were impressed!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! Vaulted ceilings and skylights throughout provide tons of bright light. The fixtures and furniture are new feeling and well maintained. The pool table and dart board in the basement were a great diversion. It felt very secluded with several deer and groups of turkeys passing through, which was such a nice relaxing way to spend the weekend. We will look up Ralston again! Thanks."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time a Robin’s place. My wife and I wanted to vacation with our two little ones, and the house was the perfect secluded getaway. The property feels so private, and the house itself is so clean and nice. Walking out onto the back porch every morning and looking out into the forest as the sun rose was a real treat. I would recommend not to arrive at night like we unintentionally did, it’ll make your life easier to find the house in the daylight. Robin was a pleasure to deal with, and she answered any questions we had promptly. Thanks for a great week!
Joseph & Rachel"

We will definitely be booking this home is the spring when we come back to visit. Thanks again!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Retreat at Ralston feels like just that - a retreat! The house is beautiful and everything looked new. Spotlessly clean, warm, inviting, with all that we needed for a relaxing weekend getaway. A family of 7 deer and a flock of wild turkeys were in the back yard shortly after our arrival. The property is private and although there are neighbors, we couldn’t see them at any point. The fire pit was a great touch! We enjoyed the outdoors under the full moon. Every space in the house was comfortable and cozy. The layout allows for privacy or for group gatherings. The kitchen is beautiful and stocked with everything that we could have needed. Robin was very responsive and very nice. The keyless entry was a definite plus. There are skylights in every room and we could see the stars through them at night. If you are looking for a serene and comfortable getaway not too far from the Pittsburgh area, this is it! Highly recommend!"

The bedrooms (2) were clean and comfortable! The neighborhood was quiet. The living quarters are on the second floor, making the place feel extra safe. The water got very hot and never ran out. There were wonderful little touches around the home like snacks, guidebook, and toiletries. A highlight was the bird nest hidden on the front deck with three baby birds and a mama feeding them daily. Theresa was very responsive, I travel to work in the area and already tried to book my next stay there."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy little home for a weekend visit. Therese provided all the information we needed prior to our visit.

Thanks, Therese!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time to stay at the Lighthouse and it was just as enjoyable as the first! If you need to visit someone in Steubenville, or your child at Franciscan, this is the perfect place as it's close to everything. It's small enough to be cozy, but large enough to allow your party to spread out. The staircase to the second floor is quite charming, as well as the kitchen and balcony. Watching the leaves fall through the many windows, (or snow last year when we stayed), as we drink our morning coffee is delightful. The lighting in the kitchen is very pleasant for cooking, dining, and even nightlights at night for our youngest. We loved being able to use a gas stove during our stay. My tall son and husband greatly appreciate the tall shower head! Oh, and the box fans.... LOL...my middle son likes to have a fan on his face while he sleeps. He was overjoyed to find fans in each bedroom! As long as our daughter remains at FUS, we'll be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I met there to visit with our cousin and each other. We stayed two nights, slept well (quiet neighborhood), and peaceful environment in the house. We look forward to meeting there again for another visit with family."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my fourth visit to Steubenville in the past year as my daugheter started and finisehd her college search. Of all the places I have stayed, this one was incredable. I stayed here with my husband and our two oldest children as we came to move our daugher into her dorm at Franciscan. We loved the space and how updated it was. Certainly the best I have seen so far. Absolutly beautiful! The location to Franciscan was also a huge perk.

It was a comfortable home with abundant amenities, the off street parking in the private driveway was fantastic as the surrounding street was filled with cars.

We will certainly look to see if this spot is available in future visits!"

It exceeded my expectations!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This fun little place is perfect for those visiting Franciscan, either as parents or for a college visit, but also just for visiting Steubenville. It's centrally located, a short, easy drive from the Pittsburgh airport, and is in a quiet spot of the neighborhood. It snowed quite a bit during our stay and all the windows offered really nice views. We could even watch from the balcony! The information booklet was FULL of restaurant and other visiting ideas! The hosts were very responsive and helpful the whole stay.
The Lighthouse is very clean, simple and beautiful (this art teacher loved the shades and tints of orange as the accent colors!). We found it to be very comfortable....from the kitchen amenities, the clean and stocked bathroom, wifi and Roku (that we don't use at home....a little spoiled during our stay!) and the common areas. We loved the high ceilings and simple furnishings. If you're tall like my husband you'll greatly appreciate the super-tall rain faucet in the shower!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at ""The Lighthouse"" was more than we expected it to be. We came to Steubenville for a college visit day at Franciscan University and our overnight was perfect. Check in was super easy and the home is just lovely and over the top clean. So much better than a hotel room. We were able to relax, make our own dinner and breakfast and less than 5 minutes from the University. We will definitely be staying here again in the upcoming months and years. Thank you for a wonderful overnight!!"

Very much appreciated the well-stocked kitchen utensils, etc for preparing meals with gas stove, range, and fridge.

,,,"Architecture of the building was awesome but the home was absolutely filthy. Carpets clearly need replaced, first steps in and you are looking at carpet stains. There is dust piled around all carpet edges along with debris and dead bugs. Mold on shower curtain and i dont think they even realize a hand held sprayer is behind a panel on shower that is caked in mold and dust. There are spider webs on almost every fixture and old food and trash in kitchen drawers that were also lined with card board. The stove top didnt work at all even after reading the directions, we used a hot plate we found in the kitchen to cook all meals. The handles on all kitchen cupboards were sticky. A lot of liquid stains on furniture. And about 60% of electric switches/outlets worked. Door was unlocked upon arrival. Candles everywhere i assume to cover the unpleasant odor.. would not stay again unless it got professionally cleaned. Extremely disappointing especially for paying almost 800 for 2 nights"
,,,Secluded place to spend time with friends.
