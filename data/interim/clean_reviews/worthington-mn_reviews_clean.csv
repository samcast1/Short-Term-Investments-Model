2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay! And amazing hosts to go with it! The apartment location was convenient, and within walking distance of everything we wanted, including Take 16 Brewery! This was such a fun and contemporary space! And so spacious too! Our group will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved having Nicole as a host! She was very accommodating. I always love staying here, my girlfriends and I had a wonderful time. We are hoping to make her bnb our annual get together spot so we can be near our families but have 'me time', too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem! Great location. Nice spot if driving through MN. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Met at arrival (we arrived around 10pm). The place is huge, clean, and was much more than what was expected in the description (as a great thing). The beds were very comfortable and the bedding was quality. Definitely one of the nicer AirBNBs i’ve been to and the price was very reasonable! Would stay here again if going through!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place! The price is so good and you can enjoy the whole room with friends. Although we arrived late, Kevin was still friendly to welcome us and introduce all facilities. If I visit this town again, I definitely will live here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is huge and welcoming. We appreciated the opportunity to stretch out! Having four beds in two rooms gave us all the opportunity to get a good night's sleep. There are indoor stairs to reach the loft, as described, but they were manageable for us. No issues with parking in the alley in the back. Decent pizza directly across the street, groceries a block away, and an excellent morning coffee shop walkable two doors away."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This unique apartment is centrally located. Nicole was an excellent host with easy to access instructions. The apartment was well laid out and has a chill, relaxing vibe."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There were 4 of us, plenty of room and fit our needs perfectly, would definitely recommend and would book again. We were in the area for the races at Husets, easy access and close."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool space! Bottom outside door dies not lock, but not uncommon for a small town. Our host's dog became lonely while they were out Sunday morning. We had a bit of dog music for a while.🙂"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Four of us stayed here and we all loved it! Clean and very spacious! We loved the decor - lots of fun art! Great location on Main street so within walking distance of a lot of things. We ate at a great restaurant just down the block and in the other direction on the same block there is a coffee shop. Great spot to jump off to surrounding attractions. Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was very beautiful and stylish. Located downtown and within walking distance of all the best restaurants and shops. Host was very friendly and responsive. This is definitely a great pick to stay if you are in town to see the local sights or even crash after a long drive.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spacious two-bedroom puts the space in spacious. Airy and filled with light, it has a wonderful ambiance. Big living room with a huge sectional on which a dozen people could sit comfortably. We did not spend much time in the kitchen, but it's well-appointed and clean. The two bedrooms are large - and, yes, spacious - with the most (and best organized) closet space I have ever seen in an Airbnb. The beds and pillows are very comfy; the bed linens are new and top-rate.
It's easy to see two couples or a family with kids enjoying Nicole's place.
The decor is artistic, creative, tasteful and interesting. I sincerely believe that you will never find an Airbnb with as many books and such a wide variety of books. You could study for a degree in art history - if you had enough time.
Good location - right on Main Street in the quaint downtown of Luverne. Off-street parking in the back.
Only caveat... Lots of stairs to climb."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great. Place was as advertised and the hosts where very helpful and responsive. Will stay again if in the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay if you are visiting Luverne! This art inspired loft was perfect for 5 hockey girls going to the rink everyday! They loved coming back to the welcoming accommodations to relax at the end of a hard day!! Being right on Main Street, we walked to coffee and the theatre is across the street! So fun exploring Luverne’s quiet, quaint town. The hosts are so fast to respond and live near by, so meeting us when we arrived was so convenient and having a tour of the place with the host was a nice touch!! Highly recommend this loft apartment!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely space, open concept design in the living room/kitchen that’s very relaxing with a great space to play a game of chess or read a book from the shelf.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We couldnt have asked for a better place to stay on our way out to South Dakota. Our kids loved it so much that they were disappointed that we only stayed one night. The decor was artistic and beautiful. Looked better than the pictures! We would highly recommend this place to anyone- family friendly, bigger space than we expected and it was cleaner than clean! We give it 6 stars!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a one night stay and it worked perfectly for us. Convenient location and spacious.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This a huge, modern space, you'll love staying here. By the time we arrived, one of the beds was updated to a queen size, so my wife and I were able to enjoy that while our teenage kids use the full size beds. Great value for the size of the apartment. It was nice to play the provided guitars in the evenings as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Loved staying here. Luverne is a beautiful town and I really feel like I had the perfect spot to enjoy it from. The hosts are wonderful and gracious.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We can’t rate our experience high enough. It was such a great place in the middle of a cute little town. Great location - right between a coffee shop and yummy restaurant. Apartment was so nice and comfortable. We would totally stay there again.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole’s place was a very sweet stay, they responded timely to all our communications, were welcoming and so helpful. A great place to rest and recharge in our long journey. The kids loved it. Comfortable and super clean, very beautiful and full of sweet details. I recommend this place if you are visiting. Centrally located, great food around, the cafe in the corner was great too for breakfast. Very beautiful, my family loved it! I hope we can come back with more time."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, welcoming space! Wonderful artistic touches - loved the color coordinated books! we were only able to stay one night but wish we had had more time!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location- one block from cute coffee shop and from an excellent restaurant, 4 blocks from brewery. Spacious and comfortable. Great stop in Lucerne to break up our drive home from Black Hills, SD."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such an adorable place. Very clean
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was exactly what we needed - a large living area and kitchen, and spacious bedrooms. We really enjoyed the art work and books in the space too!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was wonderful. Right in the heart of downtown, near restaurants, very clean, and fabulous air conditioning! Check in was a breeze. Would definitely stay again."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stylish loft, hidden gem in a small town. Fantastic hosts!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kevin and Nicole went above and beyond any expectations that I may have had going into the apartment. The pictures really don't do the space justice as it is MUCH bigger than it looks in the pictures. We are a family of 8 and we had plenty of space for all of us. Only having one bathroom could be challenging for us, but we made it work. We had one minor issue and Nicole took care of that right away. They were quick to respond to any need or question. I look forward to staying there. The art work is beautiful, the book shelves are stocked with so many choices, and our hosts were amazing! If I could give them six stars I would. You won't be disappointed if you stay in the apartment!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My favorite AirBNB stay. The apartment is beautifully decorated, furniture and beds very comfortable. Location was great to walk around a quaint town, enjoy dinner and a beer at the local brewery. We were just passing thru, but was a perfect restful stop. Highly recommend."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed at Nicole's place a few times and it doesn't disappoint. It's quiet, comfortable, and spacious. There are art books and artwork throughout the apartment. And there's a few guitars on the wall for the musically inclined. We really enjoy being able to stay there when we visit Luverne."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED staying in Nicole's loft! I hosted a 'mom's night in' and invited a dozen friends over for a get together. Everyone was so impressed with the space! We will absolutely be staying here again. The space is cool and contemporary, yet incredibly inviting. Thanks again!!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment with an ideal proximity to shopping and restaurants. Far surpassed our expectations.

2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean and comfortable.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place. It's larger than the pictures appear, which was much appreciated for my family of 8. Trendy and ecclectic styling with small touches such as mints and tips on local attractions."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Luvene is a small town close to Sioux Fall and right by Freeway-90: the house is literally 3min from the free way, making it a convenient place to stop for the night. This unit is on the second floor of an old brick house in the downtown. There is parking place at the back of the building. Despite of aged appearance of the building from outside, inside it was very neatly kept. This 2 bd/1 ba unit is tastefully decorated and full of character. The host family took great care of the place, and responded promptly to our questions. My family enjoyed our one night stay there. One comment though: because of the age of the house, ""old house smell“ could be an issue in some poorly vented corner, such as the storage closet for linen and cleaning item. Most of my family did not seem to notice, but I may have a more sensitive nose and sensed the lingering smell."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Lots of space, comfy, private with lots of great places within walking distance that we could go to if we wanted to venture out. We would definitely stay there again!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures don’t really show how nice this apartment is. Everything is a couple notches above what you would expect from the listing! Great communication with Nicole. I totally recommend this place!

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good people who care to provide a relaxed environment.
2019-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great location and lots of space that my family enjoyed! Unique apartment with unique artwork. Our host suggested Pipestone National Monument and my family loved climbing all over the rocks there and the history. There is a yummy restaurant right next door that was perfect after a couple long hot days enjoying the outdoors. Could have been cleaner, but from the other comments, I think this is normally not the case."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed two nights here. Nicole accommodates your needs, just need to ask with her. She responds super fast. Check in was super easy. The place is sparkling clean. Pictures show exact rooms. Two bedroom are separated by the bathroom. Normal noises in one room does not affect the other bedroom. We had kids sleep in the bed room while we were in the living space that has a door as well. No one lives during the night below this level (there are shops/businesses.)
Location is a cool Main Street. City park is pretty big/amazing for little kids and we did some grilling there. State park is very close from here.
Each one of us were pleased with this stay. Did i forget to say the loft is spacious? And yes, you can park 3 SUVs or cars in the back parking area. If yours are the trucks, two will fit without any issues. We parked three SUVs there. We will certainly stay again if we happen to pass through this area in future."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Place
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Family of 6 stayed for an overnight here. Nicole has a great, clean and spacious loft with a neat artistic atmosphere. It was a relaxing and comfortable stay. Cool main street location. Everything was super easy."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Nicole and Cody's apartment and we loved it just as much as the first. It's the perfect place to stay while enjoying all of the great things in Luverne - could not recommend it more highly!

2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Fun space and great location! My friends and I loved it
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I used this apartment for my friend's bachelorette party, and it was fantastic! Everyone was commenting on how much they loved the space. Also, Nicole and her family were so hospitable and helpful from giving tips to taking a couple pictures of our group. It was perfect!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great accommodation! We loved staying there for the night!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Luverne, MN is a gem. I could easily take a vacation in this town. It is like Maybury from the Andy Griffith show where everyone is kind and considerate. The apartment we stayed in Unit D was tastefully decorated though we did cover one picture that my son deemed scary. 12ft ceilings and high quality everything made it so much nicer than any hotel stay. As long as you can take stairs U recommend it. A working 100 year old theater is across the street and coffee shops and a grocery store made this feel like home. I highly recommend."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place with great hosts. Will definitely return.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great space! Only two of us stayed here but there is ample room for two couples or even two small families. The high ceilings along with a sort of minimalist decor really make the space feel grand. There are books and DVDs available to entertain you, if needed. The location is wonderful, right on the main street. Next door is Sterling's Café and Grille which was perfect with their sidewalk seating for enjoying the beautiful evenings with a glass of wine (or local beer), the food was good as well. Nicole and family were very kind and friendly, and easily accessible. I would certainly recommend this spot."
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Nicole was fabulous! Great communication. She was flexible and worked with us checking in a little later than planned. Very Nice place!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a spectacular apartment in the heart of Luverne on Main Street! We loved staying here while in town for a family celebration - it was perfect in every way. Can't recommend Nicole's apartment highly enough and we'll definitely be back again!
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Loved the location! Walking distance to everything downtown and the park. I especially enjoyed the nice kitchen ware for cooking, nice pots and pans, knives etc. The loft was stylish, and Netflix and a number of good DVD’s was available. Would definitely stay at again!!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! It’s clean and a very neat apartment to stay in. Definitely recommend it

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dear Debby
Thank you so much for letting us stay at your beautiful cottage. We really enjoyed the time at your place.
Thank you
Radmila"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem of a retreat. If you’re looking for a ton of bustle and noise everywhere, don’t book here. The lake is so serene and peaceful. It has a walkable path and beautiful views. Just a note: the wifi is not always the sharpest and there is no dedicated desk space- so leave your work at home, unplug and really enjoy Gods creation. Other note- there is no actual stove, but does include a two burner plug in and toaster type oven- so don’t plan on cooking any major meals here- plenty of fridge space and prep space though, so think easy to make meals. The host was so responsive, the instructions were crystal clear and the rest was deep. Thank you for a restorative place to grieve my good friend Pastor Marie. Also, the personal note and my favorite snack was the cherry on top!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the Cozy Cottage. The area is beautiful and quiet. Everyone slept great in the comfortable beds.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful spot!!
We loved Cozy Cottage. It was immediately welcoming, with snuggly beds and a rustic cottage atmosphere! Just perfect for our anniversary trip. We stayed in Windom for a day drive to Mankato, and hope we can come back with our littles during the summer to more fully experience the surrounding area and Fish Lake."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best places I’ve stayed. Very welcoming and very good communication. Hope we get to go back soon
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and cozy place, I didn’t like that the windows were all open without blinds felt like was being watched at times. Overall though very satisfied."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second year in a row staying at Debby's place. This year was just as good as last and already looking forward to our trip next year!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy cottage. It is a very stylish cottage with appropriate decor. We enjoyed the outdoors, walking to the nearby Fish Lake, the park, small hike to the vineyard etc. It is also a great place for night sky watching with clear skies with very little light pollution."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Debby and the cozy cottage! It is the loveliest little spot. Everything was clean and tidy. The personal touches were my favorite! A handwritten card and treats/snacks upon arrival?! Yes, please!! We’d love to come stay again one day!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what a beautiful place to stay. The little cabin was so quiet and cozy. The lake just outside was also beautiful and relaxing.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie was fantastic! The cottage was cozy, clean, unique and perfect for a family getaway. We loved how close it was to the water. We fished everyday and we caught a huge fish right off the dock! It’s kid friendly and and it had games and books for entertainment along with satellite tv. The kitchen was well equipped and we were able to make homemade meals. Deb was very responsive to all the questions we had and was readily available to help! The view of the lake was spectacular and its clean and a boat launch with public access was within walking distance. The beds were very comfortable and we all agreed we had restful sleep! We will certainly be back for another trip soon. Highly recommend this cottage to everyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,i want to thank debbie and airbnbthere was some confusion on the days i reserved. it was taken care of quickly and very fair

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable place to relax after a busy day! Quiet surroundings. Fun to wake up with the sun streaming in the window and a great view of the lake. Very responsive hosts; easy to work with!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect little getaway for 3 empty nest moms. The hosts were very responsive and helpful with our questions. They were gracious to let us keep our kayaks on their property and the lake is beautiful. As described, the fridge is small, so we kept some food in a cooler and made simple meals at the place and ate out the rest. Bergen Bar & Grill and Duffy’s Bar & Grill were both excellent. We had a lovely weekend in a beautiful setting. Would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the second time we stayed here and we still LOVE this place. Our hope is to continue to come back every year.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a nice stay, close lake access, lovely walkable area behind the cottage, lots of wildlife. Everything was as described, the fireplace was fantastic for warming up. the queen bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've slept a in!

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place with cabin-y charm, directly across from the lake. Was a perfect 'home base' for our winery weekend!
Note that there is no stove (only a double hot plate and a toaster oven) and only a small fridge/freezer, so plan accordingly. Also, the spiral staircase is narrow so navigating it with anything larger than a carryon bag would be a challenge."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As shown in the cottage photos, the only bedroom is upstairs and only accessible via the spiral staircase and the only washroom is on the main floor."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Cottage was extremely quiet and comfortable. I slept great, which is pretty rare when I travel. I enjoyed the lake-view while eating breakfast, which was a bonus. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in WIndom."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute and fun getaway spot!! While we stayed here in the winter time and obviously weren’t able to swim or anything, we still had fun playing games by the fireplace, exploring the frozen lake and local town, and overall spending some quality time together in this cozy cottage!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debby really knows how to host. The space was clean, and the kitchen and bathroom fully stocked. She really thought of everything. Beyond being thorough in her home making, Debby went above and beyond to check in with us and make sure all was well. She let us use her dock for our small fishing boat, and offered us her life jackets and beach towels when we had forgotten our own. We would certainly recommend Debby, and her space. You won’t be dissatisfied."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and nice place to stay. Winding staircase was so cool. Hosts are very accommodating. … Jalisco Mexican restaurant was good.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place located a little ways off the highway (it’s about 10-15 mins out). Nearby you have Windom which is a small little town with food and gas options. Extremely clean place to stay, it has a small kitchenette, living room with TV and games, and the bedrooms are up the spiral upstair case. Perfect place if you want a quiet and comfort place to sleep. Note: if you are an animal lover, this might not be for you since there is taxidermy all over the walls."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"perfect cozy spot in windom! thoughtful touches, clean, easy check-in & out. highly recommend if you are passing through!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fish lake is beautiful. Clean and even warm enough to swim in in the high 70 degree temperatures. We loved swimming and kayaking. The cabin was nice and had all the basic things to make for a good stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cottage stay with many cozy touches that felt so welcoming. Communication with Dominique was quick and they were able to accommodate an early check in request. We enjoyed sitting on the lake dock in the mornings, watching fish jump out of the water, so peaceful. Our stay was a little retreat for us so we really appreciated the peace and quiet for reading and quiet conversation. During our stay, a tornado warning sounded and severe weather made for some exciting weather watching. Debby was so kind to walk over to the cottage and invite us to seek shelter with them in their basement! Thank you for a relaxing experience!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, very clean and homey! Wish we could’ve stayed longer, will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debby is a terrific host!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All around great experience planning to come back
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a relaxing week at this lovely cottage! Everything was so clean and nicely decorated. The use of the kayaks and paddle boat was great. Debby and her husband were so hospitable and responsive to our questions, our family of four all enjoyed our time together. The extra cooking options of a toaster oven and electric burners made it very easy to cook what we needed, and we enjoyed the coffee shop and restaurants nearby as well."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed at Chad’s place over the weekend to go to a family event in Sibley. This worked very well for our family which includes 2 (non-shedding) dogs and an infant. Having a full kitchen was a wonderful help. This is a small property but its space was well utilized. Chad was very friendly and quick to respond to our questions. I would be pleased to recommend this property and would happily book there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"everything was great
my favorite yet
thanks"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice very happy!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. We enjoyed having the place to ourselves. Within walking distance to downtown and city park. We would definitely stay here again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We chose Chad’s home as a halfway point between SD and NE Wisconsin. The town was nice for a walk, quiet, and easy to find. We ate dinner at Round Lake Winery which was delightful.
Chad described his home accurately with everything we needed for an overnight stay. The home was spotless! The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, well kept and felt more like home than a hotel"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great thanks. The $70 per day cleaning fee is alittle high. I would understand one cleaning fee per visit but I paid $140 in cleaning fees for 2 nights and it was as clean as when I left (minus washing 1 set of sheets)
I did know the fees ahead of time and still booked, because the nightly rate was fairly inexpensive. But I would just add that for a 2 night stay, $140 for cleaning is excessive. But the home was great."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"very nice home. I liked the tranquility that felt inside the home. Chad is always on the lookout if you need anything, thank you Chad for letting us into your home"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place and town, very quiet. Internet was solid so I was able to work without issue."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Chad's home was clean and comfortable, espcially the beds! We chose Sibley solely because it was halfway between me and my daughter. But, we should have checked out what Sibley had to offer, because breakfast on a Sunday was impossible to find.
However, Chad's neighborhood was great to walk around and we had plenty of space.
Chad was also incredible responsive to us. Thanks Chad!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to get a good night rest after a long travel Accross the country. Comfy beds, clean, well appointed kitchen, great shower. Did not get the chance to check the area hence cannot comment on that. Chad communicated clearly and on time. Thank you."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean little 2 bed with 1 bathroom. The basement has a washer/dryer with soap provided. One room did not have a TV but the other room and living room TV's were perfect 65"" HDTV's. The kitchen needed some more basic pots and pans but a coworker and I managed to make dinner every night. The beds and pillows were great. I wanted to stay longer but there was another reservation. Thanks Chad!"

The location is within walking distance of everything we needed! Grocery store, restaurants and an extremely cool coffee shop! Neat, clean and quiet, it has plenty of room to work or unwind. Alyssa is a wonderful host, and we will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun place to stay! We stayed here during Okobiji Winter Games and it was a great choice. Staying on Main St. was a unique and charming experience. Lakefield is the quintessential small town!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alyssa's place is amazing! It is so quaint and has so many great antique pieces...my favorite being the old card catalog from a school! Alyssa was great at providing recommendations for both local & Okoboji restaurants. This is a wonderful place to stay & we will certainly keep it in mind for future trips to the Lakes area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We have stayed in a lot of Abnbs but Alyssa's is one of the best if not the best! Because of her hospitality, we had a very comfortable stay. She provided amenities that are above and beyond expectations- the soft linens and towels, china, and other necessary items available for our use during our stay. Everything in this Abnb is topnotch- from the kitchen utensils to even the fly swatter (which is leather I think).
The location is perfect -close to our friends and relatives in Sioux Falls, Worthington and Windom. We also felt very safe.
We were impressed by a number of features: the rental property including washer and dryer, the well-equipped kitchen, the modern bathroom and the living room. The decor is simply gorgeous.
We thank Alyssa for opening up the Abnb for us and for being a wonderful host. We hope to stay here again in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"❤️ the peace and quiet in the Haus and the town itself, seeing people driving the streets in their golf carts, and all the unusual aspects Lakefield had for a small town. Things we noticed: a Holiday gas station, a non-serviice Cenex pump area with cheaper gas prices, a coffee shop, a cheesecake business, a golf course, a police station, 2 bar/restaurants, a cafe, a pool/water park, historic buildings, a library, an old-time bowling alley, new school, soon-to-open bakery, funeral home, churches, senior housing, a paved walking/bike trail, city/county and state parks, a DAC thrift store, a main street grocery store, a VFW, a post office, grain elevators, lumber yard, a lake, a fascinating county museum, no fast food restaurants/lights/litter--with a welcoming, wide main street with angled parking spots common in quaint towns of the past that are rare finds nowadays.
Alyssa was helpful, friendly in her informative, speedy replies to my questions. Check-in/out was simple and appreciated!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Perfect for my needs! The washer and dryer made my month long stay super easy! Alyssa is awesome and the haus was an enjoyable place to stay in! Wifi, full kitchen, and no noise made working remotely easy!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Modern Heirloom Haus is an absolutely beautiful comfortable place to stay in Lakefield. Everyone in the town were so friendly. There are many place in walking distance. The bakery right next door was a favorite!! The local Silverback Cafe was delicious!
Do not miss the opportunity to stay at the Haus and experience Lakefield!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! So cool and comfortable! Loved it!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Modern Heirloom is an elegant combination of historical charm and high end accommodations. It was very clean, Alyssa was incredibly fast and personal with communication, and Lakefield is also charming. For a small town, there is a variety of interesting restaurants and a new top shelf coffee shop walking distance away right on Main Street. We were surprised by the absence of any cooking supplies, so be advised you'll need to pack in everything you need, even sugar, coffee, cooking oil, etc. And it's not all that ""senior"" friendly -- e.g. no place to put your shampoo and soap in the elegant shower other than on the floor. But it's a lot of fun, combining historical artifacts and modern elegance, and the proprietor is great. An excellent place to stop over amid the cornfields of southern Minnesota."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing Airbnb. it was quaint and very clean. staying on Main Street, and next to a bakery, was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again.

It was cozy and comfortable. Kathi and Gary are great hosts!
Spencer’s downtown is adorable with so many unique storefronts and Okoboji looks really fun for the summer!
This was a pleasant surprise and I am so glad we opted it vs. one of the motel/hotels in town."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Ideal location for a stay in a country setting and away from the hustle and bustle of the Okoboji area. The Iowa great lakes area is a thirty minute drive away. Kathi was an attentive host and The Red Shed was very clean and an ideal get away for families.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hidden gem! We were looking for a space that wasn’t the same old hotel room…found it! The peace and tranquillity were hard to leave.

Located on a small farm with horses and amazing hosts, this is the place you’re looking for! Unwind by an outside fireplace and enjoy the stars at night. This is truly a place you won’t regret booking!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jordyn’s place was exactly what we had hoped for. It was exactly as described. The living room was comfortable and the bedrooms were a nice size and the beds were comfortable. The full kitchen was great as we had planned snacks to make while there. It was a nice distance to Walnut Grove (35 minutes) which is where we planned to spend the next day, closer than many hotels and was a great deal for what was offered. Highly recommend this place."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot to stay in Slayton. 4 queen size beds and a full (although small) bathroom. The bathroom didn’t work well for our grandparents, as it is hard to move about in. The kitchen and living space were good sized. It’s close to a bar/restaurant which was great."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Chick-Inn is a great little gem of a place. I only wish we would have been in town during racing season. It is RIGHT next to the racetrack.
The place seems small from the outside but fit my family of 6 very comfortably. The fire pit out back was nice, wood provided. It was nice an clean and cozy. 100% would recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Look for the giant chicken! Clean house that is nicely located in Slayton. Walking distance to City Limits Bar and Grill. It was nice and quiet when we stayed on a Wednesday night in October, but I'm guessing race nights are a bit louder!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy. Great for our girls getaway!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything went well. She was easy to get a hold of when there was an issue. Easily fixed but didn't interfere with the stay. Perfect location for the dirt track special the night of the stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jordyn is a fantastic host, and the home is absolutely perfect! Tons of amenities, and everything is spotless, well maintained, and fully functional. The beds are very comfortable with plenty of extra space throughout the home and a great flow through the kitchen and living areas. Just a great spot to stay for a couple days when visiting Slayton!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay. The place was cute, quiet, and comfortable. It's right on the edge of town so you can get out on the road with a bike or just to watch the sunset. It was super hot when I was there so I didn't spend as much time outdoors as I would have. Happily, the air conditioning kept up with the 100 degree temps."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Super nice place to stay, I spent 3 months there. The only down fall for my was the no washer and dryer for the winter months and working on call lots at the hospital made my clothes start to pile up. As long as you have time for a laundry mat it’s a great place to stay short or long!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was very happy to be Coleens’ first AirBnB client! Very friendly and helpful, beautiful and cozy home, and an all around joy to work with. Will be visiting again if I ever return!"

I especially enjoyed their artwork, and listening to the birds in the morning."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The staff was very helpful, we had a few hiccups with the water heat being off at checkin but it was resolved quickly and they were responsive to our questions. The place was clean and the instructions were clear for checkout."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location - off Hwy 266 & I-90. First AM - the hot water heater was on the fritz delaying us getting ready for family wedding. (Maintenance was called at 8 AM & fixed it within 1 hr, but had to wait for another 1 hour for hot water). 2nd day - problem with door locks (maintenance called & fixed promptly). Host(s) apologized & will be contacting contractor &/or have maintenance fix. Evolve is only available by AirBnb app or messaging; they are not local. Host(s) do not live local but very responsive by text. Maintenance/Housekeeper were very responsive by text & live local to Worthington. It's best to ask for Host(s) phone # (Pacific Time) & maintenance ph # after booking in case of any issues during your stay. Beds and kitchen were very clean & comfortable. Home is very comfortable & accommodating for 5-8 people."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as described. Unfortunately we lost hot water the last morning. The daily rate is good, but the fees were much higher than other stays I’ve had."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice, comfortable home for our extended family to connect for a late Christmas get together. It had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Joe accidentally programmed the wrong code for the keyless lock which kept us from being able to get in. Took about half an hour and numerous calls and texts to get it resolved but Joe responded fairly quickly.
Only mirror was in bathroom which made it a little challenging with 3 people sharing the apartment. Beds were very comfortable, pillows were too big/thick for me. Would have been nice to have options of thicknesses."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Have stayed there many times. My only complaint is that the Main Street traffic is very noisy.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place right in downtown Luverne. Can walk to restaurants and stores. Felt very secure and had easy instructions. Host was very friendly and responsive. Will stay again if I come back for business.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place was comfortable and affordable and exactly how he described it. Definitely worth the cost. Luverne is beautiful with a surprising number of things to see and places to eat.
Our only issue with the unit is we had trouble using the TV. So we played some of the games he had available. 😊
The noise from the revving engines on the street outside was very loud. We are glad we brought a sound machine.
We would definitely stay here again and we've already recommended it to others!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe was a great communicator. The apartment was comfortable and in a great location in Luverne for visiting several MN state parks in the region. Parking was easy, the grocery store was right behind the apartment and the brewery down Main Street offered great Heggie's pizza, locally made ice cream sandwiches and friendly service. The coffee shop across the street is not to be missed."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for our stay as we were visiting Blue Mounds State Park and other attractions in the area.
We appreciated Joe’s restaurant recommendations and had very nice meal at restaurant just a block away.
Only downside to be aware of is occasional loud street noise as right downtown.
Would definitely recommend Joe’s place!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very restful night-the bed was comfortable. We were only there for a quick overnight stop, shower and bowl of cereal so I can’t comment on most of the amenities. The space was clean, except the bathroom floor and shower surround area was dirty.
Joe’s response was prompt and friendly."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A really good place. Central location and cozy home. it was bigger than we expected.
The only thing that could pull down a bit was the couch, which feels like it's collapsed, but the rest was so good that I give 5 stars anyway.
Great place to stay for the price. We would love to stay there again if we come by another time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe’s place was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We were there to drop our son off to MN west in Worthington and it’s about 30 minute drive but it was worth the drive. We will definitely stay again when we go back to visit our son."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The air bnb overall was great the only complaint I have is the noise outside but everything else was great
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was really a joy to easily get in without having to know or do anything special. Both times I have booked with him, the place has been extra clean with very comfortable mattresses (yay!!) and both kitchen and bathrooms are well-supplied with necessities and even a bit more. He's easy to contact when needed, and always replies in a timely manner. I was impressed since this summer is the first time I have used any Airbnb places."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are in luverne this is a great place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very responsive would stay again
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"They were kind&quick to respond!
I booked this place based on the previous great reviews.
This was my experience: as I entered the apt I was hit with strong burnt smell.This did not improve through our stay&I concluded it was coming from the heat/cool unit.We could not safely open the windows to air it out because there were no screens (2nd story/concrete below). The TOILET had visible dirt around the seat/lid, plus a puddle of dry pee at the base of the toilet.Hair throughout the shower. Refrigerator had leftover drips and crumbs. Kitchen towel felt dirty/stiff. The kitchen trash can peddle was broken. As a mom who had worked tirelessly to prepare for our trip, it was a HUGE letdown to arrive and have to get back to work cleaning the bathroom and kitchen so that my family could rest here. Perhaps they had a new cleaner in training?Or maybe the previous tenant left late?
If you are traveling with children, note that the 220amp outlets are out in the open, easy to access. Nicebutdirty:)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Luverne at Joe’s place. It’s perfectly located for area activities. The apartment was the perfect size, very comfortable and clean. We’d stay here again next time we’re in Luverne!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area for races at Brandon, South Dakota and this place was by far better price than motels. Joe was so nice to work and communicate with. Definitely would recommend staying here. Plan on using again in the future. Community is also beautiful and good places to eat."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot! If you’re in Laverne and need a great place to say this is the place. The bed was cozy, the heaters worked great, the shower was spacious and cozy, and (had I wanted to cook) the kitchen are could have more than accommodated that. Next time I’m in town I’d happily stay here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, comfortable, and quiet place all to yourself. Joe is ultra-organized. He sent me the check-in info more than a day ahead. My phone wasn't working whenever I was on the road, so that early info, while I still had connectivity at another place I was staying, lessened the stress of my trip greatly.
If you happen to have a lot of luggage, you might want to dig into it and just take essentials while you're still in the car - there are a lot of stairs and doors to get through if you have multiple pieces of luggage.
I would stay here again, for sure."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two years after booking this apartment, we were finally able to use it. Due to COVID, reunion activities were cancelled and rescheduled for 2022. We appreciated the location and ease in walking to all the activities and restaurants."

It is close to many beautiful state parks in MN and SD. Close to a supermarket and coffe shops.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Found this last minute while driving thru on I-90 — Joe was super accommodating and kind. The apartment was impeccably clean, well decorated, spacious and well stocked. The California King mattress was so comfortable and shower pressure great too.
We got there late and left in the morning, so we didn’t get to explore the town much, but it seemed cute and I enjoyed the location of Joe’s space right in downtown. Even on the 4th of July when we were there it was pretty quiet and we slept great!

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Book this place!
My fiancé and I got stuck during the blizzard... after waiting in a parking lot for 4hrs we realized we weren’t going anywhere and looked for a place to stay. We found Joe’s place 2miles from where we were hiding out. I booked, wrote Joe a message and only a few minutes later I had a response and our booking was approved.
Upon arrival only an hour later (we had to wait for the whiteout to pass) everything was ready. The instructions to get in are very clear and easy.
And when we walked in.... wow! This is a great apartment, good couch, TV equipped with Netflix and Prime, super soft and comfy bed, and a full kitchen (including coffee maker), nice clean bathroom, and dining table.
Even though we didn’t really have a choice but stay in Luverne, it really was a great experience. The apartment is downtown and I would love to come back and really enjoy the location.
Thank you again Joe!"

The apartment feels roomy and up to date. It's also a great location to take a walk and look at the downtown buildings made with Sioux Quartzite in the past from a local quarry. The town of Luverne really has their stuff together and is a wonderful community."

We did a quick weekend and fell in love with Luverne and cannot wait to go back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean place that was a pleasant place to stay the night after a long drive. Small town was nice too and we took a long walk through it in the evening.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were looking for a weekend getaway to see bison in the Blue Mounds State Park and staying at Joe’s was a highlight. The place was perfectly located next to the Main Street downtown with a cute coffee shop and some good eats. Some other perks were the self check-in, easy parking, and being a stone’s throw away from the grocery store.
We were completely at home and the modern touches reminded us of our NYC apartment before we had kids🤩"

We only stayed for a week but could have easily stayed for longer, and we even tried to extend our stay! Communication with Joe was super easy, and he was extremely communicative during the whole stay. Check in was a breeze, and it was nice to have a dedicated spot for my car for the week. One small thing is that because the apartment is located on the main strip of downtown Luverne, there is a bit of thru-traffic. Was never much of a problem, but did provide a small bit of white noise. All in all, great stay! Thanks Joe!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second of Joe’s apartments we have stayed in, and had a great experience each time. He is very responsive and the apartments have nice amenities, are spotlessly clean, and have a perfect location for a stay in Luverne. Highly recommended"

It was quite loud, but if you’re a heavy sleeper, this shouldn’t be a problem!"

It is located right in downtown Luverne, just a couple of minutes from the freeway. We checked-in late and needed to leave really early. Unfortunately, there was not time to check out the downtown area, but it looked charming! We would loved to have had time to walk around. Since it is downtown, expect a little traffic noise. We loved the spacious, quiet space. It was the perfect place to stay after a very long drive. Thank you Joe!"

She answered many questions for us about local things like walking trails and where to shop for stuff. The patio was mostly private, beautiful, and we used it every night for family gatherings. The use of a gas grill came with the rental which we used, also. This was one of the nicest AirBNBs we have stayed in and Kerri and Steve made the stay a 12 out of 10 on our rating scale."

We have stayed in alot of Air Bnbs, but this one by far was our favorite! If we could leave more than a five star review, we would! We can't wait to recommend our friends and family to stay, as well!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a quick one night pitstop on our road trip. Kerri's place has a tastefully modern aesthetic, with everything you could want in a one bedroom: ample space, smartly laid out open floor plan, and the latest appliances.

It was decorated beautifully, it was relaxing, very clean and the hosts were so friendly and welcoming. I would come back to the area just to stay in this air b and b. The beds were comfortable, the house was all new with lots of little amenities. They had cold water in the fridge and some snacks on the counter for us.

There are many special touches around the place, from a huge TV, to a comfy couch, great modern kitchen (so modern in fact the stove asked my phone to connect to it), and I would be remiss to not mention the cool mirror in the bathroom...I want one of those.
I walked around the neighborhood a bit, and there's a park near by, and it's very quiet. I think Jackson is a nice little town, and this Air bnb is nice little refuge.
Kerri gave complete info...and responded immediately to communications.
One more thing...we were FIRST! Sorry, had to add that. :)"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at this tiny house in the small town of Kenneth. We were there to visit some of the surrounding state parks so it was a good base for that. Kenneth itself is a bit of a ghost town - I saw one person total in the two days we were there and several of the buildings and homes have seen better days. But it wasn't too far of a drive to Luverne for food. The house itself has everything you need in a small package. Comfortable bed, big shower, kitchen with everything you need."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hi! We really loved the cute little house and it was very cozy!! Overall no issues, though we did notice the duvet had some dog hair on it but that could be from the dryer not picking up everything. The only issues we really had were that 1 of the bath towels that was rolled up, when rolled out had hair and dirt that we had to shake out and the dishwasher had dirty dishes, but no detergent for us to run it. Overall, really enjoyed our experience and Steve made everything very easy. :)"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks - the home was convenient and comfortable!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Spent Thanksgiving weekend at the cozy home with our dog. Always a blessing to have our furr baby with us when we travel and he liked the new town to explore.
Cottage was peaceful, calm, and great to unwind. Had all the amenities needed to enjoy ourselves. Host was easy to communicate and did reach out on our first night to check in.
Kenneth may be small and in 'middle of nowhere' but that was part of the charm. Quick trip- visited Blue Mound SP with beautiful wildlife and scenery, found small business meat shop in Luverne, and delicious Mexican food in Worthington.
Would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay close to state parks. The place is super cozy.

Other than that peaceful, quiet and easy access"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great reprieve from the road, nice relaxing stop on a road trip!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay for an overnight trip! We felt cozy, and we had everything we needed. Full-working amenities and enough space for two. The town is quiet but a bit eerie. Steve was responsive and was nice to let us stay late due to a flat tire. I would probably stay here again if I was headed to this part of the state again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steve's place was great and super cozy. Highly recommend

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,cute little tiny house in the country. not too far from sightseeing destinations
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a very nice little place to stay at. He was very flexible and communicated very well with us.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was everything we could have hoped for. We ran late getting in because of traffic and he made it easy for us. Great cabin and we’ll thought out.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well equipped place with everything I needed for a weekend stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice tiny home. Perfect for us. Very clean and comfortable
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place, but wish we could have enjoyed it more. Front Door not latching shut was a problem for us. Steve was slow at responding back to us. We being unfamiliar with area didn't feel safe leaving our belongings in the air bnb with the door not latching shut. He stated he knew there was issues with this door but didn't fix the 1st night. At 5:30 am we were awakened by door that blew open knocking the chair over we had propped up to keep the door shut. Didn't state what time he would come to fix the door he said Friday night that he would text us in morning when he was coming to fix door. We received no text or call from him. Due to power outage we left for breakfast and when we returned @ 11am he was at house trying to fix door & implied we should leave. We felt weird staying there with him fixing the door. We wanted to explore surrounding areas so we left but brought all our belongings. Informed @ 2:30pm door was possibly fixed we were told to not use front door."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little tiny place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and have peace and relaxation.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures and description represented the place perfectly! It was welcoming, cozy, relaxing and very peaceful. We live in the cities so this was a great change of pace. Heads up, nothing in town of Kenneth. Its about a 20min drive to Blue Mounds / Laverne. We were welcomed with a friendly neighbor dog and heard two people mowing next door so people do live in the town. Anyways, Steve was super helpful when it came to suggestions on where to eat. Very proactive and responsive when it came time to check in. Steve's communication was very clear when it came to expectations of guest and host, which I greatly appreciate. Overall, we would stay here again and suggest others to stay here too!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Steve’s place was a great spot, my wife and I super enjoyed our stay! Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,a great little place to stay in the middle of nowhere! it was so peaceful
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly as represented in the pictures. It was really cute and perfectly furnished. It was also clean except for the nearly empty refrigerator which had hair in it and dirty shelves from a previous guest, as well as the kitchen sink which clearly had not been wiped down. Since we only needed a bed to sleep in and a place to shower, the fridge and kitchen sink were not a huge deal. The bed and bathroom were very clean and I had no concern using them. Notable for future guests: There are no grocery stores for miles around - and no restaurants. There is a coffee maker with use instructions, but no coffee. With no store anywhere in sight, the coffee maker was completely useless. Further, though nothing to do with the room - the area is sparse. A stop sign town with a couple of abandoned buildings across the street, another damaged & falling down, as well as a tavern that was closed. Overall, a nice stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is cozy in a very nice way. It feels homey and is well decorated and stocked. Steve is easy to communicate with. All in all a lovely stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice little place right off of a county road. Nice and private with all amenities..
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, I had a comfortable stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it’s a really nice and cozy place with quiet space. However, I wish I had known that it’s would be in the center of the town."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has potential, but wasn’t clean well during my stay. I can handle a little dust, but the dog smell was overwhelming. Spent an hour just cleaning to get it back to a space I felt comfortable in."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect option for a weekend spot to be able to have my dog along for my trip.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steve is a very accommodating host and his rental unit is very convenient for when I come to town for work.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was exactly as listed. Perfect for just a weekend away! Will definitely go back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a cozy spot! We loved all of the finishing touches on the decorations and feel of this old post office, but loved how clean and knew this place felt! A very quiet, small town for a getaway to just relax and get some much-needed relaxation. We will be going again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was great I have no complaints! Steve was helpful, and was just as pictured."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely slice of heaven. This is not a rural farm stay in the middle of a plot of land, but it is a tiny cottage on the main drag of a tiny town. Somehow this tiny home has everything you need to feel comfortable including a fairly sizable kitchen. The small personal touches in the home made it very homelike."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adequate small house with amenities as listed. Awkward entryway with 2 doors. Minimally furnished. Kitchen is quite small and cramped because of the large dining table crammed in the space. Might be better in living room area. Fridge opens opposite way it should for access, inconvenient. Coffee pot(K cup machine) did not work at all. Reached out to host via text but never got a reply. Even tried running vinegar thru it, but still did not work. No spatula to flip pancakes/eggs and no individual measuring cups, so we bought them at local thrift store and left for the next guests. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom is small as well. Large living room with large TV but minimal seating. Traffic is a bit noisy but felt like a safe area. Neighbors just ignored us even when we said a friendly hello. Probably would not recommend or stay again as is, but with a few small changes, would consider it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice big house it’s everything you said it was and more thanks
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed several times and enjoyed close proximity to walking trails. Maria is a great host! Will stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here a few times. Has everything our family needs!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Maria was very responsive. Came and cleared the snow promptly and replaced what we needed for our longer stay. Will be staying in the future.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place for our small family and 2 dogs.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here. It's definitely a place we would stay again. It met all of our needs.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this comfortable house with everything we needed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here and it’s definitely my go to place when I visit Worthington.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for what I needed this week. Very clean and spacious and in a seemingly great neighborhood. It was quiet in the evenings as well and not far from the local restaurants. If I ever find myself in the area again, I’ll definitely be staying here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay in this lovely house, with plenty of room for our family including tween/teen/dogs, everyone had enough space for themselves. The location was convenient in town with a gorgeous lake and park nearby, and was just a short drive from the family farm we visited. Maria was friendly and always quick in responding to messages."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and clean place to stay! Great responses to messages
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I spent two weeks at Maria’s place and found it to be just perfect. Loved that she has hard wood floors throughout the house. It’s simple and minimalistic which I prefer. The kitchen had what I needed to cook lots of meal for my son & daughter in law who just became new parents. A nice washer & dryer in the basement. She had complimentary water & soda in the fridge. A nice backyard. I walked my dogs to Okabena lake every morning and night. The neighborhood is very quiet at night. The tv has Netflix all set up. I will try to stay there every time I visit my family in Worthington. Maria also responded quickly and kindly to my emails.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay in Worthington. Staying at the house was a much better option than a hotel. Easy drive to anyplace in Worthington.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria’s place was perfect for us. Simple, comfortable and convenient."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect stay
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a good stay at a “no-frills” house in SW Minnesota. We enjoyed having more space than a standard hotel room in the area and the house was in a good location in town to get around. Thanks Maria for hosting us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Maria was responsive when I needed her, great location if you’re looking to golf!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, simple, comfortable. Maria was very pleasant to deal with."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute stay close to the lake
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice location, clean home open living room."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a little lacking in furnishings.
But you cannot beat the space and location! I was in a nice and easy location - and was pretty quiet and felt very safe!
Definitely will book again when in town."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"the house was very clean, it however needed more seating in the living room, there were 4 of us and there was only a couch. We found some folding chairs to use but was not comfortable. The curtains in the living room did not fully cover the large window, so you could see in at night. The kitchen is very small, there is no dishwasher and the keurig coffee maker needed to be cleaned. The tub had a large rust spot in it. The house was in a quiet neighborhood. The only problem we incurred was as we were entering the front door we found a 2 foot snake by the threshold, it had apparetently gotten in through the back door because there was a large gap between the door and the floor that was not sealed. He was harmless but we could not catch him. Overall the house was sufficient for our needs and the price was cheaper than the hotels there, but it is definitely no frills."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you have issues with fragrance please let Maria know ahead of time. She uses the plug in kind. I unplugged them and aired out the house and was ok after a while. But if you let her know she can put them away sooner for you.
It is not far from the lake and there is a very nice dog park on the Southwest side of the lake.
The master bedroom has a queen sized bed and the smaller rooms have twin beds. The mattresses are nice and firm.
There are more chairs in the basement. We brought them up when my daughter and her family came over and took them back down before we left.
She has plenty of pans to cook with. Coffee cups but not drinking cups.
Over all everything was great and we enjoyed our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hi Maria-
Thanks for hosting us at you place. Everything worked out perfectly. Look forward to staying with you again.
Sincerely,
Phil"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just as described. Very functional. Great location. On busier street but still quiet neighborhood. Excellent host and good value.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy. Safe. Clean. Great value!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, we'd definitely stay here again.
We tried this place knowing there were only a few reviews. We're glad we did. We were totally satisfied with the accomodations, and could see that they are prepared to continue making remodel updates. If you have stayed in Worthington you are probably aware that all of the mid to low tier of hotels/motels have issue. We found this place to be refreshing and fit our needs and budget perfectly."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean! Worked great.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,This was a convenient stay for what we needed.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Maria's place. It's a short walk to the lake. There are limited restaurants in town. We used it as home base as we went around SW MN to see Little House sites, various museums and parks. Minimum furnishings but it worked well as we had our dogs with us. It was basic but comfortable and met our needs."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very beautiful home, with a lot of room, bright new furniture and modern laundry and drier; easy to clean on every base, which I do anyway. Huge TV with Netflix active and menu others programs. AC works perfect.
Sam, was responding within minutes on any of our questions on the Airbnb side.
I would strongly recommend the place. We used only the first floor.
The basement is fully furnished and there many other beds. Just FYI if someone is interested to accommodate large family."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This home was perfect to meet our needs while were in town for a funeral. Everything was clean and a great place to decompress. The bathroom downstairs was named “the Cadillac of bathrooms” by one of my family members and having a heater in it was an extra touch that put it over the top.
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Stay at the home was nice. Plenty of room for our family. Close to the town so you do not have to drive far. Easy to walk around the lake as well through a great neighborhood!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located on a quiet street, just a few blocks from the lake and a lovely walking path and just a stone's throw from the excellent elementary school, this spot worked out great for three visitors from Minneapolis. A modest, cozy abode with just what we needed. Thank you!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, cozy not far from town. And great communication from owner"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good communication from the host, our crew has enjoyed their stay so far. 🙂"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam's house is a wonderful place to stay when visiting SW Minnesota. Very large and can accomidate a large group. Was a little disappointed as the description of the bedrooms were not what we found, but still worked. The space is still be worked on, especially the basement as it looks like that may turn into a lookout unit. Kitchen is small and dated but it was enough for what we needed."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I visited Worthington for the first time for my nephew's baptism. We had a large group (9 adults, 2 small children) and the space was able to accommodate all of us. All in all the space is in good condition and a good alternative if you're not a fan of hotels. Sam was very easy to communicate and answered all of my questions ahead of time.
The only tip I have to share is that if you're a light sleeper I recommend using one of the upstairs bedrooms. One person in our party had a hard time falling asleep in a basement bedroom because of the noise from the upstairs pipes.
Thanks again to Sam for giving our family a place in Worthington!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Overall our stay was great. We would certainly stay again. It was wonderful for our family. Overall it was clean, comfortable and as advertised.
There is only two things I would note 1) the fridge was really dirty inside with lots of left over stuff. Especially during Covid this was a little strange. 2) the feeling that you are being constantly watched on the video out back is also a little strange feeling when relaxing with friends and family."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great and very helpful!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my second two-week visit at Sam’s house this year. Worthington is a truly wonderful little town, and this house has absolutely everything needed for a peaceful, restful stay. Sam has obviously put a lot of work and time into making this a top-notch Airbnb stay. I have stayed at Airbnb rentals all over the county, and this my favorite place. Very highly recommended- you will not be disappointed."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I had a great stay at Sam's place! The place has all the amenities you need and is super spacious. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. He responds so quickly and that is definitely appreciated. He also went above and beyond for me. I wrote to him before booking and asked if he had a crib since I would be traveling with my 11 month old daughter and since he didn't he bought a pack n play so I wouldn't have to travel with one! I will definitely stay at his place again when I go back to Worthington.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not a single complaint! The house looked brand new. Great location, came into town for work, had a 26 foot gooseneck trailer on a long bed truck and the parking was still comfortable. Giant TV and comfortable couches. Thank you for the hospitality, Sam!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was amazing and had everything my group needed. We did not expect how luxurious the place felt! Soft bedding, soft carpet, a huge TV - it was surely 5-star lodgings for a group of vacationing college students. All that plus a 5 minute walk from the lake! We had a great time and Sam was a great host."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice cozy place ,a walking distance from okabena lake . The house was nice and clean and easily accommodated about 10-12 of us . The only downside is a smallish kitchen , but overall a wonderful place ."

,,,very easy to find as described. very very peacefull and relaxing. 5 star since i wrote this i have had a terrible experence with a host or clean people saying i was only suppose to be there two days. they say thats what air bnb says he wS very rude i wont be back
,,,"We spent less than 15 minutes there. Terrible odor the minute you open the door. Pictures online had to be taken many years ago. Upstairs kitchen was grimy. Downstairs kitchen had stove that didn’t work and MW still in the packaging sitting on the counter and part of the sink. House is in poor condition inside and out. Location is fine, but neighbors should be angry about the situation. We were in town for our son’s wedding and had to scramble at the last minute to find different accommodations for six adults and two babies."
,,,"This was one of the worst experiences we have ever had staying in an Airbnb. The only good thing about this property was the location. The first night we were there the upstairs toilet clogged and we could not unclog it using the plunger. The next morning we contacted the host hoping for a resolution. Sam’s (the host) first comment was it worked fine when the maids were cleaning just prior to our arrival…keeping plunging it. We did as asked but it remained clogged. Once again we notified Sam and he said he couldn't get someone out to fix it anytime soon. He told us just to use the downstairs basement toilet. We never heard from Sam again regarding this issue which was very disappointing. Having only one toilet for 8 guests was not acceptable. To make things worse we have a handicap son who could not navigate the steps on his own. Both my Wife and I had to assist in getting him downstairs to use the bathroom. The host clearly did not care about our experience. He obviously does not live near the location nor have anybody close to handle any issues that may arise during your stay.
There were three other issues with the house:
1. The refrigerator and kitchen cabinets were full of used food items from previous guests-it was just plain gross!
2. There was used personal hygiene products left in the bathroom under the sink.
3. The air conditioning never worked properly between the two levels of the house. It was hot upstairs and cold downstairs.
In good conscience we cannot recommend this house to anyone."
