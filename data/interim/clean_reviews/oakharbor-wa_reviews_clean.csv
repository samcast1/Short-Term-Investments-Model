2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was awesome, would come again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was looking for peace and quiet and that's exactly what I got. Nancy was extremely communicative, and I had no issues at all during my stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy was great. Always responsive and with good recommendations and information about the area. The apartment was clean and comfortable. A short walk in to town or down to the water. Took a drive to Ebey State park for a nice hike along the bluff. Very enjoyable stay.
Thanks, Matt & Vicky"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, simple, well-equipped apartment with a view of the water and easy access to Pioneer St. Nancy and her co-host Michelle were both very responsive to the couple minor issues that came up during the stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly special Airbnb where you get your money's worth (in an extremely quaint and picturesque location) with all the amenities in and outside the airbnb you could ask for. Nancy really knows what she is doing as a host, both in her response time to questions and all the fun items and messages and gifts she left inside the home that improved our stay.
The one thing someone should know- and this is no fault of the host - is the thinness of the walls! Depending on who is staying in the other airbnb above this one, you might be able to hear your neighbors' steps and conversations. Fortunately, when this was a problem, the hosts worked their magic to fix the situation.
Would highly recommend this airbnb to someone who wants to experience relaxed island community life in Oak Harbor."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nancy was the ultimate host. Her and her team made our stay amazing. She gave very clear instructions for the unit. She communicated clearly and quickly! I would highly recommend staying at her place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sure was a great location! Steps away from a beautiful water front, coffee, with an adorable downtown. The apartment was cozy, clean and very affordable for our last minute travel.
Thank you Nancy for making our stay a pleasure. Call me if you decide to sell!! I hope to come back. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my time there. The only thing was the time went by too fast and it was time to leave. This place makes you feel so comfortable and safe. I will be recommending Nancy's place to anyone that wants to visit Oak Harbor Wa
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Fee was fare cleaning taste not so!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nancy was very helpful and answered all my questions. Her place was very comfy and would recommend this place. Look forward to staying here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great time and very cozy.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and communication! We‚Äôll be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nancy was extremely responsive, friendly, and helpful throughout our stay! Location is great. We were able to walk to downtown Oak Harbor shops, get coffee, and walk to the seaside parks."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This by far was the cutest most comfortable space, I loved everything about it, the beds were the best most comfortable just like at home, every time I visit this will be my go to spot! Thank you Nancy !"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying here.. super clean and wonderful for us all who stayed. So close to everything and was very comfortable. Thank you for our beautiful stay, we enjoyed it immensely.
Marci"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved stopping at Nancy‚Äôs place in oak harbor. The house was perfect for our family. The view was beautiful and it‚Äôs close to lots of things.
2023-08-01,2,Stayed about a week,"I can‚Äôt believe this place got rated so high. Where to start‚Ä¶..the building was built in the 60s and hasn‚Äôt been updated at ALL on the inside. The unit is on the bottom floor and you can hear EVERYTHING around you. We could even smell when the neighbors were smoking pot because somehow it got into our place strong enough to give me a headache. There is no dishwasher. We blew a fuse heating something up in the microwave. The laundry room is in the adjacent room off the unit and communal so everyone can use it for a fee‚Ä¶ which to me seems ridiculous for the price of this place. We actually cleaned the place ourselves with Lysol and wipes because surfaces were visibly dirty. I have never been so surprised to walk in an AirBnB like this based on the ratings. On a positive note, the owner was very nice and responsive immediately to messages. The people around us seemed nice and it is in central oak harbor. They did get brand new mattresses which were very comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a girls weekend at Nancy‚Äôs place and it was wonderful! We would stay here again for sure. :)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay - close to the water and downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This cozy little place is dated, but really cozy. The beds were so comfortable and the unit is in a quiet, safe neighborhood. I spent most of my time by the front window enjoying the ocean view, resident flock of pigeons, and shared my front yard with many deer. I especially loved to walk the Harbor trail daily, as it is just a few steps from the rental. Amazing location!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nancy was an awesome host. We had to stay longer and lucky Nancy was able to accommodate us. She always was very responsive on any of our needs. You could truly tell she cares about her guests and their comfort.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nancy was a wonderful hostess- happy with the location and quality of service !
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was such a wonderful gem. Even traveling with a pretty big group and 1 bathroom, we felt like it was spacious enough to have our own space and still hang out. Also being able to walk by the water is incredible!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,we have relaxing time with our family!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nancy‚Äôs cottage location is best for what I came to Whidbey Island for. It‚Äôs very walkable to the venue of my 5K run at the Windjammer Park. My parents and I also enjoyed the water view from the front window and strolling along by the water. The cottage has a very homey feel with all the small warm touches Nancy had placed in the home. Everything we needed was in the home. Nancy is a super host and we appreciate her warm-hearted attitude. We‚Äôd love to come back and stay at her place when we go back to Oak Harbor.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space. Second stay with this host and my second experience was just as great as the first.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Throughly enjoyed our stay‚Ä¶ loved everything about the place especially the going out and enjoying the ocean view!! Nancy is an amazing super host!! Highly recommend her and her cottages!!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,we really enjoyed our stay at Nancys property!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great and as depicted in the listing. The beds are so comfortable, and it‚Äôs a pretty good sized unit. The kiddos upstairs were a little loud, but that‚Äôs kinda expected for a Friday night. There are two parking spots available and easy getting in and out. Highly recommend"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and cozy place.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love this place! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉ
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love love love this place
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great value, excellent communication with owner, a location that is very walkable to shops, coffee and close to the water."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location for getting around the island, particularly Deception Pass, and with a bit of a view of the water. Everything easy and comfortable, kitchen well-equipped. Nancy was a great communicator and we were tickled by the wine and chocolate. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and good value. The waterfront view was pretty and the home was conveniently close to town. Had a great time here and would recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and the communication with Nancy was fantastic. Directions were very detailed and helpful and the cottage was a perfect place rest your head for the night! Highly recommend!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Apartment perfectly located between the major sites of Whidbey Island. we used it for a girl's getaway and three adult women were very comfy with all the space. Loved being able to walk to the boardwalk and waterfront park and it was an easy jaunt from there to the Pacific Northwest School of Art where we took a class. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Nancy‚Äôs communication was clear, detailed, and friendly. A lot of effort has gone into the d√©cor to make the place charming, and to make the space welcoming.
See the photo out the living room window with two chairs for the view from the property. :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Home was very cozy and clean. Best part was location. Just a very short walk to beautiful downtown Oak Harbor. Wonderful and friendly town.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Modest 60-70s something apartment infused with charm by host. Host goes above and beyond to educate the guest on the apartment‚Äôs amenities and local attractions. Little notes around the pad invites the guest to unwind and reminds guests of their responsibilities. Some of the notes are outdated as the host‚Äôs emails communicate slightly different information. Neighbors within the 4-plex are reasonably quiet but curious. If you don‚Äôt need the second parking space, someone in the community will. The flat is clean and comfortable. A good location for those who enjoy strolls along the bay and around the historic downtown area. On Whidbey Island, everything accessible is within minutes."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and spacious apartment. Easy to find and walking distance to everything!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we were expecting. Calm and relaxed, quite, plenty of beaches to explore"
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Great location. Clean. Cute accommodation.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place. Very convenient to town, the marina and a block from the water"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 3 had a great stay at Nancy‚Äôs cottage! The home itself is incredibly cozy and Nancy thought of so many special extra touches, including a welcome bar of chocolate and bottle of wine! The location couldn‚Äôt have been better, as well- walking distance to town and Windjammer park and only a 5-10 minute drive to anything else you could possibly want to do in Oak Harbor. Highly recommend Nancy‚Äôs cottage!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy's place is cute and quaint, and we had everything we needed. We spent a lot of time on the swivel chairs in front of the big window overlooking the sound. The neighborhood is great with a few sweet restaurants and shops... we hadn't planned on spending as much time there as we did, oops."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nancy‚Äôs place is cute and cozy. You can walk to shops and restaurants. She was good with communication and able to make sure everything was right promptly.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place to stay near the water.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay when exploring the area.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice and clean with a water view. Situated in Whidbey commercial town, so pack light. Windjammer park is walkable. Try mussels at Frasers Gourmet Hideaway if you‚Äôd like. Host welcomes with plenty of chocolates. No washer/dryer and toiletries refill though."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A great little place to stay to relax and have some dinner while touring the area. Was just as advertised and Nancy is very communicative and a great hostess! :)
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nancy is a very gracious host! The property is in a great location, very clean and well stocked! Plus the beds are super comfy! You won't be disappointed!"
2022-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I was excited to stay here but the excitement died very quickly. The place is very cute, clean and organized. I especially loved the beach theme and colors of the bedrooms. However, there was a locked door near the bathroom that sounded like it could‚Äôve been a laundry room and from the minute I entered there was so much noise coming through from that door. It sounded like whoever was in there was just throwing things around and smashing doors or something. The people above me were very loud too. They were stomping around all day and night and I could hear their conversations through the ceiling. It was so loud that my friend that I was on the phone with could hear it too. I did not sleep well here, frankly I didn‚Äôt sleep. I know every place has its quirks but loud neighbours aren‚Äôt a quirk it‚Äôs a problem."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable with lots of little thoughtful touches like helpful instructional notes and guest-friendly amenities which made this a great stay. Location is easy to find and central - you can see the water as you sip your coffee and walk to the Main Street and windjammer park easily. Check-in was smooth and Nancy was highly communicative. Would recommend to family and friends."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy was a fantastic host! The space is as described. She was generous in the amenities she provided and even has spices, canned soup, and snacks (includes wine and chocolate). She also provides a catalog of restaurants and things to do in the area. She does have some housekeeping requirements at the end of the stay which is posted on the door and is communicated through her messages. However, these are easy to perform. Overall, Nancy is a very thoughtful host and ensures that you are provided for."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a little gem in Oak Harbor! We had a wonderful weekend stay and enjoyed several walks into the heart of the town. There are so many cute little shops just minutes away, highly recommend the Purple Bird! The beach is just a short walk away and the apartment provides a beautiful view from all the front windows.
Nancy was a wonderful host, she communicated so well and went above and beyond to have the place ready for my mom who deals with many allergens. It was so sweet of her. The apartment building is older but don‚Äôt let that fool you, the inside decor is beautiful with bright colors and a wonderful beach theme. It was very welcoming and cozy, we would love to return again!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Nancy was really understanding of my circumstances. She made me feel special. I appreciate her communicating with me before, during, and after my stay."

A very nice surprise ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Collin cottage upstairs apartment was Cody and cozy, had such a warm welcoming atmosphere. The view of the water was great and only a block away .

2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nothing fancy but very clean, comfortable accomodations. Short, easy walking distance to water / downtown shopping streets. Very good pre-visit communications and easy/friendly on-site instructions. We couldn't get the TV to show us local channels but that wasn't important to us so we didn't spend any time troubleshooting or asking for help. Not an issue on this one-night stay."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I had a great time at Nancy‚Äôs place. It was really easy to find and a comfortable place to spend the night before exploring Coupeville and Deception Pass. The restaurants in Oak Harbor close a little early though (around 8pm) so make sure you figure out dinner ahead of time!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We wanted to stay on the SanJuan Islands but couldn'tfind any affordableoptions. This place popped up for Oak Harbor which was about 25 minutes from the Ferry. It had a nice little view of the harbor and it was homey and clean. our hostess left us chocolate andwine to celebrate with as well! we really enjoyedour stay.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful 2 day stay at Nancy‚Äôs property. Nancy is a great host and provided all information we needed. Communication is high and she is very responsive.

2021-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Pretty disappointed in this stay. A bit of a view. Furniture is very old and dated. Decor is plastic with a lot of useless stuff everywhere. Painted cement block walls, really scarred up cabinets. Dated appliances, bathroom badly in need of updating. No restaurants or bars in walking distance."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy‚Äôs home was so perfect for my stay with my good friend at Whidbey Island. From the moment you walk in the door you just know it will be an amazing trip‚Äî she has gone above and beyond in making the home so beautiful, but also added in so many thoughtful touches to make things convenient. She even left us a bottle of wine and chocolates! Just by being there you can sense the genuine love that went into making the stay as comfortable and nice as possible. Her home is also very clean and has everything you need. Highly recommend staying at Nancy‚Äôs!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little 2 bedroom apartment in a quad-plex was really nice. The kitchen had all the pots, pans, etc. that you could want for an extended stay to do your own cooking. It's a short walk to the beach and a short drive to a bunch of cool places on the island."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Oak harbor is a very quiet neighborhood. The bedding was very comfortable and there is a nice view of the harbor from the big front windows. If you like lots of trinkets around the house to make you feel at home, this is the place for you. The unit is rather old, but it worked out fine. Nancy is a pleasure to work with!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"The stay was nice. The location was great. Everything was nearby. There were gift shops and a coffee shop just down the street and a great view of the water.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an awesome place to stay! The view, the comfort, the cleansiliness, unbelievable. Definitely a place I would come back to again. It's a fantastic place with room and comfort. Plus, looking outside you can see the ocean in the distance so enjoying coffee in front of the window is a must. Our host was incredibly kind and communicated quickly. 5 stars!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend in Whidbey staying at Nancy‚Äôs place. It was as described and a close walk into town as well as right by the water. We appreciated the detailed information and personal touches from Nancy!
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"This unit is very true to the pictures. The host is beyond kind, thoughtful, accommodating and personable. My communication with Nancy gave me great anticipation and happiness! I loved that we were so close to the water and had a partial view. There is a large grassy area in front of the unit which would be really nice for any summer sports like badminton or croquetThe only things that were less than desired was that the unit above us has a metal roof over the veranda which clangs and bangs incessantly when the wind blows so in the winter months it's difficult to sleep. Although we were there on NYE when there was pretty strong winds so it is likely not like that most months of the year."
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,if you want to bake bring a thermometer as the oven is out dates and hard to get the correct temp. the rest of it was amazing.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location to downtown Oak Harbor.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy provides a true gem, an adorable getaway. Beautifully decorated with specialized touches from the local area. This is a great place for a quiet, cozy, intimate and relaxing get away. Our family enjoyed a beautiful Thanksgiving time here."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderfully-decorated space with very easy access to downtown Oak Harbor. Amazingly responsive host.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy's place is amazing! It is so peaceful and cozy and just a two block walk to the Oak Harbor historic downtown. It was nice to be able to walk to a coffee shop and restaurants for dinner. I spent a lot of my weekend sitting in the armchair by the big window looking out to the sound and drinking coffee/wine. I explored the area by car as well and highly recommend a day trip to Coupeville, just a 20 minute drive away. I will definitely stay at Nancy's place next time I'm in town as well!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an enjoyable stay we had and what a lovely host Nancy is!
The photos and description are pretty accurate. When arriving you see a early 60's two story, four unit apartment building. The outside is nondescript but Nancy's special touch of a garden bench with pillows and some plants make it welcoming walk to the front door. And that bench was used! Our mornings were sunny and a couple times my husband was found sitting there drinking in the harbor air along with his coffee!
Inside the unit the decor was welcoming and the amount of space was perfect for our needs. Our favorite spot was indeed in the two comfy chairs looking out the windows to the Harbor. I anticipated more of a ""peek-a-boo"" view of the water and was pleased that it was so much more than that. Can't tell you how many cups of coffee we had sitting in those chairs! The kitchen (whole apartment, really) had everything we needed. Speaking of coffee... if I could change anything, it would be to trade in the single cup Keurig coffee maker for a full blown coffee pot (though I loved that it had a refillable K-cup that we could fill with our own coffee). We are heavy coffee drinkers so having a full pot makes sense for us. I know this boils down to personal preference and if that's the worst thing I can say, it's all good!
This apartment met our expectations and provided everything we needed and wanted for a truly comfortable stay. Nancy has it warmly decorated for a homey feel and that she welcomes you with a bottle of wine and a chocolate bar was a special touch. That it was within walking distance to town was the cherry on top!
Nancy, that you for being so communicative, a fantastic host, and for a wonderful stay!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the most wonderful and kindest host we have had the pleasure of experiencing! :3

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nancy was extremely communicative! The pictures of this place are accurate, and location is great - an easy walk to the Main Street and good access to the rest the island has to offer. The first day we walked via smith park to flintstone park and then Windjhammer park, back on pioneer way to pick up take out on the way home. Perfection! On the days it rained we enjoyed returning and turning on the fireplace heater to warm up. We traveled with our toddler and baby (with a pack and play) - set up kiddos in the back room - enough space for the pack and play and left the front of the place for us without worrying too much about noise. A great set up for a family!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nancy‚Äôs place is great for being central in Oak Harbor. You can easily walk to the park and area with all the restaurants. It‚Äôs a short drive to Coupeville.

Getting to her place was easy, directions she give were thorough making it easy to get there. We had some issues with the door lock but she was quick to respond.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nancy was very responsive and helpful. The apartment was clean and had some lovely extra touches like a bottle of wine and bar of chocolate when we arrived. There were also bottles of wine for sale over the fridge which I thought was a neat idea. We have small children and I asked if there were any plastic cups/plates to see if we needed to pack any, and Nancy went by and dropped off a couple to make our visit easier.
We arrived after dark and were pleasantly surprised to see glimpses of the water from the front windows. Our kids loved watching all the birds while eating breakfast, and it was an easy walk (for adults) into Oak Harbor. Whidbey Coffee is only a couple blocks away too, which was convenient.
Just a not for those with young kids, there were a LOT of small trinkets, jars of rocks and shells, and other decorations that you may need to move out of inquisitive hands :) It is one level so no concerns with stairs, and accurately listed as kid friendly but not babyproofed.
We had a great time during our short stay!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, nice host, beautiful location!"
2019-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Great location; the host was a great communicator. Despite the cleaning fee charged, the host wanted the sheets stripped and garbage left by front door by her guests. We usually do this without being told."

My children enjoyed walking down Pioneer and truly enjoyed Netflix at night ha ha. Beds were comfortable and kitchen equipped with everything I needed to cook or just to make coffee. I want to point out that Nancy made sure to have organic products at the house. If you are looking for someone thoughtful, Nancy is your Gal."

The home is set up perfectly for guests with all the regular amenities and extras such as fans, coffee maker, toaster, hair dryer, washer/dryer, extra bedding and pillows, picnic table, grill, smart tv, board games, books and so much more! It is obvious that Dan and Hollis take great pride in this serene property and care about their guests. We will be back!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough good about this experience. It is in a nice, quiet location. It was very clean and had nice amenities.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Daniel‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay! We opened the door to find a beautifully lit and decorated Christmas tree! The heat had been turned up for our arrival, and he and Hollis left a complementary bottle of wine and a personalized card welcoming us.
The space was well laid out and had everything that we needed, including extra coffee, tea and condiments in case we needed to cook.
We found the master bedroom bed very comfortable. I appreciated that there were spare blankets in the closet, but we didn‚Äôt need them. Our friends commented that their other beds were also very nice.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much. When we reached out, Dan agreed to a late check out, and we had a nice chat with him outside his garage before we departed. Thank you Dan and Hollis for your hospitality!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far one of the best airbnbs we‚Äôve ever stayed at. It was absolutely immaculate.

We had mentioned we were coming to spend Thanksgiving w/our son who is stationed there in the Navy and upon arrival found a very sweet Navy-themed welcome card, bottle of wine and a turkey roasting pan. How sweet! We hosted a nice meal there with my son and his Navy friends and had everything we needed. We were also able to do easy Walmart online grocery delivery orders to the house which saved us so much time. The area is beautiful, peaceful and safe. It was fun meeting Dan and learning the history of them obtaining this property. They take so much pride in it and it shows. Our son will be there for 3 more years and we will chose this home for all of our future visits. We felt right at home."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time renting an AirBnB and it was very relaxing. The space was perfect for our family and rambunctious kids. We didn't know that the property utilized well water which wasn't a problem, just unexpected.
We forsee coming back here when we visit our relatives again üôÇ"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay at Daniel‚Äôs place. He provided everything one would need while on vacation, kitchen was well stocked with staples, and everything was as described. Location was close to both Coupeville and Oak Harbor. Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place! The pictures don‚Äôt do the place any justice. Really really beautiful unit that is suitable for any length of stay. Really peaceful neighborhood. The hosts are superb and friendly. You couldn‚Äôt ask for better hosts. Will definitely stay here again if we get the chance. Thank you Daniel and Hollis!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet area - enjoyed hearing/watching birds and animals, not so much the jets but tolerable. The yard and flowers were beautiful. The house was perfect for the four of us. Very well kept up - very clean and comfortable. You could tell Dan takes great pride in being a Super host. We enjoyed our three day stay and would definitely choose Briarwood again if the occasion presents itself. Highly recommend to others."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved our stay. Very comfortable
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was a great place. Great price and an incredible home. Beautiful, quiet surrounding. Lots of kitchen equipment to cook at the house. Picturesque setting. Lots of wildlife around. A memorable one for the little ones. Family friendly. Great board games. Beds were comfortable."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely a great Airbnb experience! Hosts were quick to respond, had easy to understand check in instructions and the home had high quality essentials.
The location was peaceful and great place to relax while listening to local birds as well as peacocks. Quick 15 min drive to town if we needed anything and there was even Walmart!
I would highly recommend this rental to anyone. Can‚Äôt say enough of the home, hosts or Whidbey Island."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Daniel‚Äôs place was exactly what we needed for our trip to Whidbey to visit family on the island.
The home was clean and comfortable, the surroundings were beautiful, check-in was easy. They left us a kind note and had provided us with some fresh breakfast staples since we got in late that night. It was so helpful and delicious! I got to meet Daniel as he sometimes comes to work on the property, and he was very friendly. He messaged us to explain when the island‚Äôs internet service went down. It was great experience staying at this location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The sweet 3 bedroom fit our girls weekend perfectly. We had a great quiet, relaxing weekend. The house was clean and free of clutter. Would likely stay at this Oak Harbor home again."

The home is located on a quiet street and was very peaceful. Thank you so much Dan and Hollis, looking forward to staying here again for our next visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Daniel & Hollis were excellent hosts. We loved the spaciousness and quiet as well as the welcoming gift and personalized greeting card. Very clean, cozy and comfortable home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was our second stay at Daniel‚Äôs place and likely not our last. Everything was as advertised. We felt at home in the peaceful and quiet surroundings. Only minutes from Oak Harbor and Coupeville provided more than sufficient shopping and dining opportunities. Presently there is no cable but the Wi-Fi was more than up to the task of feeding the ROKU stick we carry for such situations. We highly recommend Quiet Briarwood and are looking forward to our next stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing service! They were so sweet and helpful! 10/10!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was THE Best Airbnb I have ever been at, well organized, lots of treats (Make up remover, shampoo, Condicioner, body lotion). Kitchen well set with all equipment. Nice beds, nice towewn and linners.
The treatment from the begginig was impecable, the house is nice, cozy, warm, the enviroment quiet, calm and relaxing.
I hope one day to come back and explore more the city.
Thanks Daniel."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,home was very comfortable. would rent again!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We came from the east coast to visit relatives for a week and Daniel‚Äôs Airbnb provided a well maintained and exceptionally clean accommodation in a quite rural setting close to town of Oak Harbor where our relatives reside. We had a great experience.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Would highly recommend.

The area is so peaceful loved going out to the yard and seeing the wild life . Everything I needed was close to the airbnd ."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We we slighltly concerned that this was a new listing- would they have the house well equipped and set up? Needless worry! We arrived at a newly renovated house with carefully considered amenities.This home is well decorated and cozy, with every comfort considered. The linens (towels, sheets, etc) were all extremely well chosen and luxurious. Time and again, when we had a need, we found that item at hand. When we had even minor requests (needed a lightbulb replaced, or a question), our hosts were VERY quick and responsive in all communications and actions. We enjoyed a tour of Dan's garage and car work, and Dan had several helpful suggestions about local touring. The neighborhood was very quiet, especially at night. This is an outstanding property, and Dan and Hollis are delightful hosts!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hollis and Daniel's Airbnb is a newly remodeled home. You feel at home in it's airy kitchen, it's comfortable couches, and it's large master bedroom. It's all new.
It's sometimes difficult to leave the couch and enjoy the privacy of the yard, (it's surrounded by trees) or go to Coupeville or Oak Harbor to pick up groceries.
Coupeville has Ebey's Landing if you like to hike or walk along the beach, and watch the eagles. I also like walking along the wharf.
When you arrive you will find that Hollis and Daniel have provided you with a notebook that will help you get to know the house, and the surrounding area. If you have questions, they respond quickly, and kindly.
I've given them the highest ratings because they deserve it! Meg"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Back for my third time! Such a great location, the house is small but she packs a punch for being right on the water. Always clean, has all the amenities you need and it‚Äôs always so relaxing to be there. Always feel right at home here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are repeat visitors to Tasha‚Äôs amazing place in oak harbor. We love spending our days watching the bald eagles go about their business, walks on the beach and stunning sunsets. This Airbnb is a little slice of paradise!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at this air bnb and it's such a great place to stay with our dogs every time. It's quiet, private and easy access to a dog-friendly state park right next door. The house is comfortable, clean and spacious."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot on the water.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tasha's place was beautiful and just what my family needed for a wonderful getaway. Very pet friendly and comfortable. We loved our stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love staying at Tasha's place! this was our second time and every bit as beautiful and peaceful as the first. we saw eagles at the state park every day, enjoyed watching a storm roll in and even got to visit Musselfest in Coopeville! Thank you for another wonderful visit! I'm sure we'll be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha has a perfect home for a relaxing vacation . The home was spotless, the beds were very comfortable and had everything you could need for a perfect stay. The homes location with the Salish Sea just out the back door made it easy for early morning walks. With Sea birds flying by every couple mins and even a bald eagle sitting on the driftwood just out the door. I would absolutely stay at Tasha's home again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha's place is exactly what it looks like in the photos. The cozy, clean cottage is set right on the water with a walkable beach. Every amenity was provided. Entrance instructions were clear, and Tasha was very responsive. Can't wait to return!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely perfect family reunion type vacation! Absolutely loved the indoor decor. Love all the sea life and colors. The dining room bar on the ocean side of the living room was just what the doctor ordered for our meals and snacks. Took lots of walks and experienced two bald eagles several days on the beach. The beach house had every amenity anyone could ever ask for even included things that we never even thought of. Having binoculars to view sea life was super cool. Love the big Joe giant beanbag. Looking forward to coming back very soon. Thank you for a wonderful place to stay!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs rare a place exceeds my hopes and expectations, but this place did. Very comfy, had everything you‚Äôd need and was perfect for my dog. Having the state park was such a treat. Never even ventured into town as we were all content where we were. 4 adults , a baby and a dog fit great.
I may have missed it but noticed in photos there wasn‚Äôt a table so I brought one. Turns out they did have a table and chairs you could use. I must have just missed it. Def want to come back someday."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so lovely, any time of the year. Even when the beach is not walkable, the view is mesmerizing. We also enjoy this location for an easy day trip drive to Anacortes for better shopping and dining than Oak Harbor. I appreciate the new cook ware, quality towels and the rolling driveway gate."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked last minute and Tasha was responsive and helpful. Had a lovely little getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had such a wonderful stay! Right on the water - beautiful views and easy access to beach walks. The house is cozy and has so many thoughtful touches to make it a comfortable stay. I would love to stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time being only a few feet from the water! Close proximity next time I book I‚Äôll bring a fishing pole!
Really appreciate the yard and Dog catering‚Ä¶ they are family and you showed it to be that way :)
Quaint, Quiet. A bit windy but storms are part of nature (the house did great in the winds) Loved the wood countertop/beach overview.
Thanks for a great place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Delightful home and beautiful views/beach access. The proximity to beach and forested walks was perfect. Thank you for sharing this gem!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time. Amazing views and very peaceful and relaxing. Close to the parks and restaurants of oak harbor.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place in a great location.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was spotless. They say dogs are welcome (we don‚Äôt have one) and we didn‚Äôt see ANY dog hair or wear and tear from them. It‚Äôs not over decorated as some ‚Äòbeach‚Äô places are. Very tasteful and sophisticated. Kitchen is small and was all we needed. New knives/utensils. Nothing fancy, but clean. Plenty of cookware. Pictures show what is actually there. Next to a state park with a wonderful walking beach adjacent. There is some slight local traffic, but it didn‚Äôt bother us. Will definitely come again. Did I mention how clean it was?"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I took my mom here for her birthday and she could not stop talking about how perfect the place was. Waking up to the sea and falling asleep to the sound of ocean waves is something that can‚Äôt be beat. The place was very clean for a dog friendly home and our two dogs loved running on the beach. We will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This house is in a prime location, with beautiful views and a lovely beach to walk, right out your door. It's small but well equipped, and the beds are super comfortable. We had to make use of the space heaters as it was chilly and the few baseboard heaters don't cut it. It took many hours to get the rooms up to 70 degrees, but with everything running, it got there. Our biggest complaint was the bathroom. The tub is in serious disrepair, with a peeling finish. They put a rubber mat over it to hide it, but in doing so, also neglected to clean under it. It was really gross. Luckily, I was able to find cleaning supplies and sterilize everything before using the tub, but with a $120 cleaning fee, it was very disappointing. The bathroom mats, including one in front of the toilet, also were dirty and covered in hairs. I washed these as well. We did enjoy our stay, watched movies every night and played Bonk, and enjoyed breakfast at the bar every morning. It's a lovely destination!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! This is a must book. Stop looking and jump at this listing
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tasha's place was just as described a very warm and relaxing house. We loved the location, and everything was clean and inviting."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our second stay and we know we will be back. Fantastic get away.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful shoreside home with walkable beach. Drivable distance to Oak Harbor for supplies, Deception pass for views, and numerous running trails for my XC athlete!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stunningly perfect in so many ways! The inside decor was fabulous with such a lovely beach vibe! The weather matched the beauty of this home, we could not have found a more perfect place! The sunsets were gorgeous and our yellow lab, Ruby had the best time! This place lacks nothing!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the best AirBnB we have ever stayed in with dogs! Can't go wrong staying here.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our second stay at Tasha‚Äôs and we‚Äôll be back! We love the house, the yard, and the convenience of the beach right outside your back door!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modest and comfortable, quiet beachfront. Has all the amenities needed for an enjoyable stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"so beautiful, quiet and peaceful"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is maybe our 6th time back at Tasha‚Äôs place‚Ä¶ we love it ! She‚Äôs so accommodating and when I had one issue with the lock she responded right away. Thank you Tasha!! We will be back
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here! Youre right on the beach so that can‚Äôt be beat. Waking up to the smell of low tide and salt air. Home has everything you need!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing little house with great views of the ocean. You basically right on the beach, open the back door and here is the ocean. You can walk on a sandy beach, listen to waves all the time.
The house itself is so beautifully designed, like a real interior designer designed it.
Everything is color coordinated."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,4th time staying here. Outstanding thru and thru.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love this place...clean, close to activities, and right on the ocean! Wildlife is everywhere. The house is comfortable-my kids always have fun with the big Joe bean bag, beds are comfy, good tv options for night....I could go on."

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,this place was better than expected. beautiful ocean views. right on the ocean. right by state park. everything we needed to cook and live there:well equipped. the house was beautifully decorated and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a wonderful 4 days with our 6 year old grandson. He loved sitting at the bar looking at the ocean for our meals. Took him to Fort Casey, lake Cranberry, the splash park and Deception Pass. The location was amazing. The only draw back was the beach in front of the house was difficult to get to due to the rocks out to the sand bar covered with moss/ seaweed during low tide. We loved listening to the waves at night though, and we went to other beaches so he could play in the sand. Great place!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place!!! We had such a great time here with our dog. The place was sooo dog friendly!! The view was amazing and the entire cabin was decorated so nicely. I would love to come back!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely lovely stay at the beach house with our family of four. It is charmingly decorated and has amazing views of the water from the yard seating areas, living room and master bedroom! We enjoyed the many outdoor activities available on the island and watched the sunsets from the patio every night. The house was very clean & comfortable and it is stocked with everything you need to be comfortable and enjoy an island stay. We didn‚Äôt want to leave and would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tasha‚Äôs home is located right on the water. It was so relaxing to spend time on the deck and to fall asleep to the waves crashing. The house was clean and had everything that we needed. Looking forward to coming back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our 4th stay at this house and we'll be booking again for next year.
The place is well set up for our dog, who loves the yard and being able to watch the water.
We like the layout of the house, deck, and firepit area. It really feels like being on vacation and the water right there is hard to beat.
You're close to town for groceries, and close to tons of recreation areas for hiking.
Strong WiFi for remote work."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Tasha‚Äôs beach home for the weekend! Such a peaceful getaway sitting on the deck and taking walks down the beach. Appreciated the pet friendly touches and comfy bed! The campfire and string lights made for a perfect way to extend the evening.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect beach cabin! My family loved this space! Soothing high tide waves and a sandy beach at low tide beyond the rocks provided hours of entertainment finding shells, star fish and sea anemones. The home had everything needed to make a meal. We enjoyed the sunsets by the fire pit too"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our third time staying at Tasha‚Äôs lovely oak harbor beachfront property and we keep coming back for more! Spent 3 nights watching the tides come and go, walking on the beach, watching amazing seabirds and bald eagles and even saw a seal! It‚Äôs a fantastic home with all the comforts one needs in a mind-blowing location!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great house.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved our stay! Extremely cozy cabin and comfortable for both the humans & dogs. You can‚Äôt find a better position on the beach and the sunsets were absolutely gorgeous! We can‚Äôt wait to come back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views! Was incredible sitting inside at the bar looking out and on the deck watching the Salish Sea. Cozy and clean. Be aware you are by the road which has some noise, but open the back windows and you can't hear it, only the sea. Was a wonderful place and would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Tasha for giving us a place to visit and feel like we were at home yet with a beautiful ocean view. We were so relaxed, just what we wanted! Our son came for a visit and bbq on the fire pit! We all loved it and hope to come back again.
As an added bonus, you were so accommodating to our dogs, they are missing their run on the beach and chilling on the deck watching birds and people."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was everything we could have wished for. It‚Äôs right on the water, and the cabin had everything you needed, even for doggo occupants! Tasha was very communicative, even when we thought we had left something behind. We made such special memories there and will DEFINITELY be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a perfect place for a weekend get-away! The place is clean, tidy, with comfortable beds and all needed accessories. The view to the ocean is spectacular and you can enjoy the beautiful sunset from the comfort in your room even when the weather is cold outside. It is a beach-front property so access to the private beach is literally just a few steps away! For entertainment, the TV is equipped with guest subscription to Netflix, YouTube, Disney, Hulu, and others. You can even tell Alexa to play your favorite songs on the speakers. The only drawback is you have to wash your dishes the old-fashioned way because the kitchen does not have a dishwasher. But this is a very small inconvenience.
My wife and I would definitely like to come back and stay here again for our future weekend get-away vacation."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed being right on the water. The dog and I went for long walks and the husband got to relax and watch the birds.
We plan to come back with the kids next year!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time during our stay. House was clean and had everything we needed for our weekend there. Location was great and can't wait to stay again when we're in oak harbor.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great experience at Tasha's place. The place was kept well, there was plenty of extra blankets and towels. Kitchen was very much usable. The private beach was pristine. We had a great time. Overall, a very relaxing staycation."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tasha‚Äôs place is nicely decorated and in a really beautiful location.
My whole family felt comfortable during this truly unique beach vacation. I highly recommend this beach house."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Views are beautiful, and the amenities were awesome."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we had a wonderful and relaxing stay. It was comfortable and the views were amazing!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This trip was a gift for my parents. They had an AMAZING time, 10/10!! They were beyond wow'd, not only with the location and view, but also with the decor, the vast array of amenities this place had (everything you could need and then some!), and all of the thoughtful little touches for both human and canine guests. They felt truly comfortable staying here with their dogs. They insist my husband and I simply MUST try staying here for our next Whidbey trip. Thabk you Tasha for knocking my parents' 38th anniversary gift out of the park!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super quiet getaway right on the beach and RIGHT on the park. We were here for our son‚Äôs 6th birthday and he loved it and so did our pups. Thanks so much!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Tasha‚Äôs place. The views are wonderful, you can walk to the state park next door, lots of nature and comfortable. The place was very clean and had everything we needed during our stay. We didn‚Äôt take our dog but I love the special details they have for pets. Our flight was changed and Tasha was very flexible with our stay and check-in/check-out times. Absolutely would recommend staying at her place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"lovely stay, will definitely be returning"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The weather Gods inhibited our visit. an unusual storm with snow, wind and cold limited our activities for 2 of our 3 visit. Being able to stay indoors and enjoy TV was a reward. The interior decor assembled and displayed by Tasha was a story of what we were missing outdoors. It is what you desire in visiting a beach cottage. Communications with Tasha was excellent. She provided clear cut info on check in/out. Also offered restaurants in Oak Harbor forus to dine and enjoy. 4 legged furry canine guests are welcome with dishes, food and bed. The cottage was clean, well maintained, kitchen was adequate in size and was stocked with cooking tools and some ingredients. Due to the weather, we were not able to enjoy the outdoor seating, deck, grill and fire pit. Also there is a beach in front of the cottage and Whidbey State Park is next door offering activities. Excellent location with easy hiway access to Oak Harbor."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described and what you see in the photos. Tasha was very responsive if needed. Beautiful setting and cozy home. Really appreciated the dog related details. Would stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Tasha's place!!! The view is exceptional and the space is so comfortable and inviting. It had everything we needed. My dog may have had the best time of all of us with all the dog-friendly touches and the state park right there! We will be sure to be back to this amazing oasis!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tasha provided perfect directions to her place and easy instructions for opening the door. Everything seemed in place. Loved being so close to the surf! You could pitch a rock underhanded and hit it! Very relaxing. Music with Alexa was fantastic! Adequate parking for 2 vehicles. Kitchen was very well supplied to cook our own meals. Close to town for the forgotten items! Next to Josephy Whidbey State Park and walking trail, beachcombing. We will be back!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Place is comfortable with a great view.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot right on the water. Wonderful place to take the pups. Our dogs loved walking in the park next door and finding dog toys in the Airbnb. Bonus, the human beds are very comfortable! Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another wonderful stay at the beach
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! The house was clean, smelled amazing, and was so wonderfully cozy. We couldn't get enough of the view, and our dog loved the dog toys available! With so many state parks close by, including one literally next door, we had so many trails to walk and so much beach to explore. The restaurant recommendations left by Tasha were amazing as well. We can't wait to go back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the beautiful views and felt like we were in our own private oasis. We were close enough to visit little towns and can‚Äôt wait to return in warmer weather to do some outdoor exploring.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely beautiful location and loved the thoughtful touches inside! We spent our time either on the beach (which is right outside!) or watching the waves from the beautiful windows. We‚Äôre already looking forward to coming back! Our puppy Marco gives the house two paws way up!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing stay for a cozy winter weekend. Super clean, with everything you need. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was our second stay at Tasha's place and it was just as lovely in November as it was in May. Everything in it is clean and useful. Lots of kitchen stuff. Lots of fluffy towels. Comfortable beds. Good central heating but also space heaters for the cooler spots. I'm just sorry we were so busy in town that we didn't have time to use the fire pit or sit outside on the deck!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beach, barbecue, and a park right next door. The perfect place to get away with your dog!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our fifth time back! Our favorite spot on whidbey!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you to Tasha for providing my family an amazing place to vacation. The cabin is beautifully decorated and right on the beach. We had a great time and will be looking to stay again in the future.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite place to stay with our pups. The home is great, the decor is fabulous. It was clean and when I had a question, my phone call was answered. Planning another trip next year!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very special location. Right next to a wonderful strolling beach. This home is steps from the water with a comfortable interior. Feels like a boathouse at high tide. Will book again. Amazing views.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was the perfect get away. Comfy beds and great views. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tons of walking trails and within 15min or less (drive time) to lots of great adventures, food, coffee, views!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great property, location, and host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great little home! Will be back again!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could stare at the nature all day, east and west sides of the house. The marsh across the street has lots of bird watching, listening and frogs. The Salish Sea is endlessly beautiful no matter the weather. The house is cheerful and tidy."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Such a delightful little place! It was great to allow the dogs lots of room to frolic in the fenced yard with the gate. The dog bed and bowl were appreciated. We loved walking the dogs on the beach right from the house. Beds were very comfortable. We had everything we needed; coffee and ice were very appreciated on our arrival. We would always recommend this place.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view is everything! The property was very clean, comfortable bed (only used the primary bedroom so can‚Äôt speak about the comfort of the other beds), and the kitchen is stocked. The yard was great for my pups, but I did have to keep one on a leash at times because the yard is not fully fenced. With that said, I‚Äôm grateful to have found such a fantastic property that allows pets! Grab your groceries before you arrive because once you see the view you won‚Äôt want to leave. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The view is amazing. We rented this space because the yard is fenced. However, it was not fully fenced. My dog could have easily escaped - fortunately, she was afraid of the waves. There is alot of noise and headlights from at night from cars driving past. Right next to this house there is a public parking lot for the state park. We heard people throughout the night. One person let their engine idle and the fumes came into the bedroom - we had to close the window"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect view. Central location to Anacortes, Oak Harbor and Coupeville. Had everything we needed. Would highly recommend and would come back again without hesitation."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING cabin by the beach! We spent a weekend and loved the views! Both the indoors and the outdoors are thoughtfully and tastefully designed. Watched the waves and the sea for hours and had fireside dinner while watching the sunset. We can not wait to be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family of 5 had the most wonderful couple of days at Tasha's. The ocean is literally steps from your door and the view over to the San Juan Islands just magnificent. The yard is mostly fenced and a great spot to hang out/dine. The place has everything you need for a cozy summer or winter holiday. We hope to return!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was a delight to stay at. We loved the view of the ocean. Waking up every morning to the rolling waves was amazing.
We were also surprised how large the property was and the deck that spanned the entire home.
We are very happy we chose Tasha‚Äôs beach houseüòÉ"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is SO GOOD! The location is phenomenal and the view goes on for days. Everything you need inside for a comfy and cozy stay. Loved all of the outdoor seating and the giant adirondack chairs by the beach. Will absolutely be booking again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our third year in a row staying that this home. Fantastic stay thru and thru.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Tashas was great! Plenty of space for us and the outside space was spectacular. We enjoyed the amazing views and loved going down with the kiddos during low tide. Park with a small hike right next door was super convenient! Will definitely stay here again in the future!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love this spot! The home is comfortable, well equipped with everything you need and the views are amazing. We saw so much wildlife! Great location to town as well. This was our second visit and we will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful location. We saw so much wildlife! Eagles eat out of the tide pools every day. A deer brought two fawns down to eat seaweed. Seals and sea otters watched us on the porch as we watched them swimming. The children got to examine a sea star closely in the tide pool. We were very happy and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is located right on the beach. Inside it seemed to us that it was decorated by a professional designer. So beautifull it is.
Outside we enjoyed grilling hotdogs and smores over the firepit. There is plenty of nice outside furniture.
TV has all the apps to watch your favorite show or movie. There are 2 Alexa speakers, too.
There is a Kroger coffee maker and a French coffee press.
There are many sleeping places.
Upfront of the house, we played with our dog safely, because there ia a nice fence.
The view from this house is unbeatable any way you look"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really fun place to stay. Very clean, with a wonderful view that worked great for our family."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our time at this beach house. The residence was clean and comfortable, the state park was within walking distance, and Oak Harbor is only a few minutes drive. And you can't really beat waking up to the sound of the ocean outside your bedroom each morning."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at this wonderful beach cabin. It was all perfect for a much needed vacation. Beds were comfy, kitchen fully equipped, and a special touch with the dog toys, bowls, food. Most cabins do not provide these features. Loved watching Tom Cruise practice flying each day and even saw some otters, sea lions and a pod of Orcas. Tasha is so helpful and we will be back next year.. Only negative-We had to leave."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful simple beach house in a perfect location with epic views. Our family of five was perfectly comfortable. Nice high end details and great hosts. We will return :)
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, beautiful place! Easy communication with host!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great view. Wowza
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a gem! The view is incredible and the house really creatively decorated and thoughtfully appointed.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our 3rd stay at Tasha's place, each time for a week long stay.
We use AirBnB a lot ,and wouldn't have returned if it's not a great spot. The views and location are top notch, the yard is great for our dog, and the interior is well set up. WiFi is strong for remote work.
You're close to great hiking areas, Oak Harbor is a short drive away for essentials or takeout, and you can't get a better waterfront view than this house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Fantastic location right on the beach and next to state park. Minutes away from town. Really well organized and comfortable house.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this adorable house and it‚Äôs perfect location! Great beach and a short drive to town for delicious food, spa, shopping, ect. Definitely one of our favorites!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay. Seeing the waves from the room is a blessing. Department stores are 7 minutes away. It's beautiful even when there is no sun. My dog was amazed by the number of toys left for her.
Check-in was easy with a code.
Tasha is very responsive.
Music and television are available, . But the location is so beautiful you don't have time for that.
I highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect beachside property!! There‚Äôs SO much to do in the area and the view from this property is absolutely stunning. Within only 20 minutes of our arrival we were sitting in the living room watching Humpback Whales swim across the ocean. The house is so cozy (it was difficult parting ways with such a comfy bed). And my one year old LOVED the huge bean bag chair. Definitely would stay with this host again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Tasha's. Great location, convenient to everything we needed. We even saw a whale from the deck!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tasha is a very responsive host and her home on West Beach is a relaxing getaway under 2 hours from Seattle. This was our second time visiting and although we were remote working during our stay, it made a lot easier with the sound of the crashing waves. The house is perfect for a small family. We hope to visit again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right on the beach next to a state park beach. The porch is a great place sit an watch the birds, boats and waves. We found our stay very relaxing. Would recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think this was our 6th time back to Tasha‚Äôs place. It is dreamy, clean, and has everything you need. Tasha is responsive and check in is so easy. We will be back !"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and house.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is awesome. Super dog friendly, very clean, nicely decorated, and right next to the state park. The beds and pillows were comfy. The bar seating by the windows was great, the water is literally right there, and we ate almost all our meals there. Why go out, it‚Äôs the best view- get takeout, or if you want to cook, everything is there for you. The night it was stormy was exciting with the wind and waves, and we liked watching the action. They have a fun collection of games. The outdoor area is great, lots of seating and a nice fire pit area. Such good vibes. One thing to note, this house is close to the Navy airbase, so there is noise from jets and it is also close to the road and a small parking area, so there is road noise. It is quiet at night though, unless it‚Äôs stormy. If you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs just in case. Our family had such a great time here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing location and a super comfortable beach cabin! You can expect all your needs taken care of inside and outside. A beautiful private beach in front and state park next door for your hiking exploration. The view are spectacular no matter the weather.
You will have a wonderful time here.
Anne and Keith, with pups Gertie and Lilli"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sweet spot right on the water - my kids and dog had a blast.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is great! The place was well set-up to host our family of 4 and our dog. Our family loved walking on the nearby beach and the amazing views of the Puget Sound from the house. We even saw some grey whales spouting in the distance!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at your charming West Beach home is a delightful experience. It is the second time I've been there. It is on the immediate waterfront and grants opportunity to watch the skies, sunsets, listen to the waves.... both beautiful and soothing. You have thoughtfully appointed the house with all creature comforts.
Thank you, Tasha."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your goal is to stay at a comfortable waterfront property, then this is the place for you. The views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan islands were excellent. Oak Harbor has a nice little downtown with several shops and restaurants. We happened to be there for a couple of nice days in March but on West Beach road you need to be prepared for any sorts of wind and weather."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is well equipped and cleaned. The location is excellent! We enjoy our time in Coupeville and Deception Pass State Park.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is phenomenal. It‚Äôs perfect if you want to stay in or if you want to explore the north end of Whidbey island. The decor is awesome. Very in line with what your surroundings are outside of the place. The game options are great - loved playing what do you meme.. hehe! The host was very responsive. If you‚Äôre looking to have nature literally in the backyard, then this place is it!!! You want to experience the epitome of Washington island vibes.. come here! Would love to go back again! üòä"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It does get a little chilly out by the water, if visiting during the winter months, bring gloves, hats-bundle up (especially if the wind is blowing). The house is set to about 70, which was fine for us- a hoodie, pants & a blanket sufficed just fine if we got chilled. The oil heaters in each room helped immensely when we were ready to go to bed. We didn't have a use really for the other bed room, so we kept the door shut as it was cold. If the sun is shining-open the curtains/blinds to let that heat in!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was easy to fine and I will tell others
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would come again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely beach cabin in a fabulous location, it exceeded our expectations, and we loved our time there!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location and beautiful beach decor! Thank you!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"On the beach, the children saw a seal (in the water), a star fish, two eagles, herons, anemones and a fish in the tide pool. On day 2 there was an amazing storm which was beautiful to watch through the big windows while we were cozy inside. The outdoor space for dogs was so wonderful. It was nice to be close to town but not too close."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view. beautiful cabin. I plan on returning
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"outstanding views, great deck for watching the waves. more spacious than the pictures make it out to be. well stocked kitchen."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Tasha‚Äôs home. It is very well decorated and all of the instructions are clear and easy to find, a lot of games and dog items like leashes/bowls/toys etc. It is right on the water which is incredible to enjoy from in our out of the home. Right next to a state park to walk down the beach, and a short 10-15 min drive from both Oak Harbor and Coupeville."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is cozy, clean and has a great location. Our family, including the 80 lbs retriever, felt right at home. The views can‚Äôt be beat and the beach walk is right there every time you need a break to clear your head. All of us were able to do remote work and school without any wi-if issues, even when the wind and weather were pretty intense. The space is versatile and Tasha has added thoughtful touches to allow full utilization of the space."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,If you have the opportunity -book it! Everything about this place is amazing and it far exceeded our expectations. The host is great and it is easy to tell that she has put a lot of careful thought into the place to ensure that whomever stays there has a wonderful experience. We were lucky enough to experience a wind storm with waves crashing into the windows of the house. One of the coolest things we have ever seen. We want to visit again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really appreciated the location near the water and a state park with some walking trails. We came on an unusually cold weekend and it was nice that the cottage had games and a TV so that we could enjoy our time inside too.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five star stay all around only because there are no such things as 6 or 7 stars. The view is so great even in a bitter cold winter afternoon that won't stop us to get to the back porch to enjoy the view. But better yet, just stay inside the house, get all the comfy food you can eat and sit in front the dinning table to enjoy the sunset. (Well, weather permit) Tasha communicate very well and provide all the help throughout our trip and the place is clean, neat and very well decorated as you can see in the photo. There are two rooms and they are big and the house overall is decent size. Definitely recommend this property."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This spot is spectacular! The host communicates well and she has so many thoughtful touches to the living space. You will not be disappointed!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, brightly decorated cabin in an awesome location. My two daughters loved beachcombing and I had a pleasant walk through the state park that‚Äôs right next door."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely love this little house, the pictures don‚Äôt even compare. Tasha was super quick with her responses and made sure that I was aware of a storm that was rolling in. She is super awesome and the house was more than I could have asked for. I will definitely be back that is for sure."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an incredible stay at this beach cabin. The views were incredible and the cabin had all the basic amenities plus some extras (e.g., shampoo, washer/dryer, etc.) to make our stay comfortable. We love visiting Whidbey during the off season but this cabin would be incredible any time of the year."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location for proximity to Deception Pass State Park, Coupeville, the ferry, and all places on the island. Very clean space and accurate listing. Lovely view of sunset, Lopez and Smith Islands.
The weather was stormy while we were there, only adding to the Salish Sea experience! Waves washed up to the fenceline and spray hit the windows, but with no danger. Despite the proximity to the Naval Air Base, we weren't bothered by excessive noise. Right next door to Whidbey State Park, where gumboot chitons had washed up. View of the moon and stars. Would gladly return. Thanks for everything, Tasha!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,I highly recommend this place! Very clean and a perfect place to spend a weekend!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great get away and right on the water!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is truly spectacular. The views are incredible from every room, and the bean bag chair was a hot ticket item for my kids. Tasha has thought of everything from games and binoculars to dog food and it really made our stay relaxing. We'll be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Reserve it, right now. It is a beautiful cabin. What is advertised is exactly what you get. Second visit and there will be more."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Light, bright space. Lovely beach."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Tasha's place. Everything was as described in the listing and Tasha communication was great.
Our pups loved the yard. The house is very relaxing and has all you need."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha‚Äôs place exceeded our expectations! Beautiful home, beautiful location on the beach and they go above and beyond for their pet guests! Would definitely recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Definitely coming back again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a perfect location for lazy days at the beach or a short hike with beautiful scenery!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit to Tasha‚Äôs place. Word and photos will never do this magical place justice. If you‚Äôre on the fence about visiting, this is your sign! Definitely check it out."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view was phenomenal and it felt very private.
Everything was very comfortable.
Checking in and out was very easy (locking the door was difficult until we realized you really have to pull the door closed to get the lock to line up)
Close proximity to downtown and outdoor activities"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, this is the best spot in Oak Harbor Washington, and in my opinion possibly the best location in the US. The drive to the property is stunning. The densely forested areas are only broken by pristine ocean views. The house itself is beautifully decorated. It is updated with the most up to date modern amenities. There are a few speakers in the house for your listening pleasure. There are three comfortable beds and also a pull out sofa. When on the back porch, you will see the most amazing ocean views. This house is also pet friendly and equipped with everything your fur baby could possibly need. The house is also impeccably clean, it smells brand new when you walk in the door. The host responded almost immediately when we had any questions. I'm not sure I could come up with a negative if someone paid me. I hope to be back one day!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! This is our second time here and we love it!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Right on your own private beach and the house is very clean and smells amazing. We will most likely be back in the near future!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 4th time staying at tashas! We love this place . It‚Äôs clean and great location and fully stocked. Tasha is a 10 star host. We can‚Äôt wait to come back !
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house on the beach is even better than the listing makes it look. Immaculately kept inside and out, so very welcoming from the first step inside. The location is To Die For. You couldn't be closer to the waves rolling up on the beach, and since it is literally next door to a state park you have all the room to roam you could wish for.
we brought our 3 dogs and this place was great for them! the only thing to note is that the beach side of the home is not fully fenced in a way that will contain a curious pup. That said we had no issues with our dogs at all and they were able to roam the yard happily under supervision.
The house is well appointed with dishes and cooking accoutrements (no dishwasher so just be prepared) including some basic staples like coffee, sugar and spices.
After staying here we are already planning to come back again, maybe during winter to enjoy a good storm!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful beachfront home right on the water's edge! This is the sort of place you don't want to use as a home base, you just want to order take-out and stay home! We had a lovely weekend, took lots of walks on the beach, enjoyed the jets overhead, the mini-golf down the street, the drive-in theater and go-karts, and lots of relaxing!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tasha was a fantastic host! The cabin was exactly as described, clean, location was perfect, and our minor questions were responded to quickly after arrival."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is well appointed with beautiful beach decor. The location is fabulous. Don‚Äôt hesitate to rent this one!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about this home. Quaint and comfortable with countless amenities. A great location provides the best views on the island for sunsets.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved Tasha's place. We spent all out time outside or looking outside at all the bird and marine animal activity. The primary bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really nice stay with so many details thought out, like USB plugs in bedroom, dog supplies, local info. etc...The view is beautiful, the wildlife amazing and the town is a quick drive away with everything you need. Home was clean, kids had a blast and LOVED the giant bean bag chair. We plan to visit again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was perfect! The location right next to the water was exactly what we were looking for - you can hear the waves crashing as your falling asleep! Very clean home and has everything you need. My personal fav was the bean bag! Would definitely love to stay again in the future.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, divinely decorated, extremely relaxing, and very comfortable."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! From the decor to the location to the cleanliness, the response from Tasha. It's even better that you can imagine. We LOVED the location. The house sits right next to the park and RIGHT on the water. If it was closer to the water you would be in it. Lots of places to sit and take in the water view. Tasha has done a beautiful job decorating. You will feel instantly comfortable. Attention to detail as well as the cleanliness exceeded our expectations. It's worth every penny! We will be back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal view - it was a great space and the view is unbeatable. The sunsets were amazing right on the water and it was fun spotting sea lions and dolphins in the water and bald eagles flying around.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Right on the ocean! Great for dogs!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, all I can say is that this place is PERFECT! The house is decorated immaculately, and you cannot beat the view. Would recommend anyone to stay here, I already can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really beautiful place. Everything was so well thought out. Lots of great little touches.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time renting Tasha‚Äôs beach house. Wonderful spot! Wonderful house!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Tasha‚Äôs place is perfect in all respects, and made for a wonderful oceanfront getaway for our family. We were 4 adults and a dog and we had everything we needed for a 2 night stay. The fire pit was especially great for a chilly morning and waking up to the sound of crashing waves made sure the day started out just right! Tasha was super responsive and flexible regarding some of the requests we had. We will surely visit again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a lovely setting on the water. So, relaxing hearing the water roll in. Good restaurants in Oak Harbor and Coupeville. For a real treat go to Frasers Gourmet Hideaway for a real culinary experience."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best beach house adventure ever! Tasha supplied more than enough of everything for my friend and I to be comfortable, and happy. Super clean, awesome view and beach! The photos don‚Äôt do it justice as it was so beautiful and well-appointed. Will definitely go there again! Thank you, Tasha!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The beach house was perfect for our stay. Right on the ocean and just minutes away from the relatives in Oak Harbor we were visiting. Tasha‚Äôs done a great job of anticipating guests‚Äô needs. The weather didn‚Äôt cooperate to show all the views, but we loved the sunsets. Sunrise is super early in the summertime, so bring your sleep mask if you wake easily to morning light and prefer to sleep a little longer! We miss the beach house already!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was set up perfectly for our visit. There were plenty of little details and Tasha seemed to anticipate our every need. We got everything we wanted from our stay, and a lot of it was thanks to the diligence and attention to detail of our host. We would love to stay here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! The house has a wonderful location right on the water and Tasha has done an outstanding job decorating and outfitting it. It's really cozy and clean with thoughtful touches, including a festive firepit and great outdoor lighting and furniture. The house is modest in size, but Tasha has done a great job maximizing the space such that it would be comfortable for a larger number of people."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outside plug in for electric car, we used the 110 but there is a 220, but I wasn‚Äôt sure of amperage. Used the oil heaters, they worked great."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and great communication with the host. Can‚Äôt beat it.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tasha's beach home was a home run with every member of the family including dogs. This one was a winner! It was the perfect relaxing getaway and the sunset/water view was amazing. The home is clean, tastefully decorated, and all around well stocked with supplies including items for the fire pit. We will definitely be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is extraordinary in so many ways. Any amenities someone could need are there. The view is spectacular all day, especially for sunsets. Tasha is a excellent host. Quick to stay in contact for anything. This place is very pet friendly as well. Including having a very nice bed, toys and bowls. We will most definitely be returning here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, nice location, fine amenities and personal touch Tasha has added to this home."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is a dollhouse! The location is marvelous, everything in the home is clean and in great condition, thoughtful amenities, host is great and quick to respond. We will be back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an AMAZING springtime stay at Tasha's place with our 2 kids and a very old dog. This was our first Airbnb experience and it did not disappoint. The home was spotless, kitchen was well-stocked with all the essentials, the beds were super comfy, and the giant beanbag chair was a huge hit with the kids. Loved all the plants and really thoughtful decor. The binoculars were a welcome touch - we spotted otters, seals, and all sorts of shorebirds while eating meals at the bar facing the water! What a gem of a spot, close to town but feels far enough away to really feel like a getaway - thank you again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just amazing! right on the beach, though do know there I only sand at low tide, its a fun tide pooling wonderland.
eagles were around a lot, which was so much fun.
the house is well equipped with everythin you need and little extras like fun night lights! comfy beds, lots of fluffy towels. The kitchen has it all.
everything was stunning, we will return!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tasha‚Äôs place was a slice of beach heaven. Sitting on the back deck watching the sun set and listening to the waves roll in was the best medicine. The kitchen had everything we needed. All the furniture was super comfortable. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Tasha‚Äôs beach cabin. We knew we were booking a waterfront place, but the proximity to the water was breathtaking and unbeatable. I mean RIGHT on the water. I enjoyed daily yoga on the deck as the sun set followed by a romantic bonfire while kids slept. We saw a grey wale, bald eagles, and otters. When the tide was low, there is a nice sand bar for our kid to play on. The interior was clean and there were lots of little touches that made it a great place to stay. Oh! And my Labrador was in heaven chasing balls in the yard and swimming in the water. We hope to come back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd time at Tashas place! We absolutely adore it. Her attention to detail, easy check in, location and communication all 5 stars. Can‚Äôt say enough good things ! Just book it :)"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you love the sound of the ocean, this is THE place to stay. the house is right on the edge of a tucked away public beach which was basically empty 90% of the time, making it feel like a true private beach experience. The wind is insane sometimes, but I love that so it was a plus for me. Also the beach is rocky so it's a fun *explore* beach instead of a *lay out on it* beach. The breakfast bar can't be beat for morning coffees and sunset dinners. I came out to be alone in a beautiful place and this place delivered. I also really love all the puppy supplies for when I come back with my dog and wife in tow (because I will be back!) and the plants in every room were wonderful! Do yourself a favor and book it!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha's place is absolutely amazing! The views and location are just perfect. Tasha is a great host and very quick with responses. The place itself is very thoughtful and has everything you need. keurig for your coffee, 3 different outdoor sitting options, 2 fire pits and parking! It is so dog friendly - dog bed, food and water bowl, play toys and right next to a state park! We spent most of our time on the patio and the beach. The sunsets over the water can be seen from the patio, living room and the main bedroom. We also got to see a sea lion and plenty of birds. Our puppy had a great time walking on the beach and going to the state park.
we would totally come back again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This AirBnB has tons going for it, so much so that this wa our 2nd stay.
Location is right on the water with views forever, you can't get any closer to the waves.
The main bedroom is large with a super comfortable bed. The entire house is clean and well-maintained.
It's easy to work remotely, I never had an issue with the WiFi even with video meetings.
You're close to Oak Harbor if you want take out plus there are so many spots to go hiking nearby (Deception Pass, Fort Casey, Fort Ebey, etc.) or just to enjoy the views.
It's a great spot and we'll be looking to return."

The tiny home was a compact little cabin, with everything you need plus some very kind additions and treats. Remember your earplugs as the rooster is loud at 4 or 5 a.m. depending on his mood ü§£.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay for me to rest and catch my breath in between travels. The property was beautiful and the bed so comfortable!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very busy, but took the time to visit with us between our events. We were very pleased with how close the place was to town. The chickens made a fun feel to the farm. If we had more time, we would have spent time with horses. If the need arises again, we will consider this place again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Donna is wonderful! The space was perfect for spending time on the Island! Was a great location and SUPER comfy bed and great amenities.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Donna was super friends and welcoming! We were able to bring our dog and it‚Äôs super dog friendly :) they made us feel at home and it was such a cute place to stay and so peaceful for a staycation! üòÅ

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,All good
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna‚Äôs studio was amazing! Located on her farm and very tastefully decorated! The bed is truly amazing and we just loved the atmosphere! Lucky for us, her chickens had laid a few extra eggs and they were delicious! Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful peaceful stay. Lovely cabin on a farm and sooo comfortable!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna's place was serene, comfortable, and impeccably clean. it's a bit deep, and at the time, a bit expensive for the size and remoteness of the place, but worth it for the other pluses. We made a last-minute decision to take a trip out to Whibey from Seattle for the birding festival, and pickings were slim. Donna made the process quick, easy, and seemless, and we had a comfortable and cozy stay (loved the comfy king bed and quiet surroundings). While it's a bit too far from Coupeville to recommend for the birding festival, I would recommend it for anyone who wants a calm, comfy farm stay and proximity to several gorgeous parks and all there is to do there (hiking, paddling, birding, etc). We had a lovely time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna‚Äôs place was clean, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. They even had a bottle of wine ready. Stayed for one night for work.
Heard the jets do a few fly overs in early evening but stopped right before bedtime. Nothing a pair of earplugs wouldn‚Äôt fix if needed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quaint and clean! A nice laid back place to stay close to downtown Oak Harbor. Loved the vibe! I will visit again for sure.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed Donna‚Äôs small cabin for one night and enjoyed very much. We loved seeing horses in her farm and ate very fresh eggs as breakfast.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed Donna's genuine hospitality and taking the time to tell us about her hens and rooster. Place was great! Nice location on lovely peaceful property. We plan to return.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little cottage on a horse farm. Donna & Stan very friendly. Great quiet location but close to town & nice places to walk & hike. Loved it!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful little spot to stay at, perfect for a quick getaway in nature. We loved walking around the farm and saying hello to the horses, chickens, and cows. The location is a short drive into town, about 10 minutes or so, where we enjoyed visiting the local stores and art markets. Donna, our host, was super responsive and kind, and went out of her way to reimburse us for the one small issue we had. Thank you so much for hosting us, we had a lovely time!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice and as expected/described
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Bit and Bridle Cabin was a lovely little getaway set amongst the beautiful trees and cute farm. I had never stayed in a tiny home nor on a farm, and it was a peaceful and lovely experience! Donna is an exceptional host who was friendly, highly responsive, and so helpful! The cabin was decorated so comfortably and had extensive amenities, all labeled precisely and helpfully. I would highly recommend this for a comfortable, peaceful escape on magnificent Whidbey Island!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay!! If you're reading this and still considering other options, book this cottage, trust me!!! Donna's ranch is absolutely beautiful and peaceful, but still has all of the amenities I needed to be comfortable. The wifi was fantastic and I had no issues with zoom calls or streaming. My dog loved exploring the property and was incredibly drawn to Donna, he had the time of his life. We will absolutely be returning, and I can't wait!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing stay in the farm and the cabin was all that we needed. The interiors were done really good and had personal touches. The kitchen is stuffed with whole lot of food snacks. You will be welcomed with a bottle of wine and a basket of fresh farm eggs which is the best welcoming gesture !!! The farm is peaceful and the surrounding is extremely captivating. Donna is a great host and is super fast responsive to all your messages and queries.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Have never loved an Airbnb so much - Donna‚Äôs place was peaceful and pristine - it would be a honor to stay again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was one of those airbnbs i wish i had booked for longer! i loved the little studio space, the bed and sheets were so comfy and i was surprised how much cooking i could do in the kitchen space!
Donna was so lovely and i adored meeting her chickens and horses. the location was great, close to the main part of town and a short drive to Deception Pass. i would love to come stay here again sometime!
one thing to note, there are roosters, so bring some earplugs if you don‚Äôt love waking up early :) i always travel with some so it wasn‚Äôt a problem for me, and Donna gave me a heads up, thankfully!"

I heard the jets fly overhead but was a military wife so it was a comforting sound. If noise is an issue Donna has fans in the room to drown out any sounds.
This place is such a sweet gem, definitely worth a visit! :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little space to stay really close to everything in Oak Harbor.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A cozy place to land in oak harbor. Would stay here again if we‚Äôre in the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This location is a great jumping-off point to your adventures around Whidbey Island. The Cabin is incredibly cozy, and Donna is an amazing host. Among all the accommodations available to you on the Island, I would argue that the Bit & Bridle Cabin is the best value."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this little piece of horse heaven. Perfect little tiny home with everything you could need. And bonus prizes!!! I loved it here.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place close to town and a short drive to ferry

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely perfect place. Neat, clean, quiet. Total privacy without being isolated. The kitchenette has everything you need, the bed is comfy, and the TV choices are endless.
I loved walking around on the farm, pick up some apples for the horses, and enjoyed some fresh eggs right from the chickens there.
The host is thinking of every detail - even a bottle of wine and some cookies when you arrive.
Check-in and -out were as easy as can be.
Only 10 miles from Deception Pass, and another few miles and you‚Äôre in Anacortes - perfect for day trips. I will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful experience.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a delightful place and host! We got to meet Donna and her hubby briefly as they were coming back from feeding the horses, we had a lovely chat. And she brought his some garden-fresh tomatoes!
Donna‚Äôs place is well thought out and had everything we needed for the one night we stayed.
Even though it is small it did not feel cramped at all. It had a nice open feeling. Especially with the French doors on the side leading out to a deck. There was a nice cross breeze with the window.
It was super clean!
The bed was very comfortable! The pillows not quite as much.
If you are tall note that the shower head is low.
It is on a farm/ranch and includes all the things that come with that, including coyotes howling in the distance, rooster crows, and a hilarious donkey that ‚Äúsang‚Äù a couple of times. It is also near a military base and there were some loud planes going overhead , but not for very long. We got in late and left early so we did not get to walk around much, but what we did see was pretty.
It felt like a very safe area. The was easy and safe on-site parking right near the place. It‚Äôs a little hard to figure out which driveway to use if it is the dark outside, so if you are arriving late for the first time if you go slow you can actually see the little house with the porch lights on, I recognized it from the photos in the listing. Maybe check with the host for some landmarks other than the green roofed arena which you can‚Äôt see the color of at night.
We had our (large) dog with us and there was plenty of room for her to fully stretch out on the cool plank floor and still easily move around her! There were great areas to walk on leash on the property. I don‚Äôt know if there was any safe fenced areas to let her run off leash, we were not there long enough to ask/investigate.
We would definitely stay there again."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay - highly recommend! It is like going back in time a bit - quite lovely! The best part was talking with Stan about his hot rods and auto shop - which is on the premises‚Ä¶ the 34 Ford is a must see for car enthusiasts!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a fabulous stay! We‚Äôre currently living with my almost in-laws and my fianc√© had just returned from nearly two months away fishing in Alaska so I booked Donna‚Äôs place for his first night back home. This tiny home provided us with the alone time we were looking for and the proximity to town that made it easy to run anywhere in case we needed something. We enjoyed every minutes of our time here.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had the most incredible stay! I‚Äôve been renting Airbnb‚Äòs for the last six years and this is by far the best experience!

Donna is an amazing host. So generous, thoughtful, kind and a great communicator. She made me feel right at home!!

I can‚Äôt say enough! And I will most definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful!! Donna and her husband are so kind and a joy to chit chat with! The bit & bridle was exactly what we needed; cozy, serene, and welcoming! Lots of observable wildlife, plus the horses on the property! Perfect little escape."

My friends and I would definitely stay there again."

The home was well equipped in the kitchen, laundry, and bath department didn‚Äôt need to run to the store for anything. I would definitely stay again. Thank you Xin!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It was our daughter's birthday celebration and everything was just as described as the photos in the listing and that was very important for our daughter so we all were happy with that.
The linens are very comfortable and bed and the pillows were comfortable as well that we slept well.
Only downside was the BBQ grill wasn't working.
The host Xin responded promptly and it was easy to communicate with.
Overall my family and I enjoyed staying and relaxing in the spacious house with beautiful peaceful nature, and appreciate quiet neighbors."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My new favorite vacation home! It was gorgeous inside and out. So comfortable we felt right at home and even stocked with all the necessities that we could need.
We truly had the best time!
It was so refreshing and peaceful. We loved sitting outside watching the eagles fly by and listening to the waves. I wish we could have stayed longer but definitely looking forward to the next time.
Thank you again for sharing your lovely home!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location on the island. House was clean and had great amenities. Xin was very helpful and responsive.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at this amazing luxury home was nothing short of perfection. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the breathtaking ocean views that exceeded our expectations. The house itself is even more beautiful, than in the pictures, nestled in a serene environment.
One of the standout features of our stay was the impeccable cleanliness of the property. Every corner was spotless, which made us feel instantly comfortable and relaxed. Huge thanks to the host and co-hosts for maintaining such high standards.
The kitchen was exceptionally well-stocked, allowing us to prepare meals with ease while enjoying the stunning views . Whether we were lounging on the spacious deck or cozied up indoors, every moment felt like a luxury retreat.
Overall, our experience surpassed all expectations, and we cannot wait to return to this paradise by the sea. Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked Xin‚Äôs home for a quick last minute trip for a half marathon on the island. It was the perfect location for us. Xin was quick to respond to questions and made the check in and check out process easy. While the home is on a cliff (fenced) it felt very safe and accommodating as a family with young kids.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay here. The views are truly incredible and the house is very comfortable. It‚Äôs also a very short drive to Oak Harbor or Coupeville which was nice. We would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Xin was quick to respond to any messages and was a great host. The house was clean and well stocked. The beds were very comfy and it was so peaceful watching the ocean from the covered deck. There was a cute town about 10 minutes away with a great restaurant. Would highly recommend staying here.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really liked the location on the bluff, place is decently private, and lots of yard space to play with the kids. We like to rent AirBnBs so that we can largely cook at home and not exclusively eat at restaurants, and the kitchen and amenities were great, well stocked. They even supplied kids' cups/plates/bowls/flatware, which is really useful when you've got four young kids around the house. I saw a pack and play in the closet, though we didn't need it ourselves. Kids loved the bunk beds upstairs, and they enjoyed a few of the toys and books around the house. The house was great for us having two families stay together with plenty of space/privacy when needed.
Place was very clean at check-in, and a location close to Oak Harbor was great - a less than 10 minute drive to town to get groceries/supplies, etc. and very close to Fort Ebey State Park, which we have always enjoyed the trails around the bunker and the bluffs there. We would definitely consider renting this place again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing view! The house was beautiful and met all of our needs. Eating dinner while watching those sunsets was the highlight of our trip. Everything was labeled very well so there was no guessing what switch does what or where things are placed. I would 100% choose to stay here anytime I come back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great family weekend. Great location, close to Deception Pass State Park and Coupeville. The only drawback for our family was the lack of a flat, mowed yard space. We brought outdoor games to play and the lawn is very bumpy and long and brown."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house right on the water. You aren‚Äôt able to walk out onto the beach from the house but it‚Äôs such an incredible view off the cliff. Quiet, peaceful and a great spot for our family to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was well appointed and had all the amenities we required. The view was amazing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, well appointed house with great sunset views!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host, Xin, was extremely responsive during the booking and duration of the stay. She answered all my questions. The house was very clean, organized and comfortable. Ample room for family. The setting is very quiet, perched on a bluff high above the beach on the Straits of Juan de Fuca. There is access to the beach about 2 blocks away with ample parking. Also the location of the house is on the west side of the island which can be a little windy and cooler at times but the view is expansive. It is about a 10 minute drive to Oak Harbor which has all the major stores and about 10 minutes to Coupeville which has about 2 blocks + of little shops and restaurants. There is also one medium sized grocery store. All in all a wonderful stay in a very quiet setting, the house was very clean and comfortable and the host, Xin, very gracious and responsive. Thanks!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Enjoyed stay with family, very beautiful clean house with house and has everything you need to cook meal."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great experience staying at this property. Amazing ocean view and amenities. Everything was as described on the listing. 10/10.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful home! Very well appointed and very well decorated. There was even high end hair tools. Thank you so much for taking so much time and care in presenting your home for rent. We loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I stayed at Xin's home for three nights and had a wonderful time! The sound of the ocean was peaceful and everything in her home was in perfect order and just as described and pictured. It was a little cool and windy when we were there, so we didn't get to spend time out on the beautiful deck, but we did make use of the electric fireplace, which made everything cozy. We would definitely stay there again. The location is excellent; far enough from Oak Harbor for privacy but close enough to have dinner and shop, if you need to. Xin, herself, is a very responsive host and took no time at all answering any question I had. You will love it there!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and enough space for our big group of 7 adults and 2 kids. The only thing that was a little bit of a bummer was not a ton of living room seating but that‚Äôs not a deal breaker. There was a big table in the dinning room so we could all sit and enjoy meals. The communication with Xin was easy and I got responses back quickly. This is a great place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous view, and super clean! I will definitely return to live here"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Xin was an amazing host. She was very responsive and accommodating.
The place was spacious and clean. We stayed with another couple and kids. Perfect space for 2 families. The kitchen is big and easy to get some meals started. The bunk beds were fun for the kids. We did not use the yard because it was winter however it is important to know that kids would need supervision outside. The yard is well fenced but there is a big drop outside of it. There is no access to the beach from this house.
We had a very nice stay and it was perfect for what we were looking for. Thank you for Xin for making us feel like at home and comfortable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Great views, comfortable house with everything we needed!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,It‚Äôs a beautiful place to stay. Really enjoyed the sitting on the back deck looking out at the water.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was quite large and had plenty of room for all guests. It was extremely clean and had all the needed essentials and cooking supplies including BBQ. Xin was very responsive, quick to respond to any questions and very accommodating. I would recommend to stay at Xin‚Äôs property if you are in town or visiting Oak Harbor."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had an amazing stay at this BNB, beautiful views of the Salish sea and quite close to Oak Harbor downtown. The BNB itself has everything you would need and more, is quite clean and comfortable. Love the home decor!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Absolutely loved it!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a homey place and location is fantastic. We walked along the waterfront every morning and the Whidbey Coffee just 5 min walk away.
I was expecting traffic noise but May is a good month as it is peaceful and not crowded.
The house is cute, most importantly the bed is comfortable. They provided all we need. Thank you."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful views. House was very cute and clean. My mom and I had a wonderful time staying there while visiting family over the holidays.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved the house. So close to town and the sunsets and sunrises were unreal. We loved the 70s charm brought back a lot of memories. I think its a cherry tree that‚Äôs by the house that was visited by a family of deer. We loved every minute of our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location!
The house was perfect for the theme of our stay, catching up with classmates!"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cons: Photos seem to hide the fact that the house is on a busy road, not directly on the water. My friends complained about one of the bedrooms smelling like dog. Found hair on my pillow case. Beach across the road is mostly driftwood, not much space to relax.
Pros: It was nice to be able to walk to downtown in < 10 min. View from the living room was lovely. Deck was nice to hang out on, despite the road noise."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This wonderful pink house was a gem and just what we needed for a peaceful and relaxing getaway! It had everything we needed and fantastic local restaurants and trails nearby. We would stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view and great location! Nostalgia inducing vintage decor home that is well maintained.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect!! Walkable to the beach, walkable to coffee shops and other restaurants. Very clean and well stocked!
We didn't feel like anything was missing. The decor is dated but it's appealing if you like the ""retro look"". We didn't mind it.
I have back issues so I was concerned about the beds but thankfully the mattresses and pillows were comfortable.
You're right next to a main street so a lot of road noise is heard but there are fans in the bedrooms to help that or bring a white noise machine. We would 100% stay there again."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice clean house with an amazing view! Beds are comfortable, and there are plenty of extras to make you feel at home. The location is perfect, and such a short drive into town, the drive in movie theater, museum and deception pass. I would recommend!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids spent hours in front of the bay window staring through binoculars while watching herons, seals, and boats."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,What an amazing find. This was our first girls trip and it will now be an annual tradition. This house is such a gem. We felt like we took a step back in time.

The house has lots of amenities and is within close walking/driving distance to a lovely beachfront park as well as shops & food. It was a great home base as we explored the island. I loved drinking my tea on the deck on a sunny morning, watching the tide roll in and the boats head out."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! The hosts provide all the necessities that make a stay truly enjoyable. From a well-appointed kitchen to plenty of bed linens and extra blankets, to the outside gas fireplace and convenient access to local stores, all our needs were met. Their provided binder is full of great suggestions and easy to fill out directions. We had a lovely time and hope to visit again!"
