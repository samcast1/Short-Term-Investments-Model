2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly how it is described. It worked perfectly for us. I may just rent it out again next year when I come back for graduation‚Ä¶üòÅKimberly was a gracious host. The additional snacks and drinks, as well as the coffee, that was provided was extremely generous‚Ä¶ very unexpected but definitely appreciated.

out to us and we were very impressed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Kimberly was a great host! The house was accurate and close to cedar point. It was also close to local restaurants and attractions. She was a very nice host and the house was very clean. I would stay in this air b&b again in a heartbeat.

The snacks left next to the coffee bar and the drinks in the fridge were very appreciated since our kids had so much fun at Ghostly Manor we missed the opportunity to get to an open grocery store. We cooked breakfast both days and found the kitchen well stocked. Even the washer and dryer was of high quality and Kimberly had laundry pods available ‚Äî we washed our towels after our trip to Kalahari.
We highly recommend this AirBnB!"

The location was easy to access and was conveniently located around plenty of restaurant options."

Hoping to stay here again next time we visit the area!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not find another host as accommodating or as thoughtful as Kimberly. She was attentive to every small detail within the home and her extra touches of the grab and go breakfasts, welcoming gifts, beverages, toiletries, etc was not unnoticed. The area may appear as rough to some; however, all of the neighbors and individuals walking down the sidewalk were friendly and courteous. It was 2 blocks away from Cedar Point and some great restaurants. It was the perfect spot for ourselves, our toddler daughter and another couple and baby, too. Thank you so much for being so welcoming and not missing a detail in your home!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay at The Place by the Park! It was a comfy little bungalow 5 mins from Cedar Point.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are local and decided to find somewhere within an hour's drive to just get away for the weekend with the kids. Kimberly's place was the perfect find! Everything was spotless, the decor was bright and fresh and it was just a really comfortable place to spend a couple of days.
There are plenty of stores in the area for all of your needs (we even discovered that Sandusky has our beloved Drug Mart!!!). We drove in to the city center where the holiday lighting ceremony on the square was happening and visited the Merry-Go-Round Museum which was super cool. There are so many things to do in the area and we are looking forward to returning in summer for an overnight trip to Cedar Point, which is six minutes away by car.
Kimberly also had beverages for us in the fridge and a ton of snacks/breakfast bars and toiletries like I have not seen before in an Airbnb. The kids (our 11 year-old and her friend) thought the place was ""poppin'"", as they say (insert horrified look from my child)."

There are a few board games in the storage area under the sofa cushion. The stove has a griddle that sits over the burners, perfect for pancakes. Kimberly was super thoughtful and very responsive. A set up like this is just better than staying at a hotel around the park. Location is awesome. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for our two night stay to go to Cedar Point. It was super clean, very comfortable and had a well stocked kitchen. So much nicer than getting hotel rooms. Also, a quick walk to Louie's at the end of the street for a nightcap (if you aren't too tired from being at the park). We will definitely book this property again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful location and space.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and would go again. Renee was so responsive to our questions.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our visit and super clean. It was furnished and stocked well. We liked the large, off-street parking. The firepit area was not right in the back yard as we'd assumed (it was behind a garage building and storage container), but we ended up not using it anyway and there was a nice little porch and plenty of seating inside. There were places to eat and hang out close by and we had a great visit. The owner was great to work with and we felt the cost was a good value for a ice place to stay. We would stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was just a one night stay for Cedar point. Home was very well maintained. Also very clean and updated. Would like to spend more days during the summer next year.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Renee was a great host. The house was exactly as described and the location was perfect.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot! We stayed with another couple and a few kids and had plenty of space! We stayed only for one night, but easily could‚Äôve stayed longer. The space was huge! Lots of room to spread out and not feel on top of each other. The location for us was fantastic. Just a few minutes from cedar point. The outdoor fire pit on the water was a nice touch. Renee was very helpful and responsive when I reached out with a few questions. Definitely will stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute cozy comfortable home I enjoyed my stay and will definitely be booking again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place very clean super spacious!!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"After looking at the photos and then arriving to the location, I felt partially misled. This is a mobile home and none of the pictures show that at all. It is directly located on a busy street and we heard loud cars going by all night. There is a smell in the home as well- maybe of past smokers, I am not sure exactly but it isn‚Äôt entirely pleasant. They do have a cleaner come in, and overall the home was clean. Beds were clean and comfortable. There were multiple hairs left in the bathroom shower which didn‚Äôt feel very clean. We only stayed one night after a day of Cedar Point. It was a very average stay, one we probably would have gotten at a decent hotel nearby. For the price of $278 for one night (after fees etc), I think we could have gotten the same if not nicer at a local hotel."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing and clean!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We just got back from our weekend away with friends. This place had everything we could have asked for.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. Place is fantastic and super close to the park.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,I pictures make this seems like the waterfront would be accessible and not in such an industrial marine area. The house smells a bit like moth balls. Over all it worked for what we needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy to find the place and totally worth the price
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! Just wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. Unfortunately, didn‚Äôt catch any fish & it was rainy & cool for our day at the waterpark, but that‚Äôs not Renee‚Äôs fault. Her place was spacious and comfy - like a home away from home. Highly recommend! Much better than a stuffy hotel room."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house may look little on the outside but is chalk full of airy space and comfy amenities on the inside! Perfect place for our friend group to stay at before a day at Cedar Point. So close and convenient!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Perfect size for our family of five and location was very convenient for visiting Cedar Point but staying off-property.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very convenient location and we enjoyed being right on the water. The decor was attractive and comfortable, and the kitchen was well equipped. Renee was quick to respond."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in town for a basketball tournament. We very much enjoyed the lakeside atmosphere. We also loved the space. We have an adult son and teenage son with us and appreciated the extra loving space as woke up before them and able to relax in the mornings.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to Cedar Point! Loved the view of the lake. Very neat and clean. I loved that there was little spf sunscreens and lotions! Ceiling fans were nice!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We caught tons of fish all day long, definitely worth staying if you‚Äôre planning to go fishing!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is what I expected. It is really close to Cedar Point Amusement Park. Parking was a plus because it was off street. It had everything we needed for our stay and I'd definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Renee's property was great! Better than expected.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"stayed in town for volleyball tournament, twe were just a couple minutes from facility. A lot to do in the area, close to restaurant and activities. waterfront and fireplace were awesome, too"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had a great stay. I liked the fact there were so many living areas in the house. Plenty of pots pans plates etc. The boat detailing place next door was cleaning some boats and there was a very unpleasant smell drifting onto the property the whole time we were there, but that isn‚Äôt really the hosts fault, it was just annoying. The other issue we had was there were some rocks in the water near the dock and our boat got stuck on them. They should be marked but we‚Äôre not. Only other recommendation I have would be to bring your own sheets (I didn‚Äôt care for them, but that is my preference)."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The location of this home was close to the water and offered a private space to be able to fish and enjoy time outside. The place could have used more cleaning in the fridge and bathroom trim. The only other misleading information on this listing is that it is a double-wide. I think the picture of the home needs to be included in the picture listings instead of after booking. Overall good stay here.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay. We had a weekend long volleyball tournament, wish we could have enjoyed the house and view more and would absolutely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recommend the place but aye we I‚Äôll be back nice quiet neighborhood and the inside of the house was beautiful and the lake fit in with the house

The location was AMAZING! walking distance to McD's and 4 minute drive to Cedar Point. We really enjoyed the fire while watching the birds, water way, boats and sunset! in my mind we couldn't have chosen a better spot!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Home was very beautiful and up to date, thoughtful for family trips, the water front was beautiful and directions were simple and straight forward."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was a perfect location for our short trip to visit Kelley‚Äôs Island and Cedar Point. You can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover- the exterior is fairly basic/plain but the interior has everything you need. We were able to comfortably sleep 6 people. The host was very quick and helpful with communication through the app. Very pleasant stay overall and any negative comments would really just be me nitpicking. :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great people, and down to earth.
The house is clean and plenty of room. The location for cedar point couldn‚Äôt be better, and if you have a small boat or PWC it doesn‚Äôt get any better. Everything we needed was there to wash clothes, cook and or grill, and your minutes away from everything else. We will definitely be backüòä"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome !!! Absolutely better than any hotel!!!

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place!
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Renee‚Äôs place is clean, well equipped, and has nice upgrades on the inside. You can‚Äôt beat the location in relation to Cedar Point - about 4 minutes away! There is a nice little seating area by the lake with a gas burning fire pit that is convenient and cozy. I do wish that the listing was a little more forthcoming that Renee‚Äôs place is actually a mobile home and that it sits directly next to a large boat repair shop, which is your view when sitting on the back deck. It is definitely not what we expected from the listing‚Äôs pictures and description. Having said that, it is still roomy enough on the inside (for our group of 4) and kept clean. There were definitely sufficient amenities. We were able to grill out one evening with no problems and would have used the fire pit for roasting marshmallows had we not exhausted ourselves every day with everything we packed in!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time, the rooms were clean and there was plenty of room. The waterfront was a nice bonus! There were games and books available to use too, which my daughter enjoyed. There was also a huge round table which was nice to sit around to eat and play games."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay. Very close to cedar point. The place was bigger then we expected and plenty of room to accommodate 4 people, overall very clean. The only negative thing was the trains you hear all night! It‚Äôs close to a train track so that makes sense but be prepared to have many sleepless nights. Other then that, rennee & her husband were very welcoming and will respond to you in less then 10 minutes."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good place to stay especially if you are going to Cedar Point. We were able to leave the park and go back and rest for a couple of hours before returning for more roller coaster fun. Very clean place.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay. The host was very respectful and quick to respond. I would definitely come back.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the house was great Perfect location for going to cedar point. But the little touches for guests was what made it truly an amazing place to stay.

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a very comfortable stay. My teens loved that there were 2 large tvs on a rainy evening.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One thing to keep in mind when traveling to Sandusky in general is cedar point traffic. If you are going to cedar point this place is so close and very easy to get there. We were coming here for sports force park, which it is also super easy to get to. Luckily we only got delays on Saturday morning, this location is off the entrance road to the park and it was crazy with traffic Saturday morning. My only suggestion for the rental would be to redo the master bedroom area, it is a little outdated compared to the rest of the house. We would definitely stay here again! Waterfront is looking at the marina."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Renee‚Äôs place for two nights during our sons‚Äô baseball tournament at the Cedar Point Sports Center. It was the perfect location and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We spent some time by the lake and used the firepit one evening. If we had more time; we would have definitely gone out on a boat for a day. The house is clean, updated nicely, and even includes some board games for the kids. The location is wonderful if you are visiting Cedar Point. We would choose to stay at Renee‚Äôs place again the next time we visit Sandusky."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renee was quick to respond to communication. Thre accommodations were even nicer and more comfortable than we expected. The pics don't do it justice.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great location. Very clean.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My review can‚Äôt do this place justice, you have to book for yourself. We (family of 4) were immediately at ease, had amazing views, tons of games, large rooms and was super clean! Plenty to do in the area with walkable shops, restaurants and activities - a hop away from cedar point. I just wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My advice?
Book this place!
We kept saying how spoiled we felt!
Spotless, fabulous air conditioning, the deck, the view, the people watching, the kitchen stocked with all the dishes, pots & pans, quality glassware, even a bar set better than I have at home!
everything we wished for and more!
We didn‚Äôt make it to the speakeasy across the street, but we did have a few Voltair margaritas at Oh Taco, they were lovely!
On a rainy Saturday afternoon we opened up the curtains and watched people Rock Climbing!
‚Ä¶. Yes, there was a lot of clapping and cheering! Some of those kids kicked the climb! We took bets on if two of them were Ryan‚Äôs kids.
I can‚Äôt see finding a better rental, for family, or a few couples (as we were) in the area!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying in Ryan's place if you are in the Sandusky area. This was actually our second time renting the space during a visit to Cedar Point. The place is nice and has a beautiful view of Lake Erie from a nice deck up off the street. Check-in was easy and the downtown Sandusky area was nice with plenty of coffee, restaurants and bars within a short walk. Speaking of bars, there is one downstairs from the space! I didn't get to sample it since it but it seemed pretty cool and is a nice amenity to have at arm's length (for anyone worried about staying above a bar, it closed at a reasonable time and was not terribly noisy underneath). Cedar Point is a quick 8 minute drive so its a great alternative to some cheap hotel. There is a park and playground across from the space too if you have young kids. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place. It‚Äôs not our first time staying here and it won‚Äôt be our last. The location is great, and the space is super clean with all the essentials needed. Bring coffee, or if you are like us, just walk 100 yards down the street to Saucy Coffee House. (You may want to go get a smash burger later there, they are incredible!)
We liked the vibe of the bar downstairs, didn‚Äôt bother us in the evening, in fact we found it festive! Can‚Äôt wait to go back in two weeks!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was easy to find, clean, and welcoming! Would stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really loved this place! Very spacious, clean and it looked exactly as pictured. Great balcony views and near many cute little places downtown. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved it! Wish we would have stayed longer. At the time we stayed it was a great price. The location is great, the patio/balcony was huge and you could see Lake Erie. The bar downstairs was super cute. We will be staying here next year when we visit."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in downtown Sandusky! We stayed here to spend the weekend at Cedar Point amusement park (which is about a 10-15 min drive). There was plenty of street parking outside the apartment. The apartment was very clean, well stocked and had a modern feel. There are curtains to close off the glass window to the rock climbing wall for privacy purposes (although we never saw anyone there)."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ryan is an excellent host. The location was perfect. Totally as described. We loved the paddle bar downstairs. Really a very enjoyable stay.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and spacious loft!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time place was perfect
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This unit is above the Paddle and Climb store & Paddle and Climb Bar - it's very clean and enjoyable for any group who is looking to enjoy all of what downtown Sandusky and the Islands have to offer.
If you're going to Cedar Point, this place is perfect. Take the jet over to Cedar Point, have fun all day, come back for dinner and drinks, and relax at Ryan's place.
If/when we stay in Sandusky, I will no doubt check Ryan's place first!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ryan was great to deal with. He communicated everything very clearly. The apartment was really cool, my kids loved the climbing wall. We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in Sandusky."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was an excellent place to stay. It was spacious with two large bedrooms and bathrooms and tall ceilings. It had all the basics - paper products, kitchen utensils, plates, cups, wine bottle opener, linens, etc. - plus fluffy towels! It's easily walkable to lots of local bars and restaurants. You couldn't hear the bar downstairs from the bedroom and we appreciated that it was pet friendly. The huge balcony was a surprise plus! The rock wall was neat, though there weren't many climbers during our stay. Excellent value for the money and Ryan was communicative. We didn't have any issues during our stay, but if we had, I suspect he would have responded immediately. We visited Sandusky for a family reunion and come back regularly. We hope to rent this place again in the future."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice and convenient location. Had everything we needed.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was a great choice. It was very close to everything, including bars restaurants and more!
Ryan was very nice and quick with communicating back to us. I recommend this Airbnb if you are looking to stay in a peaceful location."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and daughter stayed in Ryan‚Äôs rental for their annual trip and absolutely loved the location. Ryan was an amazing host with great communication.
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was located in a great spot right by the water. Love the downtown ambiance and industrial feel. Sky Loft is a nice and modern AIRBNB. My only issue was cleanliness. I spoke with the owner about it and was told he would hire a new cleaning company. He also made accommodations, which was very unexpected. I was grateful for that. I would stay again only if cleaning issues are truly addressed."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cool space with a nice view of the water! It was very clean and I would stay there again
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We travel a lot, and I'll say this is one of the best Airbnbs that we've stayed. It was so comfortable, equipped with everything that you didn't realize you needed, and is in such a unique location. We were here for a long weekend-- one day at Cedar Point (Halloweekends), and two nights just relaxing. The Airbnb is withing walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars, and a super quick drive to Cedar Point. I'd especially recommend Volstead, a bar across the street, for a couple cocktails or craft beer. We try not to travel to the same place twice as a rule, but we may need to make an exception here. Will recommend to family and friends!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location, incredible spot! If you're looking to experience downtown Sandusky with a local's perspective, this is the place to do it. Ryan's space is beyond convenient and everything we were looking for. The place is modern and spacious and exactly what you need while away from home. We discovered a new Sandusky-- and we will be back for sure! :)"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures and prior reviews are spot on. Arrival is very easy; with the coded key box there are no worries about arriving at a specific time. Yes, there is some noise from the bar downstairs, but it‚Äôs not excessive and doesn‚Äôt go very late in the evening. We didn‚Äôt cook, but the kitchen seemed to have enough to prepare meals; there was even a decent selection of spices as well as the usual leftover items from previous guests.
Tip: If you‚Äôre a coffee lover, Boom Town Coffee is a block away. In addition to making good coffee, they‚Äôll grind beans for you to use in the Mr. Coffee drip maker in the kitchen and then enjoy on the large rooftop deck."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Ryan‚Äôs apartment. The location is great, it‚Äôs walking distance to several bars/restaurants. We would stay again for sure."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would recommend this stay to anyone. Great location in downtown Sandusky. Communication was flawless. The space had tons of room, was very clean and had all of the amenities one could need. View from the deck was great and showed off the bay. Only thing to be aware of is that the space has windows to show the rock climbing wall and is over a bar so there can be some noise. Would def stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Again thank you for sharing a great place for us to relax
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, easy communication!"
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"only had one roll of toilet paper. No paper towels. Ants all over the floor by the sliding glass door. The couch was broken, and had two by fours hold it for underneath and extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. One of the bedroom door does not close. No washer and dryer was extremely strange. The actual key to get into the door at the top of the stair Took quite the extra time to get it just right in order to unlock.
The positives, you can‚Äôt beat the location it was perfect it was a cool bar downstairs. Definitely felt safe, place was clean, they had some games."

Tons of cute shops to walk to -we loved Boom Coffee, The Maca Root Juice Bar, and the tacos and margaritas at OH Taco were awesome! It‚Äôs a super walkable location and a quick ten minute drive to a Cedar Point.
We didn‚Äôt need to communicate with the host much, but we received the check-in and check-out instructions in a timely manner and check-in was very easy.
The street parking is also free and plentiful. We were always able to park right outside the building."

The master suite is large and bathroom nice. Bed was comfortable. Loved the patio overlooking the water! Can‚Äôt say that enough.

It involved horseback riding in Oak Harbor, the drive thru Safari in Port Clinton, fishing at Shoreline Park and going to Nickel Plate Beach for a quick dip. Ryan‚Äôs hip loft in downtown Sandusky was the perfect location. We had a wonderful late lunch at the Landmark and morning coffee drinks at Boom Town Coffee. So many cute shops in the area. The magnificent views from the deck of Lake Erie with Cedar Point in the distance and the cool view of the rock climbing wall iwas all that was needed to impress my 11 and 13 yr old girls and their friends. It was a short over night stay with all of us wishing to stay longer to kayak and explore some more. We‚Äôll definitely be back. Thank you again!"

Ryan was quick to communicate the rooms availability and get us into the loft within two hours. The whole unit was very inviting with comfortable common spaces, blankets, books, and lots of natural light. Even as a winter destination, Sandusky has a lot to offer and the loft was in a great location to walk through downtown or to the lake, visit a playground, or get a last minute meal at one of the neighboring restaurants. I would definitely book again."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures to this loft do not do it justice. I definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay at an Airbnb in Sandusky to stay.

2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This condo was a great alternative to a cramped hotel room and probably more affordable‚Äîwell worth the cost! Host communication was friendly and quick. The condo‚Äôs location, amenities, spaciousness and modern style and were on point. Bedding and linens were clean and comfy. I‚Äôm a neat freak and might recommend a deep clean, but overall it was a great place. We loved OH Taco and Maca Root juice bar (right downstairs) and ZINC Brasserie.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After many years of staying in Sandusky hotels to visit family, Ryan‚Äôs place was such a nice home away from home. It‚Äôs very quiet at night, with comfortable beds, clean modern bathrooms and kitchen, and plenty of space to spread out. We loved the rooftop patio and saw some great sunsets - and one night of an amazing lightning show from the storms rolling across the bay. We ran into Ryan a few times, and he and the team at Paddle and Climb were very friendly and helpful. It was great having Maca Root downstairs to get a latte or smoothie in the morning and enjoy their patio. Wonderful location for walks along the bay and near our favorite restaurants and bars downtown."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying at the Sky Loft made our vacation 10x better. We usually rent a motel when visiting Cedar Point, but I‚Äôm extremely happy I found Ryan‚Äôs place and booked it. It was a great deal and the condo is super clean and well-stocked with kitchen supplies and anything else you might need. The beds are SUPER comfortable and I want to get the same memory foam mattress for my own place. The condo itself was very attractive and has a lovely porch to watch sunsets on the lake from. Communicating with Ryan was very simple and he responds quickly. He offered some tips for visiting the local islands and checked in a couple times throughout our stay to make sure everything was okay. I will 100% book the Sky Loft again next time I visit CP."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was wonderful! Very nice, stylish place. Walking distance to many establishments. The rooftop patio had a great view but nice selection of board games and cards when it was raining. The outdoor grill was very useful also. Would definitely recommend and look forward to staying here again in the future!"

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures on air bnb look very nice which is what got my attention. But once we got in the condo and got settled in there was a lot of dust everywhere, picked up the rug in the sitting area and swept tons of dirt looks like they hadn‚Äôt swept in months. The kitchen needed cleaned before we cooked and some of the dishes were dirty. Even though I always rinse out dishes before I use them somewhere else , these were dirty . The kitchen chairs were missing screws . My mother in law fell. I messaged them about it and they told me I was basically lying that they had just screwed everything in before we arrived which I knew was a lie because the screw was totally missing . And not only one chair but 3 of them. And they did not come and fix them and that and the fall happened the first day we were there so we couldn‚Äôt all sit at the table the whole stay. It was a very nice lay out and nice decorations. And responses were quick when I had questions. But cleanliness was not there . And the problem with the chair wasn‚Äôt fixed. They just automatically asked if we wanted refunded. I just would have been happy to have the 80.00 or more dollars I paid them to clean when I left to be refunded because I cleaned more while we were here then they did before we arrived . I will add CastawayBay was very worth the trip though! Me and my kids had a blast!"

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was incredible! Right downtown, fully furnished and even fully equipped kitchen. Extremely clean, not even a water spot in the shower. It‚Äôs downtown but still off the Main Street enough to be private. I wish I had stayed longer and not for work but the place was amazing!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zero complaints. Beautiful place. huge balcony where you can see the water. Everything was extremely clean. There was a binder with great locations for all meals, activities, etc. Quick responses from host and he was always more than happy to help find what we needed. Wow, just wow! This was my first airbnb, too. Dangerous to set the standard this high lol."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful space! Very stylish and thoughtful, with all the comforts of home. It was close to the water, which added a much needed serenity to what is typically a whirlwind trip to cedar point. Ryan was an excellent host, responding quickly to our questions and even answering some before we thought of it. The crew at Paddle and Climb were very welcoming and accommodating, as well. I‚Äôd give 6 stars if I could. The only downside is we didn‚Äôt want to leave! I can‚Äôt wait to plan my next trip and stay in Ryan‚Äôs sky loft. Thanks again! Cheers"

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a few issues upon arrival. First time she was quick to respond and rectify the issue. However, the second time she was not and we had to deal with the issue for the remainder of our stay. Upon expressing my concerns and issues after our stay, she was not very apologetic for not getting back to us and fixing the problem."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, walks on to all the downtown Sandusky restaurants, pier, etc."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the Office for just one night. Due to a change in plans, we were there less than 12 hrs. It was late when we arrived & we were tired. Still, we had trouble finding the building. (I‚Äôm sure it didn‚Äôt help that our GPS wasn‚Äôt talking!)
I share this to give you context. Once we found the building & figured out where to park, we easily found our way to the unit using the instructions provided. It was well-equipped & we slept well on the bed. My husband was especially grateful for the Keurig, coffee pods & creamer. And if we had arrived earlier, the location would have been perfect for exploring!
But the wall-to-wall carpet was stained in several places near the door, the shelves in the bathroom were dusty, the bottom of the shower walls were yellow, the bath mats were dirty & there was no direct lighting over the sink.
Also, the only response I got from the host was after booking, even though I messaged her on the way and upon check-out. Now 36 hrs later, still nothing!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is excellent with much to do and very easy access to places such as Cedar Point. The room was comfortable enough for a short stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I thought this Airbnb was super cute! It was right by the water so it was nice to wake up to. If you‚Äôre enjoying downtown Sandusky or going to Cedar Point; it was a less than 10 minute drive to the park! Thank you!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our only suggestion would be better lighting in the room.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was amazing if you are interested in sleeping there and exploring the many nearby restaurants. Unfortunately the wifi was pretty slow so we had to work at a nearby Starbucks and couldn‚Äôt work in the room. When we booked the place we were also so excited to sit out on the patio but when we got there there were a lot of spiders so we were afraid to use it. I know this is common for the area, but I just wanted to let future travelers know. The room itself was very clean and comfortable though."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the stay was great! Easy to find and plenty of parking.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our brief stay at the apartment. Nice little town with great restaurants in walking distance.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We often visit the area to get some delicious CLAG Brewery craft beers and Small City Taphouse food. Nikki's place was the most perfect location we could have asked for! Walkable to our most important spots and a bonus of many other places nearby that we hadn't yet seen. We would absolutely come back to this Airbnb!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is everything, so being wiithin walking distance to Lake Erie, visually able to see Cedar Point, view the water, and walk to great places to eat, parks and bench seating on the water, is what we really wanted. Our room was nice and clean, we had easy access to the courtyard. However, the courtyard was covered in spider webs and far from inviting. Our toilet had black mold and needed cleaning. We also noticed noise above us, either an apartment or part of the airbnb. When Nikki did reply she gave helpful ideas of places to eat. We didn't meet our host.
We hope to make a day trip back to Sandusky sometime to follow up on the things we didn't have time to enjoy. Sandusky is a nice place to visit."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice clean place in upcoming area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a room with microwave, fridge and coffee maker. It was all that we needed for the 2 nights we were there for the Ironman event.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at The Office was super comfy and easy to get to the sites downtown.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great in place of a hotel. We were only there for about 12 hours so it was literally only for a place to sleep. That said, the place was nice and clean with easy street parking right out front. We walked around the town in the morning and found a great coffee place close by as well as multiple places to eat. Would definitely recommend staying at!"

It was a bit smaller than we thought it would be and we could hear every movement that was made as well as conversations that took place on the back patio. It woke my husband and I up off and on through the night. Other than that we enjoyed our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed to check in early if possible. Nikki was very accommodating. She told me she would have her cleaning staff do they room first as soon as it was empty. She called back a short time later and informed me it would be ready by the time I got there. It was. I like everything about the ambiance. It was one of the top places I have stayed.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a sports tournament and needed an well-located, clean, safe and comfortable home base to rest and recharge after several hours traveling and after a long tournament day. Tessa's property delivered. It was all we could have hoped for: easy to find, close to sports facilities as advertised, as well as restaurants and shopping, but still in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood. The guesthouse itself was comfortable, clean and had every amenity you could ask for. Having recently had a back injury, bed comfort was a big concern, but the next morning was the best it had felt in over a week. For less than/approximate price of a hotel suite, you get the entire guest house. Privacy, room to roam and relax on comfortable couches, cook your own meals or eat take-out at the kitchen counter on the counter stools or at the 4-top table. Our host was friendly, responsive and accommodating of our uncertain scheduling, thanks Tessa! We've bookmarked and will return in the future."

I especially appreciated the whole home ""NuTone"" intercom system which I remember as a luxury installed in homes in the sixty's. My grandson had no idea what it was...I only wish it worked! I would like to know what it would take to make it operational because it would be a cool blast from the past for younger generations to enjoy.
We very much enjoyed our stay and will stay again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was WONDERFUL!
We know you are all just offering this loft since finishing it. We LOVED it! The only reason we gave 4 stars 2 times was the need for a communication/instruction sheet inside the loft or added to the Air BnB info. For example...where to find the garbage dumpster. We had to ask someone and the first two we asked didnt know either. You would have to ask...its a bit hidden.
We didnt know the space between the living room and big bedroom was open except for the blinds. That could be a big disclaimer if couples are sharing the place. We had our 2 teen girls in their. They whisper anyways...lol!
We struggled to find the keys when we got there. It was another thing yhe people we asked had no clue. They lived there. It might be the ""north of"" pool directions or what ever it was. Maybe something like...When driving in and coming up to the pool area, there is a small building attached and the key boxes are on the side of the building. Maybe its just me though...üòä
If there were instructions for anything at all you would like done inside the loft before one leaves, like dishes in the dishwasher, towels in the tub or shower etc. renters could help some. Just ideas.
Thank you again for helping us quickly with feedback with the sink drain pipe.
It was just great! Everything was so nice.
We hope to return"

This is one of those ‚Äúsecret‚Äù spots that you feel lucky having been there. I pray I can someday craft a home as beautiful, comfortable, and unique as the Siesta in Sandusky.
Everything you could think of is catered to before you even know you want it. I enjoyed practicing some origami in the kit provided in the living room ‚Äî there are puzzles, DVDs, and board games as well if you want to pass time.
She left locally baked Buckeyes in the kitchen so we could try an Ohio favorite. You could see the host‚Äôs warm personality through the decor and labelling placed in many places.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place was absolutely perfect for our stay! It was very clean and had everything we needed for our Memorial Day weekend holiday getaway. The apartment is well stocked if you wanted to cook your own food there. We ended up mostly eating out, but it is always nice to have that option. It is super cozy, cute, and well decorated just as the photos indicate! The neighborhood was very peaceful and quiet. We had a great time going to Cedar Point and exploring the area. Overall I would highly recommend Lori's place and look forward to staying there again when we make it back for another visit!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Lori's Airbnb more than 5 stars, I would!!! It has the amenities and attention to detail that would be provided at a hotel with the amazing privacy that an Airbnb user strives for when looking for an amazing location.
If your goal is to be cost-effectively spoiled by your surroundings while visiting Sandusky, this is your location!
We will stay here immediately, if she has room for a booking, anytime we visit in the future!!!
What Airbnb host has glassware for a newlywed couple to keep to celebrate their marriage??? I am a Superhost and I was absolutely amazed!!!! Amazed!!!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Lori‚Äôs place and when it was time to leave my son said he never wanted to leave! She had everything you could need and then some. Forgot your lotion (like me)? No problem. Condiments, hair spray, tooth brush? It‚Äôs all there! We didn‚Äôt drive more than 20 minutes to get anywhere we went, but there are so many places within 10 minutes or less. Shopping, dining, attractions, fishing. There‚Äôs even a Little Clinic nearby if you end up with an emergency like us. Lori herself was friendly, and we loved her dog! I had an issue with the thermostat and she was quick to help. We have to make a quick trip back up to Sandusky sometime before the summer ends and I hope we can get Lori‚Äôs place again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori communicated quickly, and clearly. She had a few nice little touches (like a small assortment of snacks, firesticks, etc.) and the place is cozy and immaculate.

The space was so comfortable and cozy and was we needed to decompress from our crazy lives. We had everything we needed and more! We thought the space was immaculate, which is super important to us. We loved the charm of the historical home as well. We loved it so much that we are planning a trip to return this summer and hope to stay again! Thanks Lori for the fabulous stay!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this is the second time I've stayed here and I thought it couldn't get better but then it did! last time the beds were a little rough to sleep on but Lori ADAPTED! this time she had different mattress firmness in each room, neatly labeled, and I slept SO much better! I love all of the little items Lori sprinkles around to really make you feel at home. I forgot my face wash and the makeup wipes in the bathroom really saved my life. not to mention this place is just so adorable and tastefully decorated. And you can't beat the price! honestly this is the best AND ONLY place you should be staying in the Sandusky area!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cutest place! We arrived late after an evening at CP Halloweekends. Parking could not have been easier - we had a spot right in front of the house. Quiet street. Check in was seamless, and the space was spacious, clean, and well-furnished/decorated. We loved the little touches, like a fan in each bedroom and noise machines for sleeping. Lori was a great host and even offered a later check out since the place wasn‚Äôt booked the next day. Will definitely be back when visiting Sandusky!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place to stay
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori was the best host I have had in my Airbnb experience. She was very quick to reach out with any and all info needed and was a very polite woman.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to Cedar Point, you MUST stay here. Lori and her dog Eskimo were absolutely incredible. She was so friendly and accommodating.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home with responsive and friendly host! Great location and easy parking.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! Everything was clean, neat, and so pretty! We asked about a washer/dryer and Lori left some detergent. So thoughtful!! Filtered water in the refrigerator was refreshing after a long day out!!
If you are used to keeping your place cooler than 72 in the summer, this one won't. The A/C programming changed to 76 after several hours, so nights were warmer than we liked. Lori tried to fix the programming, but it still reset at midnight. We are from Arkansas and keep our A/C on 68 in summer, so this is something to think about if you're like us. However, this would not keep us from coming back. It was perfect!!!
We even left a couple shirts in the closet and Lori shipped them to us. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for your concerns and wanting our stay to be as perfect as it could!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"only rented this place for one night to rest our heads after a long day at cedar point and only regret not staying longer. we were going to rent a hotel room in the area instead but the prices were outrageous which lead us to this lovely diamond in the rough. this place is so beautifully detailed and I found so much excitement in exploring it all. Lori really thought of everything from filtered water, to spices in the cabinet, to even little cheese slices for grilled cheese and other snacks. I loved all of the little notes. Even when the lock box was broken she was careful to leave me a note of where to find the key. I would warn that the beds are quite stiff so if that's not your jam just be prepared and they AC can be a little fussy. but take those more as warning signs than deterrents because this place is too delightful to not visit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we loved it look forward to staying again
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and I loved the feel of the home, definitely will be coming back for a trip to cedar point."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved Lori‚Äôs place! She took a lot of time to make sure the apartment had everything we needed! My husband is a Sandusky native, so we knew the location would be perfect! The beds weren‚Äôt comfortable for us, but that‚Äôs a personal preference. Lori was extremely responsive and I loved the decor!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lori's upstairs apartment is a beautiful, well thought out and modern amenity set in an historically old property . A wonderful mix of history in the building frame, ecclectic south west decor but not lacking any of the comforts of home and presented to a very high standard. we found downtown and the lakeside to be 10-20 minutes walk away and cedar point to be 10-25 minutes drive depending on traffic. There is a great pizza restaurant/take away just 5 mins away-Cameo. we also loved the dockside cafe, 15 mins walk away. This is my wifes favourite airbnb and one of my top 10!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lori's place was the perfect spot to stay after a long day at Cedar Point! The accommodations and decor were absolutely lovely. I would definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfy beds, great location for Cedar Point. Charmingly decorated. Gracious host that went above and beyond when our daughter decided to play ‚Äúhide our belongings and forget about them‚Äù! Thoughtful attention to detail in every room and aspect. Cool place!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely apartment in a neighborhood where me and my friend felt secure. Sandusky was only a stop through but we took advantage of our time and visited the Marblehead Lighthouse. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Highly recommend this location for anyone traveling to Sandusky,"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an extremely comfortable place to stay in Sandusky, OH with an interior like no other, which is only minutes from Cedar Point... then this is your place!!! The host, Lori, is one of the most wonderful people you will ever meet, and her pupper Eskimo is the sweetest boy! She was very accommodating, respectful, and communicative prior to, and during our visit! Not only did she allow us to check-in early since we were driving from Buffalo, NY, but she gave us a list of all of the fireworks shows around town (we arrived on July 4th), as well as parking directions to/from CP, and a convenient map right on the side of the fridge! Even on both 91¬∞ days that we were there, our AirBnB was cool and air conditioned which was a massive relief as well. We will definitely be coming back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a fantastic place to stay in Sandusky, look no further. This newly renovated private upstairs two bedroom apartment is everything you can want. Lori, the owner who lives downstairs, put an amazing amount of effort into making this place the perfect small town vacation getaway. If you are looking for a place to stay to go to Cedar Point or any of the other Sandusky attractions, this is right in the middle of all of it. Great communication and many small touches here and there that make all the difference. Cannot recommend it enough!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wish we could have stayed more than one night! Beautiful and spacious. We will definitely stay there again if we come back to the area!

If we ever come back out to Sandusky we will for sure be coming back here to stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was cute, clean, comfortable, and cozy. It was exactly as advertised by Lori on Airbnb and the use of her place was quick and easy.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lori is an exceptional host. Great at communicating and even went out of her way to get my girlfriend some happy birthday decor. I went for Cedar Point and it was super close and easy to get to from there. The place is spacious and extremely well kept. Best Airbnb/host combo I‚Äôve ever been too. Can‚Äôt recommend her and her place enough! Will definitely try it to come back and stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely amazing stay! We were allowed to come an hour early (we got rained out at cedar point and everyone was soaked) so everyone could dry off, she was so so amazing.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay - the place was incredibly well located and pristine. We loved the old feature and the sympathetic restoration. The host, Lori, had bought some local buckeye chocolates for us to try and had so many other bits and pieces like shampoo and soap arranged for us, which were really lovely touches. Really can‚Äôt praise enough - keep doing what you‚Äôre doing Lori! If you‚Äôre thinking about visiting - don‚Äôt hesitate, this place is perfect for Cedar Point or a getaway."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Omg! Our stay was great. It was a family Cedar Point Birthday celebration weekend. Lori was so welcoming. We met her on our way to dinner for my hubby's birthday. Her eclectic home was just as welcoming with such history in the ceiling, Tiffany lamps, glass windows, art work and other furnishings mixed with minor modern updates that didn't overshadow the history of the home. Charles was greeted with a birthday balloon. She also left treats and snacks for us as well. The bedrooms were cozy and the beds were very comfortable. Lori was quick to respond to any questions asked.
The house was very clean as well. It was overall just a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. We would love to stay again.."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best Airbnb yet!! I have visited quite a few locations and Lori‚Äòs place was just fantastic. Perfect for what we were looking for. A beautiful house wonderfully remodeled very close to Cedar point. She had all the perfect little amenities and extras that you would look for. Even set a little fire for us outback to get to know each other better. Her dog Eskimo is a dear and loving baby and we will come back here for sure!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori‚Äôs place is a great stay if you‚Äôre headed over to Cedar Point or in the area. If you‚Äôre a fan of old houses, add this to your list. She‚Äôs lovingly turned this historic gem into a comfy modern stay with notes to old charm. We stayed for a night, but this seems like a good place for a longer stay as well. It‚Äôs also bigger than we anticipated from the photos and well stocked."

Lori's rules were well established and written out. Any questions or concerns that I had during my stay were answered or attended to in a timely fashion on the app.
As a guest and home owner, I realized that her and I had similar guidelines as it pertains to keeping a living space livable. As a first time AirBnBer,
I'm super glad I picked Lori as a host and I would definitely repeat a stay at the ""Siesta in Sandusky"" if a future opportunity presented itself!"

Lori is a wonderful host and I could not be happier.
Many thanks!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would rate this place as one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. Every minor detail was perfectly thought-out with lots of lovely artistic touches in every corner of the apartment, making it a perfect cozy vacay-space. It was a calm street yet near to the sites we wanted to see. I would definitely recommend it."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I had a great time in Sandusky, visiting cedar point for the day. Lori was considerate and kind in every interaction. The place itself was gorgeous, truly felt like a home away from home. We only got to stay one night but if we‚Äôre ever back in Sandusky, we know where to lay our heads."
,,,"This was the worst Airbnb I ever stayed at. The minute I walked into the property I felt like it was dirty. The bed frame would make really loud squeaky noises every time we would seat or lay on it. I had booked this property for 3 nights but only stayed for one night and and had to book another property because I couldn‚Äôt sleep on that bed. Also, we saw a cockroach and spider the same day we arrived. The shower looked dirty as well. The host didn‚Äôt even respond when I reached out."
