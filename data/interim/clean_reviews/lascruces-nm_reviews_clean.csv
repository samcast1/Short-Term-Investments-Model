2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend. The only thing that was disappointing was that the jacuzzi water was murky so we didn’t use it.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly as advertised - so beautiful and spacious! Michael was a fantastic and very kind host. The only issue we had was with a very large number of cockroaches both outside and inside. Michael handled this as well as he possibly could have and sent someone to spray immediately. This did result in many dead roaches but we found ourselves then cleaning them up and avoiding the backyard for the rest of the stay as there were still some crawling around. The backyard was the main selling point for us so we were disappointed when we didn't end up wanting to be out there with the bugs. I don't think Michael could have handled this any differently / better, he was great! Just unfortunate luck."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Place is super convenient and close to everything. We felt safe and had no issues with the location. When we went to check-in at 3:45(check-in is at 3), the cleaners were still inside cleaning and said they wouldn’t be done for another 30 minutes. We had driven 9 hours with our dogs and child so this was super inconvenient and unacceptable. I immediately wrote the host and he basically said it’s part of their cleaning and turnover process? What? No. We had to drive around to kill time and when we returned the cleaners left. When they left, they left chairs and barstools all up on the tables and you could definitely tell it had been rushed. I would have been happier if the host had been apologetic but to just brush it off isn’t the way to go."

2023-07-01,2.0,Group trip,"Hello,
We were so disappointed with this place. Many things in the house didn't work or were damaged to the point one of the bedroom alarm smoke detectors was missing and we have an issue with the smoke alarm going off on us several times making it impossible to be at the house. Luckily wasn't any fire. We couldn't have a good night's sleep due to the poor quality of the bedroom mattresses. AC never reached the temperature that was set up. It was really HOT! and unfortunately hostess never responded to this issue.
Housekeeping of the house could be better. Overall my and my family didn't enjoy our stay in this residence."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Michael's place. I am fussy about cleanliness and the Villa exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated that the surfaces of kitchen counters, kitchen island
and vanities were free of little knick-knacks and decorative accessories. We've rented some places that were so full of the owner's items that we didn't have room to unpack our own things.
We discovered a wonderful restaurant on this trip to Las Cruces : Le Rendez-vous.
An unassuming little place with delicious French-inspired food and pastries and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."

We would definitely stay again but would recommend the host provide wash cloths, hand towels for all the sinks, install the fire alarm in master bedroom, change lock code as it was pretty easy to guess, master bathtub hot water wasn't working, and would also hire weekly spa care personnel as the hot tub was grimy."

The house looked nice, new and clean and they allowed all of my pets to stay for a small pet fee which I was very thankful for.
Carlos was extremely responsive and helpful, he accepted the booking within an hour which put my mind at ease for the long drive I had the next day. The day of he sent out instructions to locate the house and get inside. As mentioned in the listing it is in a new development so my navigation was unable to find it but Carlos gave very clear instructions on how to get there from a known landmark that my nav could find.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I might be too picky, coming from a big city, the mosquitoes is what made me not love the place, plus the fact that my furry family didn't have much of a place to play outside. The backyard was very small and there are two more houses in the backyard, we were separated from them with a gate, but It didn't feel as private as I would like to feel when I am at home. If you are like me I would recommend you coming in fall or winter when you will not have to deal with the mosquitoes, and don't bring a big dog, the yard is almost ok for a small dog. If you don't have dogs, the place is awesome. The house is a sleeper, It is an ordinary house, when you drive in to it. The parking is another issue, if you have a long car like we do, you will have to park it in between the two cars of the other residents. Once you enter in the house
, the place is ABSOLUTELY astounding, my wife was very impressed with the paintings you have. The furniture was incredible and your kitchen is very ergonomic."

The pool and outdoor space were perfect, especially for those hotter days. We were there for work, and hanging by the pool made it that much better. Historic Mesilla is just 10 minutes away.

our girls’ trip. We had more than enough room.
The house was very warm and inviting. It was stocked with an enormous amount of amenities. The decor had a modern feel with a Southwestern artfulness. The house was very clean. The large windows in the first living room and Master Bedroom opened up the home. The beds were very comfortable. The pool was perfect for hot days. The best was hanging by the pool watching the sunset.
You have complete privacy. I would guesstimate each house sits on one to one and a half acres. A roadrunner strolled pass me when taking garbage out. A Great Horned Owl surprised us one night while we were sitting on the edge of the pool.
Jorge was a great host. He responded immediately when we had questions. Great communication.
An enormous thank you to our hosts! We most definitely would rent this home again if ever in Las Cruces. Five Stars!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a magical weeklong stay with our family. Pictures do not do this place justice. Serene setting, absolute immaculate interior. Sunsets that will take your breath away. The pool was an absolute gem. This stay was the most relaxed I have been in years. You will want for nothing at this beautiful home. We had initially planned to take an overnight stay during the trip to Carlsbad, but actually changed our plans because we did not want to leave this property. We had an initial malfunction with air conditioning which was beyond the owners control, but Jorge went above and beyond to address this issue. This will officially be our home away from home in the future. If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would."

The furniture is nice, beds are very comfortable, communication with Jorge was excellent, the pool is great. It felt like we were staying in someone’s nice home more than at a rental. Very nice location for us as well. We’d stay again and I’m sure we will! If you have small children like we do, you’ll need to keep an eye on them as the home is quite ideally set up for adults and older kids."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful retreat and peaceful/quiet surroundings. The home was clean, comfortable, gorgeously decorated, and had everything we needed. Ideal location in a great neighborhood. An hour between White Sands National Park and El Paso, a short drive from Old Mesilla Plaza and the Farmer’s Market for local shopping and restaurants.
Host was so nice and personable. We can’t thank Jorge enough for making us feel so welcome in his home that when we were in a pinch (in a state where we knew no one), I felt comfortable enough to call to ask for help. We realized our car battery died just as we were headed to catch our flight at the airport. The hosts’ lovely family came right away and saved us from missing our flight."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family was in Las Cruces to celebrate our daughter's medical school graduation. We love Las Cruces and this home was the icing on the cake for our stay. When I say ""everything was perfect"", it is an understatement. The home itself is absolutely beautiful with every amenity one could wish for. We have never stayed in a home that was so well furnished from the comfortable beds all the way to the dishes ,platters, and outdoor furnishings. There were even saucer sleds for us to take to White Sands.
Upon arrival, Jorge had a bottle of wine and 2wine glasses set up on the kitchen counter... such a welcoming touch. There were toothbrushes, toothpaste, guest slippers and robes in each room as well.
Jorge was extremely attentive....the coffee maker was not working the first morning we were there , and he had a brand new one on the doorstep by that afternoon ! He also delivered a new iron as the one provided was leaking.
We will definitely return ! Thank you Jorge and Veronica!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is AMAZING. Exactly what the pictures show. It is FULLY stocked with EVERYTHING you need. They did not skimp on necessities.

Host was very available and checked in via text multiple times. Highly recommend this property."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private Oasis.
The house is fabulous. Great location just a few minutes away from the Organ Mountains, golf and downtown. The huge lot makes it extremely private. We arrived after dark and thought we may have trouble finding it but Veronica and Jorge have placed beautiful solar lights around the property and we saw their welcome glow as we pulled up. The kitchen is very well furnished. The beds are comfortable. The house is very clean, and the living room and kiva looks like a page out of a magazine showing New Mexican adobe design. We were there in late July and the high was 99 degrees.....sue....it was a ""dry"" heat, but the pool in the walled in, private backyard felt great. The pool area has great a great seating area including a table the is in shade most of the day. As nice as the house is you would be hard pressed to find more accommodating hosts than Veronica and Jorge. They are excellent communicators and make you feel like welcome guests. They are always available should the need arise. Looking for a private oasis with a pool> Rent this place."

There was plenty of space to spread out, and the large covered patio and backyard are really nice. There were plenty of towels, soap, TP, and coffee with a small coffee maker, but if you have more than two coffee drinkers you may want to bring a Keurig or large coffee maker.

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our stay every minute. The photos don't do enough justice of how spacious the place is, it was def one of our highlights of our trip. We had everything we need, everything is clean and easy to get access to. Would definitely want to book this place again If we are ever back in the area. All of our friends stayed here loved it.

From the moment we arrived, it was nothing but sheer delight entire property is filled with charm, artistic flow, and thoughtful personal touches throughout. Christian isn’t amazing host, willing to give you as much privacy or as much hands-on assistance and recommendation as you’d like, the backyard is simply magical. There was a full moon and a starry night sky during our stay. It couldn’t have been more perfect."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kristian’s home was equal parts beautiful and serene. The balance of whimsical, functional and oh so comfy made this the perfect place for our quick trip. Our favorite spot to relax and reflect was the back porch. The neighborhood was adorable and friendly. Unfortunately we weren’t in town long enough to use the kitchen for more than a cup of coffee but it looked well equipped. We look forward to booking again anytime we’re in the area!"

I stayed during a business trip-next time I will add more days just to get stay a bit longer in this beautiful space and to enjoy the outdoor patio and gorgeous garden areas. Hosts was amazing and very responsive.💗"

One note: Being asked to do laundry and other chores while charging a $50 cleaning fee seems wrong. I'd recommend either removing the fee or not asking guests to wash their own sheets, towels etc."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stop over on our National Parks tour and we had a blast sledding in White Sands.

Just a quick drive to Old Mesilla with a great coffee and a brewery where we enjoyed an evening with a wonderful band!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Just loved the house! The decor was so charming, tons of unique pieces, lots of unexpected cozy corners. The remodel was obviously a labor of love.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We expected a small bungalow, but the home was much more spacious than the photos made it appear. The back patio was beautiful and we were actually able to use it for an hour one afternoon when the wind died down and the sun was shining directly on it. Great location, close to everything."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kristian’s for four nights and enjoyed every minute! The house is super clean and full of everything you might need. We appreciated the clean kitchen stocked with everything you might need for a short stay (and more!) and being able to use the washer and dryer. The house is tastefully decorated, peaceful and comfortable. I wish we had been there when it was warmer so we could have enjoyed the back porch and yard! Will definitely seek this place out when we return to Las Cruces. Thanks Kristian!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great place! Beautiful, and so homey. We were bummed that we could only stay one night! Would love to go back sometime."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is really great! It has great comfy couches and is really big. Also a large kitchen area with espresso and coffee. The street has very little traffic and a good view of the nearby mountains. Getting in was a lockbox code so that was easy. Great find!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so impressed with our stay at Kristian and Zeinab’s place! Home was exactly as described, beautiful aesthetic and serene location; one of the cleanest and most thoughtfully decorated AirBnBs I have ever booked.
Great value, responsive hosts…and an additional 5 stars for the welcoming patio with friendly neighborhood cat!
Wish we visited Las Cruces more often, would love to stay again, soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great base camp for Las Cruces. The host went above and beyond on several things, including the bed preparations. a very beautiful and elaborate setup on the beds with color combos, cool duvet.... Much appreciated.
The kitchen was pretty well sorted out as well. Appreciated some things were already there (salt / pepper / butter....) and loved the open space in Kitchen.
The tub was also great!
Love the backyard space as well. Was a tad dissapointed about not being able to use the firepalce outside or inside, but otherwise lovely stay. I understand the reasons they don't want folks using that today (high winds, safety....)
I would surely stay here again though."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, easily accessible to everything. An oasis of peace. I would absolutely stay again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristian’s home is beautiful and quiet, and centrally located in this nifty city.
Morning coffee or breakfast while lounging on the back deck in the elegant and private back garden is an especial pleasure amongst many if you stay here! There are coffee-making choices, too - a nice touch!
A note: many older bungalows in the area, outlets are scarce. If you need to keep devices charged this might prove a challenge.
All in all, a stay here gets our strong recommend: we’d happily come back to this gracious home!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There is not enough I can say about this amazing home. It is large, well appointed, has comfy beds, a soaking tub to die for, great heat and AC, a hot/cold bottled water dispenser, lovely outdoor seating and yard on a quiet (except for a very occasional train) safe street.
EXCEPT it has very poor lighting in the open design living room, dining room and kitchen. I'm old and the night vision is going, so I may be biased. Every other room is well lit so I don't know why these ceiling lights have such weak wattage lights in this large space. Definitely worth overlooking this issue to stay here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is so beautiful. Everything was high quality and comfortable. Backyard was extra special. Probably the nicest Airbnb I have stayed in this year. The beds were also very comfortable! Would stay again if available. Great place!!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here three nights and really enjoyed our time. The home is quiet and very clean. Kristian was responsive and helpful. The backyard is beautiful with a nice sitting area, although it was too cold out for us to enjoy it. We would stay again if we are ever in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place. The view was outstanding and the vicinity to everything was perfect. It was in pristine condition and I could not recommend it more.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In spite of Kristian's urgent family medical issues, he was extremely welcoming and kind, not to mention very responsive and proactive in communicating information prior to our arrival on the day. His property is beautiful and we enjoyed our stay immensely. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved Kristen’s home. It had everything we could possibly need. Loved the design and decor inside and out. Kristen was quick to respond to all my questions. Would definitely stay here if we pass through Las Cruces again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kristian’s place is just as wonderful as it looks. We were only in the area for one night, but wish we could’ve stayed longer just to spend more time at the house. Very beautifully decorated and truly the cleanest place I’ve ever stayed in (including airbnbs and hotels). Overall a fantastic stay, and if we ever come back to the area we will definitely stay here again. 10/10."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place! Great location. Was really impressed with all the detail that went into the home. Loved our stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful bungalow is truly a gem in the heart of Las Cruces! I fell in love with the home from the moment I saw the beautiful exterior, and it is a home that keeps on giving! Each room has a unique and modern style, and the home has much more room than it seems from the outside. The bathrooms are spacious and absolutely stunning and the backyard, which is also extremely spacious, is another treat in itself -- with a beautiful patio, a hammock, and several spots you can enjoy a cup of coffee or meal. And to top it off, the host was amazing -- super responsive, friendly, and helpful. Definitely recommend and will be coming back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kristian's bungalow is truly magical! I couldn't have asked for a better host and place to stay while visiting my birth city for the first time. I only wished I were able to enjoy it more. The home was immaculate and had every amenity one could hope for. Kristian was very communicative and even recommended some amazing eating/drinking spots to visit while I was there. The next time I visit Las Cruces this will be my #1 choice for places to stay. Highly recommended! A+

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an issue that was addressed immediately and Jessica went above and beyond.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was by far the best air bnb we’ve stayed at. Me, my boyfriend & dog were traveling cross country & stayed at a total of 4 air bnbs. This one was the best by far. Jessica thought of everything. We were able to enjoy ourselves, hot tub, and run our dog in the mini dog park. The view is incredible. I was even able to do a couple loads of laundry. And the cherry on top was feeding the animals in the morning. Will definitely stay here again! Thanks Jessica for being so thoughtful with your space!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to enjoy a peaceful getaway! Jessica is an awesome host and this location is well worth the trip!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s place is awesome!! Such a unique stay and well thought out.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed a brief stay here en route to a hiking trip! The back patio and hot tub were perfect for relaxing, and the farm fresh eggs were such a nice touch. The place was super clean and very dog friendly! Only wish we had longer here -- will plan to be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was very pretty and it was relaxing
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My favorite airbnb experience ever!! I stayed here with my partner and my dog while driving cross country. We had such a great time here. The bed was comfy, bathroom was clean and spacious. Had a washer & dryer. Outside had a hot tub, hammock and two fire pits, and two outdoor games to play. Only complaint, which I believe was my fault was that it was hot in the unit. We fed the animals and met the owner, who was super friendly! Asked about recommendations via messenger and owner responded promptly. We visited the white sands about 50 mins away from the property and the owner had sleds for us to use. Had a dog-run that was not listed in the description but a nice surprise!
Overall, we had a fantastic time, and loved that it was pet friendly. Host is friendly and responsive. Unit is clean and matched description, and went above and beyond expectations from the photos.
I don’t normally write reviews but this Airbnb was a place to write home about! Thank you!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was amazing, Jessica is a wonderful host. I am looking forward to staying here again in the future. 😊"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my favorite airbnb experience in eight years of bnbing! I love tiny homes and Jessica did an amazing job designing hers. The layout is incredibly thoughtful and contains every comfortable amenity. The pillows, blanket and bed were super comfortable and luxe. The bathroom is spacious, the kitchen is clean and modern. The patios were really nice too and we enjoyed sunset dinners! Jessica even provided farm fresh eggs. The stay is 50 minutes by highway from white sands national parks, and the host provided sleds for us which was great because the park doesn’t rent them. I would highly recommend staying here for a peaceful getaway and to experience a tiny but mighty home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay here. It was very clean and cozy. Would stay again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great find! An oasis in the desert. We loved everything about this place, especially the hot tub and that we could bring our furbabies.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Padma’s place as exactly as presented and was a great refuge for me and my little clan!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice for 2 people.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came for a staycation in my own city. I live on the outskirts and can’t drive due to a disability, so wanted the autonomy of a location close to downtown. It was perfect! Really nice place, great access. Also very nice to have the open-armed welcome for my dog. She’s a service dog, so must be given access — but it’s always especially nice to feel wanted! Hope to repeat this experience with this host — it was that good!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was quite nice and also walking distance to local bars and restaurants. We had a great visit as a couple and noticed a number of nice touches such as plenty of toiletries and a number of up to date local publications. would recommend and stay again for sure!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy and quiet place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our overnight stay at Padma’s place which was very nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking and the local coffee was a nice surprise. She was a great host! We would highly recommend her place to explore the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very quiet and private. Stayed in unit B and it met all the listed amenities along with being clean, functional and had charm. The place seems small but really wasn’t a problem at all with two of us. Bed super comfortable. Enjoyed the farm fresh eggs in the morning too!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for a full week with our large dog and made most of our meals in the kitchen. We requested early check-in and they were able to comply. The space was comfortable and well designed. The little courtyard was well loved by our pup who would lie in a sandy area while I read or napped in the sun or shade depending on the temperature. The sheets and towels were fragrance-free which is important to us. Las Cruces is not much of a walking city, however we were able to walk to the bookstore and craft market."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an adorable place to stay. It was clean, cute and comfortable! Had quick responses from Padma and with no problems. We will definitely stay again when we come back to Las Cruces!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here during our road trip throughout New Mexico and it was nice to come back to. It was a little hard to find where to go but we also came in around 9pm so that’s our fault. Las cruces is an interesting city there isn’t a whole lot to do there but we didn’t hang around too much anyways. The house was nice and clean when we got there and felt safe for us. It was about 40-50 mins from White Sands and about 3 1/2-4 hours from Albuquerque. Padma was super responsive and easy to communicate with!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute comfortable and clean. Well stocked kitchen and bath. Lots of extras. Nice place to stay easy walk to the market and downtown.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We will definitely return for another week. Great, comfortable king-size bed. Nice shower. Great kitchen and lots of little extras: coffee and tea and hot chocolate supplies, water filter. TV is great.
Padma and Laura were very helpful and responsive to any questions. Very good ""Guidebook"" to the BnB and surrounding area -- restaurants etc. Saturday Market was a highlight -- just a few blocks walk. Short drive to historic and charming village of Mesilla with several great restaurants. (Don't miss La Posta and The Andele Dog House patio.)
Be sure to hike in the Organ Mts. maybe 20 to 25 minute easy drive depending on which hikes you choose. We loved the Dripping Springs hike into the canyon and also Soledad Canyon. Beautiful trails. We saw an oryx family on one hike and mule dear herd on another. Great picture taking.
BIG thanks to superhost Padma and her assistant Laura."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay here. The location is perfect. Padma is an excellent host.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Casita Azul was a perfect home base for us while we explored Las Cruces. Very walkable area, close to the Farmer's Market, restaurants and the library. We appreciate that dogs are accepted and valued, our Chihuahua felt right at home! it was easy to make meals and relax in the evenings and stream sports and movies."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay here and again met our expectations. We enjoy having the convenience of the kitchen. We will stay again when we visit Las Cruces.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was beautiful and such a great home. The hosts were so sweet and accommodating.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. Padma had everything you could need at her place. She had a lot of little touches as well providing bathroom toiletries, coffee, breakfast food, etc. I have also never had a more responsive host. They were always available even before we got there. We were traveling with three small dogs, and I wanted to make sure they would be no trouble. The 3 of them were so comfortable and felt right at home. We were also able to get local coffee from them too. We will definitely be recommending to anyone coming to the Las Cruces area. Thank you Padma and Laura."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We arrived when it was dark. We did not see anything showing your address. Based our find from the photos you gave listed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is spacious, clean, quiet and charming in many respects. You will have much privacy. A neighbor has a dog that loves to bark, but if you don't mind a little of that, you'll get along quite well."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described, close to downtown bars and restaurants."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Padma’s place was very well kept and comfortable. Location is great as well with many restaurants close by in walking distance. She had many helpful little suggestions and great communicator.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"When my husband and I walked in to this little place, We were struck by the beautiful colors and the general vibe which was cozy and sweet.
Being dog lovers, we know how much work it takes to keep a place clean and this place was spotless. I really couldn't even tell animals had ever even been in the place by looking at it or smelling, no problems at all. Just a beautiful cozy spot. We enjoyed it so much. Thank you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I really like the location. Place itself was very comfortable. I wish we could’ve stayed longer
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay. There were a few neighborhood dogs who loved to bark at everything and anything, but that’s obviously not in control of the hosts. The hosts were proactive and responsive in their communication. We would stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Padma’s place was absolutely lovely with every single detail thought out! We loved all the decor, the fresh eggs, and how clean it was!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good stay here. The train at night is pretty loud but we had brought a fan with us so the white noise covered the sound quite well. Very comfortable bed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely Casita and was perfect for my 3 night stay while I was in town for a dog show. The private entrance yard was great for my dogs and the Casita was roomy, super clean, and very cute. I struggled a bit with finding the entrance and parking space, but that was only because I didn't look at the very descriptive photos that were in the check-in instructions like I should have! Padma was very kind and immediately responsive when I asked questions about getting in - even though it was completely MY fault for not seeing the photos! There was a neighbor dog across the street that barked a LOT (saw this in a previous review too)...but I never saw the dog...and it was not enough to deter me from staying again - this was still one of my favorite AirBNB locations so far and I hope to return to it again the next time I'm in town!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean space. Perfect for our needs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great overnight stay at Padma's place as part of a longer road trip. Padma's place was clean and easily accessible. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place in Las Cruces!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was well situated, well equipped and clean. We heard the railroad overnight once and the neighbors dog every morning; if you wake up early, not an issue, but nice to know if you like to sleep in."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love staying at Padma’s place. It’s our fave when we are in Cruces!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"La Casita was great! It was nice and cozy! She provides fresh eggs, english muffins, coffee, creamer, sugar, etc. Everything described was accurate and casita was very clean. My husband, pup and I loved it! We will definitely we checking out her other listings soon! Only complaint we had was that the area where casita is located is very dark but other than this everything was absolutely wonderful! Don’t forget to check out the Farmer’s Market Saturday mornings, which is walking distance! Thanks so much, Padma!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we booked this place last minute and it ended up being perfect. it was so comfortable and had everything we needed. i would absolutely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area. there were so many personal touches included so we felt right at home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! We stayed here for the night driving across the country. The bed was huge and everything was really great. Pet friendly there is a little gated area where my dog used to go to the bathroom. Padma's instructions were very clear and everything was easy to navigate. The house was very spacious lots of room and very cute!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay! The home was clean and adorable. We appreciated the extra touches like the water bottles in the fridge and the guide books on the coffee table! Amazing hosts, thank you!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the cute place to stay while I traveled across country!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adorable casita! When you first walk in, you are kind of thrown back by the bedroom being the first thing you see, but then you walk through the bedroom and are nicely surprised by the rest of the space. You could easily stay here a week! The kitchen living room and dining room are a great space. I feel you could even do a business trip here and feel super comfortable! The decor is absolutely adorable and a fresh change to everyone's brown houses and decor. The bathroom is pretty small, but works. I would suggest a pocket door. This place even has a small back yard to chill in, or let your furry friends outside."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Padma and the place was perfect. Clean, beautifully decorated, lovely amenities and touches. Super comfortable bed. My pup was happy there too. It would have felt better for me to be with someone when I stayed since the entrance is down a little alleyway (glad I arrived in daylight) and I was traveling alone. Nothing about the place made me feel that way necessarily. It's more about me going to new places in new towns and not being familiar enough with my surroundings."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Padma's place was great and very central- I was able to walk all over town from there (despite the heat!). Padma was extremely communicative and check-in was super easy.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The casita was absolutely perfect! So we’ll decorated and free of clutter. Fresh eggs in the fridge and every little extra you could think of.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had a great stay with my dog Ron
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable place! A place I would stay at again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Padma’s place was the perfect place for us and our 2 pups to stop overnight on our road trip- check in was easy and everything was super clean and nice. Exactly what we needed for a quick, cozy night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was great and the house is super cute and perfect for a weekend stay. The small private fenced area made it easy to bring the dogs. Overall great stay with responsive and helpful hosts. The only hiccup was the AC. Since you can only run one mini unit at a time without the breaker flipping, you have to choose between cool bedroom or cool living area and the half of the house not being cooled is unbearably hot and not safe to leave the dogs in."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Padma’s place was perfect for 2 people who wanted to be close to downtown and things to do. The neighborhood was very walkable, the house was cute and well-appointed, and Padma was very friendly and accessible. We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location was cute, affordable, and easily accessible.
My boyfriend and I were traveling through Las Cruces and arrived to the Airbnb very late. It was an easy check in and check out. Because we arrived so late we didn’t fully get to take in the amenities of the space, but from observation everything was clean, comfortable, and cozy.
The space is small but has everything you need to feel at home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I spent four nights in Padma's cute and clean casita. Looks just like the photos. Great location!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Padma""s place was a lovely, private space with a relaxing color scheme. It couldn't have been nicer!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Padma was very responsive and the perfect host. There are lots of added bonuses she thought of which takes the stress out of traveling.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Padma was easy to communicate with. We accidentally locked ourselves out the first night we were there. She was there with a key in about 30 minutes.
The location was great. It was close to everything we wanted to do. We would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. Padma was very responsive and helpful! Great location as well.

We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The casita was charming and cozy. It was tastefully decorated and it was obvious some thought was made to think of things that would be pleasing and make the guest comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great night's sleep. All the amenities were there that we needed and it was obvious the owner spent a lot of time thinking of how to make their guests comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much and we were very travel weary but it made us feel at home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stop over from Austin on our way to Scottsdale. We enjoyed having wine and appetizers and then morning coffee in the courtyard. Bed linens were great and bed was super comfortable. She has thought of everything from farm fresh eggs, english muffins and coffee for the morning. We will definitely make this our yearly stop when we do the drive."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and decor and fresh complimentary eggs would stay again
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would 100% stay here again. Love this little space, perfect for a stint in Las Cruces and excellent location. I had a very minor issue with the space when I arrived and the host was quick to rectify it. Really appreciated it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ideal place to stay at if you brought your bicycle (or your walking legs) for getting to know the surroundings of downtown Las Cruces which is very charming and inviting. The place was perfectly and beautifully setup by my ""interior designer"" hosts and I'm definitely adding it to my favs for the future given then great value offered."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay! Padma was very responsive. Despite the wind and heat the apartment was quiet and cool.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the kitchen and indoor living space. Comfortable to watch TV and relax. Also nice table and chairs for eating and some computer work. Fresh eggs. English Muffins and apples left for us as well as plenty of coffee supplies.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great hosts
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve rented from Padma every time we have been to Las Cruces and will continue to do so in the future! She’s responsive, her places are always clean and described as she says! Great locations too!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location and such a great place to stay. Casa Azul was more than perfect for the two of us. It was a short walk to the farmer's market/main drag. We took full advantage of the sled for our trips to White Sands (side note: the full moon hike is very recommended if you can get tickets). Since there were so many fantastic restaurants we never cooked for ourselves but the full kitchen was perfect. Easy check-in/out and so many thoughtful extras. I can't say enough good things about Casa Azul. Thanks so much, Padma & co. We're already looking forward to our next visit!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were amazed how beautiful it was when we stepped in the door. Blown away how large it was as we explored the house. So tastefully decorated with modern design blending with Southwest. Loved the thoughtful
Touches of fresh eggs, English muffins and everything you may have forgotten to pack in toiletries. Art on walls, cobalt blue Southwest tile in both kitchen and bath was super. Thank you for a home away from home. Jan and Jim and our terrier Cassie"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place, easy to find and check in. Close to highway 70, ideal for passing through town."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Padma’s place was nice, comfy bed and good location . We’ve stayed in another one of her properties before and have enjoyed them both. Our pups were very comfortable in her home."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, we were able to walk to the farmer's market on Saturday morning. Everything was as described, enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again! Check-in was easy, had no issues. The porchlight bulb was burnt out, otherwise everything was great! Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay! Very nice city and location. I'm so glad there was the very helpful and thoughtful guest book for us to look at as well. I'm so glad it was there or we would have missed the beautiful White Sands National Park! Thank you Padma :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean & cozy. I liked that it was centrally located. It was walking distance to the farmers market & craft show which was a lot of fun!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a super week in Las Cruces in large part because we could return ""home"" between hikes or sightseeing to relax with a great kitchen for making our breakfasts and picnics and a nice private space to be outdoors."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cute, quiet, convenient location. My toddler loved playing in the little yard! Very comfy bed. Good price. Will stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a beautiful little apartment to stay in before our White Sands trip. Clean and cute!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for my partner and I. Close enough to restaurants and a short drive to White Sands National Park. The bed was VERY comfortable and the kitchen/bathrooms were stocked well. The place was very clean, private and well kept. I would absolutely stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a cute place to stay! Perfect for myself, my husband, my infant and my two big dogs. Padma was very responsive and helpful, and had everything that we would need for our stay in the home already!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely home! So much bigger than it seems with a beautiful living room and kitchen. So many thoughtful touches throughout the home to make my stay as comfortable as possible. Appreciated the host's clear instructions and friendly communication. Only wish I could have stayed longer!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We were planning on getting a motel after spending the day at White Sands but messaged Padma and decided to stay there instead. After some initial confusion on where the lockbox was located everything went smoothly. The place is very spacious and clean and comfortable. We were only there for the night and then out early the next morning. I regret that we did not have more time as it looked like the place would be a great base for exploring the area and the neighborhood. The host was very helpful with getting things squared away as we were driving to the location.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Padma's place was the cutest! Such a great stay, everything was clean, and very cute, and easy to access!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my time here. Everything was so clean and there were plenty of conveniences while staying here. It was very cozy and a beautiful place. I would definitely book again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute spot in downtown LC. The Airbnb had everything I needed - comfy bed, fast internet for remote work, full kitchen, and a cute patio for the dog. I’d definitely stay there again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Padma's place was perfect for us. Great location, clean, everything you would need and even eggs and muffins in the fridge. Thanks team, for hosting a fantastic stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything just like in photos. Roku TV worked well & provided lots of options. Wonderful local coffee provided by Padma along with some breakfast for first morning. The kitchen was well supplied with good dishes, utensils, spices & condiments. Bed very comfortable. Nice sitting area outside. Everything worked, plenty of electrical outlets, fast wi-fi (250 Mbps), good lighting almost everywhere (dining table lighting could be better)."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I, and dog stayed at this casita for 8 nights. It offered everything we needed; comfortable bed, well appropriated kitchen, enclosed patio, and walkable location close to downtown museums and galleries. Charming decor exactly like the photos. We experienced issues with heating and power outages due to undersized electrical system, we were staying in winter. Padma addressed the problem immediately, installing two separate state of the art heating systems which kept the casita warm and comfortable. We highly recommend staying at any of Padma’s properties, very well managed with a professional, friendly crew."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time. The place is ""out back,"" and it worked great. A couple of blocks from the middle of downtown. We loved Las Cruces. Easy to move stuff from the car to the apartment. Comfy bed."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the comfortable yet stylish casita! Had everything we needed and was spotless and close to the farmers market which we loved!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our Stay! Loved Las Cruces!
We would definitely stay again if we are in the area. Thank You"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, cozy, comfortable place. Decor was like out of a magazine, but not sterile - has very appealing character. The exposed adobe bricks were cool. Extremely clean. Climate control was great. One of the best stocked bathrooms we’ve seen. Kitchen also well stocked and appreciated the complementary eggs and coffee. Great location for urban activities and less than 1 hour to not-to-be-missed White Sands Natl Park. Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I wear earplugs while sleeping and couldn’t hear traffic except for the occasional distant roar of souped-up trucks/motorcycles. The biggest noise issue is the very loud and prolonged train horns, 3 times each night/pre-dawn. But I was so comfortable that I quickly fell back asleep by the second night of it. One review said the parking space was too small, but we were able to easily fit our late-model Subaru Outback. Hosts were immediately responsive to questions. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Padma’s place. The airbnb itself was great - it was private, beautifully decorated, and the bed was comfy. There were several touches to make you feel right at home. The location was also excellent. We walked a couple minutes over to North Main Street everyday and found cute shops, several restaurants, and a square where the farmer’s market is held twice a week. We enjoyed your stay and would definitely visit again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved the location - I was just a block from the farmers market, and had easy access to hiking trails out both highway 70 and dripping Springs Road, and some excellent restaurants nearby. There were some very thoughtful touches - doggy bed, food and water bowls for my dog. The only real issues I had were the heating system seemed a little inadequate for a really cold morning, which I think Padma intends to address, and on my last morning a breaker flipped, but co-host Laura talked me through finding the breaker box (outside) and getting everything back on (and she did offer to come over and take care of it, which was not necessary!) All in all a great place to stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space is beautiful. Very thoughtful touches that were much appreciated and it was very clean. Be prepared for train noise and you might want an eye mask as light comes into the bedroom. Once we adjusted ourselves it was great. Good value!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delighted to find this cute little place right in the middle of Las Cruces. This is the older, historic area of downtown; you can walk to a couple of coffee shops and restaurants. The space was as advertised with many personal touches throughout; I especially appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and the extra little bathroom items provided. Very quiet (the little side yard is lovely), and very comfortable! Definitely recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a darling home! It was a great halfway point for our long drive back home to Texas. Everything was so cozy.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, easily walkable to lots of restaurants and shops. Lots of thoughtful details like coffee, tea, eggs for breakfast, etc. It's a very comfortable apartment that was a great base for exploring the area, would happily stay here again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Tucson, especially if you have a pup! The bed was SO comfortable. Decor is super cute! I love the blue and white tile. Flexible checkin when I messaged day-of to ask if cleaning was done early. We didn’t want to leave."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Padma’s place was cozy & comfortable for us and our dogs while traveling to White Sands National Park! It had everything we needed and more and Padma was a great host.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gem of a place! We felt right at home at the Casita. The muffins, eggs, butter, and extra toiletries were a bonus to an already wonderful place. The enclosed yard was ideal for our furbabies, and we can’t wait to stay again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in a quiet area! Secure and private spot
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I am a solo female traveler and stoped at Padma’s on my way to visit White Sands National Park. This was a cozy space with everything I needed and Padma sent very clear and detailed instructions. Would highly recommend for any solo traveler!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing host and casita, I wish I could’ve stayed even longer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed staying here, the process was smooth and the place was as described, the location quite convenient, absolutely no complaints, would stay again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a quaint place, and decorated beautifully in with stylish New Mexico motif. It was quiet, and more than expected provisions for cooking were provided. There was actually even some small amount of food in the fridge (English muffins) and eggs which came as a surprise to me. I love that as I wanted to make my own breakfast versus going out.
I love the blue kitchen and the television was highest order. Bed was comfortable, and I fell in love with the decorative sink in the bathroom.
The bed was large and so comfortable. The small patio was cute too with again, New Mexico reflection which I adore.
Wish the parking weren't as tight, but you can also park alongside the road I believe. Larger/longer cars would have a problem otherwise.
This was a fun stay for my last day in New Mexico, and a great value in my opinion for the well kept dwelling and what the hosts offer, making you truly feel home away from home.
Well done!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great stay! Looks exactly like the pictures. The place was very clean and well decorated. Location was within walking distance of coffee shops and restaurants. Host was very responsive. They even provided a dog bed for our pup to sleep on. I really appreciated how easy check out was. There were minimal/reasonable cleaning requirements. I’d for sure stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful place to stay. Very comfortable, extremely clean and had everything we needed. Host was very responsive. Would definitely return."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a one night stay. Very cute, well decorated, and thoughtful touches. Communication was good. There was a bit of an unpleasant scent upon arrival, but everything looked very clean. Just an FYI, the bathroom is very small. If you are a larger person, it will be a tight fit."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at this casita. It was clean and decorated very well. The king size bed was comfortable and the kitchen had all of the things that we needed. Padma left us fresh eggs and English muffins that we made for breakfast the next day. The neighborhood was quiet and close to a park as well as restaurants. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, great price and in a great area! If you have a pet also a great place to bring them. This place was so cute and really enjoyed it, you’ll love this place if you book it"

Big kitchen, nice living room space with tv, well done welcome book with recommendations on where to eat in the area, things to see and do, etc. I found a sled in the closet for White Sands National Park, so keep that in mind if you are visiting that park. A lot of thoughtful touches in this space, clean, cozy, welcoming. Also excellent communication with the host and detailed instructions on parking and accessing the space."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at this place! We found it clean and roomy, and the extra touches (eggs and english muffins in fridge, sleds available for use on the dunes at White Sands, fully equipped kitchen, etc) especially nice.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed here on our way to White Sands National Park and it was the perfect place to stay. The house was perfectly decorated and Padma provided so much that other Airbnbs don’t. If your staying in Las Cruces you won’t be disappointed staying here.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked with Padma because a number of my own airbnb guests had stayed at Casa Azul and had good things to say about the place. I was traveling to a wedding in Las Cruces, and stayed only one night, but it was certainly a place that would be comfortable for a longer stay. I had trouble entering and unlocking the lock box, but Padma was shortly on her way to help. Everything was perfect: the location, tastefully decorated, lovely art, very comfortable bed, sparkling kitchen! Thank you Padma."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic space in a great location! The decor is lovely and inviting! Bright splashes of color, comfy furniture, and tasteful artistic touches make this a relaxing get-away. The layout of the space is perfect- cozy but separate rooms mean good space to spread out as desired. The outdoor patio adds a place to take in the blue skies or starlit night. Easy walking to dining."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Home was super cute and very clean! It was close to a nice park and was in a great location! Padma did a great job of adding small amenities that made the stay feel comfortable. Check in was super easy! It was so nice to be able to have my dog stay there as well. Staying in a hotel with a dog is hard so I was so blessed that this was a dog friendly rental! She also had dog bowls and treats!!! Overall a great stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the house was beautiful. in an amazing location, they had great communication! would highly recommend and come again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a really nice place to stay. We stayed for for about 3 months. It’s a good location, I felt safe the entire time. The bed is very comfortable so that was nice! The bathroom is a little small so it takes a bit to get used too. It’s nice having your own little yard. I loved having access to several streaming services. There is little closet space. Overall it was a very nice stay the host responds quickly and so is kind."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This casita was PERFECT! The decor was so cute, everything was very clean, and there were myriad small touches here and there that were so thoughtful! They had a wonderful little coffee area in the kitchen, and we were welcomed to farm fresh eggs and English muffins in the fridge that we thoroughly enjoyed the next morning. Padma and the other hosts were all so accommodating, and had excellent & quick communication. They were all so kind and thoughtful. The bed was also very comfortable! I was very impressed with this AirBNB and was not expecting such a nice place in this little town. Thank y’all!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This casita was lovely!! Was perfect for our one night stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Padma and hosts were communicative through out our stay. Checking in and out was simple and straight forward, the location felt safe and close to all of downtown points of interest.
We loved this Airbnb! The pictures are nice but we were pleasantly surprised by how much better everything was in person. This place was clean, stylish, with one of the most well stocked kitchens. This will be our go-to Airbnb in Las Cruces."

I have had 2 back surgeries so a good bed is very important to me!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, has almost everything you will need. Convenient location!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely and comfortable casita! We were pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was. My husband is 6'5"" so the king bed is a must, and hard to find! It was very clean and well-appointed, and surprisingly quiet for such a central location. You can walk to main street/downtown, but the casita is tucked behind another house so it still feels cozy and private. It is perfect for a couple, and also has a very secure little fenced area where a dog would be safe. There were nice, welcoming touches throughout like a dog bed & bowls, a nice selection of teas and coffee, and breakfast necessities like eggs and butter. There are 2 evaporative window coolers which worked very well. In fact, we turned the temp up a little and turned them off at night because the casita stayed pretty cool if they were on during the day. Cute, clean & comfy! A great value and definitely recommended."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was FABULOUS! It’s a cute little 1 bedroom casita filled with bright colors, quality appliances and bedding. It has everything you need to cook a meal at home and also in a great location to go grab a bite close by. The location was very quiet and the neighbors are nice. The communication was really good with the hosts. I am looking forward to booking again in the near future. Oh, and the bed was so, so comfortable and the casita was spotless!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Padma’s place was beyond lovely! Spacious, modern, excellently-equipped and had so many thoughtful extra touches. This spot really exceeded my expectations, it was perfect for a quick snooze in the middle of my road trip. Thank you guys!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful home! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and were sad to leave! The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the place smelled like a spa. I loved whatever scent was used throughout the home, it wasn’t overpowering, just light and peaceful. It was so convenient to be able to park the car in the garage and have a garage door opener, I loved that! The decor was fabulous and I enjoyed discovering every little detail. The patio was my favorite part, it is so private and cute! We spent tons of time out there enjoying the mountain views and sunshine. If we ever find ourselves in the area again, we will definitely stay here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay!! We loved everything about it including the patio. We will definitely be booking again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we enjoyed our stay very much!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We're speechless. My daughter and I booked this month's ago and never expected much but to our elation, it was better than expected!
The tranquil vibes and decor were on point and the space just had so many delightful surprises. If you're on the fence, don't be! Book without reservation!
Great location and the gate cited in the description is open sometimes so you can sneak right to main/i70 if you're lucky but it's super cool closed too and despite being on campus of the new hospital and on the main road you really feel like you're in a spa retreat!
I'm going to copy several things from the decor at my place. I can't say enough good about this place!
Thank you SO MUCH for being an you claim to be and more. It really was epic!! We got to show it off for dinner and games with friends and family and everyone who got the pleasure of stopping in had their jaw on the floor!! It was so fun!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"place was very comfortable, well appointed and spacious - the pictures do not do it justice! also, the back patio set up was very comfortable as well. we especially appreciated the spa-like bathroom fixtures and the well stocked kitchen! thanks jessica :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely, private accommodation. Much thought went into providing extra touches, such as dog biscuits and extra bed linens, that enhanced our stay. The house is a short drive from the historic district and from an array of stores and restaurants."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jessica's. It truly was a spa like experience and a perfect way to celebrate my daughter's 13th birthday with her two sweetest friends.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our stay at Jessica's. It was an absolute, luxury residence!! The residence was pristine, beautifully decorated, calming, peaceful, and spotless. What a privilege to stay in such a lovely home. Thank you, CMW"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a beautiful home, with gorgeous decor. Comfortable bed with plentiful pillows. Lovely zen patio was great. Exceptional attention to the special touches. Superb value.The ONLY tiny suggestion is possibly more robes (there was only one we could find) and extra towels for the patio. We are eager to return we have more time to fully enjoy!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The only regret that we have is not being able to spend more than one night at Jessica’s place. She had everything we were looking for and more. The instructions were very clear and it was super easy to enter the home. When you enter the house, you’ll notice the house is spotless and beautifully decorated! We were able to park our vehicle overnight in the garage, which was an added bonus.
Although we didn’t get a chance to use the outdoor facility, it looked very charming. White Sands National Park was very easy to get to from her place. Thanks for sharing such welcoming and comfortable home!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica was a response host and the home is lively, especially the patio and hot tub."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As everyone has stated, it is clear that Jessica has worked very hard to provide a beautiful and well thought out space. The decorative touches are thoughtful and elegant, the amenities are generous (robes!!), and the overall feel is classy yet homey. The house is very clean and we loved being able to pull into the large garage. There is a busy street very close but you can’t hear it at all inside. This one is a gem and Jessica is super responsive."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved my stay at Jessica’s. Exceeded my expectations. The house was so beautiful all around and cozy and so thoughtful. Loved all of the spa bathroom amenities, and coziest beds. Would love to stay here again when I’m in town."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a wonderful place to stay. There are too many amenities to list. This host goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable including snacks and food upon arrival. I only wish we had booked for longer than 1 night. I would definitely book this property again. Thanks Jessica!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find in the Las Cruces area! We were in town for a marathon and Jessica’s home was the perfect spot to use as our “base of operations”.
Check in/check out was super easy. The home was spacious and even had a one car garage to use!
Extremely happy with my stay and can’t wait to visit again in the future!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved Jessica's place. It was so spacious and comfortable. Sad we didn't stay for a week lol. Plenty of great restaurant options nearby as well.

Its only an hour away from Jessica's place and it was one of the coolest national parks we've been to."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a beautiful place. if you don't feel like you are at a spa you are doing something wrong. Jessica has thought of every little detail. the spa shower and hot tub were fantastic. the big king bed is extremely comfortable. we loved being able to park in the garage.
don't let the fact that there is a highway not far from the home... it's very quiet and we felt very safe. easy to get to everything.
we will definitely stay here again when in Las Cruces."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jessica’s place was the perfect getaway! It looked exactly like the pictures and was definitely worth the money. The backyard was private and the hot tub was perfectly hot. Jessica was also really communicative when it came to the check in process and the house was ready 3 hours before check in. 10/10 would book again! Thank you Jessica!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Even better than as described and the pictures made it seem! It was so clean and we felt right at home.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful at this property and made our vacation that much better. As soon as you walk in you see all the character and the amount of detail they invested in creating a safe place for you to enjoy. The master bedroom was big with a comfy bed and an amazing shower as well as his and hers sinks. The living room was inviting and I liked how we could park our car in the garage. I recommend this home to anyone!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely furnishings and definitely a relaxed setting and fantastic showers. We didn’t use the hot tub but looked very inviting. The kitchen was well stocked and had lots of useful cooking gadgets. Jessica was very responsive for any needs. I would love to come back if in the area.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easy location, but moreover the peacefulness created in this stay. The home is gently and thoughtfully decorated with calming touches. Getting ready for my baby shower, I had a vanity and the spa like bathroom was just a perfect experience! Will stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was cozy and a great place to let loose and relax..
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay here! When we say that the host thought of everything, the host thought of everything! From bath robes, to hair ties, to the slides for White Sands, everything felt intentional. We felt like we were staying at a 5 star spa! The jacuzzi was what drew us to this space, but we really enjoyed every aspect. Definitely book if you can!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at The Ritz Spa Sanctuary was for the most part very lovely and relaxing. We had a a few issues with the hot tub initially but the host was receptive and accommodating. Jessica is kind and caring and was very helpful with anything we needed. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a peaceful stay in Las Cruces.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica’s place was beautiful, comfortable, and super clean! We hope to come back here soon."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica’s place on s absolutely stunning you will love the attention to detail, the bathroom feels like walking into a spa truly!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Every last detail!! What a great eye for design and feel cozy aesthetic. Thank you Jessica we will return ;)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,WOW just WOW! We loved our stay at Jessica's beautiful home! Her home decor is absolutely beautiful and the house had everything we could have possibly wanted or needed. By far the best airbnb we have stayed at. We will be back in March on our way back home from snowbirding and already can't wait!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great second stay! Thanks Jessica!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ok if I could rate this place 10 stars I would. This is the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Also, there were no ridiculous excessive check out instructions which always ruins a stay in my opinion. Oh and the smell. My goodness the smell of a dress clean home was phenomenal. There were so many small details that made the home perfect. The interior is absolutely gorgeous! I wish my stay would have been longer so I could enjoy this home more. I traveled with my 2 littles and they loved this home. If I’m ever in the area again, I will definitely choose this home first!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, spacious, and comfortable! Friendly to all types of folks. Everything was as described. Easy to check in.
Lots of hanging out areas in the house. Very clean and i appreciated the extra little things like toothbrush, hair ties,
etc - Jessica is very thoughtful and has an eye for details. Was easy to find the place. Nice to have a garage and hot tub. Jessica was extremely responsive and helpful!!!! We ran out of propane and she put new ones at the house within an hour - amazing!! The whole house was enjoyable. It is very beautifully decorated. The showers were amazing.
Tvs with streaming services. Full kitchen with everything you could possibly need. Laundry room. A fun game on the wall.
The hot tub was a great addition. Seriously the best quality furniture i have been on in an airbnb. Definitely recommend"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jess goes home exceeded our expectations. When traveling with pets, options are very limited. Her home is decorator furnished with many many extras. The home was impeccably clean. We had several questions before checking in, and she always responded very promptly. This is our return visit and we plan to Return again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far one of the best stays I’ve had through Airbnb. My guest and I were impressed with the layout, interior design, ambience, and amenities. Jessica was very responsive and informative. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing environment. I would like to share a word of caution with those who are not familiar with the area and are traveling with dogs; There are not many grassy areas to walk pets, although there are several parks within a 2-3 mile radius that are dog friendly. I called Jessica upon arrival and she explained that there were some spots I could take them to but unfortunately, my dogs were not used to the sandy, rocky terrain and I ended up taking them to a nearby park for potty breaks. This is not a negative reflection on Jessica or the home in any way, just a side note for those traveling with pets who are unfamiliar with the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is an amazing host. She was proactive and available for communication. However, everything was clearly communicated and instructions provided through the post as well as at the house. The space was amazing, comfy, clean, and very inviting. Looove the private oasis on the back porch. Thank you so much!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Jessica’s Spa Retreat. The location was convenient and the amenities were great! We appreciated the luxurious decor, the jacuzzi and outdoor fireplace, and the fancy shower. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. This was a great place for us to relax and unwind after a day on the road. We would definitely stay with Jessica again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing host! Was very sweet and surprised to have the hot tub turned on.
Home is beyond beautiful and spacious! Pristine clean and decorate very spa chic!
Loved that we were able to park our fully packed car in the garage as it was just a sleeping spot for our road to trip.
Definitely book marking this gem 💎 for future road trips."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay for a week in Las Cruces. Loved the rain shower heads, spa feel, and the hot tub overlooking the organ mountains at sunset. Wouldn’t hesitate to book again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The listing really does speak for itself, but Jessica’s place is a true beautiful respite. Amazing view of the mountains from the back patio, very nice quiet front patio, there is no corner of the place that is not being used for beauty or comfort.
Also we were traveling with our toddler, and Jessica’s place was truly perfect. Lots of space for him to move around without anything for him to break which is an actual relaxing point for parents. Beyond that, Jessica ensures the kitchen and bedrooms have everything a parent could need from plastic plates and bowls and toddler utensils to a pack and play.
The ultimate joy though was still for these tired parents! So much beautiful space to relax, read, jump in the hot tub or enjoy the amazing shower and bathroom for getting ready, sleep in a big cozy bed - everything was just EASY and lovely!
A huge thanks to Jessica for making such a beautiful spot and being such a lovely host!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really lovely touches to make this a great stay, including comfortable beds, a fancy shower, lots of space, and the hot tub. Some noise from the road can be heard, but nothing that earplugs didn’t fix."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HOME AWAY FROM HOME- but more ritzy!
We wanted a getaway, and this filled the bill. The most spacious bnb we've stayed in. It would easily accomodate 4 adults plus a child ..We could gladly have spent the whole time at the townhouse and on the patio with hot tub and fire pit . However, Las Cruces has magnificent mountain trails to hike. Saw oryx and mule deer on the Dripping Springs trail, then retreated to the hot tub to relax. Everything is minutes away -- Old Mesiilla included. The only pause i had was how close the bnb is to a major highway, but once inside did not hear the traffic. Maybe the sound machines in the bedrooms were just so soothing.
Definitely will be back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great, the directions could talk about the road being block."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jessica is a great hostess! I've stayed at both properties and they are always clean. The backyard at this property is so peaceful!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a pleasant and comfortable stay.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an awesome time at Jessica’s place! It was beautifully decorated — and the spa shower & hot tub were awesome. Such a relaxing stay. Jessica was also super kind to get the sleds ready for us before check in so we could grab them before our drive to White Sands! We really appreciated that. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"5 stars! The place was fantastic! Jessica decorated the home beautifully the bathrooms felt peaceful and spa-like. the backyard was phenomenal and definitely made use of the hammock, grill, fire pit and hot tub! The beautiful view of the mountains was a plus and the curtains were a great add on for privacy. 100% recommend will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jessica’s place was beautiful! It was perfectly decorated, felt like a spa, and she spared no detail! As soon as we stepped into the house, we felt at home. The space outside was beautifully decorated as well - we couldn’t have asked for it a nicer place to stay. The location wasn’t the best but it was very convenient. We will definitely stay again if/when we return to Las Cruces!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the BEST time staying at Jessica’s place! The home itself is absolutely beautiful and made us feel right at home, we did not wanna leave! The backyard space is so peaceful and the views out there are so stunning. We came to Las Cruces for our honeymoon and I think it’s safe to say, we will most definitely be back. We brought our 2 pups with us too and they loved it as well! Highly recommend staying here if you are looking to travel to the Las Cruces area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing!! Unfortunately we got in late and had to leave really early so we didn’t get to enjoy the spa experience she had set up.
The place was super clean and beautifully decorated. Everything was so cute and welcoming! I hope I get to come back just to stay there and spend more time :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful relaxing place! Spotlessly clean, welcoming and Jessica was friendly and accommodating. Thank you so much for the great weekend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So great, wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed more. So many amenities, but the hot tub and back yard as a whole stood out for us!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying at Jessica’s place at it is always a lovely and welcoming rest for the night.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a delightful experience. We loved every details of the house. The interior was marvelous. Lots of amenities available, with well thought details for the best customer experience. We enjoyed the shower with the spa like feel. The patio is a wonderful place to relax along with the hot tub. It’s the best airbnb i have ever stayed in!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jessica’s place was amazing! I do believe we agreed it was the best and nicest Air BNB we’ve ever stayed in..So props to Jessica! We loved it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very unassuming when you pull up, but once you enter the front gate and get into the house it’s worth it. High ceilings in the living space/master bedroom. Very well laid out. I stay at a lot of vacation rentals and there are usually some fit and finish things that diminish the place overall, but I can’t ding this place for any of those. It was more space than I needed for 36 hours, but I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. Not that it really mattered to me on this trip, but the patio wasn’t as private as I would’ve hoped/expected it would be, but I loved the place as a whole."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful get away place! Loved everything about it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The home was beautiful and just as described in words and photos. The front garden nook and the backyard were amazing places to sit by yourself and unwind or to hang out with other people. Jessica was an amazing host who provided many extra touches that created a very pampered experience. She was also very quick to respond to the few questions I had. I would highly recommend this place and host and would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing experience at this AirBNB in Las Cruces!
Jessica was an amazing host and beyond accomodating when I had to extend my stay an extra night. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. It is tucked away in a nice area of Las Cruces.
Photos and description were 110% accurate and we couldnt have asked for a more perfect little spot for the weekend.
Thanks Jessica! 12/10!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home is absolutely beautiful and exactly as described and pictures. I felt right at home. The location is great for anyone passing through, staying a while or driving. I would definitely stay here again ."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica’s place was absolutely wonderful to stay at! The amenities were wonderful, the backyard so relaxing! Felt very safe!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our experience with Airbnb is not vast, but the Ritz was like staying at your best friends home. The outside is relatively plain, except for the yard landscaping, but the inside is magnificently decorated and tastefully decorated. Also, there were lots and lots of extras that we’ve never seen elsewhere. The home is fully stocked. Our initial response on entering the house was shocked at how beautiful it was. Also there is a garage. Jessica always responded with any messages that I sent. Overall this was a tremendous experience and we plan to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place! As described and private. Furnishing upscale and lots of thought went into this home! I’d highly recommend.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! We are frequent Airbnb users, and this is absolutely the most beautiful Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Jessica was a wonderful host. We ended up arriving much later than anticipated due to bad weather and it was no issue at all. In fact, we had a 1 week stay booked (with another host) that was canceled 2 weeks before our trip. I had to scramble to find new accommodations, and unfortunately, we had to split the trip up into 3 separate stays. Jessica's place was the 3rd stay, and not only was it the best and most comfortable, it was a welcomed relief. We had a long day of driving, and this place was immaculate upon arrival. The spa shower was just what I needed, and the bed was so comfortable that I told my family to go on without me and that I was staying behind. It was more than enough room for a family of 5 and 2 pups. It's basically a spa retreat. So if you like the sound of that, just do it. She even had sleds for white sands and items to make your pups feel at home as well!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica was fantastic to work with and the house was super nice, our stay was short and we will definitely be back..HIGHLY Recommend staying with Jessica if your looking for a place in Las Cruses!!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica's place was amazing. Her decor and the way she designed the layout were top-notch.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s place is now at the top of the list for me! Totally wish it was cloned and in every one of my favorite cities. I stayed with my sister and her kids and there was so much room for all of us. The feel of the home was so warm and inviting, and the hot tub and patio were a dream for the perfect evenings. We were well rested every night, the bedding was so fluffy, you didn’t even want to leave. The whole vibe definitely felt like a spa, a place of relaxation, we were sad to go. Jessica was great."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is very comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. We enjoyed our stay and will try to book again the next time we stay in Las Cruces. Jessica is a great communicator and goes above and beyond making sure her guests are at home. We especially enjoyed the hot tub and the hookey game!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Before you read any further or look at other locations, just book this location before it is booked. Jessica's place was SO amazing. I seriously felt like I was at a spa. This was such a long road trip for us, and we stayed in a few different Airbnb, and this was by far my favorite. You can tell Jessica put A LOT of thought into this location. SO many little touches that just make you feel relaxed and at home. I loved the welcome sign with my name on it. My dogs loved the dog bones, and it made them feel welcome too! First Airbnb I've stayed at with my dogs that offered them something to feel at home. My husband and I enjoyed playing the Hookey game and making breakfast sandwiches with the breakfast station! It was so relaxing sitting in the jacuzzi with the lights above. I was sad Jessica's location was booked the day we checked out because if it was not, then we would have booked one more night and extended our trip home just to stay there! Thank you Jessica for a great place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great private and quiet location. Jessica is a great host. Can’t wait to go back.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the house beautiful and modern. Octavio is very responsive and helpful. We were in Las Cruces for a funeral and to visit family the house is north of the city but you can quickly get to any place in the city in 5 to 10 minutes. The house has resturants and shopping within a few minutes of the house. I would definitely stay again in Octavio's home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Octavio was such an attentive host! We’ve stayed at many Airbnbs and this one makes it into our top 3.

Highly recommend and look forward to visiting again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house is truly special. Everything about it is tranquil, peaceful. I started referring to it as ""Zen House"" for a reason.
Octavio was a fantastic host. His home is spectacular. And I played 6 rounds of golf at nearby Red Hawk (an incredible course).
I'll very much be returning. Thank you, Octavio!"

The cleanliness made us feel right at home. The host went above and beyond with snacks and conveniences like bags, coffee, etc which was much appreciated after a long trip. The home was in a safe neighborhood. Neighborhood is central to Las Cruces restaurants and shops. We would absolutely stay here again and hope to come back to visit white sands!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly don’t know where to start with describing how great Octavio’s place was. It’s beautifully furnished, smells nice and has so many of the comforts from home (bidet anyone?)
The beds were comfortable and the linens were super soft. It felt like a high end hotel.
We loved having the grill - it made making dinner a breeze. Though we didn’t use them, I was impressed with all the small appliances in the pantry. If you really wanted to make a lot of meals, you’d be all set.
The 4 of us loved being able to recline in the evenings and watch movies together on the very comfortable sofas.
This was a great location for visiting White Sands National Park, as well as various hikes nearby. We went to Dripping Springs and had a blast.
The restaurant recommendations in the Welcome Binder were great. We especially enjoyed Luna Rossa’s Pizza and A Bite of Belgium!
Thank you, Octavio for the gifts and snacks. My teens had a ball munching on the fun snacks that mom doesn’t buy. 😁"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Octavio’s AirBnB is beautiful! He is an excellent host and has thought of everything a guest may need. The farmhouse aesthetic is warm, inviting, and classy.

The home was extremely clean and well stocked. The location was great - convenient to the freeway for traveling to White Sands National Park and Organ Mountain - Desert Peaks National Monument. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is incredible and the nicest AirBNB we have ever stayed in. The pictures don’t do it justice how clean and pristine the property is. So many amenities (snacks! Toiletries! Gifts for guests!) and it was perfect for our three year old (books, games, and Disney+ — what more do you need?). We used it as home base to visit White Sands and Hatch, and it was perfect. Would love to stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My father and I stayed here for several days while we were in town for my uncle’s funeral.

This private home is beautiful and comfortable, with easy access to the freeway, restaurants and shopping. I would highly recommend it."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Octavio’s place was amazing! I have stayed in many places in AirBnb and this one is definitely in my top five AirBnb. Such a great place for the price. The place is staged and prepared for the comfort of the guess such as large kitchen amenities (breakfast cereal, spices, coffees) along with every utensil to entertainment setup (large TVs in every room and fast internet), clean bathrooms (every bathroom has enough towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap) to a nice beds in every room. Getting in was easy with keypads and remote Garage (if you drive). This is a good place to stay if you want to visit White Sands National Park (only about 40 mnts drive to the entrance). Nearby, there are enough restaurants, and if you forget anything, Walmart is just minutes away. Octavio was responsive and very flexible in terms of check out and check in. If I can give this place more than 5 stars, I would."

There were all of the appliances we wanted including toaster, toaster oven, gas grill, and several items we didn’t use. There were ample linens and towels. The garage was spacious enough for our pickup truck and bikes. This was our first visit to Las Cruces and we really enjoyed the area and had a great time. We visited Carlsbad Caverns, the Space Museum in Alamogordo, White Sands NP, mission trail in El Paso area, the museums in Las Cruces, Mesilla, Dripping Springs, hiked in the Organ Mountains, biked extensively and more. This is the best Airbnb we have stayed in by far."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't pass this place up...it is absolutely amazing!!! We rent AirBnbs often and all of us said this had to be one of our favorites by far! Octavio has made this beautiful home a renter's dream. The place is immaculate and sooo clean. He really took time with his attention to detail. From the extremely comfy beds and linens, extra pillows and blankets, reclining couches, huge TVs and ceiling fans in every room, plenty of soft plush towels, well thought-out amenities for the kitchen/bathrooms, to it's convenient location with restaurants and shopping galore, as well as amazing views, this place will set the tone for an unforgettable stay.

,,,"Terrible host and ammenneties experience. We specifically chose this place over others due to the fact that it had a jacuzzi and it was close to Highway. Upon arrival, we noticed that the jacuzzi was extremely dirty and unusable. I wrote the host and sent him pictures.The host replied that it was something that the previous guest did, and since I had such a great deal with the price of his place,it is something that I should deal with and not use it. When I pointed out that the reason why we pay a cleaning fee to book the place is to make sure that we use all the ammenneties. The host got upset and told me to leave. To not be an a-høle and a cry baby. We were traveling with my kids and pulling a moving trailer. Our goal was to put the kids to bed,enjoy the jacuzzi, and rest a few hours to continue with our drive. The host just brushed out the problem,said it was too bad,clean it myself,and said he didn't care who I was.Spoke with Airbnb,and they immediately apologized for his behavior"
,,,The house is brand new and with brand new comes the smells of paint and drywall mud. Unfortunately I was unable to tolerate the strong smell and had to leave before staying the first night. This space is beautiful but may not work for those that can’t tolerate the smell of fresh paint. I would recommend this space with some time and better airing out.
