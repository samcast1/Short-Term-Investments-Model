Zachary's place is definitely a 5star+!!
What a great experience for our first Airbnb!
We would highly recommend.
Zachary has excellent communication,
easy to chat with and answered all our questions promptly.
Upon entering neighborhood we felt safe.
Smooth, easy driveway and walk path lined with rocks so no muddy feet... Lower entry had a door overhang which again beneficial since it was raining.
Immediately from opening the door,we were so impressed with the accommodations.
Everything was extremely clean, well placed and truly everything we needed for our short stay . Super comfortable bed and probably the best pillow I've ever put my head on. Slept like a baby.
Property location was ideal for attending our wedding event at South Eden plantation.
Don't hesitate to book this one. You will be very pleased!!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sometimes the expectations of city life cause one to pause when looking into ""countryside"" airbnb's. Don't be deceived! The Shack is everything an airbnb is supposed to be. Clean and modern...and a piano!?! Urban with that wonderful country indifference too polished showmanship. The Shack celebrates rest and light. It invites you in with spaciousness and thoughtful decorating touches. I was instantly home and when it came time to leave I realized I had not planned enough time to stay.
Don't rush if you stay at the Shack. Plan for 3 nights if you can. Enjoy the restfulness and the clean, white spaces filled with light. You wont be sorry."

Great location to stores and coffee shops, secluded away from noise, and while it is on the property next to the owners house-- there are trees that frame the place (that has lots of big windows) so it feels like you are in the woods! It is a converted shed that has been done up with premium furnishings and wonderful touches of class and style. Large and spacious, immaculately clean, and a full kitchen. Amazing."

Everything was extremely clean and you can tell there was extra thought put into our airbnb experience. From the drinks provided in the fridge to the extra toothbrushes and razor. We felt very at home here and the barn was very unique. I’ve never stayed in such a beautifully decorated place. It was also incredibly clean. The cleaning lady even left us a sweet note upon arrival. If we are ever back in Thomasville, we will make sure to stay here again!
Thanks so much Shaunna!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed is a beautiful, artfully arranged place that I want to move into permanently! It offers everything you could possibly need and I felt at home immediately. The furniture, bedding and king size bed is all very comfortable. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give a property 10 stars, this would be the one. It's been thoughtfully put together and is well-outfitted, beautiful, clean and comfortable. Communication was on point and I wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and feels like a little cozy home away from home. Extremely clean and feels like a nice place to curl up with a blanket and read some books. I would definitely like to stay again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed with Shaunna several times. Her home is always meticulously clean and well appointed with everything you might need. Quiet, yet close to town."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and clean! Will stay here again next time Im in town!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful guest house in Thomasville just minutes (drive) from downtown. Very unique and well put together. I think the kitchen and bathroom had literally everything we needed and we could have left our own supplies at home and been fine. The place felt very spacious and homey and one of the more unique places we have stayed. Thomasville is adorable and has a wonderful little downtown with some excellent and unique shopping and dining. Whether passing through and need a place to put up for the night like us or staying a few days, this is a great place to call home while you're away from yours. : )"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the location,Shaunna was very responsive in a timely manner. House was amazing! And love love love their beautiful German Shepard on the property. Definitely would come back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing space!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaunna's place is better than we expected, even after reading all the reviews. Yes the place is super clean and super adorable and comfortable, but here is what really stood out. We have stayed at many AIRB&B and VRBOs for many years. We have noticed that little by little more hosts have gotten chintzy with what they provide i.e. amount of toilet paper, paper towels, bath towels, shampoo, soaps etc. I get it, supplies can get expensive if you have to replace them so often. So we have come not to expect much. We usually always stop by a drugstore and make sure we get water bottles and back up supplies. Well we were shocked to see that Shaunna had already provided those little things that have disappeared. Drinks in the fridge, cute new toothbrushes (that matched the decor :) and mini toothpaste. All the streaming services were logged in and available, we usually have to log into our personal accounts and remember to log out before we leave). Thomasville was fine, but our stay in this cute AirBNB is what we will remember. Thank you Shaunna."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely STUNNING PLACE! Communication from host is awesome, the bed is AMAZING, sheets are even sweeter and the whole experience of the space is wonderful!! Truly grateful and enjoyed our stay!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place in itself was absolutely adorable. I could take pictures in it all day long 😍
It was extremely clean + well stocked. All of the decor was to die for. Extremely close to town.
I will say with kids running around right outside the windows it wasn’t very private, but all in all a very cute place and great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful, everything you need plus more. Family friendly, plenty of room to spread out, lots of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Plus relaxing family time in the pool! We highly recommend and plan to book in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved this spacious house and it fit our family very comfortably. There were 8 adults and 1 teenager and we had plenty of space in the kitchen, dining, and bathrooms. Even though the upstairs bedrooms are very kid friendly, the beds fit our young adult children just fine."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home. Perfect for our family. Thomasville is beautiful! Would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect home for my family and I to travel into town for my wedding. Very secluded and quiet back yard. Only detail which needs to be mentioned onsite is that there is a live in on the premises in the backyard. The person was not an issue during my stay, yet scheduling guest should be informed. Will definitely book again because host is accommodating and very responsive."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a beautiful stay at Raina’s home! We were in town for our son’s wedding and the home met all of our needs! We got to enjoy the beautiful backyard and there was lots common space to be with family! Fully appointed, entertains well, and exceptionally well located!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was everything and then some! Would def recommend if staying in the area. Have rented numerous airbnb and this is by far at the top of the list.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,The house was in a great location! Especially great as it was my wedding weekend and people could walk straight back from the reception Glen Arven!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is fabulous! Perfect, safe location with everything you could need. It's like staying at your fanciest best friend's house while they're out of town. Everything is there and just slightly nicer than your house. Fabulous backyard with pool and all the toys your kids could need. We had two large families here and everyone had their own space. If you know anything about Thomasville, it's in the best location. Really great find. Raina is wonderful and an excellent host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We found this home to be perfect for our Aunt’s celebration of life trip and service. We easily hosted our extended family for dinner. The kitchen especially, was well stocked for all the meals we prepared. The backyard is beautiful and very peaceful. There was a lot of pollen everywhere, but that’s to be expected for the season!"

One note that wasn’t obvious in the listing the pool house/back apartment is pretty close and not fully private. We did not have any issues or interactions with these long term renters- just an FYI."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and super spacious. Perfect for my large family! GREAT for kids as lots of toys and entertainment are available to them. Playground and trampoline in the yard was a nice touch for the kids. Gorgeous pool for when the weather is warm!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family gathered at Raina's home in Thomasville for a get together that included two grown daughters and their spouses, two grandchildren, and the parents of our newest son in law. This truly is a spacious home with plenty of room for everyone to comfortably have their own space and yet have ample opportunity to gather for meals, campfires, games, assembling puzzles and to watch football, all of which we did. The home is lovely and well appointed with comfortable beds and furnishings, a well stocked kitchen for cooks, and various cozy indoor and outdoor spaces. Thomasville's historic spots, unique shops and great restaurants are close by, as are grocery stores. We highly recommend Raina's Thomasville home."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great house. Great host .
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We were there for a wedding and the home was just perfect for our size of family. It was beautifully decorated and squeaky clean. The beds were very comfortable and the spa like bathrooms were amazing. I would highly recommend Raina’s home to anyone with a family due to its large size and fully loaded kitchen. We were very pleased !!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We booked Raina's house because it is close enough to Tallahassee that my students at FSU could come for the day on Thanksgiving. The rest of us traveled from Boston, Athens and Atlanta so that we could be together. The house was perfect for our needs (older children and teenagers and my mom, plus Forrest and I) and we INSTANTLY felt at home. It was exactly what I wanted and what we needed to cook Thanksgiving (double ovens! platters! baking dishes!). I will DEFINITELY stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Raina’s home was absolutely beautiful! The layout was spacious and accommodated 2 families quite comfortably. The outdoor space was perfect for the adults to relax and kids to play. Thank you, Raina, for being such a gracious host! We will be back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Thomasville to play in a golf tournament at Glen Arvin. The location couldn’t have been better. You can literally see the course just across the street.
This large house had the perfect character for Thomasville. Well stocked with everything needed. Raina was great, she communicated with us on a regular basis to make sure all was good.
We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Thomasville."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Raina’s home was absolutely beautiful, spacious and was full of positively impactful touches! It made my family’s stay in the area better than I imagined. I highly recommend to any family that wants a great escape away from home where you’ll be able to rest well in comfy beds and enjoy yourself in the pool or sitting around the deck in the back yard."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning house and Raina couldn’t have been more helpful. There were 4 of us here for a business trip and everyone commented how great the place was… the only downside is that we didn’t get time to use the pool.. thanks Raina

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a phenomenal place with all the amenities of a high end luxury home. With 3 bedrooms and baths on the 1st floor it was perfect for the older members of my party. The kitchen was very well equipped with everything that you could possibly need. The backyard was gorgeous with a large deck with a fire pit and the pool was absolutely fabulous. Raina was a great host who was very attentive and responsive to our needs and questions. Definitely somewhere I would go back to again when ever I’m back in the area.

The space inside was very comfortable and everything was set up perfectly. The kitchen was very well-appointed and had everything we would need. We would definitely recommend this place and would even love to return with our children! Usually we are traveling with them (2 and 3), and were happy to see a couple drawers with toys labeled for kids of different ages that would keep them entertained. This would be a great place for families, couples, or singles."

I especially enjoyed playing the piano, reading part of a book at the B&B, and watching some free tv shows. It rained during my stay, and I also enjoyed hearing the storm."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed Joanna‘s house so much. The bed was very comfy and my husband loved the shower.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming cottage redone very well. it is small but livable. Well stocked kitchen. it is on a Main Street, I had expected it to be more like the houses behind it in a neighborhood or block, off the main road. It is an easy walk to the big park. It is not an easy walk to the town or markets, unless I just did not pick the right way. Which is quite possible."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A great weekend stay. Right by our favorite restaurants and downtown shopping. We would highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location to everything downtown. House was very nice and had everything we needed.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are frequent visitors to Thomasville and usually stay with our daughter and family. This trip was to celebrate a family event and we needed more space and selected Cottage 308.
Our selection was based on the beautifully decorated pictures shown online, and we were not disappointed. It was furnished nicely and had many little extras (e.g , coffee, filters, full kitchen utensils, extra blankets, throws, etc.). There was even a swing on the front porch and we enjoyed sipping our coffee there in the mornings.
Although the cottage is only one bedroom, it lives much larger with many quaint sitting areas.
We highly recommend Cottage 308, especially for couples.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Joanna was very nice. The place was cute. The photos definitely capture the place well. It's bigger than it looks. The front porch has this very nice porch swing but it was messy, cobwebs, etc. Would've been nice if it was clean & had pillows (since the swing was metal). The area looks a little rough, but we didn't feel scared or anything. Couches & beds were comfortable. There was no winekey although Joanna said she would get one for the next renter. Joanna was very responsive, usually got a text back in a few minutes. Easy walk to downtown."

There were plenty of blankets, towels, and while the decor was beautifully minimal, every little detail was thought out.

Highly recommend this place if your ever in the Thomasville area!"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Outstanding step back in time but with just the right updates. Great kitchen with new AC's and updated showers with great water pressure.

Walkable to downtown shops and restaurants. Rendall was very responsive and helpful before and throughout our stay. Our family had a wonderful time and made some new memories together. Thank you, Rendall!"

Rendall was the BEST host I have ever had the pleasure to rent from. He even had a welcome gift waiting on us.
If you plan to come to this area you have to book this house you will not be disappointed. If I could give more than 5 stars I would give this house and Rendall 5 times the 5 stars I gave!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome Host! Property description does this house no justice. From the outside, it looks like and average home. When you enter, be prepared to be wowed. Amazing beauty. Spacious, well designed, bedrooms and bathrooms are perfect. Tons of sitting and private spots throughout the house. Absolute beauty.
We encounter a water break and Rendall and plumber responded and corrected issue immediately. Some may think this is a bit so good thing to state; however things happen beyond our control and for me it shows the issue being addressed immediately.
Thanks Rendall for a warm and welcome place to call home away from home. Nice walk into town. Great historical scenery and some. This was a last minute booking that was well worth it! We will see you again soon."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at Rendall’s home. The pictures don’t do the home justice. The rooms are nicely decorated for the area. My adult siblings and I stayed with a nephew and friends. The house accommodated us nicely. We each had our own space which was wonderful. Rendall was very responsive to all requests. I highly recommend this home to anyone needing a place in Thomasville.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place was incredible! The house itself was beautiful, very spacious, and clean. We had a small issue with the plumbing, but Rendall was responsive and had a plumber there as soon as possible. Downtown is an easy walk from the house. Can’t say enough good things about it. I’m already trying to find an excuse to go back!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in Thomasville. Jennifer was a fantastic host. We stayed just one night a few days before Easter and Jennifer got some really nice goodies for our kids. It was the perfect thing for them after a long drive. The home itself is amazing and the location is perfect. The location shown on the Airbnb map is actually deceiving, the condo is right on North Broad right in the middle of all the great shops and restaurants. We are looking forward to returning to Thomasville and staying with Jennifer again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Flexible and responsive. Thank you.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I rented this for my wedding weekend to get ready in and for my husband and I to stay in after the wedding. It was the best! So beautiful! It was a nice little “getaway” in our own little town!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Magnolia House was beautiful as advertised and the location is just perfect for Thomasville. The entry was from the rear with the two reserved parking spots very close to the stairs to the apartment. The back deck was much nicer and more private than we anticipated and was a nice place to unwind with a glass of wine. There are two alleys very close by to give convenient access to the vibrant downtown Thomasville. We would definitely come to Magnolia House again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is beautiful! Located in downtown Thomasville above His Daughter boutique. We parked our cars upon arrival and didn’t get back in them until we checked out. We were able to walk everywhere! The loft itself was shockingly quiet for being on Broad St. The original floors were gorgeous and the furnishings were perfect for the space. We also loved there was plenty of seating!
One note for future guests, I would not recommend this loft for those with mobility issues. There was a flight of wood deck stairs to get up to the entrance and the original floors are sometimes uneven. It didn’t bother us - we liked the original features! - but may be troublesome for some. If you want something downtown, walkable, historic and beautiful, This is your place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful loft in the heart of Downtown Thomasville. Couldn't beat the location, walkable to everything downtown has to offer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place is absolutely amazing. Most definitely one of my favorite AirBnBs across the world. My wife and I live in Tallahassee and frequent Thomasville. This time we decided to spend a weekend and we truly felt appreciated and comfortable in this home away from home. Jennifer welcomed us with a personal note and surprise treats! She was very accommodating. The place itself was very spacious, cozy and full of amenities. Being in the heart of downtown Thomasville, we were able to see, visit and enjoy parts of the area that we normally could not on our daytrips. The whole experience gets a 12 out of 10 rating! Will be back for sure!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my favorite AirBnbs that I have stayed in. We travel a lot and stay in Airbnbs several times a month. The house was very clean and smelled amazing! All the linens were high quality. You can tell that Jennifer cares about your experience. The sweet note and treats were appreciated! You can’t beat this location either! We walked to everything and explored all that the downtown had to offer!

Great little town too, if you're a foodie it's for you. Jennifer did a wonderful job of offering some suggestions when I asked for recommendations on where to eat. She was so proactive about everything, what a great host. The loft is spacious and really well done, you get this great downtown historic area vibe, which is spot on. So many thoughtful touches throughout. Steps away from all of the activity, yet it feels so private. What a charming place!"

If you were a bookish young person, or if love the feeling of stepping back in time, (while still having a luxury mattress and fluffy towels and coffee maker) we could not more highly recommend the Jerger. The host was also extremely kind, available, and welcoming. She left our little boy a Christmas gift! This was the perfect place to stay in one of America’s most perfect small towns. We will be back.

Thank you so much Diane!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomasville, GA, was featured in a 6-page spread in the May issue of Southern Living magazine. Since the three of us had never been there before, and it was only a 4-hour drive from our home, we decided to take a road trip for a 3-night stay and explore this charming Southern town. Next, we needed a place to stay … Once The Jerger popped up, we needed to look no farther. Host Diane’s condo is truly magnificent. It is even more wonderful and spacious than the online photos portray. Every attention to detail is carefully thought out: the tasteful furnishings, plentiful amenities, and quality craftsmanship are on display throughout. Everything is immaculate and comfortable and makes you feel right at home. The location can’t be beat, as it’s just around the corner from practically all the shops, restaurants and charming downtown area, all in a very secure spot. We loved it! Diane, too, is a gem and was quick to respond to all our communications. Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This might be my favorite property ever. I almost hesitated to write a review because I kind of want it to remain a hidden gem.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Jerger is absolutely gorgeous! Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in. It provides everything you could possibly need, and Diane adds SO many personal touches. We enjoyed the variety of snacks and sodas waiting for us, and the entertainment (tv/stereo speaker) equipment is the best. We came to celebrate a birthday and shop on First Friday. The Jerger is in the middle of the best shopping in Thomasville and directly across the street from the amphitheater.
We can’t wait to plan another getaway at The Jerger!❤️"

Our kids were delighted with the twin beds, the view from the big front windows, and very well stocked kitchen (snacks and sprites for the win!) which was beyond our expectations. Diane was very responsive and went over and above to help us with our stay. She even mailed our chargers back after we had left them behind. All in all, it was fun to stay in downtown Thomasville where we could just walk downstairs for all sorts of great food, shopping, and adventure."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Wendy's place for an early spring break. We wanted to get away and have some peaceful family time. That's exactly what we found!! The location of the cabin is just picture perfect. There's a beautiful pond and lots of trees which make it so serene. The cabin is beautiful and clean. You feel right at home with all the cozy decor and attention to detail it went into putting it together. Both the pull out couch and the bed are VERY comfortable. Our favorite was the front porch. We had so much space for board games, lots of coffee and the rocking chairs are a big plus. We will be back; our girls just loved it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed here many times! A great little place and always clean! And Wendy is a great communicator. Already have another stay booked!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is very private and nicely decorated for Christmas without being overdone.
I love having the cover over the front porch. It was raining the morning I left, and it made it easier to keep things dry while packed my vehicle."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A friend and I were in Thomasville with our dogs for a quail hunt- this location was perfect, practically across the street from River Creek WMA. The house was clean, well appointed, and plenty of private, off-street parking. Wendy and Ron were communicative before arrival with clear instructions about check in, information for our stay, and check out. The layout of the house would probably be more ideal for couples, but we found everything to be totally adequate and enjoyable! They obviously have pet owners in mind when they advertise the listing as dog friendly, as everything was designed with them in mind- down to a jar of treats for our pups! Would definitely recommend this location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really amazing place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy was a great host. Her Air BnB was well furnished and loaded with the necessary amenities for cooking and relaxing with friends.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, wooded location just a short drive to downtown Thomasville. Decor is really nice and includes a quite enjoyable outdoor front porch and fire pit. This is a pet friendly location, so folks without pets (like us) may notice a slight smell and a few pet hairs. However, this isn't a detraction from the wonderful amenities this home offers. Overall, Wendy is a very kind and responsive host and her spot is a great place if you like nature and a cabin experience close to the city."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay between Thomasville and Cairo

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was fantastic. My wife and I wanted to get away for a 4 day weekend and decided on Thomasville GA. The cabin is situated on a big, private piece of property 8 minutes from downtown Thomasville. We settled in and spent every night in the rocking chairs on the porch. Everything we needed was already in the cabin. The location is very convenient being 8 minutes from Thomasville and about 45 minutes to Tallahassee. There are also many small towns with lots of character in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and location. Some road noise, but couldn't hear it inside."

The location was perfect, close to many things yet secluded. Our kids love in the area so I hope this is always available when we go visit. Thanks for making our stay awesome."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great experience staying at Wendy’s place in Thomasville!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy was great! We were in town for a birthday party. She was super helpful to accommodate us coming in a little early & allowed us to have a late checkout as well. So we could leave our dog at the cabin to be able to go to my home church, where I grew up. So grateful to have found this sweet, little cabin."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect stay for our hectic travels. Wendy had so many little touches to make us feel like we were at home. It was very clean and cozy with a beautiful view. We will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly situated between Cairo & Thomasville —-gem of a place to stay. Always fully stocked
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect for a quick get away from the city. My dog absolutely loved the open space and the view while working inside was relaxing. The porch was beautiful and there were plenty of spots to sit at. Inside was super cute and had everything you would need for yourself as well as for your pet (dog bowls, treats, baggies). No issues with bugs or anything like that, in fact a gentleman was on site spraying at the time of my stay. It felt super safe at night which was huge for me as I was traveling alone. Would 100% stay again. Thank you again for everything!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This rustic yet modern cabin is such a wonderful find! It lives so much larger than its square footage, and the finishes are so upscale and interesting. Classic Southern elegance. The view from the front porch is lovely and the setting is peaceful without being totally isolated...on the edge of town but one can easily be in downtown Thomasville in a few minutes. The kitchen was very well stocked and there were lots of thoughtful touches throughout. Wendy and Ron are extremely hospital and accommodating. Not a single complaint and one of the best Airbnb experiences ever! Thanks so much!"

It is beautiful, orderly, extremely clean and private. Our lil dog had enough space to run and enjoy the outdoors.

We would love to return with more time to continue to check out Thomasville."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved how peaceful the location was. Plenty of space to walk our pups, two GSDs. Wish we had time to enjoy the fire pit they have on the property.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lauren was very responsive. Home was clean and well decorated. She provided bottled water, coffee, and toiletries which were greatly appreciated as we’d already packed everything up for our flight home. The house is spacious. With it being a pet friendly Airbnb, we didn’t get that typical “gross, a dog has been here” feeling that we’ve felt in other places. The home was free of dog hair and normal pet smell. The yard was clean and fenced, wonderful for my sister’s two small pups that were longing for a good run after being cooped in the car for multiple hours. The location is perfect for walking to the beautiful downtown area. The home also had a massive parking area, not normally found in homes in such close proximity to downtown. We will definitely stay here again and recommend to all of our friends needing a place to stay in Thomasville."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Every time we stay at one of Lauren’s properties, we feel right at home. Her kitchen at this home was fully stocked with everything you would ever need to cook and/ or bake. The home was very spacious, and well decorated. The office room could be used as a third bedroom for a blow up if need be. The middle bath has a bathtub if you have little ones like us which is awesome. It’s also right across the street from a playground. Loved it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lauren’s place served as our last stop on a 2.5 week road trip. We had never been to Thomasville before, but are SO glad we decided to spend the night! The cottage is perfectly furnished, beds are comfortable, there’s more than enough space for my family of 4 and the town is just the cutest, straight-out-of-a-Hallmark-movie kinda town! We felt very safe and are now wishing we had more time to enjoy it more than we did. Lauren was exceptional, going above and beyond - a fabulous hostess! We will absolutely be back, if we (hopefully) find ourselves in the Thomasville area again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cozy home in Thomasville.

Thank you for letting us stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice ""high end"" historic neighborhood surrounded by schools, ball fields, and playgrounds. Easy trip or longer walk to downtown area. Long sidewalks for dog walks. Neighbors stop to waive and say hello. House is oversized with a nice master bedroom and generous guest room. Lots of closet space. 2 full bathrooms. Nice laundry/utility room with washer/dryer and lots of room for shoes, boots, weather gear, etc. (without having to drag wet, dirty or soggy into the house). Roomy kitchen where 2 can cook and not run into each other. All appliances are made for the space and work great. Huge dining room and dining room table to enjoy meals at. Massive TV in TV room with connected office space and desk. All hardwood floors and white woodwork adds to the classic look. Generous parking in rear of house with fenced in area for a dog. Backyard table and chairs with cushions for enjoying the outdoors and cooler weather (November)."

This is a great house and I wouldn't hesitate to rent it again next time I'm in Thomasville."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place- it was super cute. I had a private backyard. I would definitely come back.

She was extremely hospitable, providing easy check-in/check-out instructions and making sure that everything was just perfect for my stay. The home itself was absolutely adorable!!! The interior was light, bright, and tastefully decorated which provided a fresh and comfortable feel. It looked just as great in person (if not better) than it did in the pictures and was actually larger than I had expected. The location was also great, close enough to all of the shops and restaurants downtown, but also removed enough for a quiet, peaceful stay. I would 100% stay here again if in the Thomasville area!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oh my word what a home! Fell in love from the moment I drove up to this beautifully restored property. Corner lot with gorgeous outdoor sitting area, oak trees, azaleas and well kept landscaping. Huge kitchen, equipped with all the essentials for our stay. Tastefully decorated with plenty of space for our family and pup. We enjoyed all the card games and local Thomasville magazines Lauren left for us. Office space was used during our stay for my remote work meetings, and couldn’t be happier with how quaint and quiet the neighborhood was. The home is filled with so many lovely windows in every room. Rooms/beds/pillows were super comfortable and sheets were so soft. Lauren did a great job picking out the best linens and towels. Everything was wonderful. Weather was perfect for day trips to Cherokee Park with our Pup, and walks through the historic downtown and streets to admire the Victorian homes. Plenty of shops and restaurants near by. We never drove more than 15 min to reach a destination. Lauren was a reliable host and was always available during our stay and offered plenty of information to help guide us through the villa. We had snacks and water waiting for us when we arrived, which was a nice treat! Overall, the place was a 10/10. I would highly recommend Lauren’s home and can’t wait to come back to Thomasville for another visit with my family!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean and overall good experience"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stand alone, garage style apartment was perfect. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen had everything I needed, and the place was immaculate. The location was excellent. I actually liked how the shower was in a separate space from the rest of the bathroom. This would seem to be especially beneficial for a couple. Moon’s Pizza - what a place! - was just around the corner and all of downtown was easy to get to on foot. The Thomasville History Museum, which I really enjoyed, was a few blocks down the street. Walking past all the beautiful homes to get there was a bonus. Thomasville is such an attractive city with more than enough to keep a person happily engaged for at least a few days. I would love to stay at Wendy and Ron’s place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This spot was perfect for us and the dogs. It was local to everything we wanted to see, and we walked everywhere. I would absolutely book this spot in the future!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was clean and cozy. I will say this is probably on our end but didn't realize that the gated yard had no access from inside so we had to leash our dog walk to the gared yard unleash and unfortunately the gate wasn't secure so we couldn't leave our dog out there alone ,even like while unpacking the car, the bed is extremely high off the ground which made life with a toddler very difficult and we left early however other than that great and was walking distance from ALL of downtown Thomasville."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! The location can't be beat. We walked in one direction to see lovely homes.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Adorable cottage, super clean, AWESOME neighborhood. We were disappointed only in that both the website and the paper with instructions said breakfast was included, and described how delicious the cinnamon rolls were. That breakfast is included and described should be removed from internet and on the welcome/instruction paper in the cottage. Other than that it was an amazing experience. Would recommend and would stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy stay, great for a quick stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for me and my little pup, in southwest GA for Thanksgiving with friends in nearby Cairo. Had everything I needed.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we had a nice stay, wendy was super helpful and responsive. it was a little expensive for such a small space, but it was very cute. they had local coffee and snacks available for use which was fun. the driveway was very inconvenient to get in and out of because it was so steep, it caused a lot of scrapes on both of our cars. that’s probably my only complaint!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and it was a pleasure. Everything was great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for a few days stay. Perfect size, clean, comfy bed. Only remarks are the bed is super high. There is a stool but if you have mobility problems could be an issue. Also the side yard gate doesn’t work well so if you have an animal you should still plan on a leash. Otherwise great experience and I will definitely stay again if needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy and Ronald were great and very helpful. We had to evacuate for a hurricane, and they were very accommodating to us.

2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and very close to downtown. Accommodations were good. Beware of steep driveway, especially in a large vehicle. Unfortunately, during my stay, painting of the next door building started each morning at 7am and rendered the side yard off limits."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little place for a great weekend in Thomasville! Great location, very clean and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really needed to get away & unwind. Normally we take our Sprinter RV and a boat to a State Park somewhere. I was reading my May Southern Living, and Thomasville spoke to me. But I didn’t want to go “glamping”. Went on Airbnb & VRBO. Found the Dawson St Cottage (converted garage) and it was perfect! Great location, we walked just about everywhere. Spent one cloudy day driving around and heading across the Florida / Georgia line. Although our Aussie went with us except to dinners, he was cozy in his kennel that we brought. However, we noticed a kennel under the bed that we could have used. Wendy thought of everything! Excellent host, cute place, great location!
5 Stars … we’ll be back!"

thank you for the stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed three nights in April, and it was just the cozy, relaxing environment I needed. This location is the best of both worlds that I was looking for: a quiet residential neighborhood only a few blocks from the lovely downtown area with lots of locally owned shops, an independent bookstore, bakeries, coffeeshops and restaurants. Super easy and safe to walk (or drive) into the downtown area to get food. If you need a grocery store, a Publix supermarket is just a few miles down the road. Thomasville's ""big oak,"" which is a huge lovely tree that dates back to 1680, is only a few blocks away too. (It sounds corny, but that tree is a thing of beauty.)
This Airbnb was very clean and cozy; the bed was super comfy; it was very quiet (I slept great); the window AC worked well; there was plenty of hot water in the shower; and I felt safe and secure as a woman staying by herself. I would highly recommend this place."

The check-in process was seamless, the location is perfect. We loved parking literally right at the door, which made unloading and loading easy. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised with the property - the amount of hospitable details is probably better than any AirBnB we've yet to stay at. They left such a lovely welcome gift, had the coffee bar set up so nicely, the place was super clean and we really appreciated the extra cleaning products available too! The wifi works great and we even loved that they had a Firestick TV (which made accessing movies for our toddler so easy). Like I said, we would highly recommend, you will not be disappointed :-)"

The space was better than we expected - cleaner, plenty of space for a couple, and the weather was perfect so we even got to sit outside at the little patio table and enjoy it. I saw other reviews about the shower being off the kitchen but it was no trouble for us at all. Actually nice because one could be showering while another could be using the sink/toilet in other space.
We really appreciated all the thoughtful little touches... snacks, drinks, and coffee were provided which was not expected and really really nice. A cute little basket of items that may be needed under the sink in the bathroom (band aids, toiletries, etc). The bed was extremely comfy and we found ourselves wanting to sleep in. One of the main attractions was that it was walking distance from the downtown, where we did a little shopping and had a nice lunch. Cute little town.
