2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The updated farmhouse was beautifully redone in both rustic and modern touches. It was great having two full bathrooms, and the bedrooms were very spacious. The kitchen was fully stocked and had all the essentials one would need for cooking. My husband and I played one of the provided board games after our daughter went to bed, which was nice. It's close to Ricketts Glen, which is beautiful! We stayed for a birthday trip to Knoebels, which is about 40 minutes away. I wish it was a tad closer, as I was hoping for a place that was 30 minutes max, but I'm still extremely happy with our stay here and will definitely be back and have already recommended it to family and friends!
Dave and his wife were very responsive and friendly and even offered nearby playgrounds for our young daughter, which was so nice. They are both great hosts and will do well in the Airbnb community. Thank you for having us and for opening your wonderful home to us, and thank you for being great hosts!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful host. The home is a farmhouse that is very beautiful and well taken care of. The view of the mountains in the dining room and master bedroom is absolutely breathtaking. The location is peaceful. The home is fully equipped with everything you may need. The home is clean and feels like you are right at home. Overall we had a great experience. It is a great location and not far from Rickets Glen state park. My family and I were well accommodated. We will differently be back.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had the best stay at Janette’s place! The place was just as pictured. Janette had everything we needed and even added some special items like the cookies and flavored creamers. She was very thoughtful. The home was immaculate and sits on a beautiful property. We enjoyed our coffee on the chairs out back with a view of the lake. So peaceful. We felt very comfortable and safe. Janette also gave us a great spot for food and ice cream. We will definitely be staying at Janette’s again in the future. PS her place is only 10 min from Knoebels!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enthusiastic 5 star rating!
Immaculately clean house. Perfect for accessing Bloomsburg and University activities.

This is the place to go see and enjoy yourself. Thank You."

We definitely plan to return in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Although a bit secluded, the individualized instructions were perfect. Close enough to town for food yet far enough away it comfortable country living. Such great hiking and trails for a brisk walk and see nature. We saw deer come almost up to the property one morning. Great stay for my daughter to spend her sweet 16 birthday party with a few friends. They got their money's worth out of the hot tub! Very well stocked kitchen and tons of blankets for the cool PA evenings. Thanks for a great couple of nights!"

Chris’ place was AMAZING! True to all the photos, listed amenities, and the glowing reviews- this house is stocked with everything you need to have a comfortable stay (kitchen supplies, extra blankets, linens, clean towels and washcloths, tp, etc). You can immediately sense the love and care in the home! Design details are classy, the views beautiful, and the surrounding area of the house is very serene. It is the perfect combo with modern amenities yet out in nature! It was pretty rainy most of the time we were there but we enjoyed the coziness of the home and the hot tub (wonderful in the cold weather especially!!). The property was very clean, and felt safe. And Chris is an excellent host! Overall, it was a wonderful stay! Highly recommend booking this space. My family and I are already planning to return again sometime! :)"

As hunters, we thoroughly enjoyed walking the property and seeing all the deer sign. We were even blessed with seeing deer on the way in the driveway, and deer at the hot tub on our last morning! The home was perfect. So clean and organized and everything you need is there. We felt right at home immediately. While there are many things to do nearby, we wanted to be away from it all - and we were! The kitchen was fantastic. We had everything we needed to cook all our meals. We truly look forward to going there again soon. Chris was a wonderfully responsive host and made sure we had all the information we needed. I also had some work to do while I was there and had no issues videoconferencing with the wifi. Highly recommend this host and this property!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sun Tower is a fantastic place to stay when in the Bloomsburg area. It sparkling clean, a fully equipped kitchen, two large bedrooms and great outdoor balconies off the kitchen downstairs and the bedrooms upstairs. We sat outside each evening and listened to the birds while enjoying an adult beverage. While pulling in, a family of turkeys, a family of deer, and some rabbits, welcomed us to the property. It is about as private as you can get situated on 60 acres with no other houses in sight but still a short drive into Bloomsburg. We will definitely stay at the Sun Tower again the next time we are in the area."

The home was very clean, comfortable and exceptionally well stocked with linens and thoughtful touches throughout. Communication was awesome and check-in was very easy. We’d absolutely recommend this adorable home to anyone staying in the Bloomsburg/Elysburg area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another incredible space Chris has created and shared. We have stayed in his “Fire Tower” previously and tis the “Sun Tower” did not disappoint. The space is unique and oh so private . We had a few local friends visit for dinner one night and they ALL were so incredibly impressed and happy to have such a space in their community. We will be back as often as time allows. Thank you Chris … see you again soon.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Very close to Knoebels for our annual family reunion.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris’s place is fantastic. It was clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. There were so many great spaces to relax and so many homey touches. Even though it’s secluded you’re right down the road from Bloomsburg so you get the best of everything."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about this place. My husband and I stayed the weekend just to get out of the city for a couple of days and Sun Tower was perfect. The grounds were excellent, the house was as described (or maybe even better) and it was so private. It was close to town (like less than 10m drive) but it felt like you were miles away. Highly recommend !"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here with two girlfriends for a weekend! The house was clean and so cute! We loved Chris’s recommendations for where to go in the area.

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Recently celebrated my birthday here with a few close friends for a quick get away/ski trip. Chris recommended the best places to ski. This place is exactly what you see in the photo’s completely secluded and peaceful, which was definitely needed for my friends because when the wine gets going we can get a little noisy lol. Highly recommend a weekend stay to get away from the city. I will be looking forward to going back this summer. He was also flexible with extending the check out time but “don’t quote me” as I can see this place being booked up in the warmer seasons! Thanks Chris!
There was even merch available such as dad hats, and mugs which we thought was a cute touch!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Any amazing location, a stunning property. Chris is focused on ensuring his guest are welcome, comfortable, and situated in town. Making the experience wonderful. His dining recommendations are on point."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay for a impromptu getaway.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As 3 best friends that live in 3 different states, this house provided the perfect girls weekend central to all of us, which we all needed and don’t get often! Everything was clean and well taken care of, beds were so comfy and we all slept great. The property was fun to explore, we loved the colored Christmas trees!
We loved playing the square wooden game, but had to search online for instructions to figure out. Small suggestion to provide ☺️
Thank you, Chris, for providing the perfect space to allow us to recharge!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the suntower. It was quiet and peaceful. There were lots of trails to walk and wildlife to see. The house was immaculate and welcoming. The directions Chris gave were spot on. I look forward to a return visit!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place and an even better host. It's a private place and very close to Bloomsburg main street.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Chris
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I use Chris’s place as a getaway from the rat race….both the Sun Tower and the Fire Tower are great spots to slow down and enjoy the nature they are built upon. Chris is a great guy and very easy to communicate with, you won’t be sorry you booked either place!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed such a wonderful stay at the Sun House! The house is beautiful with lots of thoughtful and considerate touches for guests. Very clean and comfortable. We awoke to a beautiful sunrise each morning, and had a fire in the fire pit each night. We enjoyed exploring the grounds, a gorgeous hike at Rickett's Glen State Park, and walking around Knoebel's. We will absolutely be back, and will recommend The Sun House to friends and family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely exceeded our expectations. Usually I communicate more with hosts but Chris' messages were so clear, concise, detailed and helpful that I simply did not have to.
The cleanliness of the Sun Tower when we arrived was unmatched. Perfection.
The Sun Tower is extremely private and secluded which is exactly what we were looking for, and Chris' instructions made it easy to get to. The amenities were over the top (three different ways to make coffee?!), smart TVs to cast to, outdoor heater, hammock, the two decks were awesome, just everything was so great.
My wife and I have been airbnbing for 4-5 years now, and this was hands down one of our favorite stays. We'd absolutely want to come back in the future, and we wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin in a fantastic location. It really has everything for a lengthy stay or a short trip. Everything needed to cook or grill plus convenience to a bunch of good restaurants. The cabin itself is beautiful & thoughtfully designed. Loved the upper patio, the retro arcade table, and comfy king bed. The property feels very private yet is a really short drive to town. Nice walks to be had through the trees but I really enjoyed the cabin itself & all of the amenities. Chris was a great host & really prompt to respond to questions. Hope to come back again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and service from the host. Everything was provided for our stay and then some. Thank you for your hospitality!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our time here, we could not have picked a better place to stay. The home is very secluded but close enough to enjoy everything the town offers. The property provides the perfect backdrop for family pictures. Our grandchildren enjoyed making smores in the firepit and seeing all the wildlife. We were welcomed by deer every morning. The beds were very comfortable and the home was well-stocked, Chris has truly thought of everything."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The private Sun Tower is beautiful 😍 , clean, peaceful, and close to shopping center. Would definitely recommend anyone who wants a private oasis in the woods."

Id give this one 10 stars if I could!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Speechless, this place was awesome perfect combination of privacy and not being too far from the city. Beautiful and clean, and cool amenities around the house and property that made the stay fun! Defiantly recommend throwing down 250$ a night for this!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent modern chalet, very clean, well equipped and peaceful location!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time at the Suntower relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet of this tranquil location. The home is beautiful and the kitchen is fully stocked with kitchen ware, appliances, and essentials. We enjoyed spending time cooking some nice meals, chilling by the fire pit and playing the classic arcade game console upstairs. This was a great location for a hiking trip we planned to Ricketts Glen, which is approximately 35 minutes away from the Suntower. My car is a front wheel drive sedan and had no issues getting up the driveway during a rainstorm, although you may need an AWD vehicle in snow/ice conditions."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Suntower is truly a special retreat in the country. Our whole family enjoyed taking walks through the tree farm, and encountering all the wildlife along the way. We saw many young deer, wild turkeys, rabbits and even came across a box turtle in the woods. Something for everyone in the family to enjoy. And Chris has really thought of everything! Super comfortable stay for everyone."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here for a 30th birthday weekend. The views are amazing from the house and surrounding area. If you are looking to star gaze, this is your place!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time and our four kids had a blast running around the property. There is plenty to do around the area, the Pioneer Coal Mine, the Rolling Hills Red Deer Farm and Knoebels. In town we had the best pizza also! We would definitely come back to this area, it was beautiful and relaxing!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at the sun tower. Very clean and has great amenities.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house and property was amazing and perfect for our family vacation. I seriously can’t say enough good things about the listing. Beds were comfy and had high quality bedding. Decor was beautiful. The house was spotless upon our arrival. Chris communicated well and was was easy to get ahold of. The property was remote and beautiful to hike. And the location was rural but 15 minutes from great restaurants and Knoebles.
Will 100% be staying again.
Can’t wait!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"beautiful spot to relax and unwind

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is just as pictured! Stocked with everything you need and great location. Close to all the restaurants, shops and groceries. Chris was a wonderful host!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Book your stay now! We had a fabulous time and the kids really enjoyed being outside and seeing all the rabbits, squirrels, deer, turkey and turtles! The porch was very relaxing and we spent an entire day hanging out and reading. Loved making s'mores and hot dogs at the firepit. The house is very well stocked and has just about everything you need minus your main meals/food. The beds are very comfortable and the entire house is beautiful. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is the place. The driveway is a gravel/dirt road and we have a FWD and had no problems, but we did not have any heavy rain so we cannot attest to that.
We are aviation enthusiasts so it was fun to watch the small planes on their approach into Bloomsburg airport from the porch. Close to town and most attractions. Knoebels was awesome as was the Coal Mine/Steam Train tour in Ashland (do not wear good shoes and be sure to bring a jacket). If you are a cat lover, there is a place called ""Cats in Bloom"" in town and you can go in and mingle with cats, really cool concept to help them find homes.
HIGHLY recommend and we will be back!! Thank you."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"I would recommend this house for anyone needing accomodations in the area. It was less expensive then a hotel, and the accomodations were excellent for the size of our group. We had plenty of room for the kids to hand out between games of their soccer tournament. The game room was a big hit!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Paul's home is a gem if you're coming into town for any events happening at Bloomsburg University. It is directly across the street, and very accessible to the local restaurants and shops. Paul was a phenomenal host, very gracious and the best hospitality we have had in an AirBnb thus far. We will be back when it's time for the fair."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is a wonderful host and helped advise and direct us for a family weekend where we needed extra accommodations. Her place was pristine - super cozy and had everything we needed. We will most likely be back again (and again)! Thank you Lisa!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Super clean and comfortable place to stay. Host was terrific. We will stay here again when we’re up that way. You can’t go wrong with this property.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s home was spotless and very comfortably furnished. Kitchen is well stocked with kitchenware and utensils - loved our stay!
We were attending our daughter’s graduation from BU and Lisa left a small congratulatory balloon, a wine glass and bottle of wine to honor her!! That is way above and beyond.
We would definitely come back should we need lodging in the Bloomsburg area in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wish we had more time to spend there. It was very close to downtown Bloomsburg, which is where our event was held. (Fairgrounds)
Everything was very clean, plenty of space for our group. Would have loved to get in a round of golf!
We would stay here again for sure, and plan to next year for the MAWA event."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We could not adore Lisa more! She provided us the most beautiful and comfortable home away from home following the birth of our son! Lisa went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, even delivering baby items to make our stay with our newborn easier! Lisa was so flexible with our check-in and check-out, and responded to us almost immediately when we had questions about the area/home. If you want to stay in a beautiful, clean, comfortable home hosted by some of the kindest people you will ever meet, stay here! Lisa is not only a gracious host, but an absolutely wonderful and special person!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was very accommodating, flexible and super quick to respond to questions. We stayed over Christmas since our son couldn't make it home & were all (4 total) very comfortable. We all had separate bedrooms & the living space was comfortable & clean. Well-equipped kitchen - we used the oven, stovetop & grill with no issues whatsoever. We look forward to returning in the future. THANK YOU!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was responsive and friendly in all communications, provided information prior to and during our staff plus instructions & information documented in the kitchen were very helpful. Lisa also provided a small snack basket of local items which was sweet of her. The townhouse was very clean, organized, good use of the space, & the ammentities were spot on. Overall the 4 of us were quite comfortable and enjoyed the experience."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The rental property was just as described in the listing. It was very nice, clean and well stocked with many items. The view is beautiful off the deck and there was a good supply of games and start up items for your stay.
Lisa was exceptional in communicating and answering any questions and checked in to make sure things were going well for us. She went above and beyond when one of our guests left items behind and made it easy for them to gather their belongings.
The townhouse is close to restaurants and stores but far enough away to be peaceful. I would highly recommend this rental property.
Thank you Lisa!!"

Being right on the golf course was so convenient and you are only 5 minutes away from stores/restaurants. We will be back the next time we are down in the area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Lisa’s place for a few days and loved it. The beautiful mountain views with coffee in hand from the deck were breathtaking. My young daughters loved being there. My husband was able to play golf and loved the place as well. Lisa’s place was immaculate and very clean.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great! The house was clean and beautiful! Check in was super easy and the owner touched base with us to make sure everything was ok! We would use this rental again for sure!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and beautiful place real peaceful place to getaway from work and stress lol already planning the next trip with the wife and kids
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place to get away to! Spectacular views. We were lucky enough to have a full moon one night and the next nothing put clear sky for the star gazer. Fire pit was roaring. Can’t wait to plan my next stay!

Terri & Gary"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,had an amazing birthday at the fire tower! very peaceful quiet and able to unwind . the views are breathtaking. We can't wait to come back and stay again!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BOOK IT AND DON’T THINK TWICE! It is exactly what you would think from the photos. This was my first stay at an Airbnb and it was well worth the money. You are in the mountains with nothing around but nature. All you need to bring is some K cups of your favorite coffee for the morning and nothing like sitting out on the deck with a fresh hot cup of coffee. Or Dunkin is about a 7 min drive. Picked up some burgers and hotdogs and grilled was perfect. I will 100% be back this summer for a little weekend getaway.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering a stay here, DON'T WAIT, JUST BOOK IT!!! I cannot say enough about this rental property. Exactly as described, so clean, private, bed was very comfortable. What made this rental so special were all the little touches that you don't expect. All of the outdoor seating areas, an outdoor heater, outdoor jenga by the firepit, everything you could ever want in a kitchen (supply wise), all the spices and such that you'd need to cook with, ample towels in bathroom, and a heater in bathroom!!! The TV is preloaded with Netflix, Prime, etc if you want to veg out, the walking/hiking trails are organized/well thought out with cute markers along the way. Just go. It's worth it!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the fire tower! Excellent location. You feel like you’re far away from the world but the town is only 5 min away from everything we needed. We will definitely be back! Exactly what we needed for a short getaway.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely stay in a great place. Host was available as needed and had everything set-up perfectly for our stay. We'll certainly be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Chris’ Fire Tower Chalet and are already planning to return!
The house is so private and secluded, but peaceful and safe. The farm was wonderful and my boyfriend loved getting to navigate around the trails on the property.
We visited Turkey Hill Brewery for some dinner on our first night and it was delicious! The home was in a great location, we were easily able to day trip to Jim Thorpe and it just made for a great time. The house itself was incredible, we were astounded with the panoramic views and we can’t wait to come back again. Thank you so much for Chris for letting us into your beautiful home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cool property, amazing views, and exceptionally clean home. My wife said it was the most relaxing time she's had in years. We'd love to come back again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic find. 10/10 would stay there again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place had us relaxing as soon as we unpacked!
A quiet, serene and beautiful location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place for a short getaway! Exceeded expectations & the view from bed as the sun rose each morning was beautiful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a restful, peaceful, delightful time at the cabin. The wildlife was abundant. Perfect place to rest and refresh your spirit. We will definitely be back to enjoy the serenity of this location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful time. Just us and nature for a couple of days - couldn't have asked for a better experience!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful for a weekend getaway! Location and house was exactly as described, would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris is a amazing host. The family makes you feel so welcomed. The getaway is just what you need. Beautiful home. Everything you need is right in the home. Beyond breath taking, The snow and to be able to relax and enjoy the outdoors. We have been there before and will definitely go again. This is the home, You really feel welcomed and relax. We decided to stay in and cook and had the best time. The views are stunning and took memories home with us. The great getaway. Thank you Chris and family for opening your home to us and others to see and enjoy. Thank You."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location is amazing. Beautiful views and very secluded. Perfect for a getaway to recover and reconnect with your better half. We will absolutely stay here again. We had a snow storm while we were there and the next day Chris was plowing a path so that we could leave the next day. Five stars is not enough. Thank you Chris. You and your property made for an excellent stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked this for my birthday getaway since I wanted something quiet and relaxing .. I wanted seclusion and relaxation!!! I’m a busy working mom most days and I wanted a weekend of quiet peace and relaxation!!!! This house was sooooo beautiful and so peaceful !!! When you wake up the sun is just rising so beautifully right at you ! The Draus family had a really cool scavenger hunt that had me and my husband out on the trails for hours and tons of laughs ! Felt like kids ! We didn’t find the second clue lol ohhh but we will be back ! The fire pit was awesome we had beautiful weather so we were able to have some wine and warm up by the fire ! They have a good selection of games as well !!! My favorite part everything is literally 5 minutes down restaurants , bars and supermarkets ! The breweries and coffee shops were awesome ! Don’t think about it book it! Chris place was awesome!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wanna take a min to thank Chris the Fire Tower was a great place to relax unwind and forget about the real world for a few days. The place felt just like home it was quite peaceful and quiet. Only complaint is we weren’t there long enough haha. Id highly recommend anyone to come stay here.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a much needed relaxing stay at the Fire Tower! Very private and peaceful with beautiful views. The house was cozy and perfect for my husband and I.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an amazing birthday weekend in the Firetower Chalet. The property was beautiful, and Chris was a great host. It was the exact type of secluded getaway that we needed. The town is a quick drive and has a great selection of bars and restaurants as well. We plan to return with the kids in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Firetower was everything we could’ve hoped for and more. It was such a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. The scenery is incredible and the building itself nothing short of magical. The sunrise comes through the windows in the morning for an unforgettable and enchanting wake up. There are also so many little touches that made the place extra fun and exciting and showed the owners truly care about you and your stay. I hope we get to come back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great way to ring in the new year. Surrounded my nature with no outside distractions. We loved our stay and will for sure be back. So many personal touches. The property and home were beautiful. thank you !
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the remoteness of the location. Trees and no cars and no humans. A great way to get away.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent in all ways. Deer, birds, squirrels and howling coyotes were our only companions for a lovely winter solstice trip. Thank you Chris."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for our babymoon. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings and great views.
Chris was a great host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend The Firetower to anyone looking for a secluded getaway with scenic views.
Chris was very friendly, responsive, and made our stay a breeze.
Thank you Chris!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what the wife and I needed coming from a very busy urban area. Quiet and peaceful. The views and surroundings made us feel secluded even though the town was only ten minutes away. Would recommend for anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as per usual. Thanks Chris !
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Recently, my family and I had the pleasure of staying at the stunning Firetower Chalet and it was an amazing experience. Chris, our host, was incredibly welcoming and ensured that we had everything we needed during our stay. The Firetower Chalet was spotlessly clean and spacious, providing us with all the amenities we required to feel right at home. The location was perfect, as the Firetower was remote yet with easy access to neighboring towns like the charming town of Bloomsburg and the eerie former site of Centralia. We would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a comfortable, remote, and peaceful place to stay in the area. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and we are eagerly looking forward to coming back soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as listed and a wonderful place to get away and relax.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Celebrated my wedding weekend and Chris went above and beyond with a few personal touches to congratulate us as a newly married couple. Could not have dreamed of a more prefect location, with a gorgeous sunrise to wake up to! The most prefect weekend getaway from all the emotions, and nerves leading up to our special day!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Fire Tower is an amazing place. You are completely surrounded by nature and peacefulness . It has all the comforts of home with a beautiful view.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I really enjoyed our short stay here. The house has everything you could possibly need. The home is located within a few minutes of downtown Bloomsburg area so we were relatively close to dining and shopping areas. The 60 acres surrounding the property has some great scenery and wild life (we seen turkeys and deer). Would highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and property
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second time back to the fire tower in October and we talked about making it an annual tradition. This time we combined celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary and a mini-babymoon since our first child is due January 2024. Had another great stay and enjoyed some local food (Big Dan’s BBQ and Brewski’s were favorites). Although I couldn’t partake in wine this trip, we both really enjoyed Fero Winery when we visited last year so stopped to stock up on favorite varietals while we were up here.
A few recommendations for a few things for guests to bring to make your stay even better: if you like to read at night but your partner likes to go to sleep, consider bringing a book light, or even a small lamp or candles for mood lighting in the bedroom since there’s only 1 panel switch for all of upstairs and the lights are very and not dimmable. Bring a reusable K cup for those who prefer using their own coffee grounds. And supplies for s’mores because the fire pit will call to you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin has been our bucket list for a long time. It was our first night away from our son as new parents. We were thrilled to see that there was one night available between other stays and Chris was kind enough to allow us to stay for the one night. Best 24 hours. We both left feeling relaxed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and myself booked the firetower from Chris and his family last year and we loved it so much that we booked again this year! A year later and the family has added so many little touches to the location and things to do while enjoying our stay.
The location is in the middle of the forest on private property. The Firetower itself is very well stocked and well thought out. The location has been extremely clean the last two times that we have stayed.
If you are thinking about booking DO IT! We love this location and have made so many memories and will continue to book in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful private space to make memories with family.
Enjoyed the music instruments and the extra treehouse space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at the Firetower for a few days to celebrate my husband’s 30th birthday. Every day we marveled at how perfect this place is! Secluded feel but crazily only 5-10 minutes to groceries, restaurants, and whatever other supplies you might need. We didn’t explore the town too much other than to grab groceries & go golfing one of the days - we spent most of our time at the place playing games (ones we brought & yard games that are provided!), enjoying the bonfire, strolling around the property, and savoring the slow pace at the cabin.
I watched the sunrise from the balcony every morning, wrapped in a blanket with my tea in hand. It was spectacular. One morning I was even joined by a family of deer grazing near the yard!
Chris has thought of everything to make the Firetower comfortable & inviting.
My ONLY advice is if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs - the upstairs heater is loud when it turns on in the silence of night! Luckily we didn’t need the heat up there.
We’ll be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place on a beautiful property. We enjoyed our stay.
Easy check in, simple checkout instructions (did not have a list of chores we had to complete before leaving).
Great place, great host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Just what we needed for a couple of days. Chris was an amazing communicator. We’d recommend this place to anyone just looking to chill.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, clean, great views, and very quiet. We enjoyed Chris's recommendations for Big Dan's Barbecue and visiting Ricketts Glen."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, relaxing weekend in a beautiful, private location."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was beautiful! The only thing that I didn’t like is that the front door did not lock. For my security I had to drag the recliner in front of the door every night before going to bed. That would be my 1 and only complaint. Besides that, I would definitely come back again!! Definitely was what I needed. Thank you Chris for your quick responses and offering this place for stays. I would love here if I could!!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Loved our weekend at the fire tower. Very private with lots of wildlife (deer and turkeys). Would definitely recommend it to friends.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I like to get away around our anniversary, and we love the mountains and nature. We happened across Chris’s listing of his absolutely gorgeous Fire Tower, and we were instantly intrigued. From the time we walked in the front door, we felt an immediate sense of relaxation and connection to nature. This spot is very private (which we very much prefer), and the entire time we were there, it felt like we had the entire mountain to ourselves! Chris was a fantastic host, making sure that everything was clear, that the listing was accurate, that the house was spotless, and that we had everything we needed. This is my favorite place that we have picked to vacation, and I really mean that. I absolutely love it up there. We will be booking a little after Christmas to experience it in the winter, and we’re super excited to go back. We’ve been home for 12 hours, and we’re both missing it already. If you’re thinking about booking and you like nature, do it. You will not regret it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here, would definitely recommend it and would love to return😊"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,…
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing stay"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Special place to get away from the world for a few days.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the chalet. The house was clean, location was amazing, and we enjoyed the outdoor space!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, secluded place with fantastic views. The house itself was very comfortable with all the amenities you could need, and the town of Bloomsburg itself is just minutes away if you want to grab some food or groceries. We want to go back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Firetower was even better than anticipated. Completely peaceful and only a 5 minute drive to town, having all you need. Every need was addressed and I will be booking again with Chris. Absolutely wonderful!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as shown/described and our stay was wonderful. The proximity to town / general stores can’t be emphasized enough if considering this place in my opinion
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place, was private and secluded with a great view. The house is architecturally interesting with great details all around.
Chris the host was proactive each step of the way so we never had to worry about what to do next.
while the driveway was initially daunting, it was easy to traverse and out pops this beautiful house on the hill.
hiking the tree farm was such a great treat on top."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the fire tower. It’s really a wonderful private space.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and peaceful place for our anniversary. Highly recommended. Everything was as described, and we had everything we needed. The town of Bloomsburg was conveniently near by (you wouldn't know it while at the Fire Tower), and the restaurant recommendations were great."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful fire tower secluded away from the main road. This was literally the tranquil vacation my sisters and I were looking for. We had a great time just staying on the property, seeing the wildlife and playing games/reading in the various spaces provided. It rained one night while we were there and so we didn’t get to use the hammock outside but honestly this is the best place to re-energize yourself. Waking up and seeing the sunrise from our bed was a beautiful way to start the day too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The firetower was an amazing getaway for my wife and I. Everything was as described and some touches were above and beyond. The second floor deck led to amazing views and the fire pit was a great end to our evening. The bridge to another outdoor seating area was an amazing touch. We enjoyed the recommendations made by Chris for local restaurants and breweries. We will stay again and I highly recommend this property. Thanks for the wonderful stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My three brothers and I took a little “broski” getaway trip for a couple days to unwind and bond. This is one of the coolest places I’ve ever stayed at and I can’t wait to go back this fall. Just trust me when I tell you it’s an incredible experience and book this place quick, before someone else does."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a relaxing stay. Definitely will be booking again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot for a weekend getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love the place! Very private and looks amazing! Now my only thing I noticed was a creepy picture of the fire tower in flames, I didn’t mind it but to some people it can be just a tad bit creepy especially if it it’s there first time lol and the way scary movies ruin people mines lol but besides that I would definitely book again. The people in Bloomsburg was very kind and the amusement park was tons of fun and cheap compared to others!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As a skeptic I was doubtful as the pictures looked too good to be true. Glad I let me my wife talk me into it because it was as beautiful as pictured, if not better. Remote location with lots of wildlife, yet only about a 15 min drive from restaurants and shopping centers. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best weekend! Thank you
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home close to nature. Loved watching the stars from the deck and relaxing in the hammock chair. If you want a quiet restful spot - this is it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! The bedroom upstairs was like sleeping in a tree house. The deck outside the bedroom was very comfortable with a great view! My husband spent all his time out there reading. The Fire Tower was very comfortable, and we would love to return every season. Chris was very helpful and responsive. If you like bagels, we loved Bloomin Bagels in town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful secluded getaway that was only minutes from town but felt miles away. This kind of trip is good for the soul.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even better than the pictures. Don’t hesitate, it’s a beautiful couple’s getaway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time there, my wife and I felt right at home, there's a lot to do in that house, it was clean and looked amazing in person, the views are amazing there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the fire tower.
Secluded but still close to town.
We will definitely book again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend! Perfect for a peaceful relaxing getaway. Will likely visit again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The upper level deck was our favorite part!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The fire tower was absolutely beautiful. It was perfect to get away and be able to disconnect. Chris was super helpful and made sure everything went flawless.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"As described, nice location and good communication and directions from Host. Lots of places to eat a short drive away."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris’s place was beautiful! It felt like we were in the middle of nowhere even though we were only 5 minutes from town. The place was so relaxing, peaceful, clean, and remote. We were able to take a walk around the property and we enjoyed the fire pit. Chris was also very responsive when we had a question. We would definitely consider coming back to one of Chris’s properties!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place, so beautiful. I was a little worried my Prius wouldn’t make it up the road when I arrived because of the storm but it wasn’t an issue. I made it up no problem. Private area with great views."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Chris' place! Our only ""complaint"" was it was too short (hopefully we will remedy that down the road with a longer return visit)! Just ""what the Dr ordered""....peaceful, clean, comfortable w/gorgeous views and everything we could want for a relaxing stay. Absolutely loved everything about it. Thanks so much!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly how the pictures are . Peaceful and private and was a great place to relax. Would totally recommend the Firetower.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The FireTower was absolutely amazing! The pictures don't do it justice. The home was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed. The only thing we wanted for was more time to relax at this tranquil retreat.

My daughter and I enjoyed exploring the woods. We swear we saw unicorns running through the Christmas tree farm 🦄🦄🦄 Word of the wise-don’t attempt to instacart groceries, they did t show up for me but luckily there are grocery stores just a mile away."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for an amazing getaway! I came here with a friend for a spiritual reset and it was breathtaking!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What an experience. Core memories were made here that will last forever! I was speechless when I first walked in and really saw the beauty of the firetower, the location and the views! Best place I’ve ever stayed in terms of other houses and hotels! Such a beautiful little niche spot. Will definitely be coming back here many more times and with friends so they can have the amazing experience too! Thank you Chris!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay, everything was great!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was the perfect Valentine’s getaway! It felt like an escape in the woods but was also only minutes from town.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The fire tower was a fantastic getaway. The location is perfect. Very private, but very close to fantastic restaurants and attractions. Chris was a great host and I can’t wait to come back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful retreat away from the city this is your place! Fire Tower is one of the most well built, unique and lovely places we’ve stayed. The attention to detail is stunning. Highly recommended!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A memory made for a lifetime. My partner and I had a beautiful stay. It was a lovely space in the woods with an unreal view. I was still in such a good mood when I returned home. It gets toasty which I loved. We played the couples game and a little guitar . We watched cartoons and relaxed. The kitchen is stocked, fridge is clean . He even had old bay seasoning :). It took me a little to get comfy bc I am a city girl and you are REALLY out in the woods and there is a small chain on the door and no blinds on the windows which my city mind had to reconcile. My bf however slept fine ! There is heat in the bathroom++! That was the best thing besides the view for me. Water was warm in shower with good pressure. Bed was comfy. If you are a light sleeper the heater being above you makes little noises so we had to turn it off. Also if you can avoid going at night time get there while there is daylight. It is a little daunting in the dark. Chris letting us use the trunk was a heaven sent"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great and relaxing stay. We plan to return in the future. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Well worth it!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Fire Tower is amazing. It’s extremely private and has unbeatable mountain and sunrise views. We were only there for a night, but got some much needed R&R. Proximity to Bloomsburg was quite nice."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautiful and it’s very clear that a lot of love went into designing it. The views were breathtaking and it was so peaceful to walk around the farm. It was the perfect place to spend an anniversary and we will be recommending to friends.
Thank you, Chris and family, for welcoming us in for a weekend in the country."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I needed a getaway from the day to day hustle. We chose to book Chris’s fire tower for a relaxing getaway. The scenery is unmatched! The property is secluded but only 10 minutes from the town of Bloomsburg. We arrived about 30 minutes before check in and Chris was on site finishing preparing for our stay. He was incredibly accommodating and informative about his property. His guidebook listed on his airbnb page is filled with local attractions, it’s worth looking at. Overall the fire tower is unmatched in my opinion, Chris is a great host, we highly recommend this airbnb!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic, both host and place. I have never seen a host can reply to my general question within 30 minutes but Chris did it. The Firetower is stunning and the best place to spend time with your loved one."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly as described and Chris was extremely communicative, helpful, and proactive!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although we were not actually able to travel on the day of our stay (massive storm, flash freeze on the highways), Chris was the ultimate host, very communicative, suggested places we could eat nearby. It was a true sincere pleasure working with Chris."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you want to connect with nature and detach from a busier life for a few days, the Firetower is the perfect place. would 100% go again."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris’ place was absolutely beautiful. He was very hospitable and was even kind enough to assist us with firewood. We were lucky enough to experience a beautiful snowfall while sitting next to the firepit. While on vacation, one of the things we were looking forward to the most was sleeping in. However, the beautiful view from the wrap-around porch had us eager to wake up before the sunrise every morning. We are really looking forward to coming back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris’s Airbnb was gorgeous & he was so accommodating. Highly recommend!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Fire Tower is everything it appears to be. It’s beautiful and had so many unique spots to take in nature and the spectacular views. You are truly transcended when you are there and anyone looking to get away and be in nature with all the amenities of home, this is a bonafide winner!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an AMAZING stay! The details into making the home a serene and relaxing getaway are fantastic! The home is very clean and cozy. It is comfortably tucked into the woods with an amazing view. The sunrises from the bedroom were amazing as well as the stars lighting up the evening sky. The eagle, turkey and deer all made their appearances. Excellent host with great communication. Highly recommend and will definitely be returning."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A peaceful getaway. Amazing views and great for quality time away from home.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beyond Expectations. If you are thinking about booking DO IT. Highlights of our trip included making a fire in the huge fire pit they have outside, using the hammock they have close to the fire tower and listening to the wind and the trees, and waking up in morning to the sun coming over the horizon and hitting the fire tower. Everything was EXTREMELY clean and the house had every pot pan and kitchen gadget you could think of. 10 out of 5 stars for this experience! Thanks Draus family and can’t wait to stay again!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A picture perfect mini getaway for our 8th wedding anniversary. Felt so lucky to snag two nights during peak October fall foliage season and enjoyed our time in the Firetower. From shooting stars on a clear starry night, to the blue-green flame of the birch trees in our fire pit, to enjoying the mountain view with our morning coffee and evening glasses of wine from the many nearby wineries, the experiences the Firetower offers is magical. The hosts have thought of all amenities you might need both inside and out…a hammock, plenty of lawn games, a fire pit, bikes and a grill, plus board games, movies and musical instruments…you won’t be bored!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Beautiful views. Close to rickett Glenn- where we spent the day hiking followed by pizza and beer at berwick brewery (pizza was amazing!) followed by a campfire at night.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing and a great time. Very convenient to town. Chris was great
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy and peaceful place with breathtaking view.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very secluded and special place to stay. Amazing place and property making you feel that you are all by yourself in the middle of the mountains but yet in 5 to 10 minutes eating at a great restaurant or local eatery. Very well taken care of and a perfect place to recharge yourself.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVELY LOVELY LOVELY!!!!!!The view from the balcony or the bed is amazing.TONS of things to do on site.Just beautiful!This is a must stay location.We got summer time scenery that was gorgeous but I can only imagine what fall or winter would look like.You should definitely stay here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the Fire Tower. If it’s available definitely book your stay! The view is amazing and so private! We saw some deer had a fire and listened to all the sounds of nature. Coffee on the upstairs deck. So relaxing We can’t wait to come back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! I truly don’t know where to start. The VIEW! The space, the land were all well above our expectations! We were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation that did not disappoint! Great place for a family get away to disconnect from the city for a while. If this is available I’d recommend you book! Thank you Chris."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The fire tower is a quiet, secluded place to stay, perfect for a romantic getaway. At night the woods seem to sing and it is a wonderful way to be lulled to sleep. It is obvious Chris put a lot of thought into every aspect of this quaint, little hideaway. A must see!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem. If you find this available and don’t snap it up you are out of your mind. It is quiet and secluded without being remote. It is just as clean as the pics and has everything you need for a getaway. That being said if you have a four wheel drive vehicle, bring it. :) they will let you borrow the work truck if you don’t. We are definitely going to go back again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the Fire Tower. It was beautiful and remote as described. We are extremely pleased and so happy we chose this location to stay. Everything about the stay was comfortable. This place is impeccable!! We enjoy using several of the yard games which was very nice to find.
In addition the host provided perfect information including local places to visit which was great to know.
We will certainly pass word along about this place and our 5 star stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So gorgeous! The views especially from the top floor are stunning. It was lovely to wake up every morning with the sun streaming through. This trip was a getaway for us as a couple, but we have a nursing baby, so she tagged along. If you're in our situation and wondering if a place like this will work for you, come! You could easily fit a pack n play in that second floor bedroom, or you could fit a pack n play in the loft, which is what we did (our baby is only just learning how to crawl and can't pull to stand, which is why that was a safe option for us). We loved going on a hike on the grounds, reading, playing games, using the camp fire; it was so wonderful and relaxing."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! It is scenic and beautiful, but still close enough to fun attractions! The nature is beautiful and the fire tower is well stocked with games and amenities ☺️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Firetower. It is a very special place. While it is a short drive to Bloomsburg and its restaurants, it feels like you are away from everything. A perfect place to unwind and relax. The Firetower was spotlessly clean. Chris is a great communicator and quickly answered our questions. It has a full kitchen and nice living room. The highlight is the upstairs master bedroom and the deck surrounding it. We watched sunset every night from the upstairs deck. A little slice of heaven. I highly recommend staying at the Firetower. We plan to stay there the next time we are in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The fire tower is a great getaway! My husband & I has a relaxing weekend there to celebrate our anniversary. Chris is a great host and responded to our questions right away.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris is super friendly, place is wonderful, view from the deck is great!
Deer, Turkeys, Rabbits, Owls......."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, though the first was over five years ago in the winter. Both seasons were beautiful and unique, and the house has everything you need to be comfortable. We loved star gazing from the deck, truly unbeatable views, and loved all the wildlife that came to visit. Lovely, peaceful place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than the pictures. Very cozy, private, etc. etc. All clean and modern."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The fire tower is a must stay. The house is cozy and well designed with beautiful views.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Firetower is everything described and more. This is a fabulous place to relax and unwind, yet just a short drive to activities, stores and restaurants. The accommodations are very cozy and comfortable and we can’t wait to book our next stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is beautiful, and so are the views - but all of the lovely touches, the wonderful communication from our host, all the little extras that made it so comfortable and lovely…it was the perfect place for a small girls’ weekend away and we loved it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning! Secluded but a quick drive into town. 10/10 would recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As a creative this was PERFECT! Nice and quiet. The nature walks were a plus with a cup of coffee. I highly recommend!

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very secluded yet close to all of your needs. Chris does a great job of making sure guests are satisfied.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is special. It offers seclusion (while still being just a few minutes from town) and total tranquility. If you enjoy nature and quiet, this is the place for you. We enjoyed the hike around the fire tower. The inside is lovely and modern, but has the rustic charm of wood all around. Just beautiful. And, if we forgot to bring something, they probably already had it. If they don't, there's plenty of stores within a 10 minute drive. I would highly recommend this place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couples get away. Very relaxing. We would definitely recommend this place to all of our friends.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was a great host- very responsive, and the place was amazing!!! It was very private, but a short drive into town. We had a relaxing stay and look forward to visiting again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Magical firetower with all the modern amenities that you need. The firetower’s design is magnificent and the sunset views are incredible. Comfortable, cozy, and feels just like home in your own private woods. A must for any couple looking to getaway."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and getaway from everything.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and awesome fire tower cabin! We would definitely stay here again. Loved the firepit and how private yet still close to town this is.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay in May. Just as advertised. Secluded, terrific views, great nature walks and best of all, very close to Knoebels Amusement Park. Lots of fun!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this place. It’s the perfect place to stay if you want to get away and enjoy quiet and the beauty of nature.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exquisitely serene space and location. My daughter loved sleeping in the loft and we all enjoyed long rainy walks around Chris’ land. The 360 degree windows in the bedroom are to die for. We will be back.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay in a super nice place to stay! Delightful enjoyment in the middle of the nature. The accommodation has all the facilities you need.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic location and stay! My family booked the firetower as a place to stay when we visited Knoebels park. It was such a nice, relaxing location to unwind after an afternoon of walking and rides. We enjoyed the view from the deck and exploring the grounds. The firetower itself was clean and welcoming."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location is perfect - it’s secluded, but minutes from town. We had a peaceful stay in this unique Fire tower home. As a family, we cooked and made a fire, played games and walked the tree farm, it was like camping, but with a solid roof over our heads, hot running water, and air conditioning :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The firetower is just as described. The views are breathtaking and the amenities and location are perfect to relax and unplug for a few days. We look forward to returning!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful. Great little escape.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an awesome place for a family with two little kids! We have two boys, 3 and 6, and they never wanted to leave! They had so much fun exploring the fire tower and especially loved the loft. They also loved playing outside, sitting in the hammock and swinging chair, and having snacks on the balcony. We walked the trails on the property a bit and looked for Bigfoot (their idea ;) ). They were also excited about the candy jars on the counter. As far as us parents are concerned, it was a wonderful getaway - even better than pictured if that’s possible. The views were gorgeous. The property was easy to find as the instructions were very good. Would definitely recommend this property."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful relaxing stay at the Firetower. It is the perfect place to switch off and get away from it all for a couple of days. Fantastic views from the 360 degree veranda and the inside space is comfy and cosy. The Firetower is a peaceful and beautiful place to stay.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great secluded location yet minutes to Bloomsburg. Perfect for a quiet get away.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,we just took a short family vacation to this beautiful fire tower. there were some kids activities located at the tower for our kids to enjoy during our stay as advertised. This beautiful property was close enough to the towns local attractions. it's a beautiful place for a small getaway.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris's Fire Tower is an amazing stay experience. You wake up every morning to a beautiful sunrise over the mountains and the sounds of birds chattering, and then there is ample space in the surrounding grounds for a stroll. The kitchen has all the essentials, the bed is comfy, and the shower is spacious. But the draw is really the uniqueness of the space and the beauty of the surroundings. You're in Bloomsburg but feel much more isolated up in the tower. Only thing to note is that there aren't blinds on most of the windows, so just be aware of that beforehand. Overall one of my best Airbnb experiences, and would definitely book again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! The perfect place to unplug for a while and the views can’t be beat. The kitchen is fully stocked with essentials and the outdoor spaces have plenty of amenities.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as we expected, or exceeded our expectations! We would stay here again. Thank you Chris!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway! Comfortable secluded home up on a mountain with great views and a different touch of nature. If your looking for an amazing getaway and want to relax this is your place. Owner is easy to contact and will go out of his way to help with any questions you may have! We will be back
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the firehouse if it wasn’t for work we would of requested one more night. Great Airbnb host awesome hospitality and touches. We loved the location and definitely will be back here next opportunity. Thank you Chris!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a one of a kind place. The setting is so quiet and peaceful, my wife and I are so stress free right now after our visit. Chris, the host, has thought of everything that you may need: a fully modern kitchen, hiking through the Christmas tree farm, 360 degree views from the top level and so much more. This is an ab&b that you need to do. It is outstanding in every way."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved it
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Firetower was fantastic. It offers a quietness and peacefulness you really can't get many places. You can explore acres of wilderness while still being incredibly close to a nice downtown area. Chris was a great host, the tower was clean and warm, the views in the morning and at sundown were incredible and the access to the farm truck to get around the property is a really thoughtful and useful touch. Loved every minute."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and i had an amazing stay here! It was so relaxing and beautiful. It’s a super nice getaway!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for the first time this week and were blown away not only by the privacy and seclusion, but the views were breathtaking. We could really get used to waking up to that sunrise streaming through the windows each morning. Thank you Chris!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time visiting the Fire Tower. We decided to celebrate our third Valentines together in this beautiful and secluded chalet. The sunrise, sunset and stars make you feel so connected to nature and the universe. Thanks to Chris for bringing his architectural vision to life and offering it to us to enjoy. I would also recommend checking out his new Listing coming soon- The Sun Tower!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Firetower was amazing. You definitely need awd / 4x4 in the winter to reach it but the drive was well worth it. Everything was super clean and neat. The downstairs has a everything you need to enjoy the weekend dining and cooking wise. Upstairs is breathtaking and the view is amazing. Watching the sunrise in the morning was beautiful. I highly recommend staying here and enjoying the beautiful property and house that Chris built.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect get away! Chris was great and super responsive host! Beautiful spot! Just be sure to have an all wheel drive or 4x4 vehicle
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Please was wonderful. Peaceful and very serene. Got to see some great stars our second night. Chris was an amazing host and came to help us after I locked the keys in the car. Looking forward to coming back again !
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris’s place was absolutely beautiful! I sent my parents for a little getaway and they absolutely loved it. The view was phenomenal.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The fire tower is just as pictured: a comfortable, cozy, and welcoming vacation spot that seems isolated and very private, but is close to the town of Bloomsburg. Chris provides all essentials for a relaxing, eat in, getaway. We visited in the winter, and had no trouble accessing the cabin with our Subaru. It was too cold to sit outside in one of the many sitting areas or fire pit, but we did some hiking around the grounds. Chris includes games, coloring books, and tv with plenty of channels to occupy guests inside. He was easy to contact if needed, and check in and check out were simple and contactless. The fire tower was definitely a unique and worthwhile experience!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great - we loved the solitude and how beautiful the tower was.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Firetower was an unforgettable experience. The silence of the seclusion mixed with the gorgeous setting with a warm, cozy, and perfect base was an experience I had never anticipated.
Chris's listing and messages had let us know ahead of time that we would most likely need a car with AWD to get to the chalet. Unfortunately, the car we planned to borrow fell through at the last second and we decided to risk it.... we did not make it farther than the farm house in my tiny coup.
LUCKILY Chris was incredibly responsive to my messages, and allowed us to borrow a truck that had been parked right there. After moving our things to the truck and making our way up, we were pretty cold but in high spirits. The moment we turned the corner and saw the firetower in person, we were in a new world.
Stepping inside, the tower was already so warm and inviting. We left our things in the car for a few minutes just to enjoy the space. When we made our way upstairs, the bed faces an all window/door wall with views over the mountains. It absolutely took my breath away. We came and stayed while it was snowing and cold, and I spent a significant amount of my time walking the 360 deck just having my breath taken away.
The firetower had everything we needed and more. We had brought half our kitchen and appliances with us, which turned out to be completely unnecessary. Everything was well stocked with cooking ingredients, games to play, supplies, and so many odds and ends that ended up coming in handy (that ball of string came in clutch!).
My partner and I had an absolutely rejuvenating experience staying here, and we hope to continue to return for years to come."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful. Great for a weekend away, so quite and relaxing. You wake up to a sun rise and the views are gorgeous! Will be back again"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay. Everything we needed was at the Tower and we had a seamless check in and check out. The view was beautiful.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a Phenomenal stay there and blew our minds away. It was far enough away from everything to feel isolated, yet so close if you need to pick up groceries because all the markets are 5 minutes away. The views are beautiful and it’s nice because it is the first thing you see when you wake up. Memorable experience and recommend it to anyone who wants a couple days to escape from the fast pace of life. Thank you Chris"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our brief stay here! The views from the balcony are beautiful, the fire pit was great to sit by in the evenings, and the wrap around windows were lovely. The only thing I'd note here is the heater above the bed is super loud so we didn't sleep that well. The town of Bloomsburg is also very charming and we loved being so close (5 min drive)."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous and everything we could hope for and more
Will definitely visit again ❤️❤️"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! It's unique, super secluded, and well kept. Waking up to incredible sunsets each morning will be a memory that lasts forever."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and unique property with incredible views. So close to town yet so isolated on the property. Loved the views and the sunrises. Just do it. Owners are very nice and very responsive.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Firetower is the perfect low-key getaway in Central PA! Secluded, yet close to town, the Firetower offered the exact setting I needed to get a lot of work done while still being able to relax. The space is filled with amenities including a portable speaker, tons of cooking gear, games, candle holders, and a sublime fire pit. And the view - wow!! Book the Firetower today - you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to go back!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,our family and friends were in the area for the state trap shoot and the house and area was perfect for us! 6 adults 4 teenage boys. We all had our own space to be together or apart. Danielle was a great host. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Exceptionally responsive host. She made her house feel like it was our house. I would definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Danielle’s house was exactly as described & exactly what we needed. Very spacious, beautiful view from the master bedroom window & upstairs balcony. We saw many deer in the field next to the house as mentioned in the description. Close to Bloomsburg University. Danielle was very responsive to our questions. This place really made my daughter’s graduation weekend even more special. Thanks Danielle!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We had an amazing stay! beautiful home!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The location was perfect for our events nearby and had the just right space for our growing family to be together in the common area yet enjoy the separate, comfortable sleeping spaces and bathrooms. Beautiful clean design with modern, Scandinavian style staged interesting art pieces and the well equipped kitchen was easily accessible. The view was excellent of the river valley and mountains."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the amount of space and the beautiful views from this home. Quick drive to knoebels park.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great weekend! Host was very responsive and gave explicit instructions for everything about the house. Felt very comfortable and safe the whole time, and had a beautiful few of the mountain and valley below. Would recommend to anyone."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,amazing host! very responsive and sent photos even outside of the app to help navigate the house. beautiful house and lots of supplies. would definitely book with her again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for our friends trip to knobels. The owner was awesome and responsive. House was clean and close to the park.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place with plenty of space to stretch out and relax. End of a cul de sac and peaceful surroundings
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a beautiful, clean home. Danielle was a wonderful host and very responsive. Home is close to University and Downtown."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,This place was a gem. It is the first time I have stayed in a rental that was better in person than in the pictures. Seven adults stayed for a weekend and had more than enough room in this beautiful property. It came with all amenities to enjoy a relaxing stay in a well appointed mountain retreat.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Everything in the listing is correct. We enjoyed the deer in the yard in the mornings and evenings....a doe and her twin fawns. The highlight was how communicative and accomodating Danielle is during the entire process. We had questions before booking/arrival and she answered them all. She also reached out to us the week before our visit to see if there was anything she could arrange to make our stay more comfortable. We enjoyed our visit with family for our family reunion at Knobels.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Danielle had excellent communication while planning our trip. She gave clear instructions including videos on how to enter and how to use some appliances which was very helpful.
The house was clean, beautiful, and comfortable just as advertised. She was kind enough to leave out age appropriate games for the kids and a meat and cheese platter for us to share.
Would definitely recommend and I would 100% book again!!
Bonus: Only 20 minutes to Knoebels amusement park!!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall, our host Danielle was very kind and welcoming. She was accommodating with our check in, and sent a video with instructions on how to get into the house. The house was clean and organized when we arrived, including clean towels, sheets, fully equipped kitchen, and toys for the kids. There were plenty of bedrooms and space to accommodate our party of 5 adults and 2 small children.
The WiFi was somewhat difficult to access, since the password listed on the AirBnB app did not work the first night. Danielle got back to us and fixed the issue the next morning. Although the upstairs does have great central AC, the basement that had 1 bedroom and kids beds did not have central AC and was quite muggy. There was an AC window unit in the basement bedroom, but we could not use it at night because it would be too loud to hear our small kids if they needed us in the next room over. We did notice central heat in the basement so it could be different in cooler months."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home, super clean and so welcoming. Danielle was fantastic and accommodating, very sweet! We would definitely book her home again!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"From the beginning, our host was very attentive and responsive. The home was beautiful, peaceful, clean, and matched the description. Our family really enjoyed the stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Danielle was a very responsive host who went above and beyond to provide everything one might need (coffee, shampoo, toothpaste, lotion, etc, it was all there). She even provided a cute tray of snacks and candy which was a really nice touch. She explained everything well about how to use the appliances, etc and was just overall helpful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at this property. Lots of space, including a basement with bedroom and an additional kitchen and common area that was perfect for part of our group with children. Outdoor areas with lovely views and room for BBQing and eating. Thoughtful touches such as toys left out for the children, fresh flowers, and hospitality tray. Update to earlier review - bedrooms now have curtains. Host was extremely responsive to any questions. We went with extended family for visit to Knobel's and local area sights. Was just right. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,TY Danielle! You made our stay very comfortable and hope we can come back next year!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Host was extremely attentive to us before and during our stay. Welcomed our family and even put things out for our toddler to play with! Home was in a cul de sac so it was very private. Everything in the home was up to date and very well kept. We had a small issue with plumbing but the host addressed the issue. She had almost everything you could think of in the home for us to use. One draw back is almost all the windows have no treatments so there’s no privacy at night. While it is beautiful to look out it makes it difficult with littles as they are up early and makes naps difficult. We stayed here as we went to knoebels for the weekend and for my sons birthday. The drive was very reasonable at 21 minutes. Would definitely recommend! Thanks again for your hospitality!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colleen is a new airbnb host from what she said, and the place was very clean with plenty of linens - great job with that! There were also brochures on local attractions. Lovely house with a large backyard for grilling and enjoying the summer. Large parking area if you have several vehicles. We enjoyed our stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay very close to the university. Short drive to downtown. Clean and comfortable. Thanks for hosting us!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Colleen’s listing was a perfect location to attend BU graduation. She is a great host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent find! I’m sure we will return! I wish it was warmer to enjoy the back yard and grill. Hoping maybe in the future it changes to a one night minimum verses two just for a quick jaunt up to see my daughter in college.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Colleen has a beautiful home that was in a great location.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen responded very quickly and had everything set up and ready for us.
Cute little place perfect for an alumni weekend, within walking distance of the university"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little house in a nice little neighborhood! No complaints here!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Collen's place is very cute and in a nice location. We stayed there to attend our daughter's lacrosse game at Bloomsburg University and it was the perfect location for us. When we arrived the house had not been cleaned after the previous guests left. When I called Colleen she was apologetic and she called back to let me know there had been a miscommunication with the cleaning person. She made amends and we stayed the night. I understand that things like this can happen and was appreciative that Colleen responded quickly. Despite the cleaning issue I would recommend Colleen's place and even stay again in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had a competition at the keystone horse center and this place was so close for us. Perfect to come to, get a shower and relax after a long day of riding! We had a little trouble with the lock, but Colleen answered right away and fix the problem (battery issue that was no one’s fault). If we go to the competition again next year-we will be sure to use this place again!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Nice and quiet. We had a short stay but was a perfect economical solution for us to stay a few days.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was in a place that was super close to the downtown area and with a gorgeous background. Inside was spotless and there were very clear instructions on how to make the house in the best condition for the next people (which is always very helpful).
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the house. me and my coworkers loved the house. it was quite restful after a long day at work. I would recommend the house to anyone

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for us. It is located in a famliy friendly area, close to town and not to far from the things we wanted to do. the yard was nice to be in and look out at. We were visited by deer and a groundhog the first evening. It was stocked with the things you need in a house. Decorated nicely."

The neighborhood is peaceful and was located centrally to everything we had planned! Colleen also provided a list of activities for us to do with our kiddo while in Bloomsburg which was greatly appreciated! We felt very safe and secure, I definitely see us booking with Colleen again for our future Pennsylvania stays!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Colleen was very responsive and helpful. The place was a perfect size and location for what we needed it for.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We could not have asked for a better host or location for my son's soccer tournament at Univ of Bloomsburg. Colleen was great and so responsive to our multiple requests given an up in the air tournament schedule. The place was so comfortable and clean. We were one block from the University, in a quiet neighborhood. It was a great weekend!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Was a lovely get away for a fun weekend. Great quaint vibe. Wonderful things to do within walking distance, and a short drive away. (We didn’t mind walking back to the house from downtown but it is uphill so it might not be for everyone.) Would definitely come back to stay for another long weekend! Thank you!"

Close by to literally anything you could need. It was adequately furnished and supplied with lots of extra supplies, which were greatly appreciated. Very comfortable beds and lots of room to move around. Colleen was a great host and even made suggestions of local fun to be had with the grandkids. We would definitelystay here again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was super nice and comfortable. It had everything you would need in a house, easy checkin and good location."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at the house on business for over a month. The house was very well maintained, and clean, and had all the amenities that were described, and then some. Colleen was very quick to respond if I had any questions or concerns and any concerns were dealt with in a very timely manner. I was very pleased with my stay and if I ever had to come back to the area, I would definitely contact Colleen and her family again.
Great experience.
10 out of 10.
Would recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were very happy with our stay in Bloomsburg. Definitely would visit again and stay at this location. The house is right off of Route 80 and was easy to find. Loved that it was close to downtown, which is a University town - plenty of places to eat and drink.
The house , as described, was on a very quiet residential street, similar to my own home. Furniture was obviously new and comfortable -
Being from the very flat New Jersey, I loved that we could see mountains around us and enjoyed everything Bloomsburg had to offer!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect rental! The house is on a quiet street but very close to BU and Geisinger Bloom. Getting in was easy and the house was very clean and beautifully decorated. The mattresses were perfect, and the linens were also very clean. The kitchen was well stocked, plenty of cookware and serving ware. Wonderful stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures did not accurately depict how amazing this house is! It was built with such intention with picturesque views and all the amenities you could ask for. Wanda is an amazing host, who (obviously) cares about her guests experience from how she keeps the house with all necessities, extreme cleanliness, and from what she communicates."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at Wanda’s place . The house was exactly as described and more . Very peaceful atmosphere the view from the house was unbelievable. Thank you Wanda for a wonderful visit and looking forward to returning soon.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda’s Airbnb was delightful! Beautiful surroundings, peaceful, restful….truly a home away from home!! The host went above and beyond to accommodate our stay by providing all the comforts of home, as well as providing activities our 2 boys would enjoy! We would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone who needs a quiet retreat and especially recommend it to families with children of all ages. Fabulous!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice cabin in a beautiful spot. So quiet and peaceful. The sunsets are spectacular and the wildlife was amazing. Wanda is the best host I’ve experienced. Everything you could possibly need, very responsive and so well organized."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin, in a lovely, peaceful woods!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Wanda’s place with our 2.5 year old son for a night while traveling from Ohio to NY and we absolutely loved it. The house and grounds had everything you could ever need for a kid to play and run and around. The house was spotless and comfortable as could be - will definitely be staying here again when passing through PA
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Place was absolutely beautiful, has everything you need, very peaceful and quit location, all new everything."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda's cabin goes above-and-beyond. It's not a typical rental but a fully decked-out kiddie paradise. Wanda and her family have created a great family space and are generously sharing it with lucky visitors. It comes complete with a switch labeled ""deer spotlight"" which we flipped the last evening and looked out the window, and sure enough there was a couple deer out in the yard.
Internet was a bit touch-and-go, so more of a get-away than a working hub, although we made it work and was able to video conference from the cabin."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda’s home is beautiful and peaceful with an amazing view! Our kiddos loved all the toys and space to run around outside. This house is amazing for families, has everything you could ever need and more. Our kiddos are already asking when we can go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you need a peaceful and relaxing gateway close to nature and animals this is place to go. I’ll definitely coming back.
Thanks Wanda"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for serenity away from it all in a beautiful clean cabin look no further. This was by far my family’s favorite place and we are already planning another peaceful getaway. The cabin is built beautifully and is squeaky clean. It has every amenity you can think of if you’re a mom like me and might have forgotten something. I needed a nice quiet birthday getaway from the city where I could clear my head while also providing entertainment for my 4 year old son and this space provided that and more! Wanda has thought of every detail and her home was very accommodating. This cabin is very kid friendly as they have so many things to offer, my son played for hours and hours. The views were spectacular and the fire pit was beautiful and they provided the firewood. The playground was a solid winner that any child would enjoy. The main bedroom and whirlpool made us adults admire it even more. From easy check in and great response I wish I could give more than 5 stars! Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing time at this beautiful cabin. Our kids LOVED it! As did we!

Great communication and easy check in and check outs! We hope to return as this is a great home for a relaxing vacation!! :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Appreciated all the little extras that made this stay more smooth for us. They had the pack n play set up for the baby, plenty of toys for my toddler, and the training potty. Access to washer for the poop blowouts….it all saved my sanity a bit and I super appreciated the delayed check out of 11am. 😅"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, imaculate, still had a homey feel. We had a great time responsive host. We really enjoyed our stay. We were really so impressed, very thoughtful host. We loved there was alot of kid activities/toys. Perfect for a peaceful get away weekend."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have stayed in a number of Airbnbs over the years and this tops the list as one of our favorites. Every single detail is thought about and it truly feels like home. The hosts are incredibly kind and communicative and offer a space that’s peaceful, very clean, and so comfortable. We enjoyed our stay so much and hope to stay again the future. Would highly, highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was amazing and Wanda was so helpful with everything we needed throughout the week. Great place and a great host!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda's place was more than one could ask for. I can't think of anything that she forgot.
Spotless throughout the home.
I brought my grandsons to Knoebels for a couple of days and this is where we called home during our stay. My younger grandsons both age 8 loved the toys and games that she had there to occupy them. Along with the playground.
My teenage grandsons also
enjoyed their time at Wanda's. They loved the views and the cows right across the street. They took many photos of the cows. 😊
Just swinging on the porch swing and relaxing while enjoying the quietness and scenery made two teenage boys happy!
Although it was a quick visit and much to do while at Knoebels, we all had a relaxing stay while at Wanda's.
I have stayed at many Airbnb's, but nothing can compare to our stay here. We give Wanda's place a 5 +
Would definitely stay here again.
Thank you for notifying us so quickly that Evie had been left behind. We were able to turn around to pick her up. 💕"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very welcoming and clean. Had extra beds ready for us. Best place we have stayed with kids, very family friendly. Very responsive to messages. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda’s cabin exceeded expectations. It was much more beautiful, clean, and bright, with exceptional views all around. Also, Wanda ensures that you have everything that you need while as a guest in her meticulous oasis. The home is very kid friendly as well. Our kids loved spending time at the cabin in between our adventures. We hope to visit, again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, especially if you have a large family and /or small children. House was set up to accommodate all age groups, we had a very nice time."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at this Airbnb was an absolute dream. From the warm and attentive host to the stunning accommodation and incredible location, every aspect exceeded my expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable vacation experience. I cannot wait to return and create more cherished memories in this little slice of paradise."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places we have stayed at. Super clean, and if you forget anything, the host had everything you can possibly think of. Hiking was awesome. Cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed ourselves."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin with more than what we expected. The house has everything that one needs for a vacation away from home. Kids enjoyed seeing deer and wildlife from the windows and playing with the several toys. Thanks to Wanda we had a memorable stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a getaway that has beautiful views and is private this is the perfect place. Came here for a quick weekend trip from NYC and this place had everything mentioned in the description and so much more. Wanda was super responsive, her place is beautiful and very near to great hiking. Would come back and wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was so nice. It is very family friendly. There is something to do for any age. The swing set was a huge win for our visit. The host was responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing weekend at Wanda's place. The cabin was great, spotlessly maintained, and all amenities were as described. The backyard is serene, and all we could hear were birds (which, being from the city, was a welcome respite)! Definitely will revisit if we plan to stay in the area again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We only stayed 2 nights but wish we could have stayed longer. We would like to come back and spend a long weekend for a family crab feast
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This is a hidden gem—a wonderful escape for families or reunions. Remote location in the middle of Amish country replete with all the amenities you could ever want. The view and jacuzzi in the master bedroom were both amazing aspects of this trip.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wanda's place was perfect for our needs. We needed a place for a construction crew and their possible families. The kitchen was well stocked and labeled for easy cleanup. The peaceful views, abundant wildlife and comfortable beds made for more of a vacation than work stay for our crew. You'll be glad you chose to stay here."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! What a wonderful stay. I stayed here for 10 days surrounding a surgery I had at Geisinger Medical. It was the perfect place to relax, rest and get well! My husband, son and in-laws joined me. This was the cleanest most well stocked place I've ever stayed. Wanda is top notch. She has anything and everything you need. Just bring clothes, food, and yourself. The rest is there. Everything is labels. And so many things you'd never expect an airbnb to have but would need. Spices, batteries, pens, coffee, all the pots and pans you can think of needed. Not to mention all the activities that were there for my 2 year old son. The train table was his favorite but he enjoyed the store and diner as well. Plus the toys upstairs too we're a huge hit. He loves the foosball table as well. My son loved the swing set and played on it often! The weather was perfect for us while there in November. It was unseasonably warm but we appreciated it. It was a wonderful stay and I would 100% go back. My MIL has already said she wanted to return for another trip next year! Wanda, you've outdone yourself. Thank you for such an easy comfortable stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a second time this year ! It is always a great time with an amazing view! Easy to communicate and a nice relaxing location!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW. We’ve stayed at countless Airbnbs over the last six years but this was our favorite stay. We went during peak fall foliage and hallo-fun at Knoebles. My kids (2&4) loved the fossil dig too. But honestly we could’ve stayed at the Airbnb all three nights. The place has so much to offer: beautiful fire pit, view of the stars, wildlife, playground, giant playroom in basement located right next to fire pit so kids can play inside while you prep the fire. My son has an autoimmune disease so cleanliness is always a top priority. This place was SPOTLESS and deep cleaned unlike many other places we’ve stayed in the past that we had to clean ourselves before unpacking. The kitchen was stacked and we prepped all of our meals at home. A highlight for us was playing grocery store for hours with our two kids and watching the sunrise and some deer on the back porch. The jet tub also has a 360 view of the fall foliage. The flow of this house is amazing for people with kids— it’s so open that if you have shadows who follow your every move like our kids they’ll feel comfortable and safe like ours did. If you’re a nervous over packer parent come here and pack less. No need to pack toys, booster seats, baby gates, playpen, baby monitor, white noise or fans. All were provided. Hosts have thought of everything to make a family’s stay comfortable and it shows."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful! Even better than described! From the place itself being immaculate to the beautiful views! It was quiet and serene with plenty of activities to do nearby. One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house and location! Tons of wildlife! A little tough to get to amenities, but the quality of the house, views, and value more than make up for it. Toys and playset were a great perk for the kids!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property is beautiful. If you need a peaceful stay submersed in the woods but still keeping the comforts of home you should stay here. Our favorite part were the kid’s toys and playground that were made available as well as the deer that can be seen on the property every day. The hosts were so thoughtful and take pride in their property.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We just returned less than two months later. We never expected to find such a great place for such a reasonable cost. It's living in luxury and more kid friendly than a couple with kids could imagine! Adult kids love it too :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at this beautiful cabin! Everything was super clean and cozy. The area was so nice and the host was wonderful to work with. We hope to come back soon!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin if you’re looking for a nice place to R&R! The cabin was super clean and stocked with everything you could want or need for some time away. We got a lot of rain during our trip and were so grateful that the house was full of kid-friendly activities. Wanda was also a super responsive host- would highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a stay in PA, look no further. This home is perfect in every way and the views and yard are stunning. The photos on airbnb barely do it any justice at all. It is great for a very large group of adults or a family of 3 with a baby like us, and everything in between! The home was so welcoming and clean/organized. We loved watching the deer at the feeder and playing on the swing set :) thankful to Wanda for a wonderful stay!! You won’t regret staying here :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an extraordinary stay and loved everything about this house. It was kid friendly (tons of toys, games, cribs) super clean and had everything we could have needed for our stay. The views are incredible and was an amazing place to spend our weekend."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,We had such a relaxing weekend in this cabin. It was very clean. When we walked in the door we immediately kicked our shoes off because we felt like we were in our own home. It is well stocked with the basic kitchen amenities and clean linens and towels so we were never short for anything. The assortment of games for all ages from small children to adults for both inside and outside gave us plenty to choose from when we needed an activity to do. The views from this mountain top are spectacular and the cabin has lots of windows to view the wildlife from and enjoy the scenery. When I contacted Wanda with any questions both before we arrived and while we were staying she replied in a very timely manner. This is a cabin that I would definitely come back to if I were in the area again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved how clean it was, and set up for a family of.any age. All kinds of fun toys there for kids of all ages, even adults :)
This house feels like a home, and while you think you're getting a decently priced house for rent, you're actually getting priceless beauty and comfort with the assurance of help just around the corner, should you need it. We were pleasantly surprised at how well everything went :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house on a beautiful property. This place is perfect if you have children, they have a wide variety of toys for all ages. The property is close to Knobles and the drive was not difficult to get there. You will fall asleep and wake up to deer outside your windows. Overall great experience and thank you."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place. Ideal for a nice quiet getaway with nature at the door. The family had a great time and wished they had more time to enjoy it.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place! The inside of the house is gorgeous and smells like fresh cut wood. And the property is idyllic with all the wildlife and greenery. It's the perfect place to unwind and relax. Wanda was a wonderful host. She got back to me quickly with any questions I had. I've never been in a cleaner Airbnb! We would absolutely love to come and stay again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is better then the pictures. The basement so kid friendly 2 toddlers had a blast. Want a campfire you got one with chairs already on property. Hosting more people there’s extra tables and chairs. In all this place was so amazing for 2 families with kids. I feel i got very lucky how great this place was. I would recommend to anyone. Half hour to Walmart which isn’t bad. Half hour to knobles you just can’t beat this place. Price was amazing very fair. If I could move here I would.

The host was incredibly responsive. The place is not only extremely large but incredibly modern. Highly recommend staying. Great property and great host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful apartment!! Added bonus was the heated bathroom floors! It looked just like the pictures, but better in person. The apartment was a lot bigger than I expected, and it was perfect for our short stay! Loved the little back yard that the pups could enjoy. The only thing that I wasn’t fond of was the back door steps, but I could just use the front no big deal. Beautiful, well kept home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a unique apartment! It was even better than the pictures. Loved the quality and design. Only a little bit of confusion over parking (ticketed on Jefferson overnight) but figured it out the next day. Read the parking signs carefully.I will definitely return to stay in this gem.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was great, exactly what we were looking for! Everything was clean and modern. We enjoyed having a place of our own when visiting loved ones."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Escape and Stay was awesome. Our son was able to join us this time. He found the sofa-bed to be comfortable and quiet, being on the back of the house. He also took advantage of the games. We enjoy the bird feeder's patrons and the TWO very nice workstations for when computer work is necessary. Park the car once for the weekend, and enjoy Russell's place and exploring Bloomsburg on foot very easily."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best air b&b experience I have ever had. The location was great, the place was amazing, and there were so many excellent amenities. It was clean, the hosts were super responsive and I would definitely come back and recommend to others!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I can’t compliment Russell and Mandy enough in their outstanding apartment! The lovely, comfortable furnishings and decor, the amenities provided and the convenient location to downtown Bloomsburg businesses couldn’t be better!
My stay began as a close by location to be near relatives, and wound up a fun escape room experience!
This is one of the best Airbnb locations I have ever stayed in, I’ll recommend to others and come back myself! Thank you to the hosts! Lisa Friend"

We loved the automatic light on the steps, ample space, very comfortable beds, clean linens, heated bathroom floors, and many other thoughtful touches. In case you're bored, there's the multi-game arcade machine, play station and tv! Bookworms and history buffs will also find interesting themed items. We had a great time!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a long weekend and the location was ideal for our needs. We enjoyed exploring the surrounding area for breweries and eats. The rental was exactly as was described. Everything was clean and comfortable.
We wish we had done the escape room to learn more about the property.
Slept well but as a heads up, if you are a light sleeper, pack earplugs. You are on a downtown street. One of us was unfazed the other was a light sleeper who always packs ear plugs and was prepared. It worked out fine.
Comfortable and lovely space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful & comfy ! felt right at home & you have a variety of places to eat & visit in the area. Will definitely be back soon.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful apartment, plenty of room for 5 people. A cute little college town. Many places to choose from to eat and have a beer or cocktail. Ask about the ""Used Things"" game to play during your stay."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was a great place and I would stay again. It was clean and well stocked. Very quaint. The only drawbacks were that the plumbing was a bit slow in the bathrooms and the street noise can was pretty loud at times."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very big space and way more room than we needed. Would be perfect for 2 couples since it has 2 BR and 2 Baths. Full size kitchen and all the appliances you need. Close to downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bloomsburg is my old college town. We wanted to stay to show our kids my old stomping grounds so we took a quick trip so I could reminisce while taking the kids to knoebels. I wish they had apartments like this while I was there. It was big, clean and met all our needs. I loved how modern it was, and close brought to walk for breakfast at Bloomin’ bagels. Will definitely recommend to any friends wanting to take the same trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding all around! Comfortable beds, great atmosphere and location! The escape room was a blast (keep at it even if it’s really challenging!) totally worth it"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"As new Bloomsburg University parents we came to Bloomsburg for our daughter's freshman orientation and decided to stay the night so that she could get a better perspective of the town. Since she will also be a student-athlete we know we will be coming back to Bloomsburg quite a bit to watch her over the years so we needed to find a suitable location to stay at.
Russell's apartment couldn't have been a better selection for us. Beautiful, historic, and yet very modernized. The apartment was immaculate, and the location was right in the heart of town. The beds were also SUPER comfy!
We will definitely be back!
Thank you"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely adored this airbnb and hope to come back soon. It was very clean, beautifully decorated/styled and we were so happy with the entire place and location. It's so much better in person then in pictures!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, very accommodating & responsive! A welcome basket was on counter with a couple snacks, tea, coffee pods & water. The towels were sealed in plastic bags on the beds for each guest and smelled so good.
We were in town for the Memorial of our sister, and it was nice to find this clean, roomy & comfortable airbnb. It was a nice oasis under our circumstances. Enjoyed the apartment escape room mystery game, it was fun & challenging!
Great location, enjoyed walking around the historic neighborhood drinking Bubble Tea. We were able to find free & close parking on Jefferson St. for both our vehicles, no problem. We could see our cars from the game room window too. 3 miles away is an overnight electric car charging station, that we used for our rental. Main St. Parking meters are the cheapest🤫 I ever seen at .25 cents per half hour, 2hrs for $1.00!
The beds are so extremely comfortable & plush, we would love to come again! Thank you Russell & Mandy!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this space. The pictures don’t do it justice. It is the perfect place to stay if you are visiting a student attending Bloomsburg University. You can easily walk to many restaurants and bars downtown.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and in a good location. Hosts were very responsive.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at this location for a weekend in May. It was fantastic. Due to a family emergency, I ended up going alone, so it was much more house than what I needed. However, the location and the instructions were great. The only issue I had was street noise. This property is on Main St. and it got fairly loud during the day, especially with the weather turning and all the bikers hitting the main drag. But, if you're not trying to day sleep, this was a perfect location. Much larger than anticipated, as well. I would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a great find right in the heart of downtown Bloomsburg, It is charming, super clean, and has lovely decor. It offers all the convenience of a hotel but in a spacious apartment. Would love to stay again if we’re ever in town. Thanks for everything!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was SO beautiful! The layout was great and the added pack n play and umbrella stroller made traveling with a toddler so much easier. The only negative was the noise at night, but this is to be expected being on the Main Street in downtown Bloomsburg. Other than that everything else was great! It was a lovely weekend. I would highly recommend (maybe bring earplugs if your a light sleeper)."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place! It was super clean, spacious, and the game system was a lot of fun. Would definitely stay again if we are in Bloomsburg."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is such a hidden gem located right in downtown Bloomsburg. It was within walkable distance to all bars and restaurants in town. It was perfect for our girls’ weekend getaway. Check-in was very easy and the apartment looked exactly like the photos but better! The place was so spacious and was very clean. The bedrooms and bathrooms were both very clean. The kitchen and living spaces were spacious and fit all of us comfortably. We were even able to utilize the outdoor space on a warm day! We definitely will be looking to stay here on our next trip to Bloom!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Even better than the description and pictures. Clean and well prepared for visitors. Would recommend to anyone traveling to or through the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a unique apartment right in the heart of downtown Bloomsburg! We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the apartment. The photos don't do it justice.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great apartment. It was very clean, and the beds/linens made you feel at home. I had some virtual work to do (Zoom calls), and they WIFI speeds were excellent. I was able to do everything I needed, and there was even a dedicated work space. Very convenient.
The kitchen was perfect and very clean. The fridge was large and held everything I needed for our short stay.
If the opportunity arises, I would not hesitate to rent this apartment again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed the week for work and really liked this Airbnb! It was even better than we anticipated and enjoyed how spacious and clean it was!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Russel’s place exceeded expectations. I loved the funky old building feel, but also appreciated the very up to date renovations and touches - especially the heated bathroom floor!
I found parking within a block or two every night, so that wasn’t too challenging. Also, the entry staircase is very steep, so keep that in mind if you’re not very mobile. Other than that, I 100% loved this little downtown prize!"

We would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Bloomsburg."

We also loved that this was right above Can U Xcape, we enjoyed that too. This space had everything we needed and super comfy beds!!! Highly recommended!!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"5-Star location in the charming town of Bloomsburg. We were able to catch the first night of the Christmas Carol performed by BTE at the Alvina Krauss Theater, sample some local night life, all within a short walk of the apartment. Our hosts, Russell and Mandy were very accommodating and attentive to our needs."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love to be able to stay in a spot where we can park the car and walk to shop and try new restaurants. That is exactly what we did on this trip as well as making the short drive to the Covered Bridge Craft Festival.
The amenities were all on point. The bed was super comfortable and the attention to detail with the decor and finishings created a very pleasant home away from home."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the nicest Airbnbs we’ve stayed in, and that is saying a lot. Beautifully restored and decorated large apartment with plenty of room to spread out and enjoy your stay. Very comfortable beds, good showers. These hosts have thought of everything! Perfect location for walking to great restaurants. Nice fenced backyard for your small dog to use down a flight of stairs out back. No problem finding parking. Fantastic value. We will definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"All around FIVE 🌟! Not only is the location amazing and so close to a ton of restaurants, the apartment itself was OUTSTANDING. The pictures don’t do it justice! I was in town for a wedding and had some family over beforehand and they could not stop talking about how impressed they were with the place. We opted to do the immersive experience and I’m so glad we did! Mandy and Russell responded so quickly, and even stayed up late so they could give us our extra hints for the escape room (which was insane and so much fun—we got a late start and were dead set on figuring out the story). This has been the best Airbnb experience I’ve had to this date. I cannot recommend staying with Mandy and Russell enough."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying in your renovated home in downtown Bloomsburg. What a great location and it felt like home. We were in town for our daughter’s wedding and your accommodations worked great for us. Your quick response to our request was outstanding. We highly recommend your home!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just the right touch of modern, downtown charm! Everything about this stay was easy from start to finish. Super comfortable bedding/beds and personal touches for things you may forget. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for a family wedding, so we needed a place to hang out and get ready. The apartment was well maintained, clean and the beds were so comfortable! We enjoyed having the space to hang out and stay cool on a very hot weekend.
The hosts were super and checked in to make sure everything went well!
Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved it. It was bigger then we expected. Super clean. They had everything you could need and more. The aesthetic was insanely pleasing. We will be back!!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was hands-down one of the best Airbnb surprises ever! I never imagined the apartment would be so nice and spacious! I have stayed in Airbnb’s all over the globe and this was one of the best- right in central PA! Great job with the space! Extremely clean and well decorated! Perfect location with all the amenities you need. I look forward to coming back one day.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough about this Airbnb. there’s so many great little features that really capture the historic, Victorian style building, with some new age touches. The renovation was so tastefully done to create a romantic & cozy, yet modern vibe. I was living for the lighting, high ceilings, and textures.
This rental would be great for a couple, family, or a few friends for a weekend getaway. Especially since it’s dog friendly, and has a fenced back yard! Such a fun idea they’ve created with their immersive experience. Initially, we had no idea that was included with our stay, and we can’t thank them enough for the experience we had.
These host outdid themselves with this place. We had no idea that such a hidden gem was located in this town."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To sum it up in one word: WOW!
In many words: Ignoring the unique escape room experience for a sec….the Airbnb itself was fantastic! I did not realize how absolutely gigantic the place was going to be. It was very well done and everything was very comfortable! They had about anything you could need and we spent a long time playing arcade games.
As for the escape room experience, there’s just some final touches to be put on it but anyone who likes escape rooms is going to have a blast. I’ve never heard of such a unique experience before and we had a great time doing it. The only downside of that experience is that you don’t get to experience it again if you stay more than once. But the Airbnb stands well on its own without the cherry on top immersive experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Hidden Acres was a wonderful place to stay. Very close to Bloomsburg College and town. It was secluded and private, with so many beautiful views, and a little pond in the backyard. Staying in Melody's home was like stepping back in time. Celebrating my son's graduation from Bloomsburg College at Hidden Acres will forever be one of my favorite memories."
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay and loved that Melody’s property was able to accommodate our large party of guests!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melody listing is so country farm house. You can tell a lot of love and thought is being put into making it an inviting, clean place to stay especially for a larger group. No one felt cramped and it was peaceful!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful property. Melody is so nice and great to work with. Plenty of spce to host our entire family.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home matched the descriptions completely. It housed 8 of us comfortably and was perfect for a trip to Knoebels. It is a beautiful, old farmhouse that is kept well- stocked with many extras. We basically just needed to bring ourselves!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"I booked this property along with some family members to celebrate a birthday, and to visit Knoebelsn. The drive to Knoebels is about 20-25 minutes, but feels much faster than that. This is a fantastic property run by an exceptionally communicative and friendly host. The house was clean, and the listing was extremely representative of what you received. Melody was always available if you needed anything. This will certainly be a property I visit again."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a fantastic stay! Love the old farm house atmosphere. Peaceful night time sounds listening to the pond’s bullfrogs and crickets next to the fire pit making s’mores. Nice touch having water in the fridge and ready-made ice cubes. Loved the coffee pods and cabinet with available spices. Thank you so much Melody.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a relaxing afternoon and peaceful evening at the Hidden Acres farmhouse! Plenty of room for the boys to run off some energy and settle into an evening of family board games and watching the fireflys sparkle!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at Melody’s was absolutely perfect. She had added so many welcoming touches to our stay that made my family felt right at home. I will definitely stay here again when we return in the future. Thank you so very much Melody!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"PERFECT stay for 7 of us Bloomsburg Alumni who were in town for a college reunion. We have history with the property and were ecstatic when we found out it was an AirBNB. Accommodations for 7 were great, it was roomy, comfortable and cozy. We enjoyed our time together in this house and Summer Cottage. Host Melody was responsive, flexible and easy to talk to prior to check-in and once we were there. Highly recommend this farm house."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic, private farm home.
Perfect location for us to visit Bloomsburg University and to enjoy family time.
Kitchen was well stocked, bath towels spa quality bright white, bedrooms spacious and clean.
Melody was gracious host and very responsive.
Definitely will be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melody was very accommodating and easy to work with.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Relaxing place with space to spread out. Beautiful place
Melody makes you feel pampered"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved it here! My friend and I stayed with our young families for a long weekend and went to Knoebels. It was a great place to unwind and spend quality time together. Note that you do need to keep close to young kids bc there is a sloping hill leading to a pond behind the house. We saw ducks and bullfrogs! Everything was well maintained, and Melody even left us paper products when the dishwasher broke! She also quickly responded when we realized a fuse had blown from a storm the night before. We will come back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time at Hidden Acres. The home was clean and comfortable and all the basics were readily available. Melody was very quick to answer all of questions and was consistently concerned that all of our needs were met. We will most definitely check in with Melody the next time we are in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay to visit Knoebles. Our kids loved running around outside and playing with the puzzles in the house. Everything was very clean when we arrived and Melody was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again to go back to the park.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our friend group had a fabulous stay at Melody's place. We were in town for a wedding at the Pump House nearby and location was perfect. Plenty of parking and space for all 9 of us. We added on the summer cottage to have more bedrooms and the extra shower which was very useful for us to get ready. Melody was a great host and super responsive to any questions we had, she even was kind enough to stop by to run us a few extra household items. Would recommend to anyone in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is absolutely beautiful. We were in awe of the landscapes and how peaceful it was. It was such a cute house that was well maintained. The porch and plants made the house look so warm and welcoming. We captured such nice pictures at sunset with the pond in the backyard. Melody was so nice and helpful with anything we might need. We would definitely stay here again!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Melody went above and beyond.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place to kick back and relax and enjoy the weather at! Would love to come back here if we come back to the area!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"It is sometimes difficult to find great accommodations for a large group of adults, but Melody's home fit the bill perfectly! All the girls went to a baby shower not too far away, and the guys decided to hang at the house. A perfect plan for all! Melody's home has a great feel, and we all felt like we belonged there. So welcoming and cozy with beautiful surroundings. Many thanks to Melody for her hospitality and lodging. We loved it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melody’s place is and was perfect for our gathering of 7 for sleeping and 11 for a Christmas celebration. There were lots of books for our granddaughter to read and puzzles to put together. The land provided a beautiful setting and great for strolls. Loved the isolated feeling away from hustle and bustle but very close to all we needed and wanted to do. Melody was very responsive and was great to work with. I highly recommend this place. It is a wonderful farmhouse that for us brought back some good family memories of being on the farm. The downstairs provided a lot of space for our family to visit. It was a wonderful experience.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time, Melody was very caring, always attentive.
All very clean.
The place is fabulous of absolute calm, perfect for New Yorkers like us.
Thanks again"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Such a beautiful farmhouse with so much charm! The views were spectacular!! Melody goes above and beyond to make sure her guests are happy!! We will definitely be back!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We felt welcomed here, and they did a great job to make us all feel right at home. Beautiful property, comfortable for a family get-together. Plenty of towels, sheets, and easy checkout. Very superior to other places we have stayed at.
The property is old and needs some repairs, but we enjoyed staying here very much. I was surprised at how close it was to Bloom, and yet you felt far away from the town.
Great place for a secluded and quiet time. I would rent this again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,10 out of 10 on Hidden Acres. The most amazing views with such a sweet and accommodating home. We were very comfortable and felt safe with 2 toddlers (2 under four) in the entire house. The host supplied everything we might need and more. We booked the rental to be close to knoebels and I only wish we had had more time to enjoy the house and surroundings because it was that lovely!!! This is the place to stay!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Firstly, let me say how beautiful and private Hidden Acres was. We were in the area for Knoebel’s and chose Hidden Acres for the country setting and abundance of space. We had 8 adults in our group and had plenty of space to spread out and enjoy our family weekend. The beds were super comfy and everything was so clean! We really enjoyed hanging out on the wrap around porch late into the night catching up with the family. The communication with Melody was by far the best we have had with any Air BnB rental thus far. Melody was quick to respond and very helpful and accommodating. She left extra pillows out and even recommended the room that had the firmest bed after I mentioned my recent neck surgery and possible needs. There is just nothing like the charm and feel of a 1900’s farm house, but of course having the amenities like air conditioning, internet and tv we all crave now days. Hidden Acres is at the top on our list if we plan another trip to Knoebel’s in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly an amazing property to stay at! The view is gorgeous and the home is very family friendly. It was a home away from home. I am looking forward to our next stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect! 20 minute ride to Knoebles. The accommodations suited 5 adults and 2 kids perfectly. Host was amazing! Definitely will look to stay there again!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This home was super clean, great getaway. Host was awesome!!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Lovely and comfortable home with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. Melody greeted us warmly upon check-in and messaged frequently to see if we needed anything. House was in a perfect location to get to an event we were attending in Bloomsburg but far enough away from downtown area to feel like we were escaping to the mountains for a few days.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A perfect stay—a picturesque beautiful house in a lovely hidden-away part of the world. Perfect for two days at Knoebels! The house was comfortable and convenient, perfect for six adults and two under-5s—all the kids’ books and toys were a wonderful bonus. Melody was an excellent host, very communicative and helpful—not to mention patient!—and she made our stay everything we could have wanted. Can’t wait till we’re able to stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location to Knoebels and a very comfortable stay. We loved going into the city and having dinner but yet coming home to a place that felt like home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melody was a super accommodating host! She is quick to respond and the house has everything you need. The sunsets around the fire pit were amazing. We will be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melody is a responsive, helpful and attentive host. We had ease of check-in and the description of the farmhouse is accurate. The setting is peaceful and tranquil. The beds were comfortable and the home was cool, even in the heat of a PA summer. The kitchen was well stocked with any tools you might need, and the house had plenty of all supplies to make you feel at home. We will reach out to Melody the next time we have a family gathering."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing home with a very attentive host. Great for Knoebels.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed after a day at Knoebels. Everything was clean and welcoming. Melody was incredibly attentive. Everyone from my 1 year old to my in laws had a wonderful time. Next time we’re in the area, this will be the first place we check for availability."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Melody, your warm welcome and hospitality were greatly appreciated after a busy time prior to our arrival. Your setting is truly tranquil and relaxing. Your provision of welcome refreshments and snacks were delightful. A perfect location to gather ahead of our Son’s wedding!! I would gladly advise all to consider this slice of fresh air for a very comfortable night’s rest and family gathering by the fire pit!!!! Sincerely, Fran"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place! Everything we needed for meals was included in her fully stocked kitchen. And a wonderful surprise were the children’s toys and books our kids were able to use! Definitely plan on staying again and hope it can be for a longer time to enjoy all the beautiful property has to offer.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Melody's property. The historic farm was full of charm and comfort, and had thoughtful amenities throughout. You can tell that this is a host who loves their property and hosting! Melody gave us tons of recommendations for things to do in the area. Our party had six adults and two young children. We utilized the cottage for extra sleeping space. We will definitely be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Our group of 7 friends stayed at Melody’s and it was the perfect place for a weekend getaway! We enjoyed walking around the property which was very scenic and quiet. Melody was so easy to communicate with throughout our stay and answered our questions promptly.
2021-12-01,2,Stayed with kids,Ended not using it and no compassion
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family, 2 adults, 3 kids (16, 11 & 10) absolutely loved the farmhouse. We didn't miss a TV during our weekend. Though they did have wifi access that we used on a brought laptop to stream a sports game one night. The house came equipped with everything incedental you needed, dollar general is just a bit aways off the mountain for things you may need, and food delivery was timely if you don't wish to cook. The property itself is beautiful, we spent sometime walking around, and avoiding the no-go zones. Will absolutely check if this space is open first next time we are in the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melody was so kind and walked us through the house to show us everything, answered my SEVERAL questions since this was our first air b&b stay and even gave us some fun local things to do with our kids. The house is super cute and cozy. We had a wonderful time and would DEFINITELY rent again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a beautiful home in a peaceful, gorgeous setting, look no further. Take a walk around the property, sit on the beautiful porch with a book, or get everyone around the fire pit and relax! The house is clean comfortable with plenty of space for a larger family. The host is a delight and has seen to every detail - including keeping the house stocked with water, some goodies and more. So many thoughtful little touches that just make your stay so incredibly pleasant. We will be talking about this trip for a long time, and we will be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful farmhouse in a peaceful, tranquil setting. A great place to unplug and unwind. The host, Melody, responded within minutes and was so helpful and accommodating to our ever changing situation. I would highly recommend staying here for a peaceful getaway."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"It’s a lovely farmhouse, you have it to yourself and it’s great for a nice weekend getaway if you want to unplug from the world for a bit. My friends and I had a nice time and Melody was a great host and did an amazing job explaining the area and making recommendations. Big plus is being able to see stars and nice views of the mountains. I’ll definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and great host!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Melody was an AMAZING host. She checked in on us periodically by messaging us to ask if we needed anything. Very attentive and responsive to our needs. She even offered to help find/provide transportation for us home from a wedding. The house was clean and properly set up for us. The linens were clean and we were super cozy in this cute, peaceful farmhouse. We felt right at home. Thank you, Melody! Next time we are in the area~ we will be back! If you are looking for a relaxing getaway away from everyday responsibilities, this place is perfect! 💜"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best airbnb stay! Can’t wait to go back again soon! Joe was a great host !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joe was an excellent host, super collaborative and very responsible. The house was very clean and smelled very good."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place is a little tricky to find, mostly due to the lack of signage for the last two roads. The trek is worth it for the terrific deck view of Bloomsburg University and surrounds. As long as you don't mind the hills, it's an easy walk to the many great places to eat in the town. The water pressure, shower head, fluffy towels, and provided coffee are great extras."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joe was an excellent host, attentive and caring and flexible.
I plan to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can’t explain in words enough how much Joe’s place just felt like home!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joe’s house was the perfect choice for our last minute trip. Joe was very responsive and left clear instructions. Pictures are accurate. House is comfortable, cozy, clean and in a calm neighborhood. We enjoyed the ultra soft blankets, reclining sofa and scenic views of the Susquehanna river. The shower’s water pressure felt amazing after a day of adventure! Would book again:)"
