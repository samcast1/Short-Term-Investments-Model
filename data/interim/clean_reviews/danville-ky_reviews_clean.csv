Ellen was a great host and very accommodating to our family’s ever changing needs, late check out, additional guests.
Her space is cozy and inviting.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first stay at Ellen’s Fourth Street Retreat, but certainly will not be our last. With an interesting architecture, it has all the amenities we needed. Visiting family nearby, we were able to walk to a nice, downtown Italian restaurant and did not need to drive anywhere during our stay. Pastries and coffee on the 2nd floor deck was a treat in the very quiet neighborhood was a treat."

I walked down the street to one of the close by restaurants and had a wonderful time. From now on when I do my overnights in Danville, I will be staying at Ellen’s place and not a hotel!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot to stay in downtown Danville. Everything you could possibly need, sparkling clean, and a great host. I needed to stay on short notice to visit a family member in the hospital and Ellen was very helpful and accommodating. As someone who works in the Bourbon industry, I can also confirm this is a great spot to stay over while touring the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. Lots of options in driving distance."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although we were on a vacation as a couple, this Airbnb would be a perfect place for a family to land. Two lovely bedrooms, ample space to spread out in the living room with the option of turning the couch into another bed.
The kitchen has all the amenities for cooking including a full spice rack! The host has made it fun with a Star Wars/Baby Yoda motif along with the Bourbon Trail accents throughout the house. If you are cooking breakfast don’t miss using the R2D2 toaster! Because of the weather we couldn’t fully appreciate the enclosed backyard, but when the temperatures warm it will be awesome to enjoy the fire pit and for families with children the swing set. We did take time for a hot tub soak under the stars. The path from the house to the yard is well lit and additional lights in the yard make nights out nice. Brent’s place is within easy drives to many distilleries, local historical attractions (it is only two blocks to the Dollhouse Museum) and some great dining."

There were even physical restaurant menus inside of the place for us to browse through and various other pamphlets with activities in the area. The dogs had plenty of space to run around in the yard which was a plus! I highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! From the moment we pulled in the driveway, we felt like we were at a home-away-from-home. Beautiful mums and pumpkins and gourds were on the front steps and a lovely autumn wreath was on the door. Inside, each room was clean and spacious. Information about interesting things to do and places to eat was displayed near the front door. The pitcher of cold water in the refrigerator was a welcome surprise! Brent was very patient and accommodating when dealing with an issue of only having an old phone number for us. We would definitely want to stay here if we were in the area again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable beds and great living room set-up for relaxing.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great local spot!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful place only thing I regret is not staying longer than just at a couple of days. The place was spotless and (as a huge Star Wars nerd I loved the coffee cups and decor sprinkled through out the home) the back yard was amazing and that hot tub after a long drive awesome if you’re looking for a place to stay I highly recommend this place very responsive host no matter the time of day 10/10 would stay again (and are actually already talking about coming back and staying)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Brent was incredibly responsive. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, especially if you're a bourbon enthusiast. Neighborhood isn't the best Danville has to offer, but its an easy town to get around and you are close to some beautiful tree lined streets, a wonderful college campus, and easy access to main roads. Can't say enough about the house, very cozy and welcoming and the temperpedic beds are great. The back yard was great too...completely private space to enjoy a great soak in the hot tub. We didn't take advantage of the firepit or grill because were both under the weather, but had everything you could need to enjoy those amenities. Plenty of seeting around the fire and plenty of utensils for grilling or roasting food over the pit. Personally loved the R2D2 toaster and blender as well as the other Star Wars touches in the house...but make no mistake the MAIN theme is all bourbon. Will not hesitate to book here again (as long as the price doesn't skyrocket like bouron prices have 😉 ). Seriously though, a really great place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very cute and clean

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brent's place was awesome! We were in town to move our daughter into Centre College. Close to campus. Can't wait to stay there again!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Danville at Brent’s place. He was very responsive and super helpful, we were traveling for our anniversary and he made sure to make us feel special during our stay. Check in was super simple and the private backyard made for a great space to hang out. All finishings in this newly remodeled home were top of the line with super sweet themed touches. It was clear that no expensive was spared in the design of this home and we surely enjoyed it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice bungalow in an older neighborhood. Some great restaurants a 15 minute walk to downtown Danville. House was spotless, cleaner than most hotel rooms."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so comfortable and clean. It was exactly as described and Brent was quick and extremely helpful in his responses.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we enjoyed an extended stay in Danville while visiting family. it is a quaint town, and this property is close to the downtown area and an easy drive to many things.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Better than described. From the moment you walk in, you can tell there has been a lot of thought and love put into every inch of the home.
The TV is huge, and the picture quality is pristine.
The beds are the most comfortable of any Airbnb we've stayed.
There is an outdoor play area we were not aware of, and our 4 year old was in paradise!
The fire pit was great for evenings w family, the hot tub was a bonus.
The Star Wars and bourbon theme definitely made it the best money for an Airbnb we may ever experience. Hope we are invited again because my family can't say enough great things"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brent’s place was just what we needed. We were on a family road trip and needed a place to stay for the night. Brent’s place was perfect for our family. The hot tub was an extra nice touch to soothe our travel weary bodies.
We were able to walk to the main street and we found plenty of restaurant options based on the recommendations, including a great coffee shop and even a donut shop.
The house was spotless had all the linens we needed, the bedding was superb and even had sleep number beds that we weren’t expecting, that was a bonus!

The location is awesome, although it was fairly noisy Friday and Saturday night, as bar goers hang out to smoke in the shared parking lot.

All of the little details including the closet full of things for the two year old and baby that were with us were so awesome! The baby gate and the toys and eating chair for the baby were so appreciated. All of the beds were extremely comfortable and we stayed out on the top deck until 3am! Hahaha Hope we weren’t too loud! Everyone gathered in the kitchen and also lazed in the living room on the huge couch and queen sized daybed for hours just being able to enjoy each other’s company.

The loft is beautiful! It was so clean and furnished wonderfully. We couldn’t have wanted for anything else— except a longer vacation!
The hosts gave us wonderful instructions, and provided a great booklet inside the home that gave us all the new places to eat and all instructions we would need for our stay. They provided such clear instructions for parking and even gave us a parking pass.
I can’t say enough about the layout of the loft. It was so roomy and every piece of furniture was so comfortable I never wanted to get up. The kitchen had everything we could need, and was stocked with the best coffee and tea I’ve ever had. And both were local!
The bed in the primary bedroom was heavenly! I could go on and on about how lovely the loft is. There is even a roof top deck! You won’t be sorry you stayed here!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful loft in downtown Danville! Book it, this place is a gem. The hosts were amazing with communicating and they have thought of every single detail to make the loft comfortable and relaxing, including snacks in the kitchen and water bottles in the bedrooms.

Will definitely be staying there again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect! It was easily accessible, nicely decorated, very clean and perfectly located. The place was exactly as advertised. We had no trouble parking our car right outside the door on the street, so we never parked in the city lot. The stairs to access the building were wide and easy to navigate. The layout was very open and inviting with a large island separating the kitchen from dining and entertainment space. It was a perfect place to gather! The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the bathrooms were brand new and very nicely appointed.
I simply cannot find a single thing I would change about this place - it was perfect!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Residence is simply amazing. Worth a trip to Danville KY just to stay here. Large gourmet kitchen with everything you could possibly need, very comfortable living and dining areas, three large bedrooms with the most comfortable beds any of us had ever slept on, bathrooms are amazing including a soaking tub and separate shower in the master, and the small rooftop deck is perfect for an evening hangout! And it is so well decorated - beautiful yet comfortable.
The location is fantastic too, with shops and restaurants in walking distance, including a great coffee shop called Dry Stack just downstairs.
As long as stairs are not a problem for you - the apartment is accessed via a one story stairwell from street level - then this place is absolute perfection.
Leigh and Aaron and welcoming and gracious and the space was immaculate. Will definitely stay here again as home base for next trip to bourbon and horse country!"

Leigh and Aaron’s place was spacious, stylish, convenient, and had everything you could think of!
Their attention to detail was so pampering and wonderful. The best soaps, coffee, water bottles and even snacks! The beds were so comfy and the bath tub was a dream!
We loved the art work from different places of travel and just the overall flow of the space was amazing.
We felt so at ease during a difficult time and was able to enjoy our time together as a family in complete comfort and luxury.
Thanks to Leigh and Aaron and we will definitely book again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Must stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We always love staying in one of Barbara’s beautiful apartments when we are in Danville! Location can’t be beat, walkable to Centre College, right downtown in the center of restaurants and shopping. Barbara is the sweetest host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend in Danville near Centre College. The Airbnb's location was excellent, with close proximity to the college and restaurants. The apartment was very clean, well-stocked, and featured a super comfortable bed and furnishings. The rocking chair was a nice touch and my wife loved the complimentary pastry too. Would visit again. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was wonderful, it is a great location, host added perfect inviting touches. Walkable distance to restaurants, Centre, and many other things. Would definitely stay here again!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here. Not only is it close to all the shops & restaurants and to Centre, we love the aesthetics ; we love the classic furnishings, character of the space, and locally inspired art& decor."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Barbara was extremely friendly and cordial from day one. She went above and beyond in every way imaginable. I stayed approximately 2 months at this location and was extremely happy with every aspect of the stay 😊

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Repeat stay and beautiful place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara went out of her way to accommodate us at the last minute. Her place was so classy. She has decorated the apt appropriately for its age and style with just the right amount of modern to make it fun and comfy as well. I feel our short stay was wasted as I felt the need to host a dinner party in the amazing dining room... She provides coffee, tea, snacks and baked goods (if you book before the bakery closes 😋.) She is a lovely host and it is obvious she enjoys making her guest's visit memorable. This was a fitting end to our unplanned 10 days in KY after attending our friend's daughter's wedding. Oh, the joys of retirement; you get to make these last minute travel plans and we are so glad we did. Kentucky is a beautiful state, especially in autumn!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time in Danville and it was an awesome little town that goes out of its way to feel bigger than it is.

We look forward to staying here again during our next trip to Danville."

I managed to cook a large Mexican dinner and Southern breakfast for us in the kitchen, as it was well-equipped. The beds were comfy and the room darkening curtains in the master bedroom were a nice touch. The dining table was massive with plenty of room for all of us. This is a well cared for little house in a cute little town close to when my daughter lives so we will likely be back!"

It’s close to grocery and other stores. Each room is nicely decorated which makes it feel welcoming. If you are looking to stay in the area skip the hotels and book this charming home instead.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We were in Harrodsburg for a family wedding. The blue cottage was perfect for the 5 of us. The home was decorated for the holidays, offered lots of snacks, coffees, and the kitchen was adequately stocked with what we needed on our 2 night stay. We slept well with lots of pillows, comfortable beds and lots of blankets if you like. The bathroom was better than any hotel. The off street parking was convenient. We felt right at home, and appreciated the special touches, making it a special place and a lovely stay. We would definitely stay here again if we returned for the bourbon trail."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an adorable little house that was centrally located in a cute historic town. It was very walkable to the downtown area with at least 3 really good restaurants within walking distance. The beds were very comfortable and the bedding was super nice and well appointed. In the kitchen, a nice coffee bar and everything you need if you want to cook. There is no dishwasher though just fyi.
The bathroom was very nice but not super modern. Not a problem for us. The water pressure was good and hot water plentiful.
Adam and his team were very responsive and communicated well. Check in was easy. All in all, a great experience. We loved our stay there."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far the cutest place I have ever stayed at. All the little details were great. The aroma sprays, treats, bathroom amenities the fresh cut flowers.

Nice back deck; was wishing for a couple of chairs to enjoy it more easily. The nearby train can be heard into the wee hours, but it didn't bother us. Used the kitchen a little bit, but it it's well-stocked with what you'd need to cook. Decor was charming and simple, and we also appreciated the nice touches for soaps, creams, etc. Very close to Ft. Harrod State Park which is worth a visit. Would definitely stay here again next time."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kudos to whoever designed this lovely Airbnb. We especially appreciated the abundant bedding, throw blankets and pillows, the candles, lotions and other special touches everywhere. It was very cozy, very thoughtfully and aesthetically designed, and super comfortable.
I was not super impressed by the company running the listing as hosts. They sent a lot of pre-scheduled canned messages, but were unhelpful when we actually needed something (to be clear, we didn’t have any big issues, it was a very small thing.)"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place is clean, nicely decorated, and very functional. The kitchen has great pots and stencils. The host was helpful and let us stay past checkout. I gave it 4 stars only because it had no dishwasher, the only one bathroom is tiny and becomes a desired commodity that all guests compete for. I also did not like the polyester sheets and bed cover. But, the masterbed was firm and comfortable. There were plenty of towels. TV and Wifi were ok. The house is close to the historical part of the town. Parking was no easy in the driveway. I would stay there again."

Very clean except there were some ants in blue bedroom on nightstand and kitchen area but not by coffee pot area. There was a gas fireplace which we didn’t know if we could use or not because nothing mentioned. Loved the blankets and comfortable beds.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was so warm and welcoming. We loved all the warm blankets and little touches.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed at many AirBnBs over the years. This one majored on the little things from the variety of snacks, to holiday appropriate decor, to well coordinated decorations. The property has been well maintained and was very clean. Beds were firm memory foam and seemed fairly new.
You'll notice the lack of an outside picture. That may be because the property sits directly in front of an apartment complex. It's perhaps a stretch to call it a cottage, but more appropriately a nice small home on a mildly trafficked street close to downtown in a small town.
Communication from the host was excellent. All in all, we had an excellent stay and would stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Such a cute place!! We visited during Christmas and the place had cute Christmas decor. It was very clean and there were amenities everywhere. A perfect spot for a small group!

Will rent again if we are in the area."

2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend the property. Very clean, smelled great. House was beautifully decorated. The property is in a cute town. The street directly behind the house has amazing super old historic houses. You definitely need to take a walk and see the beautiful history all around the town.
The house had wonderful extras. They included 2 Hello Fresh meals in the fridge. They had great spices & seasonings for you to use. They included detergents for the washing machine. They had LOTS of towels and rags to use. The house was super clean and very welcoming. We really liked it. Our really only complaint was communication with the property management. Prior to us booking the property, they were super quick to answer our questions. Once we booked the house, it was just auto messages that we received. We also had questions that we sent to them and never got a response. The house also had an ant problem. They had ant traps all around, but the kitchen counter always had ants walking around."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were impressed with Lee’s place the minute we walked in the door. Clean, spacious, beautiful furnishings, comfortable temp… we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Thank you for sharing your home with us! Best Airbnb we have stayed in yet!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Came to town for high school graduation, walked to Norton Center. Major thunderstorm came through, but this house felt comfortable and safe. We comfortably fit ten people in the dining room for dinner. The host responded quickly to messages via Airbnb. Highly recommend and plan to stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I know a lot of guests have already commented on how beautiful the home is etc. and I agree. For me, it met my most important expectations; plenty of hot water for showers, good water pressure, clean, comfortable beds and coffee when I get there before I shop. One thing I will say, is that this is the 1st AirBNB where I could live year round, it is that nice and comfortable. One thought, 2 couples is the perfect size group. I think any more might be a bit much unless you are a family and can put the kids on the sleeper sofa. If I find myself in the area again, I will look here first to see if it's available."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is always a great place to stay! The owners are so responsive and nice! We most definitely will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to Danville to attend the wedding of my cousin's daughter in Harrodsburg. Since we were unfamiliar with the area, we were looking for at least 2/BR and 2/Baths since we were traveling with our adult daughter to allow privacy and space to decompress after a long drive. The house looked exactly like the photos and was located on a quiet street. It was spotless, the beds and linens fresh and comfortable, and there was plenty of space to call our own. We also loved the walkability to Main Street and surrounding neighborhoods. It was a short drive to local distilleries and the wedding venue, but if you're child is attending Centre College, it's a very short walk to campus. Truly a hidden gem, and the owners were incredibly responsive, friendly and welcoming."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here multiple times…great location /proximity to Centre campus and especially the athletic complex! And,It is always so clean and great attention to detail! We’ve had a few folks sleep on the fold-out and said that it was comfortable! And hostesses are always very responsive!! They are great!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are always traveling for work and have stayed in many places in this area but by far this, AirBNB and Danville was the cleanest that we have stayed in.

Lee and Ann are super responsive and flexible. Couldn't recommend this location higher. Will definitely be back when we're in Danville!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Visiting a destination with a wintery climate adds new levels of opportunity: activities, temperatures and especially those out of one’s control: precipitation! Once again, Grant Place exceeded in the hospitality category. The driveway and walkway were cleared of snow for ease in parking following the snow delayed flight/late night arrival with the cozy element already covered with the home being perfectly warmed upon unlocking the door with the provided access code. The welcome sight of extra blankets and assorted hot beverages to prepare in the kitchen were next level! Local favorites are recommended by Grant Place - many of which are within walking distance! Welcoming, proactive, kind and responsive … you’ll be back to Grant Place (just like I was!)!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Grant Place and would recommend it to anyone coming to Danville. You won’t find better hosts and the accommodations will exceed your expectations.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m not sure that I’ve ever stayed at a better Airbnb and I’ve stayed in lots! I booked Ann’s place for my family coming into town for a wedding. Ann made check-in and check-out very easy for us in changing both times to better our schedule.
This place had everything you’d ever need! From a whole basket of snacks in the kitchen with an entire coffee bar, even whipped cream in the fridge. Plus, extra toothbrushes and toothpaste in the hall cabinet in case you forgot.
Not to mention how beautifully Ann’s place is decorated and how clean and spacious it was for our family with two toddlers who stayed.
Ann and her husband always responded to any message from me within 10 minutes. We felt very cared for! Cannot recommend highly enough."

You are close to the best parts of town- coffee and restaurants are just steps away. Very comfortable bedroom and bathroom and the kitchen (though largely unused by us!) is spacious and well stocked with pots, pans, and dishes. Thanks Wendy and sandy for a great stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy's place is very well located a block or so off the main Danville intersection, making it quiet yet, convenient to walk to nearly everything Danville has to offer. It is clean and has what you would need to enjoy even a longish stay. I would definitely recommend this for a single, couple or even friends who would want separate bed areas, as the living room functions very well as a second bedroom.
Something not mentioned much in the guides to Danville is the Young-Rode's library, literally steps from this property. It is a little jewel, staffed by very friendly knowledgeable people. If you ask nicely, and the stars are aligned, it is possible to read a book in the oldest room, by an actual fire, in a leather chair. Basically heaven."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely Airbnb that I would recommend to anyone staying in the area. All the amenities of home and a short walking distance to restaurants and shops.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I always use Wendy’s Airbnb when I’m staying in Danville! It’s very clean and comfortable!

Access to restaurants, stores, and banking is a breeze! We did lots of cooking as we love to. Cooking Utensils need upgrading😊 Everything else was as described in the listing. Top notch service."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great clean and well appointed 1BR apartment convenient to downtown Danville and Centre College. The host was extremely responsive and helpful. It was exactly what I was hoping to find for visiting my daughter over the weekend. I will be back!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An all around WONDERFUL stay!! The amenities, location, personal touches…all of it was FANTASTIC! What sets Wendy’s experience apart and what I appreciated SO much was the transparency and reasonability of the nightly rate. Unfortunately, a guest has to sift through a posted nightly rate that will double or more than double with cleaning fees and other fees. Not so with Wendy. It was a great stay and was the way Airbnb used to be with rates and transparency! A wonderful experience all around!"

There are considerate touches throughout the apartment that make this an ideal getaway (counter-top icemaker! dual-function coffee maker! softest sheets ever!)

The decor is a beautiful mix of urban and antiques, and is charming from every angle. The beds were so comfortable, like a dream! There is a fairly steep staircase from the street entrance to the loft, as well as a spiral staircase up to the master, which people who have trouble with stairs might take into account. But for the able-kneed, don’t hesitate to book this apartment. With the coffee shop across the street and the best restaurant in town just a block down, we felt like we were on a true vacation instead of just at an out of town wedding. We have already talked about coming back to Danville just to stay in this lovely spot. We didn’t want to leave."

We definitely recommend checking out the bar/restaurant Copper & Oak which is less than a block away and had great drinks and food. That was super convenient! The one and only thing that may be a negative is if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the traffic on main street but I think that’s kind of to be expected."

The 5 stars are definitely well earned. We visited for the Great American Brass Band festival. The location was perfect; within walking distance to the music and main events, close to downtown. We even used the football field/track (which was open to the public since it was off season) across the street to burn off some of our kids’ energy. Virginia has thought of everything. We had milk, OJ, and eggs in the fridge, lots of snacks, and delicious cookies and muffins. Lots of other nice touches like toiletries in the bathroom, noise machines, etc. Very clean, and I am picky about that. Loved our stay and would definitely stay again or recommend to anyone.

That said, my daughter declared this,” the best Airbnb that we have ever stayed in!” She is 18 and a world wide traveler, so a well informed declaration! The house was well appointed and had more treats, like cookies, than my own home! We will be back!"

Everything is very well stocked. She honestly spoils her renters."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We rented Kaylee’s house for our son & his family from Denver. The house worked very well for them and was convenient for us. When Kaylee learned a 3 yr old was coming she immediately offered a crib and high chair plus encouraged us to let her know if there was anything else she could provide for their stay. We would definitely rent from her again. She was a wonderful host - we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Short & simply put it’s an incredible stay!!! Super cozy, & loved being able to experience something unique. Some of our original plans fell out, but we still made the most of it as great as the property was!!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Evolve and David the host were exceptionally proactive and clear with all the instructions. Looking to book again in the near future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This ""apartment"" is appointed with pieces that I assume are someone's family treasures -- the paintings and lithographs, the interesting and eclectically curated furniture -- all of which give the space an at-home feeling. So cozy and comfy, too. And we were able to bring our very well-behaved dogs with us! David lives in the downstairs part of the house and was available for questions but he gave us our space. I am partial to Danville, but if you are thinking about making this town your hub for a Kentucky adventure, you will fall in love with this small college town."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great home and a great location! David was so sweet! Very clean! Tons of windows! We did puzzles that were there. Lots of books around to look at. We walked to town for dinner. Lots of blankets and pillows! Overall a great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family was visiting Danville to attend our daughter's concert at Centre College. The Green Door was a lovely place to stay - the upstairs apartment is spacious, beautifully decorated, clean, and has modern amenities within a charming 1920s house. My husband and I worked remotely, and while the internet wasn't quite as powerful as we needed, the setting allowed for both of us to have work space. The house is just a 5 minute walk to downtown, and 10 minutes to campus. We couldn't have found a place more ideal for our needs. Our host was very communicative and accommodating. The kitchen was well stocked - we had almost all our meals there. Couldn't have asked for more!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in one of Kentucky's greatest small towns. Fairly comfortable beds, and furniture - great for a short stay with four friends. Any group larger could feel tight with one bathroom."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Spacious and well-furnished accommodations! We will use this location again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a quick but peaceful visit to Danville.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Loved the location, very nicely decorated. Classy and antique- great decor. They thought of everything. Facial wipes, coffee, some drinks in fridge when we arrived. Easy to get keys etc.. Parking could get tricky if you have more than one car. We parked in the front yard both days. They even had pumpkin spice coffee for the fall. The location is great. Close to the college and shops and stores. We did some bourbon tours too which were close. Very clean and very spacious. Beds were firm, linens were very nice. There were 32 windows!! Plenty of gorgeous light and fall tree leaves to be seen with nice blinds for night. Had a cute front room that was like a sun room we would have coffee in the morning in. Not a party place but nice for family or adults. Had towels and toiletries. Had cups, utensils etc. , even wine glasses. The 3rd room had A/C unit and a plug in heater in case you need them. They have done a great job with a beautiful older home ( historic).
Beautiful neighborhood- slight traffic noises when someone speeds by. Gorgeous old homes. We were happy with the rental."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, very well stocked apartment just steps from everything we love in Danville- most importantly Centre College!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This home was really beautiful. The art and furniture felt so thoughtful and intentional, it was like sleeping in a museum. The house is deceptively larger than it seems, so our group was very comfortable."

Everything was Great !"

The location is convenient to downtown and the college. As noted there is only one bath. I highly recommend this rental."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful decorated, spacious apartment in an historic home and neighborhood. I walked my dog to Constitution park and downtown. Great location to everything Danville. David was very accommodating and answered all my questions quickly! Thank you for a lovely visit!"

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,We had such a great stay! The only con was limited parking. But we ended having more cars as planned so it was tight. But if you have 2 cars it’s perfect! We definitely recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Green Door in Danville is a wonderful apartment in the historic downtown area of Danville. It is walking distance to Centre College and the downtown business district. The apartment is clean and spacious, and the host is close by and very responsive. Check in and check out could not have been easier."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning property. We felt like we were in a professionally decorated lap of luxury with the quality of the furnishings and skill of the designer. Commensurate with an older home was a bathroom that was a bit antique in nature. An elongated toilet is preferred by my husband usually, as his body is taller than most, but he made do just fine he said. If you are planning on doing some cooking, you'll be really glad that this kitchen was outfitted by a professional chef. Great pots, utensils, etc. We felt very much at home here and wished we could have stayed longer."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,If you are visiting central Kentucky this is the place to stay. David was always available! The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My parents enjoyed staying here. Very close to downtown and where we live. Very clean and well stocked with amenities including in the kitchen. Minor downsides are it’s located at a fairly busy intersection and the parking is a bit tight. Also this is run by a property management company so the cleaning fee is pretty steep if you’re only staying one or two nights. My parents will definitely stay here again if it’s available when they come back to visit.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient central location. Easy walking distance to downtown.
Spacious upstairs apartment. Comfortable with all the basic necessities!

You can walk everywhere from here. We will definitely be back!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Historic house a block or two away from downtown Danville (maybe closer than that, really.) The beds are SUPER comfortable as are all of the sheets, towels, etc. Very clean, safe, etc."
