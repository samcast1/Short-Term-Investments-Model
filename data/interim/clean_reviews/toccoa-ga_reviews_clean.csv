2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Best design on the lake! This home was beautiful and better than the photos even. The location was peaceful and private. The property manager was helpful and responsive. Would definitely stay here again. Just a fabulous property!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this place for my son‚Äôs graduation from Toccoa Falls College. It perfectly accommodated our extended family. We enjoyed kayaking off the dock. The house has everything you need and the decor is gorgeous! The beds are comfortable and there is so much space for gathering together. If this place is available, I highly suggest booking it ASAP as there are not a lot of other options of this quality in the area. Thank you for a wonderful experience for our family!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin and the area, especially the water.
We arrived after a long drive in the afternoon, got in easily and felt right at home.
We chose to spend more time at the cabin than we had planned, only because we felt on a real vacation. Very relaxing and comfortable. Used the kayaks every day.
Highly recommend this place - you will love it!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is terrific. It‚Äôs beautifully maintained and in a private, peaceful setting. We had a terrific time. The dock, large deck, screened-in porch, and guest house with a pool table offer a bunch of different options for relaxing and hanging out. Nicest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in and the hosts were terrific as well."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lake house did not disappoint. Beautiful property, peaceful surroundings, welcoming and responsive host. They have thought of everything, there are thoughtful touches throughout the home. Perfect place to getaway and relax for a few days. Don‚Äôt hesitate, just book it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The house was exactly as listed and had everything we could need for our weekend stay (and beyond). A fully equipped kitchen, multiple areas to read and have coffee and the kayaks were a plus. Great place to stay and we got to meet the neighborhood pup as we departed! Would book again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying in this fabulous rental, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! We absolutely love the location of this place and it‚Äôs the best setup for being on the lake! Can‚Äôt say enough good things. Wonderful location, beautiful home, everything you need for a fantastic vacation. If you are thinking about it, just book it. I know without a doubt that we will be back again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our time while grilling and playing on the lake!! We would like to come back during the summer!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was heavenly! One of my favorite things to do with our kids when they have a few days off school is find a lake or mountain cabin and disconnect for a few days. All that to say, we‚Äôve experienced quite a lot of these kinds of airbnbs and this one was definitely in our top favorites of all time! It was clean, BEAUTIFULLY decorated and completely stocked with everything we could need. It feels very private without being isolated. The lake was great! We enjoyed taking the kayaks out and relaxing on the peaceful waters. The screened-in porch was perfection. No bugs, SO much furniture and dining space! The game cabin with pool table was AMAZING!! Highlight of the trip, especially since my teenager slept out there (which was his idea of heaven). Oh, and the LIGHTING! I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how lovely the lighting is in this home. I‚Äôm sensitive to lights and have never stayed in a rental that has so many dimmer switches! Can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay longer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice place we will visit again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing service from Linton Realty! Beautiful home, exactly as pictured. Such a fantastic getaway for our two families with young kiddos. We will stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We loved staying here this past week. The guys and I most enjoyed the dock and pool table. We had a great time. 5/5
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the place , but more loved that we had a nice Christmas and they decorated us with the Christmas tree üéÑ
We felt very calm and the house was super organized and cozy
10/10
We will certainly return"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is beautiful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great location great it was eight of us and we had plenty of room. Just a Couple of things to note
1* At this time of the year the lake is drain't there is no water.
2* The cell phone reception is very bad.
They place with very clean and very roomy"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a lovely home and very convenient for our plans.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay and enjoyed the Tallulah Gorge, Toccoa Falls, walks to Travelers Rest, a couple days kayaking with the kids on the lake, and s‚Äômores outside every night! They provided everything we thought we'd need and a few helpful things we forgot to plan for."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very beautiful and tastefully updated home. Exceptionally clean and comfortable and as described.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great üôåüèª
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location is perfect. The host was very responsive. We had a WiFi issue but they were able to resolve it promptly. Water level was low at Lake Hartwell so dock was not usable during our stay but the host had already communicated ahead of time so that was nice to know before arriving . . .
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful place. The beds were very comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials (even some ziplocks and tin foil). We were easily able to cook, do laundry, and dishes. The design and decoration of the house is very conducive to relaxing. The lake/cove was a little low during our visit, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the beauty. We enjoyed the nearby waterfalls (Ana Ruby, Minnehaha, Tallulah Falls...missed out on Taccoa waterfall..next time), the city of Helen and Mountain Coaster, and even Ziplining. Having a nice grocery store and some restaurants/fast food (Chick fil A/Starbucks) not too far was a plus. My teenage daughters enjoyed walking around outside, the bench swing, and our visits with the sweetest fur-neighbor ""Whiskey"". We were sad to leave."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is as described. Very well stocked with everything you will need. The only big down fall is the water level was extremely low and we were unable to use the dock, kayaks and paddle boat. Would rent again. Located center of a ton of waterfalls and state parks. Our 2 families loved the adventure of hiking to see waterfalls! Thank you for amazing hidden gem. Just wish the water levels would have been up. Wi-Fi was nonexistent for us. But had workers out working on lines all around the house. They may have been the issue But we spent time as a family and enjoyed the screened in porch. Had some great food from the area restaurants!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed here with my bridesmaids, plenty of space and places to just ‚Äòhang‚Äô! One thing to note is the area is heavily wooded so spiders and mosquitoes joined in our bridal fun lol. Would recommend and stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and nicely decorated. The home had everything needed for cooking and all extra amenities. It‚Äôs extremely peaceful and relaxing and we had such a wonderful long weekend stay. The host is super responsive and very helpful. You will not be disappointed.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"we had a BLAST, is the perfect house for a big family reunion or getaway!! we loved it! And the host was super responsive! the house had everything you might need!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend making memories in your beautiful home with family. Your spacious home allowed multiple family members a comfortable place to all gather. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to stay. We would love to come back if the opportunity presents itself. It was an unforgettable weekend!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is a really nice place to stay. It‚Äôs our second time now and we will keep coming back. Everything is clean, simple and very comfortable! Thanks!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was our third time staying at this house, it‚Äôs always been wonderful! Communication with the host is always quick, responsive, and helpful."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This place is gorgeous. It had everything it said and more. It even had extras for the baby we had with us. It is at the end of the lake so the water was a little lower for us but that didn‚Äôt stop them from giving us suggestions on ways to have fun. The Wi-Fi is also pretty rough and we had no service but they gave instructions for how to combat that so be prepared just in case you rent here. They are extremely responsive, gave tons of suggestions, and really were so friendly. My family and I had an absolute blast. I highly recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at this beautiful lake house. The house had everything we needed and was very comfortable. We loved the big screened in porch. One highlight was renting a pontoon boat from Interstate Boat Rental. They deliver to a boat ramp that is a 2 minute drive from the house. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home on beautiful river cove. Had a great time with our family!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,I will definitely be back. Everything was perfect and would not change anything about my stay. Grocery store is close and easy to get to as well as local restaurants. Perfect weekend get away.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and so tastefully decorated. We loved the dock and kayaks. Such a fun and relaxing stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay as a family! It was recently remodeled and offers some wonderful amenities. It‚Äôs also on a quiet park of the lake (no boats going by).
My only small complaints are that the ice maker didn‚Äôt work and the game room had a mildew smell so we didn‚Äôt use that much and brought some games to the main house.
Other than that it was fantastic!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place for a girls weekend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Inn the Cove was a wonderful place for a busy family to relax and reconnect. Everything was as described, with our only complaint being that the peddleboat was broken and could not be used during our stay. One night, after 11:30pm, the smoke alarm started going off and we had to contact the management - who was extremely responsive! It was recommended to buy fire for the fire pit at the general store, but you didn't get much for the price. However, just to the left of Manor Oak is a neighbor who sells bigger bundles at a reasonable price. The place was beautifully decorated, peaceful, and everything we hoped it to be and more. We definitely hope to return again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The lake house was very clean and exactly like the listing. The host provided helpful suggestions such as local restaurants as well as things to do and they were all wonderful. The house felt very private while not too far from neighbors so you never felt isolated. I would very much recommend this place to others.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! We had a wonderful time during our stay here! Everything that you could possibly need is available to you at this home. They have thought of everything‚Ä¶ fully stocked kitchen with beautiful countertops, glorious screened in porch, extra large back porch, windows that open from the kitchen to the screened in porch, exquisite master bathroom/shower, fire pit, nice dock with kayaks, detailed instructions, new washer/dryer, large flat screen tvs, etc. An extra bonus to this home is the fabulous ‚Äúboat house‚Äù that has a pool table, four extra beds, bathroom/shower, large flat screen tv, games, etc. The host was very friendly and responsive as well. We really appreciated being notified that the house was ready and that we could check in two hours early! We will definitely stay here again! I have already recommended it many friends and family members."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,We had the most incredible time! The house was beautiful and the layout was great for hanging out with a large group.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This rental was phenomenal. Beautiful. So tastefully decorated. Welcoming. Refreshing. Many places to relax -- conversation on the back screened porch or on the dock or around the fire pit. A nap on the day bed on the screened porch or on the comfy beds. Unwinding in a game of pool or on kayak ride. Sharing a meal from the lovely, well stocked kitchen too gathering around the table in the dining nook or on the screened porch. Andrew was so responsive and available in his communication. Cannot say enough for this incredible place!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Exceptional home! Clean, beautiful decor, responsive host, near Toccoa Falls."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We didn‚Äôt use the lake access so this review is focused on the house. It‚Äôs perfect. We stayed here comfortably with 10 people for a Clemson graduation. We loved the long table on the screened-in porch. We enjoyed the privacy of the guest house. Quiet cul-de-sac. Beautiful, high-end finishes. Comfy beds. Gorgeous shower in the primary bedroom. The communications were prompt and clear. We would recommend this house!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"We rented this for our friends to stay in for our wedding weekend. It was nice because boys and girls could be separated by the pool house so it was like having two houses rented on property. Interiors are gorgeous. The master bed is super comfortable - not too mushy, not too hard but supportive and firm. The master shower was gorgeous and spacious with plenty of hot water. Only complaint was that there were no bath towels upon checkin when all our out of town guests wanted nothing more than to shower; however host was very responsive with bringing a big bag of fresh towels by the next morning. One of our friends also left his AirPods and the host had the cleaning crew find it and then shipped it to him and sent tracking, which went above and beyond. Would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Had a great stay. Host was super helpful with any questions I had. They were willing to go above and beyond to make us feel at home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend! The place was a very private and nice place to get away for a couple of days. Would definitely recommend and come back!!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect getaway location with plenty to do and more than helpful host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was great! best airbnb we've ever had :-)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We would come back, and that's the highest rating I can give an AirBnb. The space, grounds, amenities, and sleep spaces matched the description EXACTLY. No hype here, no misleading photos, and everything listed in the ad is present, new, clean, and thoughtful. Make no mistake, you aren't within walking distance of any food or entertainment, which was exactly what our group was looking for: peace, quiet, water, and plenty to do at our house in terms of space to spread out, space to make food, space to play inside and out. The host made great recommendations for places to eat and visit locally, and don't miss Bell's Hamburgers for some of the best home-cooked southern fare any of us have had. Lastly, I think it's worth mentioning that when I had two questions (before check-in and making the host aware of a minor issue), they were extremely responsive and helpful. Well done from top to bottom."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt so comfortable and didn‚Äôt have think of a thing while we stayed. Your accommodations were nice we really thank you for all the details!!! Such a wonderful place.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great house!! Our family of 7 all had plenty of space!! The kitchen was well stocked! We loved the lake, we took advantage of all three kayaks (the big one didn‚Äôt have seats but still worked). Had a fire every night!! Neighbors dogs will visit and take off with stuff if you aren‚Äôt looking, neighbors also fire their guns, but we were never worried. The place was perfect. Hiked Tallulah falls and Toccoa falls, and drove to Helen!! Loved it here!!!!
Lots of games on hand as well!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful secluded home and location. Perfect for our family getaway. The house was clean and comfortable with everything we needed. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. Highly recommend
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do not do The Inn Cove justice. The kitchen and master bath are incredibly gorgeous. The outdoor seating screened-in patio with the daybed and extra long table is such an added bonus to the lake, as well as the kayaks. We had such a beautiful and peaceful time!! Loved sitting around the fire pit, and outside listening to the birds in the mornings! Such a beautiful place!! They are also mindful in all their amenities. They truly have everything you need!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house in a great location.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,This home exceeded our expectations! Definitely recommend to folks and we would go back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home had everything we needed and is located right on the lake with boats and life jackets provided. There was plenty of room, the house was clean and comfortable and within driving distance to biking and hiking trails. We enjoyed our stay and wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely LOVED our stay. There was more than enough supplies like toilet paper, dishwasher tabs, towels, etc. We were a group of 4 adults, 1 ten month old, 2 eight year olds, and 1 eleven year old. We all loved the space and enjoyed it to the fullest. Anytime the adults decided to leave and do some exploring and hiking the kids begged to stay. They enjoyed kayaking, the paddle boat and the boat house the most.
Other things to note was that the kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots, pans, etc. There was salt, pepper and olive oil as well as most other spices we could think of! The wash machine had detergent and dryer sheets to use as well. A coffee grinder was provided with beans and filters and was so good!
We had also reached out to see if they had a pack-n-play for a ten month old and they bought one specifically for our stay to keep at the space. The communication was excellent. Reach out if you have questions or needs and they will likely accommodate. Amazing stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here for our wedding out at Toccoa Falls. Our whole wedding party stayed here with us. Plenty of space and tons of features. Perfect location to downtown Toccoa. Completely beautiful location, amazing hospitality."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our first Airbnb and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the home and place we chose. The home has EVERYTHING you need and more. This is a wonderful place for families or couples to come and enjoy. My kids and nephews had a blast playing outside. We look forward to coming back soon!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 star stay! We loved the home it was very well decorated! Our boys loved the boat house!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay:) Beautifully decorated and very cozy cabin and boat house, enjoyed fireplace every night‚Ä¶ cabin has everything you‚Äôll need for your stay, gracious host beautiful place with beautiful surroundings!!
We would love to come back in the summer and enjoy the kayaking and outdoors. Thank you for letting us stay at your lovely place:))"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Very beautiful place. Beautiful views and quiet neighborhood! Look forward to coming back in the spring and summer!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,great place to stay near town. We've stayed there 2 weeks in a row and will try to stay there again.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"House was great, rebooked it for the following week also. house is exactly as advertised and perfection accommodations for our home away from home while we are working in Toccoa."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home. The screened in porch, fire pit, and game room made a perfect area for socializing with our family and friends. The bathrooms and kitchen were stocked appropriately for all of our needs.
Water level was low in the lake (cove) while we were there, so we couldn‚Äôt use water toys. However, the rest of the place was so great, our family really enjoyed our time."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We rented the house for Thanksgiving week and we loved it! The house had everything we needed and is set up to Entertain! We loved the games and fireplace/firepit. The neighbors dog is so sweet and friendly. We enjoyed his outdoor visits lol
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great stay!! Enjoyed every moment, would love to come back during the warmer seasons as well!!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This was my first experience staying at an Airbnb and it definitely will not be my last. Everything, from the reservation process, to payment, to confirmation, to check-in went smooth and easy. The host was extremely responsive. The home and surroundings were beautiful. The furnishings were comfortable and the kitchen and bathrooms were spotlessly clean. The home contained everything that we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable stay. I would highly recommend this property to others and hope to return for another visit."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best home to stay at! If you have a larger group this house has a TON of great space for sleeping, spreading out, and overall fellowship. Books this home if you want a home away from home to be with family and friends"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Nice place well appointed
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic home with all the best amenities. We enjoyed having a peaceful and quiet space to wake up to. Kitchen is well stocked with the basics plus some extra appliances. Plenty of room to spread out and soak up the weather, and the fire pit was a big hit for us. We had a great stay and would happily come back. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place wonderful!!! So beautiful and it was great for our wedding party. Game room, on the lake, fire pit, I mean it was perfect. Great customer service, very clean, overall 10/10 would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here, it was just as perfect as the first time. We hope to come back soon!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Excellent communication and super fun house for a group gathering. We had a fantastic stay!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,An amazing stay! This cabin had everything we needed
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"The property was very well maintained and spacious. There were plenty of beds and places to sleep and the kitchen was very well stocked with utensils, dishes, spices and everything else you would need. Unfortunately the lake level was very low during our stay so we weren't able to use the dock or kayaks/paddleboats. Overall our group had a great time and we would definitely stay here again if we came to the area."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay here was fantastic. We came with a group up 22-25 year olds doing a work training and had the best time ever! The space is big enough to hold lots of people and still be very comfortable. Andrew, the host, was incredibly kinda helping us the whole time. Woulda totally recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wow‚Ä¶will you be happy in this home. It is gorgeous inside and out. You are right on the lake with a dock, kayaks, and peddle boat that we all enjoyed!
Most anything you could need is supplied with this rental. The house is immaculate and well designed with lots of entertaining areas. You will not be disappointed."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our annual family get together was a roaring success. The two buildings really worked well for our group, allowing those who wanted to turn in early could do so in peace and quiet. The cove is very shallow, so we couldn't swim off the dock, but loved hanging out and the hammock seats are really comfy.
The kitchen is well stocked, plenty of dishes so we didn't have to run the dishwasher after every meal. Andrew was quick to respond to every message and was very helpful. Thanks for a great week!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was really really great. Clean, modern, beautifully decorated. We loved hanging out every night on the large screened in porch. It was nice to have a separate space (the boat house) for our kids to hang out at night. The house has everything you need! I definitely recommend this house, unless you are visualizing yourself jumping off the dock and swimming. The water is low (as noted in the description of the house) and you just wouldn't want to get in there anyway. BUT, they have paddling options there and all you have to do is paddle out of the cove (very short paddle) and then you are able to enjoy the deep, cool water of the lake!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The home is beautiful and clean with a well-stocked kitchen. My family loved the pool table and giant connect 4 game in the boat house and Andrew was very prompt with responses to our questions. Our only complaint is the state of the water in the cove, it was filled with algae and smelled bad. Even with water shoes no one wanted to get in the water. Thankfully we rented a boat and were able to go outside of the cove where the water was wonderful."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful time! Everything was perfect.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a family trip!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The lake house was perfect for us! The house is charming and cozy. Everything is updated and well maintained. The house was clean and very well stocked with everything from coffee, filters, and extra toilet paper to even shampoo & conditioner in each shower. The beds are comfortable. We never hurt for things to do - with pool table, board games, and kayaks to keep us busy! Communication was quick and helpful. Highly recommend"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house and location were great. We loved the convenience of the dock. It was really easy to pull up with our 19ft Montauk BW. All the outside equipment and furniture was in great shape. The multiple living spaces were a nice touch. Indoor outdoor living was really enjoyable. The hosts have thought of everything. We cooked on the clean bbq and had s‚Äômores in the fire pit. As it was basically all one level, it was user friendly for our elderly grandparents. Our kids loved the bunk beds and all the activities. You can‚Äôt go wrong with this place. The hosts were very responsive. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house is amazing! The decor is beautiful! The dock and kayaks were the highlight of our trip. The hosts were wonderful! We will definitely come back again,"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved this beautifully decorated and completely renovated cabin is a find! It accommodates groups both large and small and was a great spot for a reunion with college friends. We could not have asked for a better spot. Thanks to the host for a wonderful stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a hidden gem on Lake Hartwell! Easy to get to, lovely accommodations, very well-stocked kitchen and bedrooms, quiet lake and lots of fun lake toys. The booking company communicated very well throughout our stay. We hiked Tallulah Gorge which was challenging but worth it. Do not hesitate to book!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a place to host your next family vacation, girl/guy trip... look no further. This home has to be one of Georgia's best kept secrets as it was a beautiful gemstone tucked in Toccoa. It sits on a lake with a beautiful dock that has a paddle boat and three kayaks waiting for use and two hammocks swings if you just want to relax. This home has a boathouse that was turned into a gaming/sleeping quarters for four, a tv and pool table! Including the main house, which had three other bedrooms and a pull out couch bed, all 14 family members were able to sleep comfortably. There was a SOP/guidebook left by the host to help guide us throughout our stay. The host also stayed in contact with us from date of booking until check out. If at anytime we needed something, he was a click away. Although we brought our own seasonings and some kitchen items we thought we couldn't live without, none was necessary as this home's kitchen was completely stocked from seasonings to blenders. We really enjoyed making memories in this home and will most definitely come back again next year."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is refreshing to know that there are some hosts that go above and beyond on Airbnb. Communication was excellent. The house itself was in a very relaxing location and had everything that you would ever want. I felt at home the only issue I had was I only had 3 days to unwind!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Would stay in this home over and over again. Perfect place for 10-13 people. The house is beautifully appointed, very well stocked, gorgeous private setting and was just what we wanted to celebrate our daughters UGA graduation! One of our all time favorite Airbnbs!!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"A truly wonderful place. It is very clean, beautifully decorated, and fully stocked with everything you could need. We cooked all our meals there and lacked for nothing. The steps down to the lake and easy and well maintained. The cove is quiet and great for families. Lots of games and the pool table was a big hit with our teens!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is amazing!! Never a dull moment between games in the boathouse to catching fish off the dock to taking the kayaks out to having a fire at night. This place is so well done and the host took great care of us while we were there.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,‚Ä¢Lovely lake house in a great location with beautiful views. Andrew is a great host and provides everything one could possibly need for comfortable stay. We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful and beautiful property! Fully equipped with everything you. There was absolutely no complaints from an of us. Me and my family had a wonderful time.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a nice week at Inn the Cove! It was plenty of space for our group of 12. The home is very clean, updated, and had everything we needed. We spent lots of time on the water and around the fire pit, but we also explored some local attractions like a waterfall and beach (which was great for our little ones)! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this gorgeous rental! I spent a week here with my family and we enjoyed every minute! The house is absolutely beautiful and so well put together. The design, the details, all top notch. You will have everything you need. The cove it‚Äôs on is so peaceful and serene. The location is perfect. If you are considering this place, just do it! We will definitely be coming back here :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house and location. If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place to unwind, then this place is perfect and has everything you need to have a blast."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Amazing and comfortable place was more than enough room for me and my group. Lots of activities and amazing food in the area!! Would definitely recommend to anyone who is visiting
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place. Lots of nice touches and tons of outside space to enjoy. My family had a great time using all the great things and spaces the house had to offer. Highly recommended!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I really enjoyed this property! We went to the local spots and enjoyed the remote, peaceful area. The hosts were really kind and helpful for any issues we had during our stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This house is perfect for a large group that want to hang out at a lake.
We had a group of 8 adults cook 3 meals a day for a long weekend. There were more than enough provided cooking devices, platters, plates, silverware, etc to accommodate us without having to wash every single dish in the place. The Ingles market for groceries is like a 15 min drive. There was an additional drink fridge in the guesthouse.
The neighborhood was quiet in February. We saw maybe 6 other vessels on the lake all weekend. Our group used all the kayaks and peddle boat (almost all beginners) successfully with the gear provided.
The guesthouse with the billiard table was so clutch! All the games provided are varied enough to keep a variety of ages entertained. We barely put the tv on because the common areas were all so welcoming for our group to use. We could spread out and have quiet time away from one another. We could come together as a big group and play a game or eat.
I found all the beds and bathrooms luxe and comfortable. The provided soaps and shampoo, etc. were all well placed, plentiful, and enjoyable.
One thing to note is most of us did not have cell service in the area, but the Wi-Fi was pretty solid in the bedrooms. We had two guests take Zoom calls for 30min- 1 hour."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a perfect getaway! It is close to Toccoa Falls, which is where my husband and I got married. We especially enjoyed breakfast in the screened porch and sunsets by the lake."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful home in a beautiful location. We had a family reunion with 14 people and there was plenty of room for everyone. The decoration is perfect for the location. Every detail is prepared!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I think I was spoiled for my first air b&b experience. Should I ever be back in the neighborhood again, I‚Äôll 100% check if Andrew has anything available. 5 stars all around. Highly recommended!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"This was one of the best Air Bnbs we ever stayed at. It looks exactly like in the pictures, if not better. My family and I had a relaxing time. It was not difficult to arrive, the instructions were clear, and the check in was easy. The dock was magical and fun! We loved the way the beds were organized and it was easy to distribute the families accordingly. All in all, we would definitely come back! Book NOW!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautifully appointed home with all the boxes checked. Great kitchen for cooking, nice views out the back, great bedding and game room. We enjoyed our stay and took advantage of the fire place and games. While we didn't use the kayaks or paddle boat due to weather, it would certainly be a great spot them on a warmer trip. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Andrew was great and communicative as a host. If we had questions, he would respond very quickly.
We had to find a last minute booking due to a winter storm that knocked out power higher up in the mountains. We were so thankful that Andrew was patient with us as we were navigating that issue before booking.
The house and property were wonderful. A beautiful view of the cove to wake up to every morning. The decor was fantastic and cohesive. The beds were comfy. The bathroom and shower were everything I could have hoped for. There were plenty of activities around the house and water that we never even got to enjoy, but maybe we will have time for those things next time. In particular, I wish I had time to take the kayak out onto the water.
I would definitely book this home again in an instant the next time we are staying in the area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a spectacular time at Andrew‚Äôs house. They were super friendly and at all times assisted us with any questions. The house is very comfortable and full of pleasant details. Highly recommended!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House is perfect! Highly recommend and hope to be back soon :-)
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend, great amenities with lake access and feels like you are in a treehouse and a 5 star hotel"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful retreat at Inn The Cove. Our daughter was married in front of the breathtaking Toccoa Falls and we needed a special place to congregate as a family. We LOVED the clean, cozy, & beautiful atmosphere. Everything we needed was provided. I just wish we could have relaxed more as we were so busy with the wedding! Our hosts were great! Don‚Äôt pass up this beautiful home away from home!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space is more beautiful than pictures can capture. Everything is beautiful and done so tastefully. Huge back porch surrounded by trees. The screened in porch is AMAZING. The kitchen is open with tons of space. The kayaks and paddle boat were our favorite part. The dock in the little cove with direct access to big open water is so, so fun. My family was thrilled and we couldn't recommend this house more!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house! So well-appointed! Clean and comfortable, with all that you might need in the kitchen and throughout the house."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a getaway at the lake. We had literally everything we needed there. The house was beautiful, and the location is great. Great views plus it has a dock with kayaks. And I forgot all my hanging clothes in the closet and they sent them to me the next day!! 10/10 recommend this place. We want to come back!!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"10 STARS!! We highly recommend this gorgeous lake house! Inn The Cove is beautiful, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, sparkling clean and very well maintained. The photos are accurate, however they do not do the home justice. Andrew & Ali, prepare to be rock stars in the vacation rental world. My daughter loved the home's aesthetic and has already started redecorating her own home.
THE SPACE: The home is very relaxing and offers a lot of indoor and outdoor space. The living room is large with plenty of comfortable and cozy seating. The kitchen is beautiful, well-stocked with lots of amenities and high quality appliances. The bedrooms are large with good storage, comfortable beds, plush linens and there were plenty of extra blankets/pillows provided by the host. The bathrooms are big with good water pressure and lasting hot water. Plenty of bathroom linens are provided. The outdoor deck is large with lots of seating, peaceful, quiet and perfect for morning coffee. The screened-in porch was by far my favorite spot. We had dinner there every night and then made s'mores at the fire pit. The washer and dryer worked well, the TV/Cable/WiFi all worked fine and the AC kept the home very comfortable. The dock is large and offers the use of kayaks and a pedal boat. The driveway/parking area is well lit and provides enough space for larger vehicles.
THE LOCATION: The home is nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac. It is very peaceful and private. The property is full of nature, we enjoyed seeing all the litter critters and we especially enjoyed the chipmunk greeter. The views of the lake are just gorgeous. We had no issues with privacy or noise from the neighbors. It was a 10 minute drive to the major chain stores.
THE HOST: Andrew responded quickly to my questions and offered us some awesome recommendations for fun things to do. We took them all and had a wonderful family vacation. We truly enjoyed our time at Inn The Cove. We plan to make this home our future Georgia vacation rental and can not wait to return. Andrew and Ali, we wish you the best of luck in the future and we thank you for the hospitality. ~ The Price 5"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Inn at the Cove was the perfect fall vacation for our family. The pictures do not do the house justice. It has everything you could want and more! We loved the lake toys as well as the games inside.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to enjoy the lake and the Georgia fall season. We had a lovely stay at the inn the cove lake house. Our family of five thoroughly enjoyed the house, especially the perfectly appointed kitchen. Place was very clean and the outdoor area was perfect for enjoying the fall weather and roasting smores."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place went above and beyond our expectations! We decided to visit northern Georgia for our honeymoon and we could not have been more pleased. The thought, detail, care and love the hosts have put into this place is exceptional.
The location, decor and amenities were amazing! Our favorite was the private dock with kayaks to voyage around the lake as often as we wanted. I also really loved how the games were rustic and decoratively placed with such thought!
Game room was great with a full sized pool table that we absolutely loved.
They had everything needed in the kitchen.
And the hosts were consistently checking in with us to be sure we had everything we needed, to be sure everything was the best experience plus sending us awesome recommendations for things to do throughout our trip. At check-in, we walked into the lovely surprise of a bottle of champagne and a thoughtful note wishing us a wonderful life together as they remembered it was for our honeymoon!
This was definitely one of the best and most comfortable AirBNBs we‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of staying at.
Thank you so much to the hosts for making our honeymoon so special in the forest of northern Georgia on the beautiful lake!

Andrew the host was excellent and very attentive to anything needed as well as provided any helpful tips to make our stay most enjoyable. Highly recommend.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very tranquil place to stay, felt very safe. I used my paddleboard daily, just left it on dock all week. Beds sleep well, house has all the amenities. We used the firepit nightly. Boathouse with pool table is a great place to hang out too. We loved our week there!"

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful place to stay. Very spacious and accommodating. Just minutes from a huge variety of restaurants and grocery. Lake is beautiful and property provides many water sport items. A great pleasure to spend a weekend with the family here with ample space
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place far exceeded our group‚Äôs expectations! The home was so cozy and well-designed, we didn‚Äôt even mind that one of our ‚Äúlake days‚Äù got rained out. From the boat house to the screened-in porch, there is no shortage of nooks to curl up in, plus if you are a bigger group, the open floor plan would make it easy to spend time all together. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed, especially in the kitchen, where we cooked everyday during our five days at the lake. It was such an awesome spot, and we will absolutely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and comfortable home.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,House is as advertised and looks just as great in person as it does in the pictures. Hosts were very accommodating and available to address any issues. A very lovely home and space to spend time at Lake Hartwell.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great home! The cleanliness and the comfort of the home made our family feel like we were at home. The beds were comfy, this is always a major factor for me and something I look out for. Andrew helped us with finding activities and food in the area and was very responsive. Great home and host!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far my favorite stay through Airbnb! Beautiful home with everything you‚Äôd need. Hosts were responsive and helpful without being intrusive and they thought of everything you might need‚Ä¶ right down to a drawer stocked with every spice you‚Äôd need. Will definitely be heading back with my family üòÅ. When not relaxing on the dock or the screened in-porch or cooking meals in a fully stocked kitchen, I spent a good deal of time figuring out how to recreate this beautiful home in my town."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is amazing please to recharge energy,and take nice rest"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully decorated and well stocked kitchen! This place is private with plenty of areas to hang out. The screened in porch was amazing, although we did bring fans to plug in for the GA heat. We loved having our own dock to put the pontoon and jet skis at, as well as the provided kayaks. This is a wonderful lake home and we will rent again!
Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Inn the Cove is an exceptional location, full stop. It is beautifully designed, incredibly (almost absurdly) well appointed and has everything you need, down to not-at-all-expected details like a bundle of firewood and charcoal. The views of the cove are amazing and the included access to kayaks and the paddle boat makes for an amazing experience. Our kids loved the boathouse and pool table and the main house is an incredibly relaxing place to be. This really is a top notch property with every detail thought through, it would be a struggle to find anything to complain about and we entirely enjoyed our time there."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing house! It was not only beautiful and functional but was also full of anything you might want or need :-). The boathouse full of games was definitely a plus for 2 teenagers- and the dock was wonderful! We all enjoyed kayaking on the lake and the fact that it was in the cove kept it peaceful and quiet. Absolutely perfect for a family vacation! Thank you so much! We look forward to returning:-).
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous property with beautiful views, super clean and so many fun spots to hang out at the house! You can launch your boat right around the corner and keep it at the dock. You will feel a lot of peace with the environment and even get a lot of decorating ideas! We had 11 of us and we all slept in a bed and were super comfortable! We played pool, board games, made s‚Äômores on their fire pit, went fishing, grilled out and even had a table big enough to all eat together! Incredible screened in porch, big deck out back and the dock has a hammock plus table and chairs, plenty of room to fish! The hosts were super kind and treated us like family. We will most definitely be back, Thank you!!!!!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not find a better option for lake view property than this lake house. The views are gorgeous, the house is beautifully decorated and immaculate (the pictures do not do it enough justice unlike other properties), and everything you need for a perfect stay feels included (the paddleboat, kayaks, and game room are amazing extras!). Andrew, the host, is a dream to book with and does a great job making you feel at ease and ready to relax. Every part of the house, dock, and property is designed to help make your stay as pleasant as possible and makes it really hard to leave...... but very easy to book again! 15 out of 10 for sure!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Prepare to be absolutely amazed with this Beautiful little slice of Heaven. It has everything you need and could possibly want.

Beds are comfortable, and have an extra couple of blankets. Overall we had the best time, recharge and ready for school."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We took a short family vacation over the weekend to this amazing cabin. Lake we could see from the backyard through the trees. Kids loves fishing and we loved relaxing on the lake. There are neighbors but not to close and very friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here. Very quiet area but we have 3 teenagers and a 6yr old and they can get noisy at times and still enough space to let them be them. They had a grill that we cooked out on the first night which was great to have. Only 30mins from the state park Tallulah that we went to check out. Overall love this place.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time to say at Dock Holiday. This was a family trip with our adult children and grandkids. The cabin was very comfortable for our family of 7. The kids really loved the bunk beds, and the house was full of fun toys for them. They loved walking down to the lake. We fished every evening and had a great time. The kitchen and dining room are central to the layout, with a nice open plan. We look forward to coming back again soon."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this home really beautiful and cozy .. I hate we had to leave .. someone else had it booked so if you want it you better get it fast

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was really great!!!!
My friend and I and our kids needed a last minute get away and we are SO glad we got this place. Nice drive to Helen and Clarkesville. Great place to stay over all and it accommodated all of us!! We played and slept and just had a great time!"

Wonderful place to stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, quiet, and peaceful getaway. Beautiful home with everything we needed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Of all the Airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed at this is my favorite home away from home. It is easy to see why Andrew has a ‚ÄúSuper Host‚Äù rating, as his compassion and kindness shine.
The home itself is lovely and has everything I could ever want as I travel: extremely comfortable beds and linens, plenty of soft towels and washcloths, a well-equipped, usable kitchen, a quiet, effective heating and air conditioning system, cozy recliner couches, welcoming porches, a good washer and dryer, pretty pottery dishes galore and attractive decor without clutter.
The neighborhood and outdoor surroundings are beautiful, too.
I look forward to the next time I will stay here!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was amazing! We had everything we needed. We will be back for sure!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was so happy to be able to stay in this beautiful and comfortable space. Also, Andrew's kind help will never be forgotten. Thank you."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful 5 day stay. Clean, comfortable, and quiet. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook. Plenty of laundry pods provided for laundry. Children‚Äôs room with books and toys was a plus; my three year old loved it. Pack and play was so convenient for my 11 month old. House was cozy and in a perfect location. Close to nice trails, waterfalls, and national park. Ingles and Walmart only 10/15 minutes away. Love the walk to the dock. We went kayaking one day. They are sit on top kayaks and you will get wet, so be prepared for that. The host was very responsive and helpful. Overall a very positive experience."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was great! Close enough in proximity to where we needed to go but not right in town. The cabin was stocked with everything you might need in a home away from home. It was clean and the cabin was cozy. The check in process was easy and communication was exceptional.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice well appointed property
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great cabin at the lake ! We had a wonderful family weekend getaway and this cabin was perfect for that . We also enjoyed the Helen Oktoberfest and the drive from the cabin was not bad at all. Had lunch at Ping‚Äôs grill and it was great ! Kids enjoyed kayaking . Overall great experience.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really fun cabin that is nicely equipped. Just a short walk to the lake. My family had a great time!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great family stay! Loved the area and host was great!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great rustic cabin! My family enjoyed staying over fall break! I highly recommend staying! Even though the water level was low, but not bad we still had a great time fishing! My kids enjoyed the kayaks and the weather was great! Owner responded if we had any issues in a timely manner. Would stay here again! Great place to getaway! Toccoa is a small town. I recommend seeing the Toccoa Falls. If you really love hiking I recommend taking the drive to Tallulah Falls Gorge. It was only 30 minutes from the cabin. Don‚Äôt hesitate staying here. It is definitely worth it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall appealing, quiet and clean!!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This house is a wonderful retreat for the family, especially ones with small children. The bunk beds were a hit with the kids. They had a great ""sleep-over."" The trail down to the lake was an adventure. The owners set up a discovery path where we had to find animal signs staked out on the trail. We found all of them but the eagle. I suspect you had to look higher than we did. The lake was a place for a wonderful picnic. It is quiet and secluded. You should know the space is shared by the neighbors and you should respect their docks. But there is a dock assigned to the house and its plenty of fun to fish from. You have access to the kayaks and chairs. The house is very comfortable with brand-new appliances. The house is clean and safe. The beds are wonderful-great mattresses. The location is not too far from town and we found great places to eat. The owners are super responsive and communication was great. By all accounts, a Five Star stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, clean cabin in the woods! Very peaceful. We traveled with our baby and toddler and it was very safe for kids and had a really cute bedroom full of toys and books!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a place to get away from the city and ‚Äòunplug‚Äô and we found it. The house was very nice and was close to great hiking trails. The kayaks were great and there was no boat traffic near us. There were a few dead bugs and the grill outside didn‚Äôt work. Other than that the kitchen was modern and everything was very nice.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay. Hiking one day, day spent on the water the next, or take a quick swim to cool off. Easy check-in/out Lots of communication with quick responses. Will keep on our list for future trips."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, great location, nice change of pace and scenery for those looking for it! Also great for kids-safe because not RIGHT on lake and has a back porch that locks. Also nice bunk room and toys/books!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Had a wonderful stay. Needed a escape and this house was exactly what I needed. 5 stars all around, my family enjoyed the back porch and the dock. The decor was great and the house was very comfortable."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice relaxing and quiet atmosphere. A five minute walk to the dock and lake is refreshing. Take your coffee in a insulated thermos to keep it hot while sitting near the lake or on the dock. Very little boat noise and the lake is usually calm and inviting.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house!!! So clean, beautiful spot, comfortable beds."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeously clean and spacious cabin. Spent an extended weekend for our huge family and it felt super homey. Host was very quick to answer questions at anytime of the day or night. Enjoyed the recommendations and the beautiful dock.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5 stars all the way! Our family of 7 was in town for a wedding, and there was plenty of room for us to unwind between events. The location is perfect, a few minutes from the falls, a few minutes to town, all the while you feel like you're away from everything while you're sitting on the porch, sipping your coffee, and admiring the woods. If we ever get back down to Toccoa, this will be the first place we try to book."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,This a great cabin with plenty of room for a family getaway. Close to anything around Toccoa. The place is clean. Beds are comfortable. Host is attentive and courteous.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the lake and in Toccoa!
Andrew was great at communicating and was dedicated to making sure we had a nice stay.
We are just a family of four - but the house worked great with a toddler and an infant - making my packing much easier and I got more sleep than at home!
Really nice walk to the docks. The house is in kind of a residential neighborhood when you drive in, but the walk to the lake feels like the woods and we didn‚Äôt see and neighbors when we were at the lake.
House set up would be great for traveling with more family or a friends weekend. Photos are super accurate. Master bed and living room very comfortable. Everything you need in a kitchen - and generally in a super natural spot to find. We really enjoy cooking, and this is the best Airbnb we have found for that."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great, plenty of room for our family of 4. The host has all of the essentials there and the beds were very comfortable. The lake isn‚Äôt too far of a walk and the neighbors on both sides weren‚Äôt loud."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this cabin is very nice and comfortable for large families and groups. beautiful walk to the lake and dock. if you are a birder as I am, they have a great variety to watch while you sip your coffee on the wrap around covered deck. you will find everything you need in the kitchen to plan meals. we definitely recommend this lake home away from home."

The recliner is big and oversized for maximum comfort, the decor is very homey and charming. Sherri is a fantastic host, she greets you when you arrive and you makes you feel welcome and at home, very friendly and warm, I look forward to staying with Sherri and her dog Chipper again in the future."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sherri's Lakehouse ‚ÄúOn the Edge‚Äù was a delightful retreat! The detached cottage exuded rustic charm and impeccable cleanliness. Sherri's hospitality was exceptional; she ensured our comfort and even provided a leash-free area for our dog Jaxx. We enjoyed cozy evenings by the fire, engaging in provided games and movie nights. The serene atmosphere was a welcome escape, offering a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle. Can't wait to return in the summer! Highly recommend for a peaceful getaway."

It was such a delight to meet Sherri onsite and have her welcome us and ask if we needed anything.
AS SOON as we got there, we were met with a beautiful wrap around porch (with a swing!) and lawn lights that made the entire location look so magical! This was one of my absolute favorite stays found on AirBnB and I truly hope I have an excuse to revisit this one!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is absolutely beautiful with views of the lake easily seen from the porch.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri is a great host and does an amazing job keeping her Airbnb clean and organized. She was very helpful with any questions I had and supplied me with a pan, utensils, ect. Anything you need is just a message/ knock on the door away. There is also a washer and dryer she let me use so that was a plus. The fridge had plenty of room for food and beer and Sherri had plenty of ice. There was salt/ pepper and all the basic stuff you need along with a coffee maker and propane grill. Outside of the house there is a fire pit and plenty of fire wood, 3 kayaks, and 3 canoes. You can sit on the beach or on the dock and jump in the water or float around on a raft. All in all I would highly recommend this space with no complaints. Thanks Sherri!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"**If you find this lake house available during the dates you‚Äôre looking for consider yourself lucky!**
If you‚Äôre looking for a place where time passes slower, where vivid memories are made and where inspiration (re) fills you, you‚Äôve come to the right place; not even Norman Rockwell could have painted a more perfect place to be.
Sherri, and Chipper (15yr old friendly Jack Russell) were exceptional hosts!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such an adorable cabin in the perfect location.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If anything, the listing undersells the place. The Airbnb was on a prime spot on Lake Hartwell , close to Toccoa, but with a ton of things to make the stay amazing on its own. Kayaks, canoes, fire pit, and outdoor games made for an amazing weekend."

The cottage is charming and the bathroom is great. Only drawback is the lack of a full kitchen. Sherri keeps the place well-stocked with snacks, and the grill was excellent for our burgers, sausages, and fish. The snacks were great and the hostess made our stay even better. Sherri is the hostess with the mostest! We would love to return soon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sherri was awesome to work with and very personable upon arrival. The space is absolutely stunning with clear views of the lake right out on the porch area. We‚Äôd love to have spent more time there as it was the highlight of our trip. Also, we loved getting to spend some outdoor time with her super cute pup, Chipper!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Sherri was a GREAT host. She was so responsive and friendly. I was staying in her guest house with my groomsmen for my wedding. She saved the day by lending us her iron cuz we forgot ours. The inside is smaller than I imagined, but it was very comfortable and the backyard is awesome. Highly recommend"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed with Sherri last summer for a brief escape and knew we had to come back with friends for a lake trip and it was perfect.

My dog Otis really enjoyed our walks to the dock where we would sit in the morning and at sunsets. Sherri is the sweetest host...so helpful and made us feel right at home. There were lots of little extra things like water and orange juice in the fridge along with snacks. I would recommend this place to anyone with fur babies. Thank you Sherri for hosting and making our stay so wonderful.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"5 stars isn‚Äôt enough! The host, Sherri, and the home was even better than expected.

I would recommend this place to everyone that is looking for a great place to spend time in. My family and I will be going back in the near future. Thanks, Mike Cruz and family."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Sherri is hands down the best hostess we‚Äôve ever dealt with. Incredibly accommodating, laid back, super responsive, I cannot say enough good things. She went above and beyond in every way!! Save yourself any headaches and book her gorgeous lake property!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sherri‚Äôs cabin! The cabin was the perfect place for us and provided the getaway that we desperately needed!

We will definitely be back again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Sherri‚Äôs cabin! The mix of antique and modern was skillfully done, Sherri has a great sense of style. The bed was very comfortable and anything we needed was included. The larger fridge and microwave work space were a great addition. Staying at ‚Äúon the edge‚Äù was a delight!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sherri's place is a respite from the mundane worries that plague daily lives. Her little cottage feels like home from the first time you pull in the driveway till your tires leave her road. The lake view was a balm to our harried family of five (and two pups), and we had a blast kayaking. Whether sitting by the fire in the front yard or lazing on the porch, there is ample seating for everyone. The beds are so comfy and the bathroom is the cleanest I think we've ever experienced with an AirBnB. We plan to be back sometime soon!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amenities and cabin were too notch!! We didn‚Äôt need for anything. Gorgeous place and stay.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Sherri was super nice and was actually waiting up for us to help get into the cabin even though we arrived late. She had the lights on and welcomed with a smile. The beds were super comfortable, even better then most hotels. The little snacks and drinks were great since nothing was really open when we got into town. It does feel like you driving forever get there but super worth it. The cabin was quiet and relaxing. The whole area was beautiful and peaceful. I have no complaints at all. I miss that porch already."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri is such a wonderful hostess and her guest cottage is so peaceful. Her cottage is well stocked with snacks and toiletries. We loved watching the mist on the lake in the morning. We visited for a wedding in town and enjoyed Toccoa Falls.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherri is the perfect host. She respects your privacy but it always available if you need anything. The lake hose is very cozy and the lake is beautiful. It is a great place to relax and unwind.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very relaxing. We will be returning.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Excellent location and Sherri is an excellent host! She was so nice and everything was super clean and so cute! Loved our stay. Will definitely visit again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay at Sherri's was absolutely magical in evey way! Sherri is hands down the best Airbnb host I have ever experienced. She is helpful, available, friendly, genuine, and also extremely courteous of providing her guests the utmost pivacy and space. This guest house and access to the lake felt like they were truly mine to enjoy. My dog and I loved relaxing in the woods, reading on the porch, and playing in the lake. This vacation provided the peace, adventure, and joy I was hoping for. Hopefully, we will be back! :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Very relaxing and comfortable. Looking to return in the future
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sherri's spot on the lake is stunning and so peaceful. She has thought of so many small details that make even the shortest stay full of memory making moments. The only thing more charming than the accommodations is Sherri herself. We can't wait to go back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the greatest air bnb we‚Äôve stayed at! Sherri is so amazing and has true soybean hospitality. The cabin was beautifully kept up, clean, and comfortable. We will be back again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect getaway in Toccoa, GA. It was the highlight of our trip. Sherri is the friendliest and most welcoming host I‚Äôve had. We wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great host. You won't find a better one. Lots of activities in the area, but just relaxing on the front porch or fishing on the dock is always good. Thank you Sherri!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sherri is a wonderful host with amazing hospitality. She greeted us as we arrived and showed us around her amazing place. She answered all our questions quickly and anytime we needed her, but also gave us our space during our stay. It was just what we needed to recharge and relax for a weekend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had such an incredible time. Sherri‚Äôs place is amazing and she is such a wonder host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a special place! So peaceful and quaint. The lake is perfect and the cabin is adorable. We'll be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little cabin was wonderful. Sherri was very sweet and accommodating. She really has gone above and beyond to make her property beautiful, comfortable and safe. I love the personal touches and the tasteful decor and landscaping. Her efforts show around the entire property. We especially enjoyed the huge front porch, lake view, fishing and swimming. It was a wonderful, relaxing getaway. I highly recommend this special spot for a cozy & relaxing weekend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is an absolute gem! Sherri has put an incredible amount of thought, care, and kindness into every detail of the space, from snacks and a great collection of games to bowls and towels for your pets. She is so sweet and welcoming and made us and our dog feel right at home. Theres much more room to hangout outside than inside, but with a porch and view as gorgeous as this, who'd want to stay inside anyway? We didn't have the chance to make use of the lake this time around but are definitely hoping to come back for that purpose."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was absolutely wonderful. Sherri thought of every little detail. The view of the lake can‚Äôt be beat, and she even offered use of her kayaks, but unfortunately it was raining. We hope to be back someday!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for me (and my pup) to have a break from the city. With the beauty of the lake, the tucked away space, the special touches in the cabin, and the hospitality of the host - it is truly a place of peace and rest. I really enjoyed time by the lake and on the porch - as did my dog. As a solo female traveler I always am on the hunt for places where I can really get away from it all but also feel safe - if this is you, I can't recommend this enough. Also the bed is extremely comfortable - always a bonus!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Sherri is wonderful and she makes so much effort to make her guests feel comfortable and at home. Access to the water felt like such a luxury and the landscape is really one of a kind. Thanks for having us. Can‚Äôt wait to be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sherri's place was perfect for our 1-night stay in Toccoa.
Amazing Hostess and the home was spotless when we arrived.
She even had some nice touches such as snacks, coffee, and water in the fridge.
Will definitely be staying there again on my next visit to the area.
Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful little place to stay. The lake, house, and the host are amazing. We could not have asked for a better place to spend our weekend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful guest house on the lake, with thoughtful landscaping, mature trees, and easy access to the water. Plenty of room for parking, ample towels and linens, tasty snacks to enjoy, with a wide porch for lounging and enjoying the scenery. Sherri was so accommodating, great with communication and added so many thoughtful touches to help us feel right at home. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely hidden gem! Sherri has everything you need, or forgot to bring. I could sit for hours on the porch swing listening to nature and watching the lake. A very relaxing getaway from this crazy world. Loved Chipper!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just want to let everyone know that they will enjoy everything Sherri have to offer.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful long weekend here and Sherri was a wonderful host! Will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Looking for a great peaceful place on the lake, look no further! This place is amazing!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is perfect! Awesome lake get away
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was an amazing space. Sherri met us at the door and welcomed us along with giving us a run down of the available amenities. It was incredibly clean, and spacious. This was by far one of the best stocked air bnb I‚Äôve stayed at. She provided snacks, breakfast biscuits in the freezer, coffee, etc. It was just my boyfriend and I but a family could definitely stay here easily. Don‚Äôt pass this one up!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sherri was absolutely the hostess with the mostest. She has the most adorable spot down on the water. We arrived late and were greeted by the cutest porch lights, a sweet doggo and a plethora of snacks. The cabin was clean, cozy and had the cutest antique decor. I 10/10 recommend Sherri's place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The nicest little cabin getaway! We fished and even swam in the lake. Such a relaxing and comfortable stay; Sherri provided everything we needed for our vacation and MORE! We plan on making several trips back. (and definitely eat at Moogy‚Äôs)!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Sherri communicates very well and was very nice. Even when I forgot to update the reservation by adding a person. The property was beautiful and well maintained. Loved that the building was rustic and antique. Even though Sherri lives on property we didn‚Äôt feel as though she was watching over us. Falling asleep at the fire with a Busch beer and the nice ambiance of the outside lights was par for the course for me. Thanks
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outstanding!
One of the pretties and most hospitable places!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Man where do I start??? Ok let‚Äôs start with out host Sherri. Down home southern charm all day long. Communication was perfect! She was there to greet us on the porch even though we were a little late for checking in. Even made sure she had extra snacks since we had not eaten all day. She even introduced herself to Spicy Dog and had a few treats waiting!
Now unto On the Edge, the name of the property. Freshly refurbished without keeping the charm of an old fishing cabin. Looking around at the wonderful decor one can see and even hear grandpa telling stories of the one that got away!
The linens were fresh and the mini fridge was packed with plenty of snacks and drinks. Keep in mind there‚Äôs no traditional kitchen, but there‚Äôs microwave for quick meals. My wife and I had a few nice steaks and Sherri was more than happy to let us use their grill, even their own porch to eat and enjoy the lake views. After we enjoyed S‚Äômores over the fire pit‚Ä¶mmmm
There are some water toys available, canoes, water boards etc..
Our short stay will definitely become a longer stay in the future. My wife and I have already begun making arrangements to include our sons and their families, as well as my mother and Father.
That‚Äôs if we don‚Äôt buy a property first! ‚Ä¶lol
Please take care getting to On the Edge, the street signs are quite old and can‚Äôt be seen in the dark! We totally understand that this is a minor inconvenience."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful experience! Sherri‚Äôs home is such a quiet, cozy little sanctuary. Her home is beautifully decorated and the landscaping is gorgeous! I highly recommend staying here! The lake is easily accessible and in quiet little cove. Sherri and her dog Chipper were the sweetest hosts! We hope to be back soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location. Comfortable. Like home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Such a cute place right in the heart of downtown Toccoa.
Thank you for hosting my guest, Sarah!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described and really enjoyed our time at Sarah‚Äôs place. Will certainly consider staying at again when in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space in a great walkable location to shops and restaurants. Felt very at home!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We liked the place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apt was very spacious. Large living area & bedrooms with walk in closets. The apt was clean & neat. The apt appears to be recently renovated and gives a loft like feel . When I reached out to Sarah she responded in minutes. My stay was comfortable & this is coming from someone who is very particular about where they stay. I would defiantly stay there again!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is very nice and clean two issues was the master bed is to high off the floor for short people and when the AC comes on it will wake you up every time
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the apartment overlooking Main Street Toccoa. The shops were decorated beautifully for Christmas. The place was clean & comfortable. We loved being able to walk to shops & restaurants. We drove to Dillard, GA one day & ate at Dillard House which was a great experience. We all so went to Curahee winery in Toccoa which was so fun.
My only complaint was the neighbor in the next door apartment talks so very loud you could hear all her conversations in the evening in the kitchen. This is no fault of the owner. You did not hear neighbor in bedrooms only in the kitchen/living area.
Great little place! We would visit Toccoa again!
Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown. Walk to a lot of places from the apartment which is great! Very clean and spacious. Well decorated and laid out. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful, nice and clean and easy to find. I would have to say the only issues were the stairs ( 32 to go in with luggage) so wouldn‚Äôt recommend to someone older or disabled. Also the freight train runs behind- which did not bother us, but might be good to know for some."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah‚Äôs place was very clean, quiet and homey feeling, We came for a wedding in Toccoa. Sarah left great recommendations, R&R prime was DELICIOUS. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit . We would highly recommend this property. The accommodations are fun, fresh, beautiful, a fully stocked kitchen , and a great location for many activities.
Planning to return here in the future and would book this location again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,The apartment was designed beautifully. The furniture was clean and comfortable. Kitchen was large and had everything we needed. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful accommodations! The apartment overlooks a cute small-town street. It looks like a Hallmark movie right now with all of the Christmas lights up. The apartment was clean and comfortable, absolutely perfect little getaway. Sarah gave clear, concise instructions that made check in easy. She also provided a notebook with recommendations of places in the area to explore. Everything was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend for anyone visiting northeast Georgia."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice place, very clean."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious apartment! Everything is brand-new and spotless, the town is really cute, lots of great hiking nearby. The host was very accommodating and easily available any time we needed to communicate. The town of Clayton is close and has a lot to do as well. We were in town for a wedding, and it was a perfect place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here as last minute get away when all mountain places were booked. We took day trip to Helen, Highlands, and Tallulah Falls. We missed Toccoa Falls bc it closed at 5 and then was closed for the weekend - fall break.
The apartment is super cute, spacious and well stocked. The host was very responsive and gracious. This is a full size apartment, not the normal cramped airBnB - plenty of room for kids or activities. High ceilings, hard wood floors, lots of extras!
We tried R & R across the street - service and food far exceeded expectations in this sleepy little town."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and tidy and a very comfortable space.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Thanks for the stay! Everything was as described and was a great place to stay for my employee for work travel.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place matched the pictures perfectly. Host was very responsive and also checked in throughout the stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay for anyone looking to stay in this area! The host and co-hosts are extremely polite and ready to help with anything! The place itself is extremely well put together. The decoration is great and it comes with anything you could need to enjoy your stay. I highly recommend the spot for anyone looking to stay in this area, it‚Äôs a phenomenal deal!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We recently stayed at this Airbnb and was impressed by the great amenities it offered. The location was convenient, super close to downtown and the restaurants, and the host was very helpful throughout my stay. Easy check in and check out process. It had everything we needed, including high-speed Wifi, AC, and heating to keep us comfortable during our stay. The bathrooms were well-stocked with essentials (towels, soap, and toilet paper, and very nice shampoo)and hot water in the shower never ran out. The hangers made it easy to keep our clothes looking neat which was much appreciated as a wedding guest. Oh and the laundry room was a lifesaver for my dress! The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals during our stay. It even has a coffee and tea bar! The rooms were spacious and there‚Äôs also private parking right in the front, which was a huge plus. I definitely recommend this Airbnb. We had a nice time staying here and the amenities were excellent."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was very nice. We enjoyed the stay while visiting the rest of the family in the area so basically we just slept there. However, one evening our son enjoyed making a fire in the backyard!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very kind and welcoming. The home is very private with an awesome wrap around porch. If you want a cabin in the woods that is still close to town, this is a great choice!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was a beautiful weekend getaway. Loved the country setting, especially the out door tub and shower. The house was just what we wanted; quaint, clean and peaceful. We enjoyed a show at the Ritz Theater, walked around Toccoa Falls, went to the Currahee Military Museum and the Travelers Rest State Historic Site, visited a few beautiful wineries, Dinner and Breakfast all in two days. Wish we could have stayed longer. Oh I forgot to mention Clutch (the Lab ) he greeted us every morning and night.We will definitely return in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was peaceful and quaint. Very quiet. It reminded me of being at my grandmas house. Very close to the activities that were planned for the weekend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the accommodations
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleased with our stay. Quaint, quiet, and peaceful. Would definitely stay here again."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Luis was an amazing host! He went above and beyond to ensure my stay was exceptional. My family enjoyed every accommodation and thoughtfulness. Every room has a beautiful theme! Luis was very helpful and a resourceful host for my wedding event as well!!!!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The property is beautiful, very accommodating and relaxing. And for a second year of our visiting, we knew the owners would be nearby if needed.
I would highly recommend this home to make lasting memories with your family.
Thank you very much Luis and Nancy!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"To say Luis‚Äôs property matched its descriptions is an understatement. Believe it or not, this property is far more beautiful in person. Even my wedding photographer kept commenting on how the pool area/ landscaping made us look like we were in another country. Also, Luis and his wife were amazing. They were easy and quick to communicate and helped make my stay and wedding exactly what I had dreamed of. I could not recommend this property enough to others. I hope i can come up with another excuse to stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was GREAT! Had everything we needed.The pool and grounds are amazing. The view and the landscape were breath taking. The table tenis and pool table provided a lot of extra fun and Luis and Nancy went above and beyond to make us comfortable and accommodate all our needs.Nancy had us over to to teach us pottery. She even taught our young granddaughters
It was a pleasure to stay at their house"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect! There were so many nice touches and the pool is so much fun. It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. The hosts are amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house with gorgeous views! Luis was VERY responsive and helpful with all our questions. The house was stocked with plenty of towels, and the hosts even provided a generous snack basket, complete with everything we needed for s‚Äômores in the back!
The property is very well kept outside. The kids loved the horses and were able to enjoy feeding them. The sunsets were amazing. We had plenty of room for our group of 15 to spread out, and everything we needed in the kitchen for family dinners.
The only opportunity to improve the stay would‚Äôve been new mattresses, but typical in rental properties.
Thank you Luis & Nancy for a great stay! Thankful for the memories you‚Äôve helped us create."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great vacation for the kids and family!! Very relaxing environment, and helpful caretaker and host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Luis was fantastic. He really is a top grade host! He called us ahead of time to let us know he would meet us upon our arrival and show us around his beautiful picturesque estate. The kids and adults had so much fun with the different activities, such as enjoying the spa and pool, as well as, the table tennis and pool indoors. He provided wood and marshmallows and chocolate for the fire pit and all utensils and towels we needed for our activities. He has an easy to connect to WIFI with good speed and connectivity for a large family using multiple devices.
Luis was so attentive to our needs and was available when we needed help with his fancy appliances. The view is to die for and we are definitely considering visiting again in the future.
Thank you Luis for your hospitality, my family and I really enjoyed spending time in your beautiful home!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We met here for a family reunion, and our stay was perfect. We entertained a large group for multiple days and never felt like there wasn't enough room. The pool and grounds are amazing. The well-maintained landscape is endlessly impressive, with so many tropical plants, blooming flowers, and unique plants. Everyone enjoyed seeing and feeding the horses. The pool table provided a lot of entertainment. The home is well stocked for large groups, and it would be a great place for a wedding. Luis, Nancy, and Donnie are all focused on providing the best experience possible. Thank you."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Luis was absolutely pivotal to the success and enjoyment of our wedding reception. He was so proactive about making sure our vision came to life, even though it was different from previous guests‚Äô. He was willing to be so flexible and made himself available even when he didn‚Äôt have to. He even went out unprompted and bought another space heater during our reception because there was a sudden turn in weather. The view is somehow even better in real life. He also saw us heading toward the horses on the property to take photos, and he came out of his house with carrots so we could feed them and bring them closer. I saw he did the same during our wedding for my family. He is ON IT at all times. 10/10 recommend. He and Nancy are a breath of fresh air after dealing with vendors in the wedding industry."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Cherrywood ranch was absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. Had our intimate wedding with all the closest family members, it was perfect.

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"From the very beginning Luis was very friendly and responsive. Once we arrived, we also met his wife Nancy. Together, they both made us feel comfortable with the choice we had made and at ease when they reassured us that they would be available for anything if needed.
The property was beautiful, amazing, peaceful and even better than described in the listing. My family actually decided to just stay at the property instead of venturing out.
My main goal was to create a lasting and memorable experience for my family. Well thanks to Luis and Nancy, I achieved that goal. I thank you both for allowing us to have such a great experience. We do hope to return."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful. We had a lot of fun and such an amazing time! We plan to make this an annual trip if possible.

We look forward to visiting again in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful home, pool, and property. Everything was exactly as described on the listing. Very clean home that is well cared for. We had kids of all ages and all had a great time with the pool, ping pong, pool table, coy pond, horses, and nearby hiking. No one was bored or ran out of things to do for our 5 day trip. This was my first time in the Toccoa area and I didn‚Äôt realize there is so much to do outdoors."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We all had a wonderful time on this beautiful property!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We booked this property for my daughters High School Graduation trip. Could not have been more perfect! The house is huge so it had plenty of space and it has everything you need to have fun and enjoy yourself without even leaving the house! The pool and hot tub are amazing and the views all the way around the house make it even better! The hosts are very nice and responsive to anything you may need. Definitely recommend!

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Booked this place for a vow renewal. This place is perfect!! If I could give more stars I would. Pictures don‚Äôt do justice. The view was magnificent. It exceeded my expectations and Luis was absolutely phenomenal. He was so kind and helpful and communicated with me throughout the process. We will definitely be coming back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,To say the pictures do no justice would be an understatement. The property is BEAUTIFUL it was everything we could‚Äôve ever imagined and even more. Our special day was so magical. Luis and Nancy were extremely hands on and made our stay a breeze. The views are to die for! I would 10/10 recommend.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great views helpful host
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place was amazing! It is worth every penny and the pictures do not do this place justice. The owners were amazing and were there whenever we needed them. The views were breathtaking. I just can‚Äôt explain how
Much I love this place. I will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Get ready for a hidden treasure, my family and I had a wonderful stay and a great experience. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner amongst the stars overlooking the mountains and watched videos with family. This was an amazing experience. The host was over accommodating and I truly appreciate his hospitality and laid back persona. The music over the pool and the vibe was everything!!! I will definitely have to come again when not in wedding hustle mode.
Thanks again!
Erica"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely perfect! The home has EVERYTHING you could possibly need or want!! Hosts were terrific and available!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved every minute of our stay. The location was perfect. Similar to staying at Gibb‚Äôs Gardens! The beautiful flowers and plants were all in bloom and had clearly been well taken care of and the view‚Ä¶. Wow!
The house had everything we needed! It was high quality and wonderfully looked after. Luis and Nancy were great hosts too, some minor issues with the AC which they fixed instantly!
Thank you for having us in your beautiful home. We hope we can come back in the future!!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our weekend getaway was wonderful! The facilities are more than we expected. The furnishings are of high quality, unlike some rentals that are kept to bare minimums. There are beautiful works of art all over the house! Our hosts were wonderful. We had no pool table chalk, but Luis provided it to us within an hour or two! There was no delay. The owners were on site and available at all times. The grounds are well looked after. The resort style pool/spa is guaranteed to be the highlight of your trip, and I doubt you‚Äôll find another rental in this price range with similar pool/poolside facilities. There was a lovey but unexpected surprise for us to enjoy on the counter when we arrived. I won‚Äôt give spoilers on that! I highly recommend bagging one of the upstairs Queen bedrooms for the best views of the mountains! Do not hesitate to spend your time at this rental."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"At this home you can expect an immaculate Mountain View, a movie night under the stars, Trail ways In the forest to an undiscovered waterfall, a slide into a heated pool, and so much more!
The hosts, Luis and Nancy are simply amazing! They greeted us on our day of arrival and took us on a tour of the property and home. They both went over and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable and memorable!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect during our stay here! We all enjoyed our time at this house immensely. The view is amazing, the house is spectacular, and Luis was very communicative the whole time. :-) We can‚Äôt wait to book another stay here soon!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay in Toccoa Georgia at the Cherrywood Ranch. Our Host Luis and Nancy were great, very accommodating and gracious. The house and setting was absolutely beautiful, there was plenty of room for our entire family. The house and landscaping were well kept and the house was stocked with anything you might need. The pool was amazing and the kids loved that it had a water slide and koi pond. The area was close to amazing waterfalls, hiking trails, riding trails and kayaking. The Dillard House and Helen Ga are just short rides away. We will definitely be back.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very clean, quiet spot with beautiful surroundings! Most importantly, our baby loved crawling around on the spacious floor. Just a heads up‚ÄîAnn doesn‚Äôt keep much in the way of dishes for the microwave or kurig, so you‚Äôll need to communicate any needs with her. But she is very responsive and provided what we needed when requested."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann was an AWESOME host. The day we were to leave to come to her place we blew a tire that morning and had to wait for the tires to be ordered and put on our car. We told her we were going to be late checking in. We told her it would be around 10:00 pm before we could get there. Ann offered to go to the grocery store for us since we were getting in late. We politely declined but she did go buy a small cookie cake for our kids and had it waiting on us.
Ann was very responsive when messaging her. Don't think I ever waited more than a few minutes before getting a reply from her.
We definitely will be visiting again in the future."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a peaceful oasis every night after busy days at the TFC Missions Conference. We stayed toasty warm on the very chilly nights. Ann was friendly and quick to respond to questions.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann was a sweet lady and we enjoyed her Air B&B. It was clean and has a nice bathroom. Only thing was there was no info on the hot tub that was listed and no wifi. I would have loved to have gotten to use the hot tub. Other than that it was a great stay! Quiet home in the woods. Super close to town so that was convenient for food. We enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay again! Thanks Ann
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,110% recommend this location to anyone just trying to get away. I had a family emergency and had to book my airbnb early morning hours. I wrote Ann to let her know and her response was quick. I was driving over 20 hours and reached out to Ann if I could possibly check in early since my mother in law had passed. I didn't make it to see her one last time. Ann made sure she called me and told me that the house was ready when I was. Ann gave her condolences and made sure my husband and I were doing okay. It was one of the hardest weeks of our lives and yet we still felt at home and welcomed. Im sure Ann had to rush to get us in early but it was much appreciated since we wanted some private time to mourn. Also the balcony in the back is breath taking. I sat out most afternoons and read while I had my coffee. It helped me put my mind to rest a little. This property is absolutely gorgeous. I promise you wont regret it. Thank you Ann for the stay and never correcting me when I called you Anna
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I went on a close to last minute small vacation right after Christmas. This was a very affordable option to stay in the peaceful, quiet town of Toccoa. Ann's property is beautiful and the cottage may not look secluded from the front but inside and the balcony porch were enough to allow my wife and I to feel connected to nature and serene. We greatly enjoyed our stay and if we are ever back in Toccoa, we would love to stay here again."

We found the location great to venture in different directions to many of the various things to do. I would highly recommend. Joseph was quick to respond, offered suggestions, thought of everything. We loved it, and I must have mentioned to my husband how cute it was 1000 times-he was teasing me. We will definitely be back!"

Joseph was a wonderful host and made sure our stay was exceptional. Not only was he very responsive, but he also gave us some great recommendations. We would love to come back to Toccoa and stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy our stay. Nice and clean. We‚Äôll equipped.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Emerald Cottage was the perfect setting for our 29th honeymoon weekend! So quaint and comfortable, with a large eat-in kitchen, comfy furnishings, bright warm shower, and beautiful grounds. We didn‚Äôt take advantage of the deck, the hot tub, the hammocks, or the fire pit, but we did enjoy strolling down to the creek, immersing ourselves in the natural beauty of the place. And, it was nice to know those amenities were available should we want to use them.
The location is perfect for getting into the historic downtown‚Äîincluding the Ritz Theatre, or making a jaunt to the store for necessities or one of the many restaurants nearby, or trekking over to Toccoa Falls College or Toccoa Lake for beautiful Fall foliage and peaceful strolls.
If you‚Äôre in the area to hike or bike the local trails, be sure to stop into Currahee Outfitters downtown for any gear or knowhow you need.
We‚Äôll be back to this area and hope to enjoy our new home away from home at Emerald Cottage."

It was located in the heart of town, just minutes away from our destination. Even though it was in a neighborhood, it had the feel of being in the woods, especially the backyard. The home was extremely clean, it was well thought out as far as supplies and the neighborhood was extremely quiet. The bed was comfortable and the hot tub was a definite plus.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not look any further because THIS IS THE PLACE! It's good for your soul to stay in this perfect home. The pictures do not do it justice.

There are really no words for how special this place is."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy! Everything was easy! Booking, finding the cabin, communication - it was all easy!
We've come up to the area so many times to go hiking and were so lucky to find this place. Joseph was super friendly and quick to respond to my questions. The cabin was really cute, very well decorated, and had probably everything you could possibly need. The beds were really comfortable, too. Firm but still squishy!
We hiked all day and then went back to the cabin to play games and relax. It was perfect for our family of three but I also think it'd work well if it were two couples.
Definitely booking here again!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at this cottage. Clean and cozy. It was like being at home. No detail was overlooked. The location is great too close to all hikes and more.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen's guest house was very clean and comfortable.
We especially enjoyed having the loft bedroom for our granddaughter and her husband. This provided more privacy for each couple.
The coffee and snacks were appreciated.
We didn't understand why the price increased when the number of people increased from two to four. Also we were disappointed we were told our son and wife were not to set foot on the property. Would have been nice to have them stop by for a short visit.
The porch area was charming; wished we had more time to sit out there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in the guest cottage. The accommodations exceeded our expectations.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stephen was very responsive and allowed us to check in a bit early as we arrived sooner than we anticipated. The photos don‚Äôt do the home justice as the hydrangeas were in bloom and captured the beauty of toccoa perfectly. We enjoyed the ability to walk the really short distance to downtown and explore. This was my parent‚Äôs first Airbnb experience and this set a great expectation for them. We can‚Äôt recommend the home enough.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place! Great location. We sat on the back porch each morning and watched the squirrels chase the birds off the feeder. Stephen went above and beyond in hospitality. HIGHLY recommended.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our nights in Toccoa at Stephen‚Äôs guest house, just as we always do. He goes above and beyond to provide an excellent stay for his guests. The space is so clean and inviting-feels like home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting Toccoa to attend a wedding at the Falls. The reception was held at Flat Rock.

We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend this place."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would give the house and the host 10 stars if I could. I rented it for visiting friends and they agree with the rating. The guest house was super cute, comfy, clean and just an overall wonderful place to stay. One friend said the bed was extremely comfortable and wanted to know the brand of the mattress because it was even better than what she sleeps on at home. The location is perfect for a Toccoa visit, within walking distance of downtown. The host, Stephen, is very accessible, responsive and helpful. I would recommend the house without hesitation to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Toccoa."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the price, Stephen's place was definitely worth it. Comfortable space for the family with everything we needed...we'll definitely be staying here again if it's available...Stephen and Laura made every effort to make my stay comfortable while spending time with my uncle and cousin...and they couldn't have been nicer!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Stephen's Toccoa Guest house.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was a good stay located centrally in Toccoa with easy and quick access to restaurants and shopping. Beds were comfortable and we enjoyed the endless HW supply from the tankless HW heater. Furniture was comfortable and I'd say that the property was as shown in the photos. One item that is shown on drawings but not so well from photo is the spiral stairway to the upstairs loft. While this is clearly noted in the property information, there are no good photos of it. Overall, the property is well appointed and in very good shape including appliances which seem to be barely used. Hosts were quick to respond to messages, and I would certainly stay here again on a future visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found it very cozy, so homey. Easy to find, good location. We recommend Stephen place to all who need a place to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have family in Toccoa and have visited there for years. It has been extremely hard to find a good place to stay in Toccoa. The local B and B is nice but books up. We were thrilled to find Stephen's Guest House listed on AirBNB. The location is great, very close to Toccoa's downtown area. It is one of the best equipped places we have stayed.

Everyone had personal privacy as well as the opportunity to gather in the gorgeous covered breezeway. Our hosts provided welcome snacks and drinks plus worked with us on a few other requests.
The beds were comfy, all linens very nice, and the kitchens were generally well appointed. Everything was so incredibly clean, even the outdoor spaces. Parking was plentiful with spaces on the driveway and at the back of the property.

The four of us stayed upstairs in the loft area on the three beds and the other couple slept downstairs. The downstairs would suit the elderly very well. It was very nice to have a full and well stocked kitchen and a full size laundry area.
The hosts were incredibly responsive. The house was nicely tucked off the beaten path but very much within short walking distance to the heart of downtown. We never had any issues with noise, lights, anything of that sort and rested quite well."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you find yourself in Toccoa, Ga you‚Äôll be blessed if you‚Äôre able to stay at Stephen and Laura‚Äôs guesthouse. It was spotless, cozy and had all the comforts of home. The special touches of southern hospitality can be seen and felt in each room. From the enchanting and beautiful porch, watching fireflies in the backyard and sleeping in the wonderful linens on the beds. Check-in was seamless and there were snacks, cold beverages and a fresh loaf of Laura‚Äôs Blueberry poppyseed bread. I wished we could have stayed longer to soak up all beauty of Georgia."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve & Laura were such amazing hosts making us feel extremely welcome for our two day stay. They provided snacks and drinks knowing that we were in town for a competition which was beyond kind of them.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Well-appointed guest house with more than enough room for our family. Beds were comfortable with quality linens. Kids loved having their own space in the loft and the hot chocolate bar was a favorite! Beautiful yard with private patio perfect for enjoying a morning coffee. Hosts are welcoming and offered wonderful suggestions for local restaurants and activities. Will definitely stay here again if we are back in the area.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Extremely nice house and host. We stay here often and enjoy it every time.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute beautiful guest house in relaxing Toccoa, GA. The hosts have thought of everything. All the little things add up to major points with this house. This house could easily host six guests, with ample room to get around. Fully stocked kitchen, bathrooms, and living room. We were able to see the waterfalls nearby (Toccoa falls were closed for Covid). We came home and told others about our fantastic stay. We will be back. If this place is available, book it right away."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura and Steve are great hosts, who are naturals as inn keepers. The details were personable, the accomodations most pleasant. Very clean, offering any convenience needed if you are staying in to just enjoy. The guest house is enviable in many ways; from the great master suite with HUGE bathroom, to the family oriented living area. Love the spiral staircase to the spacious upper loft. It accommodated three adults and two children comfortably. They had games, puzzles, TV with cable access, two porch areas to enjoy the mountain air. This stay rivals any high end penthouse hotel stay in the feel of luxury and details. Comfortable bed. Comfortable recliner sofas for movie watching. Spacious kitchen with all amenities. One of the best AirBnb stays I've had.
The ONLY dissatisfaction was with the water pressure, which was not Laura and Steve's fault; as I have experienced similar in hotel stays in GA. I like a strong hot shower as part of a relaxing vacation, and although the water was hot, it was lackluster pressure. HOWEVER, this does NOT reflect on the efforts, details or experience Laura and Steve so greatly provided. Still a 5 star experience! We would book again if returning to the area. Defenitely recommend their hospitality!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Stephen's place and it was another delightful visit. We enjoy the community and the beautiful hikes and waterfalls to explore, it's such a beautiful area. We know we have a beautiful home to come back to after a day out exploring and hiking. It's always sparkling clean and the hosts are great."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the absolute best Air B&B at which I have ever stayed. The location was fantastic, and close to everything we needed. It was a good central location that made day trips to other towns very convenient. The unit was very private and super quiet. The cleanliness was over the top, and the amenities are unmatched pretty much anywhere. It was great for my traveling partner (my mom) who has serious mobility issues. And the fact that the second bed and bath were on the second floor made things even better. There was not a single thing that wasn't already provided when we arrived. And the hosts are super nice people! If I am ever in the Toccoa area again, I will try to rent this place before any other. Thaks so much to my amazing hosts! I wish you well!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed the park-like setting and spaciousness of the guest house. It is located convenient to downtown and a wonderful area for evening walks. The hosts were fabulous and the house sparkling clean.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Guest home was clean, relaxing and comfortable. Would recommend!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Guest House is wonderful in so many ways... a beautiful, peaceful, well-appointed space with all of the extra touches that make a visit perfect, including a quiet location near downtown Toccoa. The upstairs loft is perfect for families with children or larger groups. The master suite downstairs is decadent. The master bathroom is very spacious with an inviting tiled walk-in shower. The hosts were quick to communicate and available for any questions we may have had. They also left us some information about local entertainment options during our visit. We enjoyed the easy access to Helen, GA (Anna Ruby Falls) and Lake Hartwell, where we spent a day on the lake. Hoping to come back for another visit sometime."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can not say enough about our stay! The entire family is fantastic! The attention to detail in making our stay even better than we had hoped was phenomenal. Location is perfect and the cleanliness was top notch. Great place to stay!

COVID safety-conscious host."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen‚Äôs place is a great retreat! We only had a couple of days but enjoyed this house and area so much...we weren‚Äôt ready to leave! We enjoyed the scenery, hiking, the restaurant (X Factor...twice) and then coming back to the house and relaxing. The outside spaces in the early morning and evening were so nice...all kind of birds singing...perfect for settling down with a good book. The bed was very comfortable, amenities were thoughtful, home was very spacious, and of course sparkling clean! Beautiful neighborhood and Toccoa is full of friendly people...great experience!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such an amazing host and a perfect listing for traveling professionals. I've used this host for many of our reservations and they are simply the best that you could ever ask for. I truly enjoy working with them!

2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hosts are super responsive and very friendly. Pics do not so this place justice! It‚Äôs amazing from all the little touches of decor to being way over stocked with any little thing you may need. Super clean. No smell. Very spacious inside and out. Will be our only place to stay while in Toccoa. The hostess even made my boys rice crispy treats and had a full hot chocolate bar waiting for us when we arrived. Couldn‚Äôt ask for nicer hosts or a nicer place to stay.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It is a great space with great host.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't say enough about Stephen and his wife's guest home. My husband and I were married on October 18th at Toccoa Falls. Not only did their home provide amazingly convenient accommodations for my husband's two college-aged sons, but the amenities were spotless, spacious and booking was a breeze. My husband enjoyed being able to spend quality time with his boys here and I am thankful for the hospitality and prompt correspondence from Stephen. A true gem if you need a place to stay in Toccoa!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn't ask for anything thing better.

Guest house has everything needed for a trip away from home - thick towels, comfortable beds, plenty of soap choices, selection of beverages, and just very comfortable! Very nice place! Toccoa is an adorable town. We ate at a local diner and were treated like locals. Excellent food, excellent conversation.
We want to visit again!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations with nice amenities! Really nice hosts! Easy walk to cute town center.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"What an adorable and convenient guest house! For a group of 6 traveling to the college, we could not have asked for a better stay! We had 6 separate individuals so 2 slept on couches, which were quite comfy. We enjoyed the living space where we could debrief and enjoy each other. The 2 outdoor doggos were sweet and the handwritten notes and comfy linens made us feel at home. Definitely check out the Java Station while in town!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephen‚Äôs lovely home was cozy, inviting, well-appointed, and immaculately clean! We found things to be just as described and pictured ‚Äî in fact, there were some great features (like a huge custom shower) and amenities (like goodies in the fridge) which were pleasant surprises!
Stephen and his family were also communicative, kind, and patient with us when our plans changed last minute. They were always quick to respond and were waiting for us with a smile and a quick, friendly tour when we arrived in the late evening.
In short, we have nothing but wonderful things to say about Stephen, his family, and his home, and we‚Äôd gladly stay there again in the future."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Very clean and top notch place to stay. Would definitely stay here again if we have another softball tournament in the area next year!
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"My bridesmaids and I stayed here the night before my wedding, and the Toccoa Guest House was beautiful and far exceeded expectations. Photos don't do this restful home justice. The house is spacious, cozy, and clean. It's also well-equipped with everything you'd expect and more from a top-notch AirBnb. The most noteworthy characteristic is the awesome hosts, Steve & Laura, who were more than accommodating for us. I never met them personally, but my bridesmaids who were greeted upon arrival said they were very kind. Steve and Laura even went the extra mile to fill some additional requests I had prior to our stay so that we could comfortably get ready for my wedding. Communication was prompt and clear. If you're on the fence about booking, just do it! I searched for and considered many properties in the area due to the nature of our stay, and I am so glad I chose this property. The time leading up to my wedding was pleasant, and I will cherish the memories made here for years to come!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirBnb that we've been to. Definitely much bigger than the pictures and beautifully decorated. We could see ourselves living in this guest home indefinitely. Stephen was friendly and a great host. The drinks and snacks were a nice touch and much appreciated. The location is close enough to Helen, Ga which is a hot spot for tubing and a quant little town with shopping and restaurants. Tocca has a Wal-Mart close by. We didn't eat at any restaurants since we use a AirBnb to save money on meals. I would strongly recommendnd and will use again if we are in the area."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was so spacious and welcoming. We had more than enough room for everyone, and it was lovely to be able to use a full fridge and kitchen (even if we mainly enjoyed snacks and tea and coffee provided!). Soft beds and plenty of sitting space made the rooms the perfect place to relax between a long trip and a wedding. The pretty deck between where we were staying and the house was a nice touch as well. I was only disappointed that we could not stay longer to enjoy the place!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen and Laura were fabulous hosts. They even texted to let us know we'd left a light on in our car! The guest house is adorable, comfortable and delightfully decorated. It is incredibly well-equipped with lots of comfortable touches (super thick, nice towels, lots of kitchen amenities, a gorgeous yard with a super sweet patio!) It is a perfect get away, or a great place for a small bridal party to stay for a wedding at Toccoa Falls."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, home away from home. Quiet peaceful surroundings. We loved it."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen was a great host and very down to earth. He was very attentive to what we needed and extremely kind. His communication was excellent. The house is a lot bigger than I expected. The master bathroom and shower are handicap accessible and HUGE! We had a peaceful and relaxing get away. If you‚Äôre in the area then you should totally stay here, you won‚Äôt regret it. Thank you Stephen for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home."

Stephen and Laura have a beautiful home, and the guest house was fantastic. We were so impressed with the little touches that were done before our arrival. There were waters in the fridge, the place was immaculate and Laura made some delicious muffins. Overall, my family and I were very impressed with our stay. I would highly recommend anyone in the area to stay with Stephen and Laura."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The experience was perfect. The accommodations were above and beyond. The home is in a beautiful and serene area, and we greatly enjoyed the hospitality and kindness. The knowledgeable and concise information on the events in the area and places to see were above standard.
I highly recommend Stephen‚Äôs Airbnb to anyone, the cleanliness was exemplary and very nice furnishings with all of the comforts at home. I would comfortably have paid double the rate for the experience that we had."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time in the area, touring Toccoa Falls College with my son. Jackie's place was the perfect place for us during our visit. So clean, close to everything and yet still a private little getaway. We will be back for moving him into college and hopefully a few visits over the years and I hope to stay at Jackie's again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for our girl‚Äôs weekend!!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place to stay for a wedding nearby at Cherrywood Ranch. This was only 7 minutes away and super clean, quiet, and affordable! It was the perfect little peaceful get-away from our urban hometown. The bed was also so comfortable, we slept like babies! Highly recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was just what we needed for our weekend in Toccoa. Thanks!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay - perfect location to where we needed to be. Everything is as described. It‚Äôs clean, in a great area, felt at home. Beds are very comfortable, love having extra towels, blankets, toilet paper, etc. Only small thing is you can hear footsteps, doors closing, shower turning on upstairs etc. And the walkway is a bit steep, but we made it work even with two of us having some recent knee injuries. Other than that, we definitely would stay again! Would totally recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jackie‚Äôs place was adorable and very clean and spacious. Loved the ease of check in and check out. Beautiful scenery as well.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet area, convenient to Toccoa Falls College we were visiting. Very spacious, clean and comfortable. Well equipped clean bathroom- thank you for the blow dryer and plentiful towels. Only thing I missed was a mirror outside of the bathroom. Even though there isn‚Äôta kitchen, we were able to make breakfast with the supplies we brought. The refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker were perfect."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay here, and it was still great! It is super clean; and the beds are so comfortable! Jackie is a great host and was always quick to respond. We will be staying there again when we go back to TFC!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Exceeded my expectations!! Will definitely book this place again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was easy to find, comfortable, and clean.
Unfortunately, there is no thermostat to control temperature. It was comfortable during our stay and I'm sure we could have conacted the host if there was an issue.
Also, prior to arrival, I did ask the host a question to which it said was read, but I bever received a respone. The printed house rules cleared it up once we arrived.
Overall, it was a good place to stay for the 2 nights we were in town and I would consider staying there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time renting an AirBnB, but Jackie‚Äôs place set the bar up high. It was pleasure staying here and Will definitely book again when we visit Georgia."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place we really enjoyed our stay!!!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean & comfortable, though we couldn't find extra blankets for sitting around. Bring your own corkscrew. It is what it is advertised to be."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"we visited for a friends wedding in town and this was perfect for what we needed. the size and space was awesome. we were able to adjust check in time in order to get ready in time unlike a hotel, and Jackie was very responsive and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting town!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After checking out the hotel/BnB options within the desired radius & being highly disappointed in availability/price/reviews, we were thrilled to find this AirBnB option that was exactly what we were looking for. We very much appreciated the refrigerator stocked with water bottles (although the local tap water isn't bad). Both bedrooms don't have windows, which facilitated sleeping in. We did run into the owners during our stay, & we mentioned that the headboard for the King bed was very squeaky. They were aware, but had not found a solution. The bed was comfortable though. The water pressure & hot water availability were both fine. We weren't using the shower during peak 'get ready for work' time though. I looked for a way to regulate temperature, & there wasn't any way to do that (that I could find), but we weren't uncomfortable. Wifi speeds were fine. There is no 'kitchen sink', so have to get water from the bathroom sink. Not generally a problem unless you have a very tall canteen."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect! The rooms were very clean! The backyard was perfect for coffee in the morning and wine in the evening! And the king size bed is so incredibly comfortable!! This was our second stay at Jackie‚Äôs and we will definitely stay there again when we go back to see our son at school.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jackie's place was clean and spacious. The king size bed I slept in with so comfortable and my daughter said the other bed was comfortable as well.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place to stay. We spent very little time here but it was homey. Wish the master sleeping space had an accessible closet.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a very comfortable stay at Jackie's! The space is very clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable and she was very easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend her place and would stay here again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jackie‚Äôs place was just as advertised. We enjoyed our stay and it was perfect for the short duration that we wanted to stay.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was in town for a baseball tournament and Jackie‚Äôs place was close to where we needed to be. The R&R steakhouse downtown was close, the food was great and the ice cream at Rebel‚Äôs across the street was good too. That downtown area was cute and the Main Street was closed down for a fun concert! I would recommend Jackie‚Äôs air BNB for any travel needs in the Toccoa area. I did request to check out at 11 rather than 10 am and she quickly responded and said it was ok. I would stay here again for sure."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, clean, and easy to find! Worked great for me and my kids! Would stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was just what our family needed. We booked last minute after lasting 2 nights in a hotel. We felt cramped and the hotel was really busy. We definitely don't regret our decision. The cottage was peaceful. It's surrounded by trees with a wonderful back yard. We will definitely be back!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,I have visited abroad many times. It felt great to meet Airbnb and rent a house. I was overwhelmed by the boredom of the hotel rooms. I loved the amazing welcome from our host to us on this first experience. All the items in the house worked very well. Also thank you for the treats.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nice house
Comfortable
Quite area"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The Deerfield Cottage is a lovely and tranquil home
Our daughter had a waterfall wedding at toccoa falls and we were thrilled to find such a lovely place nearby
We enjoyed drinking coffee on the deck and deer watching
The backyard cottage is adorable and the perfect spot"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this lovely place to explore some of my husband's old stomping grounds and to catch up with his uncle. It was perfect for our needs! It literally was like visiting grandma's house (in the best way). The beds were comfortable. The seating arrangements perfect for chatting.
On the morning of our check out we witnessed a doe and two fawns frolicking in the front lawn! What a great way to end our magical stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Our stay here was great. We stayed here for a wedding at the beautiful venue Flat Rock Farm.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just perfect! Clean, cozy and well-stocked with everything we needed and more. The beds were super comfortable, the towels were plush, and there even were toiletries for our use. The quiet and pretty deck was a beautiful place to enjoy breakfast, watch deer and listen to the birds. The location was perfect for our weekend of exploring North Georgia's mountains, waterfalls, parks and small towns."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautifully appointed accommodations! Everything you need is there. The hosts are thoughtful, kind, and considerate. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An awesome, cozy cottage! We loved the surrounding yard. The location was perfect in relation to Toccoa and the local water falls. Only 5 minutes from downtown. Would definitely stay again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean, lovely cottage!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place! Easy check-in, communicative host. Bunk bed is slightly smaller than average for adults. Top bunk was too high/bottom bunk too low for my less physically agile mother. My 6‚Äô3 brother was too tall. At 5‚Äô5, I was Goldilocks for the weekend and slept comfortably in the top bunk!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cyd's place was great! We had our dogs with us, and they loved the backyard. Also, very quiet with no neighbors nearby. They were super quick to respond to message and questions and included lots of useful information.
Definitely visit Toccoa Falls, since it's literally only 5 mins away (and beautiful!)."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cyd was lovely! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Deerfield Cottage. Cyd even put fresh flowers for us in one of the bedrooms! The location to downtown Toccoa was perfect and we enjoyed looking up at the stars on the back balcony. There was no shortage of fluffy towels and the two beds were nice and cozy. A wonderful place to relax.
Disclaimer: the house is gorgeous and full of lovely/antique furnishings. Our toddler stayed with his grandparents the weekend we stayed here but this is not a place I would‚Äôve wanted to bring him. Older kids would likely be fine."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quietly located perfectly just outside of Taccoa. Only a 2 minute drive to the heart or Toccoa, about a 30-45 minute beautiful drive to Helen and Unicoi. Perfect spot for a relaxing weekend.
The house sits on an extremely quiet street (frequently used by a few deer that passed through numerous times). Hard to say if we were the first or hundredth guest to visit - Cyd‚Äôs upkeep of the house is phenomenal.
Cyd was perfect, making sure we got in OK. Checkout was simple. Highly recommend this property, or any of her others."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! The space was exceptionally clean and comfortable, making it a cozy retreat after a day of exploring.

Additionally, the booking process was seamless and hassle-free. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a hassle-free and enjoyable stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely would recommend staying here and renting from Brett. The home was wonderful and the host very responsive and nice. From decorations to amenities, this place was very well thought out and equipped for short term guests. We were in town for a wedding at Toccoa Falls and found the location central and ideal for all the events. The host was very quick to help when we had questions during our stay.
While the location was central, there was some noise from neighbors in the adjacent loft and traffic throughout the night. I felt safe my entire stay, but did always stay aware of my surroundings given some watchful neighbors in the morning and evenings.
All around would stay here again and recommend to friends."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Brett's was very nice. We loved the location, which was close to businesses and restaurants. We loved the nostalgia of the apartment. The renovation was the best we have seen while staying in Airbnb. The home was very comfortable, beautifully decorated, and had a wonderful kitchen.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The loft is a great mix of old historic charm and updated, modern fixtures. Kitchen/bath are beautiful and the loft has lots of comfortable and fun touches throughout the space. As a host, Brett was very flexible and accommodating as I had to move my reservation up by a day at the last minute due to changes with my schedule. Great instructions provided for getting inside and operating what‚Äôs inside the space."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and convenient to town. Our daughter and sisters stayed here the night before her wedding at Toccoa Falls. It was close and just what they needed for a one night stay. If you don‚Äôt look at his detailed instructions on finding the door it could be a little confusing. He sent detailed photos and info on finding the door and getting inside. It was small and efficient but the details are perfect. Loved the exposed beams and piping in the ceiling. It just added to the charm.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was wonderful. My husband and I had plenty of space and the kitchen was well-appointed. The location was central to Toccoa, and to the wedding we attended. I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is lovely. It has it's own rustic charm and the equipment is good. You do not have windwows with daylight in every room, but we did not mind. Brett was very nice and provided helpful information regarding the check-in, check-out and the area around."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A true hidden gem! Finding the loft upstairs feels like you discovered a fun place to hang out. The location is excellent. Everything you need is provided. Both beds were comfortable with nice linens. We loved the loft and would love to return. We were in town for a friend‚Äôs wedding at the Currahee golf course and decided to make a full day of it. We recommend the Winery and R&R prime for dinner. Thanks again for a great stay!!

2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Cool and eclectic but for the price needs to be cleaner and beds aren‚Äôt very comfortable. Also, I didn‚Äôt read this before but it‚Äôs right on a busy road and can hear cars and big trucks go by into the night and was hard getting to sleep."

It‚Äôs cute, unique and adventurous. Every time I climbed out of the window I felt like a 16 year old girl sneaking out lol‚Ä¶ but my body tells me otherwise lol‚Ä¶ Location is really great close to the stores and restaurants‚Ä¶

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was exactly what we needed. We were in town for our son's wedding. This townhome was walking distance to our Rehearsal Dinner location at The Venue at the Star Theatre. It was also only 5 minutes from the wedding venue at Flat Rock Farm. The downtown location was fantastic. We walked around downtown and visited the local shops and Antique stores. We were unaware that the Toast of Toccoa event was going on Saturday morning. The whole street was blocked off with local artists, food trucks, classic cars and Beer and Wine vendors. It was the perfect distraction for our downtime the morning of the wedding. I was able to spend time walking around with family that were in town for the wedding as well. Parking was easy as I was able to catch the spot on the street right in front of the door open every time we came back. Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in a convenient location in Toccoa."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I booked this space for some actors and producers for a film I was producing in the area.

It is in the middle of ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù so it‚Äôs walkable. It is a super small town though so the walkable things tend to close early or aren‚Äôt open on Sundays. There are a ton of options that are just a 5 minute car ride away. I would stay again if I found myself in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quirky place with its varied history displayed with vintage photos on the walls. Super clean and a fresh feel to the entire apartment.

The week of check-in, Naomi reached out to provide additional instructions and make sure there were no questions I needed answered before we arrived. Naomi was kind, responsive, and polite.
We (family of 6) enjoyed the space. 1 large room (master) with a queen size bed, a chaise, closet with a half bathroom. 1 room with a queen size bed and dresser with mirror. 1 room, multi purpose, with day bed and trundle.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan's place was a great stay. It was a tight squeeze for 4 adult males but that was my mistake reading the amenities. It was very close to the location in Toccoa we were working for the week.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"A little pricey for what we needed it for, but given the decor, furnishings, etc. I can certainly understand why.
We tend to opt for AirBnB's when we go out of town, simply for the privacy and amenities. This house was far more luxurious than any others we've stayed at. It didn't feel like a rental. The furnishings, linens, etc. were far nicer than your typical Airbnb.
Host was responsive when I had a question, and check in was exactly like she described in the message.
I highly recommend this property if you're in the area. The place is serene, and very easy to relax and decompress from life's chaos."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Janet was so responsive and helpful for my guests, and her place is really beautiful.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Hidden Gem of Peace and Relaxation
Janet's place was a hidden gem of peace and relaxation. I've read multiple reviews mentioning that the photos don't do it justice, and I couldn't agree more. The moment I arrived, I knew I made the right choice to spend the entire weekend here. It felt like having my own private day spa.
The house is beautifully private, and the amenities exceeded my expectations. The highlight for me was the huge garden tub and the massage chairs - truly a luxurious experience. The serene surroundings and the attention to detail in the house made it feel like a retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
Janet was an exceptional host, and I want to thank her for sharing her wonderful home with me. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect getaway. The money spent on this stay was undoubtedly well worth it.
I highly recommend Janet's Place to anyone looking for a peaceful and rejuvenating escape. It's an incredible value for the experience it offers."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very nice and clean. All the amenities of a serene spa. It was nicely decorated to compliment the setting. The only thing I would suggest is lighting up the house for people coming in at night because you cannot see the house numbers from the road up to the very long driveway. House is in top notch condition. Would stay again if in the area.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As advertised! There are not many Airbnb options in the Taccoa area. Local hotel and B&B options are sub-par. This home is a true gem! Super clean and recently updated. It felt like we were the first renters in the home. Janet was very helpful and provided recommendations for local restaurants and things to do.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Janet's place is in a quiet area of Toccoa Falls and was perfect for our family getaway.

The check-in was easy and the house quickly warmed up when we turned up the temp a bit. The house is beautifully apportioned, has 2 baths and lovely bedrooms. The kitchen is well-equipped and spacious too, I almost wished I could have the same home. The house was super clean.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Janet's home is very nice! The photos on the listing actually do not do it justice. It is beautifully decorated and has many special ""touches"" to make guests feel comfortable and welcome. My husband even commented on what great craftsmanship was used in the updating/remodeling of the home. It looks beautiful and obviously was done by a master carpenter.
We were in Toccoa for my daughter's wedding and this home provided ample space for our family of five. We were not able to be there much with all the activities going on over the weekend, but the location was perfect for her wedding at Toccoa Falls and the reception at Lake Toccoa Event Center. Just a short drive to both. Very convenient!"

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay here! Toccoa is a lovely town and we‚Äôve visited very often. We would definitely stay here again! Everything was clean and up to date, and the main part of town was less than a 5 minute drive. Only thing to note, there was currently a traditional coffee pot, so be prepared with your own coffee beans/grounds if you want a morning beverage. We just assumed it was a k-cup style and brought our own )our fault for not even thinking about a traditional maker), but there‚Äôs a grocery store very close if needing to pick something up."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly an amazing home!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a very relaxing retreat in a beautiful area for hiking. We were visiting our son who is working at a nearby camp this summer and he only had a short time to spend with us. He was able to relax at the home as well. It was close to restaurants in town so we could spoil him a little! It was not too close though, so we could feel like we we in a country setting.
The back patio was the perfect place for morning coffee. I would recommend this beautiful home to anyone wanting to relax a little. Great for a couple or a family since it has 3 nice bedrooms!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a delight. Beautiful decor, clean and easy to check in. Everything we could have needed was provided. The massaging chairs in the living room were a pleasant surprise and the clawfoot tub in the master bath was great after spending a cold day outdoors . We were only in the area for one night but would definitely stay here again. We recommend Puerto Nuevo Mexican restaurant in Toccoa and Hawg Wild BBQ in Clarkesville."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a truly awesome place to stay!! Very clean and well managed. We traveled from Washington state to see my grandmother is 104 made reservations at a hotel upon arriving found it very very dirty and not the best for visiting with grams so i opened my air b app and poof we were out of the grimy old dirty hotel and into this hidden gem on the state line. We did much touristing of the waterfalls and forestry trails with my aunt and the rest the time stayed in visiting with gram. It was super clean all newly remodeled very accessible for my grams and we also found it very conveniently located just far enough from town but not too far! Thank you for opening up your home to us we look forward to coming back & staying with you when we visit our family living in toccoa.

The host Janet and her husband are very good people and very good with making your stay perfect and feel like your at home. The house is very clean, modern, and well taken care of. I stayed for over a month and never had the first problem. It‚Äôs a very safe and friendly area and definitely recommend anyone to stay at this place."
