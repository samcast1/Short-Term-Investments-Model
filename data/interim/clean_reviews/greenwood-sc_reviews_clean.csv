2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We loved our stay at the cottage. It was perfect top to bottom with lots of sweet, thoughtful and practical amenities. It is a pretty oasis in a very green, quiet (except the frogs and cicadas that lull you to sleep) and peaceful to take a good walk. The home is adorable with two bedrooms and bathrooms that are immaculate. Chase was very responsive whenever we had a query. A sweet, private and quietly friendly home and neighborhood. We were sad to leave. Very pretty place, convenient walking distance to hospital for family visiting or professionals. We will be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was absolutly great. Minutes drive to the city but just far enough where traffic was of no concern.

Absolutely everything has been thought of. Ann and David are so considerate and welcoming, we truly felt like friends and guests for our stay. We were on a business trip but we will definitely try to stay there for a break. It is so peaceful. They have an 18 hole disc golf course in the property and provide discs to use if you don‚Äôt bring yours. I even got in 9 holes with David the evening I got there. I simply can‚Äôt recommend this enough. They have walking trails, a pool table, fishing, beautiful covered patio to sit, rest and relax. Great amenities and they even had it stocked some for immediate needs. Super comfortable. Great people. Just loved it. Reserve this with complete peace of mind."

There were clear instructions provided inside the rental that helped guide us through the check-in/out process - and how best to utilize the space.
I would highly recommend this rental! Also the resident furry friends (Misty and Cheeto) welcomed us on the property. Truly a wonderful place to call home for a couple nights.
Thank you Ann for the hospitality and for trusting us with your home!

Thanks again Ann!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a stay! The home - inside and out - was absolutely beautiful and decorated with love. It feels like you are staying with family.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann‚Äôs place is very cleanly, spacious, and stocked with the basics for a comfortable and homey stay! The location is stunning, and close to everything! 10/10 recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was skeptical at first of the reviews that seemed to have been left by the same person several times over‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve heard a few nightmare stories about Airbnb and I always notice these things. I gave it a shot, and now I realize why one person leaves multiple reviews‚Ä¶. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and leave another 5 star review ourselves! The house was BEAUTIFUL, in close proximity to where we needed to be. It was well stocked with the essentials, with several added extras. It seemed like small gestures (chocolates by the bed, stocked fridge with milk, bread, OJ, cereal, coffee, a cute little rubber ducky on the bath tub), but these things add up to a lot when you‚Äôre there‚Äîcaring and thoughtful. Check-in was an absolute breeze, Ann was very communicative, and our stay was fantastic. 10/10, can‚Äôt wait to be here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I really enjoyed my stay at Ann‚Äôs!!! She was very communicative and caring, an amazing host. The place is so nice. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. If I ever come back to Greenwood I hope Misty Meadows is available!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Misty Meadows is a fabulous place to stay! The accommodations are spacious and comfortable. The expansive property--with a pond, water fowl, and a walking trail around the 40 acres--is gorgeous and peaceful. Ann is also a wonderful host. As a former AirBnb host myself, I can tell you that she goes above and beyond! All the little, thoughtful touches make you feel right at home."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Misty Meadows is just as beautiful as the pictures look! It is close to town, but still feels like a stay in the country. Ann was very friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be staying here again if we are in the area:)."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Ann's property, what a beautiful place. This basement apartment was bigger than I thought, it worked great for my wife and I. We truly enjoyed the separation of space, there's a door for the bedroom and one that divides the living room. My wife sleeps later than I do, so I got to just sit at the windows and enjoy the beautiful pond while I had breakfast & coffee.
Thanks again Ann.
David and Savina H."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful country home and super nice host
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was in Greenwood for contract work. My schedule was continued. Ann accommodated my extended schedule. Lovely family, lovely place, very close to anything needed in town. Enough cooking options available without a full kitchen. Highly recommend."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ann and her family were terrific hosts. I was in town for business. My stay was extended. Even though Ann was out of town, they made arrangements for me to stay at their place. A beautiful manicured farm home with dogs, cat, horses and even bee hives with a lovely lake as a view. Great pool table too! Easy quick access to town. Much thanks to Ann, her family and the pets!"

2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time trying Airbnb and we were very happy with how convenient Ann made check in for us and how fantastic of a place this was to stay. Unfortunately we had some rain on 2 of the days we were there, but we were super happy we were waiting it out there as opposed to being stuck in a hotel room. It is a large livable space, private and with all the details make you feel at home."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann‚Äôs place is beautiful beyond expectation, accommodating, exceptionally peaceful and relaxing... you‚Äôll love the location! It‚Äôs close enough to Greenwood which has everything anyone could ever need and far enough out of town to enjoy restful peace and quiet. Check out The Pantry Shoppe... great home-made deli sandwiches plus lots of other yummy stuff to enjoy! We hope to return."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is peaceful, sooooo beautiful and feels like home. Do yourself a favor and arrive while it's still light to soak in all of the beauty the property has to offer. Nothing but good to say about our stay and our hostess."

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location!

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd visit and Ann's basement apartment did not disappoint. Everything was very clean and waking up to eat breakfast (which Ann provided!) on the patio by the water was so nice. Can't wait for our next visit.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect! There is a fridge in the unit, which is a huge help with a baby!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second stay at Misty Meadows. I travel for work and each stay was a week long and I loved both. It's such a nice place and, even though attached to the main house, I felt like I had complete privacy. As long as you don't need to cook a big meal, I can't think of anything you'd need that isn't already at Ann's."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The basement apt was exactly as described. Ann was very welcoming, warm and was very responsive."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Ann‚Äôs!
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I seem to always have good luck with airbnb's... but my gosh, this is the single nicest place we've *ever* stayed. Incredible setting, and what an apartment! Tall ceilings, lovely bedroom, comfy main room (pool table!) - just perfection. Quiet area, but close enough to the shopping area that you don't have to drive forever to get to the grocery store. We loved our visit - and can't wait to go back!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and good value.
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and great host. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Beautiful place to stay and great hospitality. Ann was more than accommodating on all accounts. The breakfast foods she had for us in the fridge when we arrived were a great bonus. The place was spotless when we arrived. Would definitely recommend and look forward to staying again in the future.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay! The basement apartment was spotless and we had everything we needed. The fact that you could wake up and walk 20 yards to go fishing was amazing. The land is beautiful and extremely relaxed. I would recommend staying here to everyone.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Ann's!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Ann was an amazing host! The home and town are beautiful. Add this place to your must stay list.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann is such a great host. She is so nice and hospitable. The home and property are so beautiful and you would definitely not regret booking here! The views are amazing from the windows and it's as if you're staying on your own nature preserve. Great breakfast items were provided, as well as, many other items needed to make your stay more comfortable. The place is so clean and tidy! It was a home away from home for us. If we are ever in the area again, this would definitely be the first place we would choose to stay!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't recommend Misty Meadows highly enough. The location is great - five minutes from many shops, restaurants, and grocery stores, and the grounds are beautiful. The apartment is spacious and comfortable with awesome features such as a wifi, a huge sectional sofa, internet-connected TV, and a pool table. Ann also generously stocks the kitchen and bathroom. You can have total privacy if you'd like given the apartment's separate entrance and electronic lock, but Ann can also show you in and offer friendly recommendations for the area. Our trip was centered around the 2017 solar eclipse - which brought totality to Greenwood - and we were delighted to share the experience with Ann and her husband!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, just outside of town. 5 minutes drive to shops and restaurants. The apartment was fantastic, comfortable bed and great porch to relax on in the mornings."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Misty Meadows and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a beautiful home in a quiet spot, but still close to shops, restaurants and downtown Greenwood. Ann is a great host; discrete, but available at the end of the phone if you need it. If you get the chance to stay here, you should definitely take it."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Ann's was perfect! I travel for work and this was definitely the best stay of my year. The communication was great, the place was very clean and had everything I needed."

2017-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,The space was clean and private. I loved the view from the living room and how quite the area was.
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,3rd visit....lovely place.
2017-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I would highly recommend this AirBNB to anyone who is looking for accommodation in Greenwood.
A large and lovely apartment with a bedroom, a private bathroom with shower and washer / dryer in the bathroom for your use -- complete with washing detergent, and a large living / dining room. There is a kitchenette with a standard microwave and toaster oven, but no conventional stove or convection oven.
Very peaceful, quiet, and scenic location.
Although this apartment is in the basement of the main house, it is NOT a basement apartment -- the house is built on a gentle incline, so the entrance and windows to the apartment open out to the expansive lawn and a large pond, which is lovely.
Cell phone reception in parts of Greenwood, particularly in this neighborhood, is very spotty and weak - it can be difficult to sustain conversations on cell phone (but probably unrelated to the apartment itself). Wireless internet access is generally good, but occasionally it does cut off without warning and needs re-connecting."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed at Ann's several times for business trips in Greenwood. The home is very clean and spacious. Ann has been a wonderful host. I would highly recommend Ann's home!
2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property about 10 minutes from Greenwood restaurants and shopping. Quiet country atmosphere. Main room looks out at a large pond. Enjoyed watching the geese fly in and the crane and other birds enjoying the water. Comfortable, relaxing. Very welcoming."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful and comfortable space to stay for short or extended period; a true ""home away from home."" Ann was very accommodating and willing to provide anything I needed. The grounds are lovely, we felt like we were at a park. I highly recommend this location to those looking for a retreat-like atmosphere."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann was a great host. Not around much, but always available by text or phone. Her directions were excellent - which is perfect for me because I always get lost!. The space itself is lovely. Very private, even though it's attached to the house. I heard hardly any noise from Ann and her family, and I hope I didn't disturb them. The space had everything I could have needed, and more. And the grounds are beautiful for a morning, afternoon or evening stroll. If you are planning a visit to Greenwood, this is definitely the place to stay."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place to stay! I visit Greenwood frequently and this was by far the most welcome visit yet. Anne was amazing. She met me when I arrived and showed me around. She had the fridge stocked with breakfast and even a little pumpkin bread ( my favorite ) from a local shop. The basement was very clean and spacious. I actually ended up just relaxing for once on the couch watching TV. It was a much needed trip and I am so thankful for Anne making the stay so easy. I also loved that she has animals since I have none of my own, it was nice to love on them. Best Air Bnb experience so far."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice time at Misty Meadows! Everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable was provided. Not only the basics, but fresh local bread, chocolates, a fridge full of goodies, a Keurig, and more. We had a fantastic time fishing in their pond, too.
Would highly recommend. It's very clean and private."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another wonderful stay at Misty Meadows. I have stayed here for business trips and Ann has been an amazing host. I would highly recommend staying here!
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am so happy to stay this house! I can do everything what i want! There is laundry, cozy bed, shampoo and conditioner, etc. Also, Ann give lots of fruit and beverage, so i can eat breakfast. There is lake in front of house, so it is really calm and peaceful.
I am absolutely trying to stay her house when I visit greenwood again! Thx for everything!

In Korean,
Everything we needed was there! Shampoo, conditioner, warm bed, pool table, simple food for breakfast! And there was a lake in front of the house, so I really felt like I was able to rest in a family home! When I visit again, I think I'll check if I can sleep here!! And, it was separate from the upstairs, so I didn't notice it even if it was a little busy eating at night! I recommend it!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time. The space was incredible and Anne stocked the fridge with everything we needed for breakfast or snacks the few days we were there. Can't wait to go back again!
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I LOVED staying at Misty Meadows! It was defiantly a home away from home experience. Ann was a wonderful host and made us feel right at home. I knew she was a simple phone call or text away if I needed anything. The property is beautiful! I visit Greenwood often and will definitely be returning to Misty Meadows.
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Misty Meadows is a wonderful spot to stay. You can feel the love in all of the details. The space is beautiful and private. It is more like an apartment than a bnb. Everything was clean and the bed is very comfortable. The hosts are kind and will check to make sure everything is satisfactory.
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann was very kind. She provided me different breakfast options. The basement was very clean. I felt very safe staying there.
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann made us feel welcomed each week we stayed at Misty Meadows! My husband and I came back for a second and third time as I was attending classes at Lander. It was the perfect place to come ""home"" to after a day full of learning. Ann was very kind and hospitable, checking in with us to see what we wanted for breakfast each week and providing yummy ""study time"" snacks. Misty Meadows is a beautiful green property with a pond that can be see from the apartment. Perfect view to start your day. = ) It is beautiful to walk around the property in the early morning just as the sun is coming up. There are flowers all around the entrance to the apartment and most of them had a tag indicating what type of flower they were. This was really special to me because I love flowers and I can't wait to start my very first garden. The flowers was such a welcome and provided additional comforts of ""home"". Peaceful and private is how I would continue to describe Misty Meadows. Even though the apartment is shared with the main house, our stay was quiet and relaxing. Thanks Ann!"
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were just here last week, but this time for the weekend. We enjoyed walking around the pond, visiting the dogs and cat and petting the horse and looking at the chickens. Wow, 3.7 miles from our in-town destination and we felt like we were miles away in the country. Great place to stay and wonderful host."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very pleasant stay at Misty Meadows in a tastefully decorated basement room/apartment. The fridge was well stocked with breakfast items and everything mentioned in the description was correct. The view of the pond from the basement apartment is wonderful. Ann was very helpful processing in and out of the private basement room and the washer/dryer was an added plus for our stay.
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ann made us feel so welcome from the very beginning of our stay to the end! = ) She was responded very quickly to all of my questions before our stay. Her home is beautiful, cozy, comfortable and full of joy right down to the smallest details ( chocolate by the bed and delicate varieties of body and hand soap). We had a fridge well stocked for breakfast and light night cravings. She even asked us what we would prefer for breakfast before we arrived! How sweet was that? The grounds were beautiful and it was so peaceful to wake up and see the water before starting our day. We are very excited about the next time we stay at Misty Meadows!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Enjoyed my second week's stay at Misty Meadows!
2016-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Staying at Misty Meadows feels like a real retreat. The space is private and scenic. I definitely enjoyed meeting Ann who made me feel so comfortable while I was new to the area. She is not only a wealth of information but goes above and beyond to ensure that I was comfortable during my stay. She allows you privacy to enjoy the space while being accessible in case of anything. This was the perfect decision for me as a contract employee at Self Regional Healthcare- an easy drive away. I'm grateful to have found this unique spot in Greenwood!
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We let Ann know that we would be arriving late. She had the lights on for us and met upon arrival to show us around and let us know about the well-stocked refrigerator for our breakfast. Everything was great! See my two earlier reviews for details.
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We liked it so much that we came back for a second stay when we returned to Greenwood. And Ann had made improvements to an already great place. You will not be disappointed if you stay here. Lovely country location. Convenient to town. Nicely stocked with breakfast items.
2015-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Misty Meadows Air bnb! Such a comfortable bed, and a cozy area to wake up and have coffee while enjoying the beautiful view! You are a great host. I'm so glad we decided to stay here!"
2015-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My Airbnb stay at Misty Meadows was exceptional! Ann is a fantastic host! The accommodations were very clean and the view was gorgeous! I would definitely recommend Misty Meadows Airbnb to anyone looking for a down home style atmosphere!
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Ann was very accommodating in regards to breakfast and beverage items. The living space was amazing with all the conveniences of home while the property was equally incredible with the pastures and lake just outside the door. The location is a beautiful country setting that makes you feel like you are many miles from city life, but in reality it is only a couple miles from good restaurants and shopping. Thanks David and Ann for welcoming me into your home!"
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had repeat business in Greenwood so I definitely wanted to stay here again. Again, a wonderful experience ! Ann makes it feel like home away from home!"
2015-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Host welcomed us upon arrival and made sure we had everything we needed even though our stay was a last minute event! Very safe and beautiful location too! Loved the availability of a pack n'play for our baby, as well as a washer/dryer. Great place- would definitely go back."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, you can‚Äôt ask for a better place to stay. We only spent one night here while in Greenwood, but it would have been a pleasure to stay for a few days, if we had the time. The apartment space is large and well-kept, the bed was comfortable and the country surroundings were quiet and peaceful. The refrigerator is nicely stocked for a light breakfast or evening snack. The grounds are beautiful. The property is only a short drive into town, but feels a world away. Ann is a welcoming hostess and very helpful with tips about the Greenwood area. I would highly recommend a stay here."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our hosts at Misty Meadows were wonderful, warm, and welcoming. The photos do not do the place justice. Gorgeous location! It was such a treat to stay at such a lovely suite overlooking the meadow, woods and lake. Ann paid attention to every little detail and makes you feel like a personal guest. Very comfortable bedroom and area to lounge in the evening while watching tv, reading or playing games. We were not in need of anything, the refrigerator was stocked with all sorts of breakfast items, fresh pastries from a local bakery and even snacks for evening cravings. We will definitely come back and stay with them again and again! Great location for a Lander University parent like us to stay while visiting."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our hostess, Ann, was wonderful. Everything was warm and welcoming. She thought of everything! It was very comfortable and spacious. The property was great! My husband and I took a walk around the pond. We also sat outside with our coffee. A lovely experience!"
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a delightful time at Misty Meadows. Ann was very welcoming, friendly, helpful and quick to respond with communication.
The accommodations are really terrific. It is both spaciously well-appointed and private with a beautiful view of a large pond, pasture and woods. The small kitchenette was thoughtfully stocked. The bed was super comfortable and the bedroom had some very effective room darkening blinds.
Overall, my wife and I couldn't have been more pleased with our stay and we would definitely rebook there on our next visit to Greenwood."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've been to many Air Bnb's and I can honestly say that Ane's home tops the charts. She's thought of everything, not even kidding. Super friendly, clean, amenities like you wouldn't believe. If you're anywhere even remotely close to this one, do yourself a favor and reserve this one! I have a feeling that once word gets out about this place it will be booked up for months at a time. The scenery is spectacular. The home is Pinterest perfect. Ane is gracious and helpful. This is an Air Bnb experience that can't be beat."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a peaceful weekend getaway at Justin & Emily's place! They were extremely accommodating and helpful. The loft was comfy and cleaned spotless. We would love to stay again in the future!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting me for the weekend Justin and Emily! I appreciated your hospitality and your responsive communication during my stay. Greenville is such a peaceful and calming area and was the perfect retreat after finishing my law school exams!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Justin and Emily were wonderful hosts! They were very responsive, eager to share resources with us, and were super thoughtful-- from having our own YouTube TV channel, to printing a list of local restaurants in the area with contact info, addresses, and menus. They even reached out to their neighbors for us so that we could pet their lambs. The space was beautiful, both inside and outside, and we felt so welcome. We would strongly recommend Justin and Emily's space for anyone looking to stay in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, peaceful, && clean place!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Justin & Emily's AirBnb. This a beautiful, quiet location in the country with space to walk, relax, & enjoy solitude. My husband and I are both 6' tall, but we had plenty of headspace, even in the bathroom. We were in the area for a wedding, so only had time to explore one coffee shop in Abbeville (Main Street Coffee Co.). Great place for coffee! We enjoyed our stay at Justin & Emily's & would definitely recommend it."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay overall was very good. We would recommend this location! We stayed 2 nights and on our first night, a dog was outside the house barking and howling for several hours and that kept my husband up. But we messaged the hosts the next morning and they let us know right away that they'd be sure to keep their dog inside in case that was him making the noise. (We cant fault them if it was a neighbor's dog though!) And the second night, there was no dog noise, so we slept well. The room was as pictured with the full bathroom and kitchenette and my husband appreciated the Keurig coffee machine and K-cups! The closet had extra blankets (thank you!) and extra pillows and other items you may need while traveling. The bathroom was stocked with several bath and body products as well. The area is farmland and was quite beautiful and within close driving distance to restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries. All in all, great!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Justin and Emily were great about communication before my arrival, went out of their way to get the place ready early (even though I just needed to drop my bags), and are incredibly friendly and welcoming. The property is beautiful, guest space very clean and exactly as described, and the town of Abbeville is charming. The window a/c does a good job of cooling the space, but it's a little noisy when it turns on, so if you're a light sleeper, I'd recommend using the ceiling fan instead at night."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location and great hosts! Justin and Emily responded quickly to any questions and had some great recommendations for the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place, well worth it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily and Justin were great hosts (kind, helpful, and communicative), and their guest house was perfect for a relaxing weekend getaway! We loved getting to swim and enjoy the quiet of the countryside while only being 25 minutes outside of Greenwood."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"...Incredible week at Justin & Emily's! I needed time and space for a personal retreat, and I found the perfect place. There was plenty of solitude and peace, and also an invitation to join their family pool night if I felt like it. J&E were happy to chat and recommend activities, or let me have space - whatever I needed. There are gorgeous, open pastures nearby, a short private road, and a long quiet one. Take as many walks as you want, swim in the awesome pool, soak in the sunshine, or sit quietly in the woods - there is a forest of lovely trees right outside your private entry, and a small table with chairs. You can enjoy the swing or sit and journal at the picnic table and look across the fields, have a glass of wine and watch the sun set. Just beautiful!
...The room itself is fantastic. Awesome bed, reading chair, terrific shower, and clean in every way. Some basic kitchen items to make things easy. Extremely comfortable, quiet, and well-appointed! Great parking spot and private door a few feet away.
...Justin & Emily were great communicators and responded to any question or need that I had, promptly and with generosity.
As far as places off the property:
- I spent an evening watching the sun set at Calhoun Falls State Park (an easy drive <30 mins). Definitely now one of my favorite places. Very undeveloped; natural views and huge skies every direction. Almost empty when I was there, but there's a day-use area for families to swim and picnic.
- Downtown Abbeville is 10 mins away and charming. Excellent bakery and vintage store on Washington street.
- Check out the dairy nearby, Southern Oaks Jersey Farm & Creamery (5 mins) for a cash-only grab & go. They have raw milk, choc milk, fresh ice cream (!) and fresh butter. So good. The jersey cows are beautiful.
Sweet, sweet family. Great hosts. I had everything I needed, and some lovely surprises."

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I never got a chance to meet John and Emily because my stay was only 2 nights and 2 days and we were on different schedules, but they were responsive to my questions before I got there and gave me directions and information.
The place wasn't as clean as all the reviews said, especially the bathroom. Perhaps because I came in a weird season.
However, the property was beautiful, and I fell in love with their small black dog."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Justin & Emily‚Äôs home is the perfect place for a relaxing getaway. My bf and I traveled up from south FL to visit the gem mine nearby and we really enjoyed our stay. The property is sooo pretty and not near a main road so you can actually experience some peace and quiet! The Airbnb was very clean and exactly as pictured. They provided us with coffee, snacks, and water upon arrival which was nice after such a long ride. They also have two *adorable* pups that are super friendly and I was so sad to say goodbye to them. ):
Overall, we were really pleased with our stay and couldn‚Äôt recommend Justin & Emily‚Äôs home enough! Thank you again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Justin and Emily are the ultimate hosts. They have thought everything to make the stay in the loft perfect!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was like visiting friends. We appreciated their warm hospitality from correspondence to personal check-in, to the thoughtful amenities in the room. Our trip was only a quick overnight, but we would certainly recommend it for longer stays. In bleak February, we couldn't take advantage of their beautiful property like we would have in the warmer months."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Justin and Emily were awesome hosts! The apartment was super clean and stocked with all needed supplies for a perfect stay. It was quiet and set in a beautiful area. Hosts were responsive and friendly. Their two children are adorable. The two dogs were precious too.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a comfy and cozy place to stay. Surrounded by beautiful farmlands. Great place to get away!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again it was an excellent stay. Justin and Emily's family was so helpful and friendly (including the furry four-legged girls--I enjoyed giving them hugs and rubdowns). But they were also willing to give me the space to come and go as necessary. And the Gingeriches did a great job at keeping everything clean, comfortable, and well maintained. I couldn't have asked for a more relaxing several nights. The sunrises and sunsets, from either at the end of their drive or from between trees on their property, were memorable. Will gladly stay there again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Justin and Emily have a wonderful property. Everything was clean and tidy and very cozy. They were more than accommodating and had great communication! Highly recommend staying, we know we will be back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This host family did a great job with the space above their garage for guests. Their listed information and pictures clearly indicated the natural beauty of the setting where they live. Items inside were well marked or positioned for ease of use. At first I wondered how the shower's water spray and curtain would be affected by the roof pitch, but it worked well.
The kitchen area conveniences were very nice. Custom-made furniture and tiling were great. Two super friendly dogs welcomed me each time I came and left. This family helped me feel at ease as I began adjusting to a new job in a new community."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, quaint getaway. Perfect to relax and rewind. My partner and I really enjoyed the seclusion, as well as the comfy bed and equipped kitchenette. Justin and Emily were so sweet and their dog Darla was our favorite to hangout with! About 2 hours from North Carolina mountains, and only an hour from Greenville & Columbia. We will be back for sure!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Justin and Emily's place is in an absolute beautiful setting and they are tremendous hosts.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was as delighted with my stay at Justin & Emily's Peaceful Secluded Loft as I hoped I would be. The loft (or garage apartment) accommodations were clean, comfortable, homey, and as well-appointed as any mid to upper range hotel (but without the sterile atmosphere!). But it was the grounds and setting that really charmed me. I loved that their home and loft are nestled in the woods alongside a scenic pasture. And I also love what they've done to enhance their outdoor space to enjoy the beauty of God's creation. I really appreciated their porch swing, tree swing, fire ring, pool with its pasture view, party lights and cobbled outdoor dining patio. My travelling companion is Jewish and after prayers we enjoyed the most memorable Shabbat (Sabbath) dinner eating outdoors al fresco. The cows serenading us and the majestic stars in the night sky created such a fitting environment for us to leave behind the cares of the secular world and greet the sacred. It truly was the highlight of our entire trip! I recommend this place as a location for a spiritual retreat or just an escape from the maddening world. As I overlooked the cattle in the pasture while doing my evening prayer I rejoiced in the simple things in life that never change! Thank you Justin & Emily for sharing your portion of paradise!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed this place so much! It was a very quiet and comfortable place as well as affordable! Definitely felt stress-free and relaxed. The pool is absolute amazing and seeing the sunset üåÖ was so beautiful! Emily and Justin were very sweet and helpful in anything that we needed. I would definitely recommend going to the drive-in movie theater in Greenwood! üíì
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If your in the Abbeville area please choose to have your stay with Justin & Emily. Their home and amenities are second to none. Their very accommodating and always kept an open line of communication. Their home was very clean and cozy. Their bed and bed sheets are from another universe of comfort! It made getting out of bed very difficult üòä. If your looking for a place where you have space to yourself and be alone but have a hometown feel please pick this place. Only minutes away from a great downtown area with great restaurants and an Opera house. Only 30 minutes away from a drive inn theater. Their location is in small town so us visitors stuck out but everyone was very friendly and polite and even thanked us for visiting their town. Very much family friendly. We look forward to coming again. Thank you Justin & Emily.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I fully enjoyed our stay at Justin and Emily‚Äôs loft. It was so cozy and quaint, perfect for a weekend getaway!

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking for a great house to spend a quiet weekend with friends or family and have access to the lake, this is the perfect place. We had a family member graduating from Lander University and this house was an easy commute to Lander and had plenty of space for the entire family. We used the kitchen to cook a celebration dinner and all of the equipment was in good working order. Having double ovens was a bonus! The pool table downstairs and the games all got a lot of use as well. Some of us bought some nightcrawlers and minnows from the bait shop down the street and tried our luck at fishing from the dock. Caught a few fish and saw a lot of good size bass. Would definitely book this house again if we end up in the area for fun or for another graduation. The hosts were also amazing with their instructions and responsiveness!"

We used the grill on the porch one night with an amazingly peaceful view of the lake. We even saw the end of a rainbow! The beds were large and very accommodating to large families with children. One room even had a walk in closet which was perfect as a ‚Äúnursery‚Äù for one of our babes. Seriously book this! You won‚Äôt regret it. We never left our entire stay."

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,highly recommend. Great host and a great place to stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The photos did not give this beautiful lake home justice! My spouse and I are both in the Air Force and travel a lot due to work. We always overpack just to make sure we have everything we need. While staying here we didn‚Äôt need all our extra items. The house came with bottled water, snacks, different types of coffee pods, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The list doesn‚Äôt stop there, the laundry room also had detergent and bleach. My ultimate favorite item the house offered was the throw blanket in the master bedroom! I was able to use it to cuddle in the living room and relax in the back deck watching the sunset. Lastly, after check out (an hour and a half away from the house) I noticed that I had left my wedding rings in the Airbnb. I quickly called the host. She calmed me down and ensured my rings would be there. An hour and a half later, I arrived back to the house and found all my rings, just as she had said.
I will definitely book again and highly recommend you stay!"

Having the downstairs pool table/ rec room area was a hit with the kids! They spent plenty of time down by the water as well. This house was well stocked, including the kitchen and bathrooms. I definitely would recommend this stay to friends & we may be back! Love Lake Greenwood!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The host was quick with responses and wonderful with accommodations. We have stayed many places and this house was more equipped then any other.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was lovely and very spacious! The kitchen was also surprisingly well stocked, which made making a big breakfast for my whole family so much easier. This has nothing to do with the host at all, but I do just have to warn those visiting during the summer months not to set anything on the ground outside for more than a few moments unless you want to battle a swarm of biting ants for it! I made that mistake with my kayak and didn‚Äôt check before launching off the dock. Let‚Äôs just say that there was a frantic paddle back to shore! üòÇ"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful place to stay! It was even nicer than we hoped it would be. The kitchen is spacious and so clean. We enjoyed the spacious master bedroom suite with its huge closet and comfortable bed. The open floor plan with the large dining table and living room area was nice, allowing our family to get to be together. We played some of the many board games as well as pool, and the fisherman in the family caught several fish from the dock while the rest of us watched him from the deck. We never needed anything from Host Kristin, but she responded immediately when we let her know we‚Äôd arrived and that everything looked great. I have no doubt that if there had been any issues, she would have resolved them quickly. We hope to return soon!!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Book this! You will not regret it! Kristin has thought of everything. Equipped with everything in the kitchen, lots of games, a fun pool table and big kitchen table for large groups. The view was amazing from every deck! Perfect location on the lake, we highly recommend renting a boat from twin rivers, so worth it!"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Waterloo provided a welcome retreat venue for our group meeting. It is well-stocked, nicely decorated and furnished, and has a lovely view of the water. The large sectional sofa in the living room and beds in each bedroom were all quite comfortable and relaxing. The kitchen was well stocked for meal preparations and the pool table and games in the basement were an added plus! The host was easy to communicate with and the price was reasonable. We were not disappointed!"

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Well decorated, clean, spacious and gorgeous lake views! It was a pleasure to have this house for 5 days with our grown children. If you are a cook, this place is for you! If you like very comfortable beds and HGTV homes, this place is for you. If you like to sit on your back deck and gaze at the lake, guess what! This place is for you!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This lake house was one of our favorite Airbnbs, and we have stayed in, and we have stayed in many! The openness of the house was fantastic and the views of the lake from the inside and upper deck were wonderful. The natural light during the day was fantastic. The neighborhood was quiet and there are no other houses close to the place. The house was super clean.The kitchen is fully stocked with all you need to cook great meals. We didn‚Äôt go out to eat once. It is a short 20 minute drive to Greenwood which has everything one could need including a Publix and several restaurants. There is also a convenience store very close by. The TVs are well-placed, and the L-shaped sofa was great for lounging. This place is great for large groups, and the master bedroom was a perfect size with a comfortable bed, great bathroom, and plenty of closet space. This house has everything including a full-size washer and dryer, tons of games to play, and a pool table! We didn‚Äôt use the downstairs much as there were only two of us, but the size of the upstairs and the layout gave us plenty of space to move around and could be a complete house on its own. Kristin was a great host. We never saw her personally, but she kept in touch and made sure we had everything we needed. She answered questions very quickly and was very kind. I highly recommend this place, and we will be back. Thanks, Kristin for your generosity and making such a beautiful retreat!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I never ever write reviews. However, this home is worthy of my time to write about this awesome place. The owners have thought of everything one would need from your morning shower to your last glass of wine before you go to bed. The bedrooms are awesome with large beds that are so comfy. The kids room with the bunk beds, TV and tent was just right. The game area with the beautiful pool table and board games were an excellent touch for the kids and adults. The three outside seating areas are perfect. The appliances are modern and very useful. The art work in the rooms are just perfect. The lighting and fans are perfect. The thermostat was so easy to use. There are so many small things that the owners took time to include like shampoo and conditioner, washing powder, pizza pan, seasoning to cook with, cookies sheets and tons and tons of towels that allows you to know that the owners really want you to enjoy your stay and not have to worry about anything. You can cook any meal as the home is equipped with a variety of pots, pans and appliances. The view of the lake is magnificent. The home is just PERFECT! I don‚Äôt want to leave!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Old Soul Treehouse was wonderful. It is such a lovely place for rest and relaxation. Everything was exactly as described and we loved the peace and quiet. I would definitely go back again and will be recommending it to friends.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I honeymooned here and it was the perfect escape from reality! Long days with beautiful weather, peaceful surroundings, and absolutely nothing on our itinerary other than spending quality time together. The place is truly every bit as gorgeous as the photos. Like it was right from a fairytale! We loved reading about the treehouse‚Äôs story and the origins of the pieces used in the design as well as the burger recommendation at Harris Landing. The place comes stocked with pretty much anything you could need though we would highly recommend bug spray and/or a citronella candle to keep the bugs away! Wonderful and responsive host. Hope to be back to celebrate wedding anniversaries in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my husband thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the lake is beautiful, peaceful, and calming. The treehouse is such a fun and cozy environment! Kristin was incredibly helpful and quickly responsive with any questions we had. I‚Äôm sure we will be back to visit!"

She‚Äôs a wonderful host and very responsive to your needs. I would highly recommend.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tried this place out for our honeymoon, and we absolutely fell in love with it. It is the most beautiful Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The location is amazing. There‚Äôs houses around but it‚Äôs still very private. My favorite thing about it is how peaceful it is. You have the option to close or open the windows, there‚Äôs window covers that are remote controlled if you want it more private. It just feels so romantic. There‚Äôs a few spots close by that are really cute if you want to go out to dinner. Overall it‚Äôs just an amazing place to stay. We will be back every year for our anniversary!
The host is very kind and you can tell she loves what she does. If you‚Äôre thinking about staying, do it! You won‚Äôt regret it!"

We loved everything about this place! Don‚Äôt think twice, book it or don‚Äôt so I can ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our time at Old Soul Treehouse! Loved all the neat places to relax, getting sun and fishing from the dock, and enjoyed the hot tub in the evenings! The interior was smaller than I pictured, but it was perfect for two people!

""We really enjoyed our stay at The Old Soul Treehouse. It is such a beautiful place! Made such a peaceful and romantic ""mini honeymoon."" We really enjoyed listening to the record player, opening the kitchen window, and eating dinner at the outside bar. The hot tub was a nice touch, and Kristin made sure that it stayed clean for us the entire time. We wouldn't have wanted to spend our wedding night anywhere else!"""
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was beautiful getaway, the treehouse had a wonderful feel. The windows across from the bed so you can watch the view from the comfort of the bed is fantastic.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for a wonderful weekend. The little sentiments, such as the Bluetooth/lantern speaker, the record player, candle, bathtub tray, robes and snacks were well beyond hospitable. Those little touches truly made the stay even more pleasurable. My husband and I rented a pontoon, sat on the dock, relaxed downstairs on the swing, soaked in the hot tub and enjoyed the peace and quiet. The book that Kristen leaves for you with suggestions for your stay including restaurants, boat rentals and more doesn‚Äôt leave you questioning not one thing! I highly suggest this property along with the 5 star host. She is above and beyond what anyone could ask for. Book the stay, you won‚Äôt regret it!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This may be the cutest/best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I absolutely loved everything about the furnishings and decor.
Here are my favorite things:
‚Ä¢ I was expecting a little guest house that was essentially in someone‚Äôs backyard, so when I arrived here, I was surprised & thrilled. This little place has it‚Äôs own little lot entirely. The host‚Äôs home is visible from the driveway, but at least a football field‚Äôs distance away. So no awkward, accidental run ins, but they are close enough to be able to address/fix an issue should one arise. LOVE this.
‚Ä¢ The front porch is such a great touch. Not only is it huge, but there‚Äôs a grill, a little sitting area, and even cute little string lights.
‚Ä¢ There are 3 high-tech, wall-mounted AC/Heat units in this little place, so it is super easy to achieve/adjust your perfect temperature in each room.
+ many more!!
I would 100% stay again. I actually wish I could rent it entirely for the duration nursing contract. Such a great little place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My expectations were met. Beautiful home with everything you need. Felt like you were at home. Everything was beautiful. If we could give it 10 starts we would‚Äôve had.

Great location, very clean, comfy beds, had everything we needed and helpful hosts.
One of my favorite Airbnb‚Äôs!!!!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house in quiet area. Short drive to any restaurants/shopping. Extremely clean and well maintained. Communication was excellent and would definitely recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for Senior Lacrosse Day at Lander University, and we had scheduled events Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the inaugural group of graduating seniors who started the Women's Lacrosse program in 2019. It was awesome to have such a comfortable place to come back to each afternoon and evening to rest and get ready for the next event. The Little White House is one of the most comfortable and best Airbnb's I've stayed in. Everything about the home and the location was perfection. I was even able to safely get in a 4-mile run in the neighborhood right beside this property. I will be back next month for my second stay. I highly recommend The Little White House if you have a student at Lander University or if you are in town for a wedding or any kind of celebration!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful little White House! It is even better than pictured because the small details (charging stations on both sides of the bed, nice linens, coffee pods and creamers, etc etc) are hard to capture a picture of. We love to stay in Airbnb‚Äôs and have stayed in many‚Ä¶.this was top-notch. Chase was super quick to respond, the location is very close to downtown, and the golf course, which is why we were there, to watch our daughter play.
Although the little house is on property with the hosts, it is very private and quiet‚Ä¶
If you‚Äôre in Greenwood, grab this lovely home.
We definitely will if our daughter plays there again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are thrilled that we found this cute place to stay as we prepare to move to Greenwood. It was better than a hotel with its space, privacy, cleanliness and ease of access !"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chase was a responsive and flexible host. The listing is accurate, and the place was very clean and well maintained with modern, functional amenities.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at Andrew‚Äôs place. We had the max allowed people, and it never felt crowded or too loud. Having two living spaces was great, kids downstairs and adults up for TV watching. There were plenty of dishes, cups, glasses, and both glass and plastic ones which was really nice. Beds were comfortable and bedding nice. The place was close enough to big water, but on a really quiet cove with deep water. The back railing of dock was removed (not shown in current pictures), making it perfect for jumping into the lake. Bring your own beach towels and lake toys.
Before we made the trip, Andrew told us about an issue with a couple bedrooms that could potentially leak. There was rain in the forecast, so we were a bit hesitant. However, we never had an issue and it rained hard several times. I appreciated Andrew being forthcoming with the information.
We are already planning to stay here next year!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our family gathering and we want to book again next year! It slept everyone comfortably, with plenty of shared spaces, and the kitchen was nicely equipped for preparing food for our crew!

It's also super convenient to a ton of public land in the area. The house itself was super clean and had everything we needed for a great weekend besides food and drinks. The wife loved all the decorations as well. Communication was also great with Josh the entire time and answered any questions we had pretty quickly.

An overall wonderful stay and we would definitely reach out for our next trips up there.Thank you,Vinetta!"

The home looked just like the photos and was so cozy and comfortable. The house was clean and fully stocked in the kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry room. The gazebo in the backyard was a bonus area of peace and quiet and this home was located 5 min from a grocery store, 10 min from Walmart, and 20 min from the event venue we were in town for. I will definitely look up Serenity Cottage when I come back to the area again. Plus, she had a hand-written note and a custom welcome sign for us. Just a really lovely space! We all enjoyed it!"

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I don‚Äôt have enough good things to say about Serenity Cottage! Vinetta has really gone the extra mile to make her guests feel like they‚Äôre at home. The beds are outrageously comfortable - we overslept by about 3 hours on our first day because we just couldn‚Äôt get out of bed! The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the living room was the perfect spot to lay around and recoup in between activities. Vinetta even left us brochures with things to do in town! Greenwood, by the way, turned out to be more a vacation destination than we were expecting!! We were just in town for a wedding, but we absolutely fell in love with this sweet little town. Their downtown area is full of locally owned shops and amazing restaurants. If we could do it over again, we would book an additional day just to have time to explore the town.
Overall, we were so pleased with Serenity Cottage! You won‚Äôt regret booking this sweet AirBnB!"
