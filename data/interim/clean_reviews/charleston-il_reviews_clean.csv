2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful and relaxing accommodation. Tim and Joanie thought of everything down to the little details. Communication was excellent. The restaurant suggestions were spot on. We hope to stay again. Thank you for creating and sharing this peaceful space!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a place to stay for an investigation and the place was so nice, so private, so peaceful that we hope to go back not for another regular trip but just to stay there for a few days and unwind. Top spot. Couldn’t ask for better."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Joanie's place is very charming. We loved every moment of our stay. They were flexible with the check in and wanted to know that we had got checked in. The setting is very peaceful and private. I recommend going on walk around the property. If you follow the gravel road past the house you will find a nice sitting area. My husband left his watch and they mailed it to us. Would definitely stay again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. Very comfortable and clean house. We loved everything about this place. Tim and Joanie were amazing hosts and they took care of everything we could have needed!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean and peaceful place, 10 min drive to EIU, even closer to hiking. Tim and Joanie are good communicators and have thought of just about everything. I would stay here again. Just a note that the stairs are very sturdy but narrow and steep. We had no issues but I would recommend slippers with non slip soles for the stairs and for the cool tile on the first floor. Thanks for an enjoyable stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this place! No corners were cut. The space is pleasantly creative and unique. The beds are super comfy and we prepared several meals in the kitchen and found everything we needed for them. Hubby was please with desk set up in loft. 16-year old loved the ping pong table, swing chairs on the porch and the cubby bunk (the right bunk in the photos, behind the partial wall).
The setting is beautiful too. The trees in the photo aren't just forest but dramatic ravines that lead to the Embarras River. We didn't spend as much time in Charleston as we wanted but we second Tim and Joanie's recommendation of Siam Thai. We definitely want to return!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very peaceful, quiet and relaxing. Very beautiful shouse!!! Felt right at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was amazing!!! Very peaceful location and gave us that ""at home feel"" . Very clearly outlined directions to get to the Airbnb and instructions once inside , along with recommendations for the area and things to do were all greatly appreciated . We stayed with our 4 children and never felt cramped . The special touches to help make families create memories like game area , ping pong table , and fire pit were amazing. Our children loved the swings and sitting around at night playing games together .
We would definitely stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect cozy cabin for a weekend in the woods
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place felt like home! It was so comfortable and super clean. There was a personal note, hand written on custom fine art stationary, with great information about the area included. My husband is a professional artist so the small gesture and gift was much appreciated. We stayed in multiple places during our time in Illinois, but Tim & Joanie were the kindest and most communicative hosts. Everything you could need and more was available for use here. The cozy and spacious Barndominium is great for both shorter and longer stays. It was close to amenities yet quiet and private. Beautiful kept property. Highly recommend."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed for EIU’s family weekend. Perfect location and very charming. We had the most relaxing & peaceful time here. Communication was great & very prompt. We will for sure stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a really fun place to stay. It had a unique setup with the bedrooms upstairs in the loft. The home was clean and well equipped. It was wonderful to have a location away from noise an chaos. There were even deer that visited in the morning.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay as long as you like country living. definitely not a downtown setting, but you can see than in the pictures. Can't wait to stay there again next time we come to the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks for the hospitality! Our stay was comfortable and peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is even better than the pictures and descriptions. So peaceful and quiet. We saw deer several times while our drinking coffee in the mornings. Close to lots of local attractions and restaurants
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is too cool. The pictures don’t do this place justice. It’s very secluded, quite and very peaceful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific stay! The space worked great for us — we enjoyed watching the deer and birds in the morning. And so close to EIU to drop off. Really appreciated the information Tim and Joanie provided, we explored Arthur after reading about it. Love to stay again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts. Found something in drive that was ours and brought to where we were. Great host will stay again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim and Joanie's rural ""Barndominium"" was a real diamond in the rough -- peaceful and cozy, yet modern -- with lots of charm and amenities. My wife and I were returning to central Illinois to celebrate her grandmother's 100th birthday, and once we decided to have an extended stay to visit with family for longer than the party, we were please to stumble on Tim & Joanie's rural hideaway as a place to come back to each evening after a day of visiting, shopping and celebrating. Tim & Joanie greeted and welcomed us before we arrived, sharing very user friendly check-in instructions -- and they were always responsive if we needed to communicate with them. Instead of staying in a hotel room for roughly the same price, we got to enjoy an expanded home space and the peace and quiet that comes with Illinois country living. Coming from a Virginia community where we see lots of deer in our local wooded habitat, it was very cool to see lots of deer nestling in the grassy and wooded areas here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriends and I stayed here for a weekend getaway. It was perfect for us and loved being away from everything. It’s very secluded with amazing porch swings. Drive to town is about 15 min which was no problem for us. The beds were so comfortable too.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome Decor and super peaceful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Though short it was a great break in our travels. Leaving the interstate and driving to their place was good for our being. A space to breathe
The place too is beautiful and accommodated the 6 of us well"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was very nice, and the property was beautiful. Coming back in January, may give you a call."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think for up to 6 people, peaceful, spacious acreage and as nice as most peoples homes, $100 a night beats any hotel accommodations and most bnbs. Everything and more is right there for you to enjoy. Best bnb for me so far.....and I'm pretty picky."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tim and Joanie have thought of everything! Our stay at their place was flawless, and we would for sure stay again. Everything was clean, the property was beautiful, and the house had anything and everything you could need. The game area, and art supplies was a huge plus!! We were in town for our children’s dirt bike race, and after 3 long days at the track each evening we looked forward to going back to their oasis! It’s truly is a gem, and they were great hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tim and Joanie's place was a perfect retreat for our family weekend getaway. The home is spotless and is well stocked with useful amenities. The clever layout of the living spaces worked well for our family. We had beautiful weather so we were able to spend a lot of time in the yard and enjoyed relaxing in the porch swings, eating at the picnic table, and playing bags and ping pong. We highly recommend this Airbnb - great hosts and a great home :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tim and Joanie's place is phenomenal.
Place is sparkling clean, beds are super confortable, and communication was top.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I felt right at home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We didn't actually make it due to an unforseen travel disruption on our end. But Michael and Linda were kind and understanding. The communication was good. We would book again in the future and appreciate their responsiveness.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,It was an amazing stay I wouldn’t definitely stay again!!!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We almost always stay at one or the other of Michael's and Linda's properties on our way to and returning from visiting our daughter in Kansas City, Missouri. Both of their homes are always spotlessly clean and comfortable. It's our home away from home. Mike and Linda are gracious and responsive hosts who are always ready to help. You can book either of their homes with confidence that you will have a great experience."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful home. We really enjoyed our stay. Looking forward to next year's trip.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed staying at Cozy Corner. It is so nice to see affordable places to stay in Greenup. In the past we have had to go to Effingham and stay at a hotel so having a home with all the privacy, quiet and space was perfect. We visit Greenup frequently and mostly stay with family, but this time we had a family reunion and needed a place to stay. This worked perfectly.
I definitely recommend this home for a family to stay in. It is clean, has great amenities such as a full kitchen, laundry, and is a nice quite place to stay. We only needed one bedroom, so we used a 2nd one for suitcases / dressing and still had an extra 3rd bedroom. It would work great for a family."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very nice, clean and homey place to stay. Unfortunately we arrived very late .... pretty much just to stop and sleep for the night and we were back on the road by 8ish the next morning.
This place is as described and right off the highway. Great hosts, they were both very pleasant and proactive in communication. I would definitely stay here again :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super clean and great for our family of 4 for an overnight stay! Everything we needed was there! We will be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little home was the perfect stop for us. It was clean, comfortable and convenient. We will be staying here on future road trips!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you was good

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, great to work with. I was able to host a dinner for a few family members. I will definitely rent again. Some of the family members were interested in sharing with their family members from out of town."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything you would want, need and expect!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy Corner was just as described. The home was very comfortable and clean. It was very much like staying in a friend's home.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place, easy highway access. We have stayed here twice now as we travel across country on family vacations. A nice little home away from home, and we will stay there if our travels take us that way again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ill admit that theres not much in the way of restaurants and shopping in greenup but our stay was because we were surprising my mother in Effingham for her birthday so we are pretty familiar with the greater area. This house perfectly accommodated my siblings and I. The place was super clean and had cute decor. Beds were soft and comfortable and plenty of towels and linens available. We really were only at the house to sleep and spent most of our time in Effingham but I would definitely rent again. The time spent there we dod get the opportunity to play some family board games and they had some games available to us as well as the ones we brought.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, as advertised! Our stay was very pleasant. Can't complain about a single thing!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Suited our needs perfectly.
Be back for sure"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at both of Michael’s places in Greenup several times. Every time, the accommodations are clean and comfortable and have everything we need and Mike and Linda are friendly and responsive hosts.
I Imagine, as long as our daughter lives in Kansas City, Missouri, and we live in West Virginia, we will continue to stay in one of Michael’s and Linda’s homes on our trips to Kansas, as they both are very conveniently located just off of Route 70 and about halfway between our home and our daughter’s.
Thanks, Mike and Linda, once again, for a wonderful experience."

Diane Allen & Family"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very pleased with the house & our stay! Michael & Linda were very responsive to any questions or concerns we had. It felt very warm & welcoming from the moment my Wife & I first saw it! It felt very homey & comfortable from the outside & inside! We appreciated the recommendation to explore the town of Casey which was only 9 miles away. It was home to the worlds largest mailbox, pencil, barber shop pole, ruler, knitting needle, bird cage, etc! My Wife & I walked around with eyes as big as half dollars looking at everything !
We were dismayed though that the house did not have a dishwasher though. I didn’t pay attention when booking the house that it didn’t list having one. The bed in the first bedroom sagged in the middle so my Wife & I slept very close to each other…more so than usual.🙂 Also the two recliners in the living room were uncomfortable…not as plush as they look. If we ever get that way again we would love to stay at the Cozy Corner again! Highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house. Accommodating host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay very much and will book this house again on our next trip! Thank you!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Came her for a niece's graduation with my siblings. So nice to have plenty of room. We hit a couple of local restaurants and bars. Friendly community. We will be back here again. Much cheaper than staying in local motel when more than one couple.

We have family in Greenup, and now that we have grown in size with the kids, we need a larger space. The travel from north of Boston can make for a long day of flights and driving. This checked all the boxes, and there was even a pack & play in the closet. What a surprise! This is our new ""go to"" home when we come out to visit Greenup. It was so nice and the kids slept so well, we want to come back asap! Don't even think twice, go ahead and book this Air BnB, you will not be disappointed! Thank you sooooo much!!!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and cozy airbnb! this is one of the best airbnbs we've stayed at and we will definitely stay again if we are in the area!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in the Cozy Corner house was great and we really appreciated its pristine cleanliness and brightness and being well equipped with everything in top notch shape and that everything seemed quite well kept and in like nrw shape inside and out. it is just off I70, but not so close that noise is a problem, and in a nice, safe neighborhood in a nice little town.
We also appreciated being able to get free local channels for news and weather on the tv which so many airbnbs do not offer. We would also recommend a drive 8 miles to the east to the cute, pretty with flowers, little town of Casey where they have at least 14 of the Guiness World Records "" biggest things"" that are huge and working and many that you can go inside and that kids and adults would like like - like a windchime that you can pull a rope to work, a birdcage with a swing inside you can swing on, barber pole, mousetrap, mailbox, and so much more. Anyway, the Cozy Corner was a great place to stay while there to visit with family and we will be recommending it to other family and friends and likely returning ourselves more than once!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient off interstate. Amenities provided. Comfortable ""grandparents home"" atmosphere. Ample parking for our U-Haul truck and car. It should be noted, however, that very-strongly scented laundry detergent and/or dryer sheets are used, which caused me a migraine the whole visit. For most people, this won't be the case, and you'll actually think everything smells ""fresh and clean."" But for those of us who have sensitivities to chemical fragrances, it was a very unpleasant stay for me in that respect, especially considering I'd asked BEFORE booking if there were any strong scents and was told, ""No."" But to be honest, I do not blame the hosts. Most people are not aware of just how much these scents can bother some people. And I know these types of scents are often preferable to others. So it's just a live-and-learn situation. The other notable things were the creakiness of the floors and the fussiness of the doors. (They really have to slam shut in order to actually close. The house must have settled wonky at some point.) So there are definitely noises heard from each room as a result, if you're staying with multiple guests, as I was."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"clean, darling little house! we enjoyed our stay and rested well."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very Clean home! Cozy and comfortable.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had lived in Coles County for 30 years but had been gone from there for the 25 years since; I am no longer young. This was a visit to reconnect. I found this bed and breakfast online and was intrigued -- I remember the building as a church! The pictures were attractive, the amenities tempting -- I had a four-night stay and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I far preferred it over a motel. Karen and Adam were ""there but not there"" -- available, not hovering -- privacy was something I appreciated due to the nature of my visit, meeting up with the friends still in this world, and visiting graves of some no longer with us. It was a wonderful, if wistful trip, and much of the success of it I credit to Adam and Karen's lovely facility. I heartily recommend a stay there, or to utilize as a place to stash relatives for the next family reunion! But beware: there are many stairs. Part of the charm, I thought (I'm pretty spry!) -- after all, the place had been a church. FIVE STARS!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, history, decor, stained glass, tile, hard wood floors with old church features that remained intact through a significant renovation process to turn this building into a unique bed and breakfast.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam and Karen’s place was just perfect! Very spacious and quiet common areas. Walking distance to downtown and EIU. Not a lot of tourist attractions around, but there are definitely a lot of older homes and buildings to look at on your walks. I love the murals downtown too!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great quiet alternative to hotels in the area. The place was spotless!

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Immaculate , warm and cozy.
We arrived last night around 6 pm.
Beautiful ambiance awaited us with gorgeous wood floors and stained glass windows as described in listing .
We like to sleep in the winter with windows cracked open with maybe a fan, but the upstairs room had no window.
With the ceiling fan turned up on high and the bathroom door left open, it kept the room cool enough to enjoy a good sleep . We did find a plug in fan the next morning in the closet. I would of loved to have used it last night, if I knew it was there.
Morning was quiet and peaceful enjoying coffee overlooking the local homes .
We bought 2 of the sturdy coffee mugs available for sale ."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to spend some peaceful time. Good to know about the history of this place, adding more to it uniqueness. Thanks for being so wonderful. :) ~ Monica / Lekhana"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the McGrady Inn was amazing! The space was sparkling clean which is especially important during Covid. The place itself is homey and comfortable. Karen and Adam are amazing people! Not only were they responsive to the constant changes in my trips and quick to accommodate, they even drove me to the train station at 4 AM! I couldn’t have asked for better hosts, will definitely be staying here again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a special place! It has been beautifully restored! Large and spacious with easy access. Had the extra delight of a beautiful place with Christmas decorations throughout. The hosts are very friendly and responsive. Would highly suggest staying here! You will not be disappointed.

Very cool property. A Charleston destination in itself.

Beats a hotel by ten fold.
Would stay again. Highly recommend."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen was so quick to reply to my messages and was flexible when we asked to change our check in time. COVID precautions were taken, and the whole place was sparkling clean. This was my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed in, and far better than any hotel. We are recommending this to friends and family in the area!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a one-of-a-kind accommodation! Beautiful common spaces with large old church windows, lovely private rooms with attached bathrooms...a historic gem.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"McGrady Inn is an incredible building, and Adam and Karen are attentive hosts. We’ll definitely stay again."
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"this building retains wonderful things like the ceiling stained glass transom that floods the first floor with light. The original wood trim of the hundred year old building has been faithfully recycled into the new design. Windows are nearly up to the ceiling so by daylight the place gleams. There are MANY stairs to deal with so not a good choice for somebody with bad knees. The breakfast is noted to be ""continental"" and it is a serve yourself setting. I found it to be under powered and I have suggested that the options be expanded."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved this place! It was super clean and I would come back anytime and recommend to anyone!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Plenty of common space and quiet serene setting
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is likely the best run and most beautiful Airbnb rental we have ever experienced! It is conveniently located near the town center of Charleston - what a rich and interesting history. Adam & Karen have thought of everything! Really - Everything! We have stayed here twice, and will surely come back! Beautiful floors, backlit stained glass, high story central common space. The first time we stayed in the choir loft, and this trip in one of the suites. I have never recommended a place higher - 6 stars!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam and Karen were great. They were quick to respond when I could not get the TV to work.
Most importantly, everything was so clean! The kitchenette downstairs was also a great amenity with yogurt, coffee, natural tea, granola bars, muffins and more. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A really great place to stay and much nicer than a hotel for the same price. Karen checked us in and she was very friendly. If we need to stay in Charleston in the future I’m looking here first.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam and Karen were amazing hosts!Their place was so unique and I enjoyed my stay immensely! I hope to stay again during the holidays!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When when we are traveling we tend to avoid hotels and try to find unique accommodations. McGrady Inn certainly fit that bill. We enjoyed looking at the binder of pictures of the history and renovation of the church which was turned into a very lovely place to spend the night. The beautiful wooden trims, antique furnishings, and the salvaged stained-glass church windows throughout both the common areas and in the individual rooms were gorgeous. Great decor! Our room with spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We appreciated the relaxing shared areas where we could sit and enjoy the company of other couples we met who were there from different parts of the country... quite an enjoyable stay in an impressive accommodation!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can expect only the best. Beautiful, comfortable, well lighted inside & out.
You will need to be willing to do some stairs but even those have great handrails."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful clean, quiet and historic site to relax in. Walking distance to campus and the town square."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place and great location!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful old building with high ceilings. Close to the University where we visited our granddaughter. The breakfast area had what you would need although Gini and I always travel with our own coffee, oatmeal, sugar, etc. We did take a couple muffins with us! Roger"
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We couldn’t have asked for anything better than McGrady Inn. Between the sparkling clean location, their passion for preservation and a wonderful overall stay, we had such a relaxing and peaceful evening. This location is one of those “hidden gems” you always keep in your back pocket for a weekend away."
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful gem of an inn!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely fantastic experience. Beautiful accommodations and amazing hosts. We will stay here every time we make a trip out in this direction.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"McGrady Inn was a welcome surprise of top-notch amenities and restoration touches on our road-trip. Wish we could have stayed longer than 1 night and explored the walkable charms of downtown a bit more! Karen was very responsive and helpful with our check-in and also with suggestions on local eateries before we were to meet friend later in the evening. We would stay here again 100%, such inspiration to see the love and care put into their historic converted Church Inn."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam and Karen are the best! I enjoyed my stay at their inn and would highly recommend it to anyone touring the Charleston area!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, lovely architecture, cozy rooms, and large roomy bathroom! It was an excellent choice for us!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a wonderful gem!! We loved staying at the church. It was clean, beautiful and so relaxing."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique, interesting, clean, friendly, helpful.... yep that says it."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently was in Mattoon, IL on business and the usual chain hotels were fully booked. The McGrady was available and for less than I usually pay. Rolling the dice on an unknown isn't always easy for someone who spends over 100 nights a year in Hilton's and Marriotts. This was a dice roll that paid off.
The innkeepers Adam and Karen were super helpful and friendly. Adam even showed me some of their pictures of the building from back in the early 1900's.
This place is spotlessly clean and the AC is adjustable in each room. Everything is comfortable and welcoming.
This building was a United Brethren church and then a United Methodist Church. There is stained glass and beautiful wood floors. It is an architectural gem.
The only detracting is the narrow staircase to get in the building, otherwise a perfect experience. I loved the peaceful and unhurried experience.
I will be back!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,McGrady's is a beautifully done former church that retained many of the stain glass and other features. It is spotless and unique. Highly recommend it.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very cool space w/tons of character. Several nice amenities & host Karen met us to check-in & then we met Adam as we were leaving. Very nice hosts & a must see location. We’ll be back.
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen and Adam were wonderful hosts, and the amenities lovely. The space is gorgeous and the bathrooms large and clean. Charming historical building. You need to be able to climb steps to enter."
2018-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The renovated church has a very attractive and useful open common space for all guests with a kitchen, couches, sitting areas on two different floors. The room I had was clean and neat. If you came for TV, the large one in the common space is for you. I will come again."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are staying in Charleston, IL this is the place to stay!! Such a cool building in a prime location. Adam & Karen are awesome and easy to communicate with - you will thoroughly enjoy your stay!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a unique B & B being in an old church building. We enjoyed looking in all the spaces and noticing all the 'old' things, the curved woodwork, and the simple furnishings. Even though the rooms were booked, the place was quite and we enjoyed our coffee and breakfast in an upstairs sitting area. The bathrooms are very spacious and clean. We highly recommend a stay here and we are looking forward to another visit."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the McGrady Inn for a quick overnight stay while travelling back home from northern Ohio - so glad we did! This is a wonderful alternative to a conventional hotel. The renovation from church to Inn/BnB has been really well done. Details from the original building are preserved throughout; the renovated space is full of craftsman style detailing.
Karen was a wonderful host. She met us at the property, talked with us about the building's history, suggested restaurants in town, provided directions, and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was well-maintained and clean. Our overnight stay was peaceful and quiet - providing for some of the best sleep we had throughout our trip. If we are in the Charleston, Il. area again, we will definitely stay at the McGrady Inn. Recommended!"
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"McGrady Inn is a remarkable renovated space. Highly recommend. We had a very short stay (arrived late, left early) and we would have liked to have been able to enjoy the Inn more. Karen was flexible and accommodating even though we arrived later than expected and met us at the Inn to show us to our room. The room and private bathroom were lovely, clean, and had plenty of space. The whole place had great character and is truly unique. The only downside is you can quite literally hear everything that is going on and spoken in the guest room next door. If you are looking for complete privacy in that way, this would not be the place unless you happen to be the only guests there. Overall very good stay!"
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a beautifully renovated old church. However, we were disappointed that this was a small commercial Inn just like the name said, and not like a private Airbnb such as we had experienced in the past. That said, it was unique, and worth a visit. The accommodations were comfortable, spacious, and very clean. We loved the old church, however, we did not have a restful sleep because the couple next door to us came in late after we were asleep, woke us up and kept us awake with loud talking until the wee hours of the morning, then woke us up again early in the morning with more of the same. We may as well have stayed in a Days Inn."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A warm and interesting place to stay. A welcome alternative to hotels.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible house. Architecture and furniture perfectly match. Hosts live in different house.
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is amazing! It is peaceful and beautiful! A friend and I met there for a weekend get-a-way. The weather was not good but we enjoyed two dinners out within walking distance and a trip to the outlet mall about 25 min away. I would enjoy coming back to explore the area when the weather is better. This location was a good mid-way stop for us as we are from Indianapolis and St. Louis. The owners are kind and attentive and gave great recommendations for food and outings. I would highly recommend this Inn! It would also be a great location if there was a need to rent the entire place, as there is so much room to congregate in the open living area on the main level. I could picture it as a wonderful event venue!
Thanks again to Adam and Karen for being such wonderful hosts!!!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with air bnb and this place made it wonderful. The inn is adorable and they made sure we would have everything you could ever need. Adam and Karen were great hosts and so helpful. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, and even helped us find an apartment in Charleston for when we move."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is amazing. In fact it's perfect!
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is amazing. The owners are great. I hope to stay there again!!
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the cooliest places I have ever stayed at!
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a great place to stay! My son and I stayed in one of the five bedrooms with private bath available. The entire inn is well-kept, clean, and nicely appointed. Adam and Karen were gracious hosts and communication was excellent. I arrived late Friday night and they met me at the Inn to let me in and show me around. I can't recommend this place highly enough if you will be in the Charleston, IL area. Thanks!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of character, very clean, convenient to EIU. Very friendly and helpful."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. We were leery about driving so far off the highway but so glad we did.
This beautifully renovated church is a masterpiece. We stayed in room two and enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep. Every touch is perfect... The wonderful sheets, the heavy towels, the thoughtful snacks and breakfast items.
We are from New York, this would've been a $400 a night stay in New York. We paid $100, what a steal. Run don't walk to this inn!"
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed out stay in this beautiful, unique Inn. The owner's did a great job of balancing the historical charm of the property (stained glass windows, antique furniture pieces) with modern comforts. The Inn is in a quiet neighborhood, but it's just a short walk up the street to the town center. Recommended!"
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This converted church is awesome inside, almost like an annex to Hogwart's. Karen was very welcoming and there were many supplies for breakfast."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We can't wait to return to such a great vacation home. Loved the pond and surroundings. Was great to be in the peaceful outdoors and stay in a clean and beautiful cabin.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? Typically quick to respond, Micheal and his co-host were extremely helpful and on top of things. This Airbnb is absolutely beautiful and I felt so at peace that I truly wish I could’ve stayed to enjoy it more. Super clean and lots of utensils if needed, which I love. Some Airbnbs I’ve been to really don’t have anything in their kitchen or even wash clothes but I enjoyed those touches. I’d definitely book here again if I’m ever in the area. Thank you a million and I could only hope this listing is successful for you all"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visiting EIU 30 min. away. We arrived late night. After getting off 57 it's 15-20 minutes down a 2 lane road. 1st half paved . Driveway wasn't very visible so I called Michael at 3am he was very pleasant and helpful. There is a sign that says ROCKY SPRINGS CABIN LLC. Turn left there in front of the sign . The entrance isn't paved but has gravel tracks . The log cabin was beautiful inside and out. Wrap around porch with rocking chairs was relaxing . Beautiful view, lots of windows/doors - no curtains. Pull up on door handles. Everything seemed new. VERY CLEAN and the beds were so comfortable. No stove but there is a hot plate, a few grills and a fire pit. They had charcoall, you'll need a long lighter and fluid. Dollar general is 15 min away stop on your way so you don't have to go back out. The staircase to get upstairs was challenging. The lake is a few feet away with a boat. Bring life jacket and Off. Co-host Megan was always nice, available and accommodating. We loved it!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house close to EIU.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very smooth, from booking to check-in, to knowing how everything worked. It was a trouble free stay. Exactly what we wanted."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you find yourself in Charleston, this cottage is the ideal home away from home. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, a quick drive to town. The space is cozy but not cramped, and is clean as can be. Would absolutely book again and recommend to all!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If 5 is the highest rating, I give this place a 10. The hosts were attentive and the home & kitchen were well appointed. Charming, clean, peaceful, cozy… just a couple miles from restaurants, shopping, grocery stores and only a few blocks to a great paved walking/jogging path in a country setting. Lake Charleston is just down the road with its beautiful nature trails and scenery. If you’re going to Charleston, this is the place to stay. I’ll definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A wonderful stay! Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cozy stay for our family of three. Perfect for visiting family nearby. Easy check in process. Loved the space & stocked kitchen with gear for cooking & leftovers. Comfortable beds & living room. Lots of natural light throughout & nice fireplace area in back. Our four year old was extremely comfortable there & liked some of the games provided. Very close to beautiful ravine hiking trails around lake Charleston.
FYI Bathroom is nice, but definitely a cozy fit, so could be uncomfortable for some folks depending on body size."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable and clean house! It was decorated beautifully and had everything we needed for our stay. The place isn’t hard to find except that GPS thinks it is if using Waze. A few things to note: we have a 4 and 5 year-old and there were a fair amount of decorative and/or breakable items. I put some of them away, and the kids did fine, but I would hesitate with kids who were toddler age. The couch was great, but off-white. We were sad not to be able to use the fantastic patio with the fire pit (it rained all weekend). The second thing is that, since it’s a rental company, communication about things like early-check in wasn’t great. We asked for early check in and no one responded (even when texting and leaving a message with the local contact). It’s fine we couldn’t get in early, but a response would have been nice. The bathroom was modern and clean but very small (shower is fine, but sink and toilet are very tight) It’s a lovely house and we would stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect location!! Literally right down the street from EIU track
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were thrilled with the accommodations and amenities at Corey’s house. We were in town for the IHSA track meet and it was so nice to be able to escape the heat and walk back to the house for a quick break. The house had everything we needed and more.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay for our big family - lots of rooms to spread out. My kids loved the game room. Walkable to Eastern Illinois University and places to eat and a park for the kids. Host was super responsive and helpful! Would stay here again with a big group.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place couldn’t have been more perfect for what we needed it for. We were in town for my nieces graduation from EIU, and it was basically on campus. The campus was literally at the end of our road, which we walked to for the graduation. The house was absolutely adorable. It looked like everything was brand new. The kitchen and bathrooms were all completely stocked with enough linens and cookware for everyone. There were six of us and we stayed for three days with no issues. The beds were extremely comfortable. There were games available for us to play and televisions in every room. We really couldn’t have asked for anything more. Highly recommend this rental!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Newly renovated space with everything you need. I would absolutely stay here again. Shower was hot and powerful. There was a well stocked game room. The kitchen had a clean coffee maker with both drip and Kureg, cookware and cooking utensils, dishes and silverware, as well as a toaster and roomy dishwasher.
I've been to newly renovated Airbnbs before that we're bare, but this was not my experience here. The host's attention to detail shows. The space was ideal.
Location was walkable to Eastern Illinois University, a huge community park, and lots of restaurants. No yard, but tons of space inside and the huge park is one block away.
Two of the six rooms are in the basement, but southern facing window wells gave impressive light to the rooms.
Beds are firm, but comfortable. Bedding is ample and cozy. The only rooms without a TV was the bathroom and the reading room/study.
Perfect place to relax and visit with family before eclipse hunting."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to stay for a family weekend close to EIU campus. The house was spotless and had all the amenities required for a long weekend stay; big back yard, plenty of easy parking, lots of outdoor space, and campus is only a block away! 10/10 would recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place, we had a great stay and will definitely be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The cutest house! They had everything we needed and more. So many thoughtful details and a great location. I would definitely stay here again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Third time staying here, best air bb in the area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was beautifully kept and exactly as described. Jesse was a gracious host who responded quickly and anticipated our needs. Would recommend!

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is amazing! Clean, modern, and cozy. We had a little issue with the plumbing but that was quickly taken care of.
Overall my family had a very nice time here and enjoyed the spacious layout of the house. The complimentary wine was such a nice and unexpected touch. Thank you Jesse!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at this house. It was near my son’s dorm and very convenient to campus. The house was cozy and relaxing, we even saw deer in the yard! Everything seemed updated and fresh."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for an EIU Reunion! Great Girls Getaway! We found the perfect place to reconnect with friends and enjoy a visit to our alma mater.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, almost right on campus so walking distance to everything. The place is huge too! Updated, super clean, we absolutely loved our stay. Photos don’t even do it justice!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jesse’s home was the perfect place for our family. It was clean, beautifully renovated, and my children loved having their own downstairs!! We would definitely stay there again when visiting Charleston."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We LOVED staying at Jesse's house! It is literally on the edge of the EIU campus, and it was a very short walk to our son's dorm and also to the football stadium. The house was spotless and there was tons of room for the 6 of us who slept there. It's also decorated very cute, and there were lots of nice touches, like shampoo, soap, microwave popcorn, 6 bottles of water in the fridge upon arrival, and more! We also played some of the board games that they had in the basement. We would ABSOLUTELY stay here again. Thanks so much!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, grandson loved the downstairs!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Remisa very clean and comfortable house and above all spacious house
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessie was a fantastic Super Host. The entire home was immaculate. Home is located close to EIU and my Family. Home was cozy and very comfortable. Newly remodeled and very tastefully decorated. On an extremely hot weekend, the homes air conditioning was fantastic and performed without a hitch. The area was quiet and and safe. One evening three grown deer visited us in the backyard. We sat out on one of two patios and enjoyed nature literally at our back door. The homes layout (Kitchen, Dinning and Great Rooms) allowed my Family to comfortably gather for coffee, breakfast and card games. Appliances were all new and clean. Bedrooms are modern and comfortable. Full basement with fireplace, bathroom, bedroom, workout room and office was a definite bonus. Great job Jessie! We will definitely keep this home on our radar for future visits."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great place to stay!
The house is in amazing condition and very well cared for - not a speck of dust to be seen. Jesse was easy to reach and very responsive for any questions we had.
The kitchen is very nice and super clean. There are lots of nice spots to sit in the living room. The bedrooms are super nice - extra blankets throughout if needed. The basement is gorgeous with really nice carpeting and sitting spaces - we didn’t spend much time there but had we needed it, it’d have been perfect to relax in. The backyard is beautiful - we saw several deer and bunnies during our stay.
We would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whole experience was awesome. Very clean, and very comfortable stay. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse’s New Modern Farmhouse was by far the nicest Airbnb we have stayed in to date. The house was walkable to the EIU campus… PERFECT for parents visiting their college students or for former students or fans who are in town for a game. Plenty of bedrooms, eating spaces and general open spaces both inside and out for families or couples. Rooms were super clean and beautifully finished and decorated. New appliances, included: lower level and first floor washer and dryer; dishwasher; gas stove (with a pot filler!) and TV’s throughout the home. The grill area and private back yard with a fire pit were unexpected bonuses! Lots of off street parking is available. DEFINITELY will return to Modern Farmhouse on our next trip back to Illinois! Thank you, Jesse!
*We happened to be at Modern Farmhouse during a severe thunderstorm which resulted in widespread power outages. Jesse informed us to be safe and head to the basement until the storm passed. He’s the best!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I am a long-term resident staying in Gentry's lovely home. The house looks exactly to the description entailed. The house is cozy and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful; love that after a hard day of work. If you're looking for the same in comfort, then consider booking Gentry's home. You will not be displeased."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy and cute spot in Casey! Very close to downtown, a pleasant and short walk over. Quiet and pleasant neighborhood, maybe a bit livelier from the eclipse crowd hanging around. Felt truly like a home away from home, especially with all the household amenities like washer/dryer, full kitchen, WiFi, living room and TVs with streaming. It would be a nice longer term stay if one was in town for longer. Gentry was super responsive and the check-in instructions were detailed and clear, the whole experience was totally seamless. So glad to have the perfect spot to decompress for a bit after all the eclipse excitement. Thanks so much!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Casey, IL has been on my list of places to visit. The house is in a quiet spot and walkable to all the ""Big Things"" in the town. Gentry and his Co host are just the sweetest and so responsive. This is our second time staying at one of Gentrys properties.
If you are looking at this listing, Definitely book it. Your just a couple blocks away for the main strip.
Recommendations - maybe bring an extra pillow with.
And a card game or board game. (We got spoiled with Gentrys Ashmore Cabin, lots of board games there)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great response time.
But sadly I did not utilize this space an
Min any way planned… due to a certain smell."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place in a quiet neighborhood for an overnight stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's always a great experience! I will be back!😊
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay-my go to place when in the area!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The apartment was exactly as described. Fantastic amount of space and really felt like you were stepping back in time.
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"Internet service was great. However, there was no television. Great place for friends to hang out to talk and play games at night. I wish we’d known about all the things that were out of order. The guest bed upstairs dips badly in the middle. My boys LOVED the billiards table, but we wish the sticks were in better condition. Overall, the place was great. My kids got a kick out of the place looking like it was blasting from the past. Great space."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Another great visit! If my son is still living in Charleston for Easter next year, we will definitely be staying here again. This was our second year staying at this home and my whole family just loves it here. It’s very spacious and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely place. I highly recommend it
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"this place was wonderful to stay, I loved the classic style that it has. it is a place with a lot of space. I definitely recommend it"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thought Mac’s Place was wonderful. Truly a blast from the past but in terrific shape. Would stay again.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an excellent location if you are visiting Charleston Illinois. It is in between downtown Charleston and the campus. Everything in the description of this Airbnb was accurate. The only reason I’m giving this four stars is because the pillows and bed were very uncomfortable. I would suggest purchasing a new mattress or a mattress toppers with some decent pillows. Otherwise it was a neat retro place to stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay, beautiful apartment fun for a group."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wanted to personally think Lori and Natasha for their stay. This place was very good for a sales team who needed a place to lay their heads while we worked constantly and all the elements. We also had some fun with the local lake with multiple beach days as well as hiking and local parks, Lori was very communicative, responsive what a wonderful host the home felt timeless and we were all sad once it ended highly recommend this location for a Blitzing team in sales this day was wonderful. We will look forward to the next time.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay in a beautiful apartment. It was kind of like a time capsule. Very cool.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect - easy walk to downtown or campus. It was perfect for a college roommate reunion clean and lots of space. While the decor was dated, it was very quaint and didn't impact the quality of our stay at all. Would absolutely recommend and have said we will plan our next Charleston get together around the availability of this rental! Host was flexible and allowed us to check in a couple of hours early. Thank you for everything!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what a throwback to the 60's/70's! Felt like we went back in time to ""The Brady Bunch"" era. Surprising to find this modern, brick, urban building rising from a large, green expanse of lawn after driving through a sea of one-story aluminum-sided homes. Immaculately kept classic condo with high-end furnishings and appliances from the 60's/70's. Couldn't believe they are all in in good running order after 40-50 years. All of the spaces were super clean and tidy. Kitchen had adequate supplies for making coffee and simple cooking. Ivory/white carpeting throughout the condo, including the bathrooms, kitchen, and dining room that one can't quite discern in the photos. Caution to those with active children or clumsy adults as this is really an adults' home. Honestly, we were super careful not to spill anything in the kitchen and dining room or drip in the bathroom. Thank you for sharing your home so we could attend graduation at UIUC with four adults and two 12-yr olds."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place & so spacious!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay! Unique property with interesting and eclectic decor. Very clean with fresh bedding and plenty of extra towels. Perfect spot for our EIU girls reunion trip!
2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Place was good
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! There were nine of us visiting my son for Easter. As there aren’t too many hotels in the Charleston area we opted to go the Air bnb route and we were so glad we did! There was plenty of room for all of us, plenty to keep the teenagers busy, and secluded enough that we felt like we were in our own separate space. We took a peaceful walk to the park and enjoyed the neighborhood. The kitchen was the perfect set up to cook our dinner. If my son stays in the area we will likely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is gem of a place right across the university. Loved staying here! The games that has been provided and the pool table, piano has kept us busy all the time. The spacious kitchen is cherry on the top. You’ll experience the 80’s vibes because of the architecture and details!!
Definitely will visit again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed plenty of quality space as a family to play board games, shoot pool, visit, read and work on line as needed. Thanks for providing this opportunity ."

2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Unique and beautiful place.
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spacious, clean home, not facing a street added privacy to the property. The kitchen, living room (vaulted ceiling), backyard deck, bed rooms came with excellent design and shape. Good office space with tables, games, billiards table all added to the wonderful weekend at our 35th EIU reunion. Thanks."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is spacious and has a lot of character with many retro details and a lovely, open living area. The large side patio and entrance balcony are welcome bonuses. Communications were thoughtful and details accurate. Thank you!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Natasha’s place was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. It was spotless. A unique place to stay while in Charleston. Lots of apace to spread out in and close to everything. We loved the games and our time on the patio.

2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I highly recommend MAC's place. It is a perfect quiet little get away. It is immaculate. It has all the vibes of the 60's and 70's so if you are a nostalgia buff this place is for you. You can really see the love that this family has for this home. If you are looking to make family memories, MAC's place is it."
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Natasha is a very responsive and CLEAN host. When we had a question about the AC unit she responded within minutes, and made sure maintenance arrived within 30 minutes of us reaching out to her. We live in the city so having a location that gave you the peaceful country feel but still so close to grocery stores, fast food places,and other essentials stops is just what we needed. We visited with our large family of football playing boys and made happy family memories. A must for a relaxing extended weekend, or college campus visit trip."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Mac’s Place is an amazing space. It is beautifully maintained and spacious. The host was extremely nice and accommodating. Definitely a place you should check out!
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"MAC’s place is an old school, stylish home that is absolutely amazing. It’s very spacious and many homey touches were added in. Would definitely stay here again."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Couldn't have been any better. Lovely home and Natasha was wonderful. I highly recommend staying here if in Charleston.
2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great place to stay and centrally located in Charleston. Natasha was great to work with and communication with her was excellent. The check-in process was seamless. Very comfortable accommodations especially for a family!

2019-08-01,3.0,Group trip,"Just make sure to ask if all the amenities are in working order: washer machine,TV, fireplace, indoor grill etc."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gentry’s cabin is about as perfect as it gets. It’s cozy, modern, peaceful, beautiful, stylish, and so very welcoming.
Only one warning to potential guests (and this does not detract from anything): the stairs are not for the mobility challenged and the bathroom is downstairs with the bedrooms upstairs.
There was more than just the necessities provided. From coffee, to olive oil, body wash, board games, and extra blankets. The back deck is gorgeous, there are hammocks to chill in, and the surrounding area has lots of nature to discover.
It’s been by far the cleanest place I’ve visited, the appliances were modern and in perfect order.
If I could give the cabin more than 5 stars I would."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,very responsive to questions
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place to stay for a quiet time away. Loved visiting Lake Charleston nearby.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We wanted a quiet weekend away and we got that and more. Such a beautiful place and quiet even with the race track near. Loved all the old school games they had and the back porch was so relaxing to just chill and enjoy the nature around. we stay at many airbnb and this is one of the top 5 ones for sure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at the cabin. It was such a nice property and loved hanging out on the back deck.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gentry was very receptive to my messages; he responded very quickly and helpful. I even left my cup there; he was quick to respond and even left it outside so I could pick it up. The cabin was beautiful and very private and peaceful. It had everything we needed. I was sad to leave and will be staying here again in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Cool space.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A comfy cabin in a beautiful private forested seeing overlooking a hill and creek. We enjoyed bird watching and hanging out in the hammocks. The house was well appointed and my kids enjoyed the games. Of note, the stairs to the upper bedrooms are steep and could be challenging for small kids or people with mobility issues. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and it was a great location for our trip."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean & comfortable space in a beautiful setting.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed the space, fun games, fire pit, enjoyed that there were extra toiletries (q-tips, dental floss, shampoo/conditioner and body wash)."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and great communication. The inside was gorgeous and had everything needed (plus some).
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were looking for a weekend getaway with our pup in a remote area and found this cute cabin in the woods. The pictures really made it look like it was going to be luxurious, but when we got there it was definitely more of an income property vibe. Don't get me wrong, there were cute touches here and there, the rugs were great, stove/oven, dishwasher, TV, soap were all really nice, but then the bed was cheap/uncomfortable, flat pillows, the upstairs ceiling was tin, downstairs ceiling was plywood, walls were warped, super steep/cheap stairs not for the faint of heart and wobbly handrails, no trash cans in the bedrooms, no coffee table, and a cleaning list while we paid a cleaning fee. They're only a year in, so maybe this will change. The actual property the cabin sits on is gorgeous and at night well lit. Our puppy loved running all over! Also, the host is very nice and super responsive. They let us do a late checkout, so that was also very kind. Just a confusing stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place had and amazing time with beautiful views
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice place, great views. We were very comfortable. Only the neighbor is very conflicting and very observant. It's flipping all the time and very rude. We chose this location for our dog to run and was a little more free. The neighbor was upset because our dog approached her property and I threaten that if I passed the line we would pick it up in a bag.
Gentry was very nice and very nice to us. The place is amazing. Just be careful with your neighbor."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was lovely, you will have a great experience"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little gem outside of Charleston Illinois. This cozy chic cabin is peaceful, fun and inviting."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect for our needs. Plenty of space and privacy for a winter getaway. Electric fireplace was a bonus on a night when temps went below zero. Lockbox for the key was easy to use. Space was bigger than I expected. Well worth the price. Kitchen was very nice and allowed us to stay in and cook at a time when going out would have been very uncomfortable.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great time
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had such a lovely cozy retreat at their place. Beautiful surroundings, beautiful house, nice and cozy living room. It was just perfect.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our only issue was the steep stairs. The hosts were great. The location was perfect! We had a wonderful time with an early Christmas Dinner, a few breakfasts with family and s’mores over the campfire. Our grandkids fell in love with the hammocks even in 30 degree weather!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute and comfy little house!!! So quiet out there and would be very relaxing in warmer weather being able to sit out on deck. Recommend!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a nice, relaxing weekend. The back porch & yard were beautiful with fall trees & would also be very beautiful in the snow."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for a weekend escape. Awesome deck and scenery, really cool living room, fireplace & well stocked bathroom.
Kitchen doesn’t have much to work with, so bring your own pots & pans if you’re looking to cook. Didn’t find the upstairs bed very comfortable and was disappointed we couldn’t get any leeway to extend a 10 AM Sunday morning checkout, especially considering the time we took follow all cleaning instructions & leave the place in good shape."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clear instructions, clean, and peaceful. Dogs were not a fan of the steps so that was the only complicating factor. Be advised that the steps are steep so old or timid dogs may fight you on climbing them! That might be a good thing if your dogs are willing to sleep apart from you but was problematic with our co-dependent pooches. The place was great overall and the host was responsive. No complaints and will definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for relaxing, very cute and cozy. Gorgeous views and close to town."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved sitting on the deck here. The leaves were stunning and the deck furniture was super comfortable. Sweet cabin.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful! My best friends from high school all came together after a decade to celebrate my birthday! We cooked, watched movies, had a bonfire, went to Castle Finn Winery, Southfork Homestead farm, and played games! It was just what we all needed. The house was charming and had everything you needed. Be careful driving at night, it is very dark!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at this charming and cozy cabin!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved this place! Gorgeous views and close to town so my friends and I could cook our meals and get everything we needed easily. The host was very responsive and we had no issues overall with our stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for a relaxing getaway. Close to town yet felt remote and tranquil. Everything we needed was provided an excellent experience.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice comfortable place
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is very cute and cozy and overall the house was clean and neat. The view of the woods and the deck are awesome. But we were disappointed with the beds. They are in very poor condition, very uncomfortable, and the frames are super squeaky; a good night’s rest is impossible on any of them. We found the couches way more comfortable. There is only 1 bathroom so if you’re staying with a larger group it gets tricky. The stairs are steep and very narrow and the railings are weak and noisy. The getaway was nice, but not easy to get any rest."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Relaxing getaway with friends. I was working on a painting of my daughter pretty much the whole stay and then forgot it (of course the only thing I wouldn't want to forget) and they're even getting it shipped back to me! Will stay again if ever back in the area, pretty reasonably priced"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were swinging through the area for business, and found this GEM! It was perfect for my husband, dogs and I! It was surrounded by beautiful trees; great place to hang out outside! If you are looking for a cozy place, you found it! We hope to be back again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come back next year with our dog ! It was beautiful, peaceful, and cozy. We were scared at first because we kept hearing noises but it was just acorns falling, it’s a safe place. The only issue we really had was the tvs not being connected to the internet/ disconnecting, however we didn’t reach out to the host about it because it didn’t bother us, though I’m sure the host would’ve been able to help if we had asked ! Our favorite part was sitting on the back porch, such beautiful scenery !! 10/10 recommend"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, quiet cabin. Great hosts and location"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay. The cabin is really nice, and the setting is really relaxing (especially around fall). Gentry is very responsive and everything was clean and in great shape."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Cabin was located very close to EIU campus! Very clean and well stocked! Would stay here again!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The stay was good. For the most part, the place was clean; except for the couches on the first floor were very incredibly stained and we had to lay blankets on top of it to sit on it. Also, due to the location large acorns kept falling on the tin roof throughout the night which made sleep almost impossible but that was not anyone’s fault. Outside of those 2 things, the hosts were very friendly and responsive."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh my Gosh what a fabulous Aframe in the woods. It’s really outstanding, comfortable and unique. The back deck is a wonderful place to decompress! The surrounding area and drive to the house we’re just beautiful. Also, they thought of EVERYTHING! If you needed something it was there. Every little thoughtful thing. We were inn route from a family gathering and home and needed a lay over spot. It was so perfect. If you are reading this review to possibly stay, DO IT! Next time I am planning for a longer respite for sure! Fantastic! Thanks Gentry for sharing this place!!! It’s so well done!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, peaceful and clean… would definitely stay here again and recommend"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This cute little A frame is perched amongst the trees. We loved sitting on the back porch listening to the breeze.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay with our dog. Super clean, nice and cozy and everything that was expected and more. Love the outdoor firepit and good dry hardwood provided. Good stuff. Just wish we were there on Saturday’s for the races."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean & well kept. We did not have any issues checking in or checking out. It in a great location & the neighborhood was quiet.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we enjoyed our stay here! neighbors are close by but it was still very peaceful and quiet. loved that the back balcony was fenced in so our dogs could hang outside without worry. clean, cozy, cute, and has everything you need! the wifi was spotty for a little bit but the host was very responsive and it corrected itself quickly! would definitely stay again. thanks for everything!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,👍🏽
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved it here. Definitely coming back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of 4 plus pup spent 2 nights at the Sweet Dreams Cabin. Access to the unit was very easy, even at night thanks to the well-lit front porch, string lights and even little lights on the trees. Location is very scenic, nestled in the woods. We enjoyed using both the back deck and front porch. Kitchen and bathroom are both well-stocked. We appreciated the fire starter and logs that were provided for campfires, and enjoyed using the gas grill one evening. Our dog enjoyed being in the great outdoors. There is a bit of road traffic noise that can be heard from the cabin (not as noticeable on a quiet Saturday morning, but more apparent during the work week). The clean, updated interior and wooded location made it well-worth the trip. We recommend hiking at Fox Ridge State Park, Cameo Vineyard for wine, and Lincoln Cabin site for history. Thanks for a nice stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect! 5 ⭐️
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great and relaxing trip to central Illinois. The cabin was in an awesome location and within 30 minutes of a few fun small towns like Casey! The view from the deck was very pretty and we saw some deer. Only feedback would be that the curtains were no longer there to cover the large glass door to the back patio, at night this felt a little uncomfortable. We had a very comfortable stay and appreciated the air conditioning available in each room. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I enjoyed our stay. We were looking to escape the city life, and Gentry's airbnb offered just that. It offered a cozy place to relax indoors and outdoors. Everything was as shown in the pictures and very clean."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Don’t hesitate and just book the trip! We drove 5 hours and will be back again. Relaxing getaway from the city. As soon as you arrive you feel a sense of peace. The cabin was very clean and the fully stocked kitchen was a plus(I made pot roast and Birria)! Dog friendly and our pup was happy to be free -I don’t think he wanted to leave either! Also, no mosquitos or bugs! We were prepared but there weren’t any and if so Gentry has you covered with bug repellent candles. Thank you for your hospitality, can’t wait wait to be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay with some close friends. We were looking for a break from our busy work schedules somewhere in central Illinois, and we were happy to find a very clean and comfy cabin with a great view of a forested area. A highlight of our trip were seeing a couple dear nearby during the sunset!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cute cabin and serene area in the woods! The appliances, including washer and dryer, are top notch. The shower is beautiful and the outdoor space is lovely. We had fun exploring Charleston too."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little cozy cabin.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet with beautiful view off the back deck. Clean and cozy.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cabin and location. Not a lot to do around, but perfect for quiet and relaxation. A storm went through, knocking out the power. However Gentry was very quick to communicate and help us with our issue."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Came for a quick getaway with our new born and our 2 dogs. The yard was a great place for them to run around free with a lot of privacy. The yard was very cute to lounge around. The interior was clean and spacious. There were games to play which was nice. The back porch was great, and overlooked a beautiful forest. It was so quite and peaceful at night. The only thing to note, the bed rooms are located upstairs atop a steep set of stairs which could be tricky for some. The listing states this though, so you can’t be taken for surprise as it is advertised as so. Would definitely come back again! Make sure you stop by Chubby’s pizza, Monicals, McHughs for food; or Lake Charleston or Fox Ridge State Park for a great scenic walk!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was exactly as described. Lovely, private setting. 2 bedrooms upstairs with comfy beds and excellent AC plus fans to keep the air moving. Gas stove was great for making an impromptu breakfast! Highly recommended!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and relaxing, we would recommend Gentrys Cabin."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great communication. Cute place, had everything we needed for a short stay. Loved the deck and all the tall trees. Felt like we were in a tree house. Close enough to town to get a few things. Went fishing at Lake Charleston. Nice walking path around the lake. Then went to Casey. Fun little town with great pretzels!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay at this sweet cabin!! Host was amazing and very responsive! This will definitely be my place to stay each time I’m in town ❤️
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Sweet Dreams Cabin for our first kid free trip for our 8 year wedding anniversary. It was absolutely beautiful! The cabin, the scenery, the cute little towns nearby! We had a magical 2 night stay! We were obsessed with the decor and vibe of the interior of the cabin. Cozy, warm, homey. Stocked with so many pillows and blankets! We enjoyed exploring Charleston and getting some pizza from Windy City Pizza and also the nearby town of Casey and seeing all the Big things in a Small town! We cuddled on the couch watching tv, enjoying the beautiful electric fireplace in the living room. The main bed was a bit uncomfortable, but that is literally the only thing close to negative I could say about this place! Very obviously professionally cleaned. Kitchen stocked with most everything you need, besides a can opener! Bathroom was also well stocked! Quiet, secluded, peaceful, but still close to the highway and just a few minutes drive to town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Relaxing , quiet stay. Quaint cabin in the woods"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cabin in the woods. The place has very basic kitchen supplies for simple cooking. It was comfortable for our group of 4 and the perfect place to relax in evening.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, so serene. Lake Charleston is minutes away and has a great trail around the lake! This place was ideal!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were only there for a day but it was a cute cabin with the country vibe expected. Very decorated pretty and had a good amount for a comfortable stay. Did not stay long enough to have a proper review! Didn’t really communicate with the owner because we were there for such a short time.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely and serene cabin! It was a very peaceful location. Everything was clean and organized inside, and the cabin was cozy and charming. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved spending time out on the deck, the view is amazing!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was such a wonderful trip! Hiked a bit! So peaceful! We will be making a trip back in the future!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an incredible time!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Solid quick, weekend getaway."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing time, the cabin was nice and clean."
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,During our stay the various a/c and heating units weren't working well. we reached out for help finding more adequate shelter during a major storm but no response was provided. The bed was also fairly uncomfortable. We decided to leave early and get a better night's sleep back in our beds by the last day.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, peaceful cabin. Nice location, easy to get to and less than 10 minutes to Walmart/ Aldi if you need anything. The decor was nice and beds were comfortable. The deck and outdoor space is nice and we wish it were a little warmer so we could have enjoyed it more! The upstairs was very hot and stuffy when we arrived and the heating/ac units were a little confusing but Gentry responded to my late night message and was helpful. I’d recommend more instructions on using them for guests and to future guests just make sure you get the temp adjusted early so you aren’t miserable come night time. The photos show curtains in the living room but there were none and no curtain rod so I couldn’t even hang up a sheet. It’s just woods behind so not really a privacy issue but it if you are like me and like to shut curtains at night you may feel uncomfortable. My only other concern was while the door to the deck locked, the deadbolt would not lock at all."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall just great , friendly host , lol wanted to stay longer we really enjoyed ourselves"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is awesome. Clean and fully stocked with essentials. It felt very private and was a great place to hang out and spend quality time. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Gentry was kind, communicative and succinct! The place itself is aesthetically stunning and we had such a dreamy thunderstorm filled night. The fireplace feature was the perfect added touch combined with hot tea and nature sounds. The foggy morning sunrise and bird song were such medicine and we felt truly blessed to be among them.
The bed frames used were both creaky and moved a lot and the mattresses weren’t cardboard, but they weren’t comfy either. I found the couches much more comfortable and stable.
I do have several intense food sensitivities and allergies, so we were cautious in the kitchen as there were grease, bread crumbs and excess spices all around the stovetop. I cleaned this as well as the sand and dried dirt that were in the dryer so we could fluff up our clothes for our event and washed dishes we used before we used them. The coffee pot had a seemingly never ending supply of small grounds, so I cleaned it as best as I could to heat water for tea. Aesthetically 10/10."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a great night away!
It was beautiful, peaceful, and we truly felt at home. Would encourage anyone to stay here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful place. Everything was perfect - we loved the woods, the rustic charm of the place, but still with every modern convenience we needed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here so much! Our family had such a relaxing time, and had fun cooking in the great kitchen. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute, quiet, and peaceful place. The beds were comfortable and the amenities were bountiful. The space was great for the six of us, but beware of the stairs to the bedrooms if you have young kids or any balance issues."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for the 6 of us while we were in the area visiting some friends. The house was clean and cozy and very cute. The house and amenities were exactly as explained in the description. The location was relaxing but we were in and out so much we didn’t get to enjoy that. The only recommendation I would have is to include something to make a frozen pizza on like a pan or stone. Just a note for future guests, if you’re not good with steps, be aware that both bedrooms are upstairs and the steps are a bit steep and narrow (depth-wise.). We would definitely stay here again but would like to spend more time at the house enjoying the peacefulness."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy place to stay. Quiet and relaxing getaway.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks for everything nice place, peaceful and secluded"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot, very clean, and best of all it was quiet. Gives you that wonderful cabin feeling while over looking the balcony."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time here, enjoyed the view of the woods, seeing deer, and exploring nearby. Internet was slow and not ideal for remote work, kitchen is stocked with the very basics, so perfect for short-term stays (or long-term, if you bring what you need).
Very warm and cozy!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to relax and get away from all the city noise, but easily accessible to shopping and roads. Would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"An absolutely amazing place! Gentry was an extremely genuine, kind, and helpful host. We will absolutely stay here again if passing through the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sweet Dreams Cabin was perfect for our working vacation! The back deck was beautiful, overlooking a woodsy ravine and felt incredibly wild considering it’s not far at all from town. Beds were comfortable, host was really friendly and accommodating. We recommend the place highly & hope to come back soon."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool little house tucked in the woods not far off the interstate. Glad I found it as I was traveling through. Everything you need and more. Beautiful setting.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful home. The house had a great view out into the woods, and we saw some foxes in the early morning. A quiet place to get away for a while. Host was accommodating and punctual with his responses."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great peaceful place to stay! Would rent again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a beautiful, cozy spot!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place. It is just remote enough to have the peace and quiet, but close enough to town that the drive in the morning and night is always pleasant and quick. The inside of the house is beautifully decorated, with every thing you need. All in all I think this is the place to stay if you're staying around Charleston."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Before I booked our stay at sweet dreams cabin I messaged Gentry and he responded quickly. He was very helpful and tended to our needs. We are a family of 6 so it takes a lot for us to go anywhere these days and for everyone to be happy. Well Gentry’s cabin made all 6 of us extremely happy! The location was perfect. The cabin was everything we would need and want for the most memorable family weekend getaway. The listing is accurate plus more. Sheets, towels, extra blankets all clean. The stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, and washer/ dryer all like brand new condition. You can tell from when you walk in everything is taken care of with TLC! This is a family memory we will never forget! Thank you Gentry for all your hard work in making this cabin such a perfect little getaway!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful place to stay for the whole family! Great place to rest.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Cabin is a slice of wooded paradise. The inside is beautiful. The woods are beautiful. It has an amazing gas stove in the kitchen. Each bedroom has its own temperature control. It wasn’t drafty, which can happen in older homes. The electric fireplace was great! Three TVs! Beautiful gray linens, soft fluffy white towels. Coffee! A well lit bathroom. We were in town visiting because my Mom is sick. This beautiful cabin was the respite we needed. Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, comfy. Just what my family and I need!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and private - it felt like we had the whole woods to ourselves. And the full moon was an added bonus...
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a beautiful setting!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was ADORABLE! It had everything you needed and was just a perfect place to relax. My kiddo wants to return in the winter because, ""this would be even more beautiful covered in snow!"""
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was lovely! Very clean and comfortable and the view from the back deck was stunning and serene. We enjoyed morning coffee on the deck watching the sun rise through the trees and listening to the leaves falling. Beautiful! The house was clean and decorated tastefully with comfortable beds and living room furniture. Gentry was great at communicating and always made himself accessible to talk. We needed propane and firewood and he took care of it immediately. We had a great stay and would love to stay again next time we’re in the area!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was recovering from a surgery and talked to Gentry several times before my stay. He was always quick to respond to any questions I had. Wow it the perfect place to get some much needed rest and sitting on the back porch watching the animals mostly deer. The trees were beautiful this time of year. My brother would say ""I picked the perfect place."" Beds were comfortable. Thank you for sharing your place with us. We will be back again to enjoy this perfect place for my family. God Bless you!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is really nice and has all the amenities. I was there in the fall, and the location was very pretty. The little deck in the back has a little gas operated fire place, so it’s great for enjoying the view in the early evenings. Gentry was very communicative and the instructions very clear. Overall, a very good experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described! It was perfect for a weekend getaway for some friends. We didn't realize there wasn't an oven so our grocery list will be different if there is a next time but we had a great time and would love to be back.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was nice & cozy, private location. We enjoyed the firepit & the flat-top grill the owner had delivered. The bed was comfortable. The place was close to a race track, which we enjoyed a night out at. The owner was easy to contact. We would stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing. Quiet and a beautiful getaway to unwind and relax. Beautiful scenery thank you, the sheep and chickens are just an added bonus. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this super clean and very cute tiny home! Far enough away to be secluded, but close enough to necessities."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute tiny home, great little getaway! loved seeing the sheep and chicken"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing little getaway. Ambers place is so cute and very clean. No TV was perfect for my husband and I to focus on each other, enjoy the hot tub, play card games and watch the sheep. Thank you Amber!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was such a peaceful getaway. From the cozy interior to the inviting outside area, we wish we could've stayed longer. The hot tub was a great amenity, and also loved that there was no TV in the place. Easy access to a shower, the kitchen had all the cookware needed and a larger fridge, and the bed was comfy. This is simply a wonderful place to detach and rest!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"delightful. the live plants are a lovely touch. the sheep and chickens, too. highest recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I found Amber’s place to be just as advertised. It was peaceful and comfortable with all of the amenities you could ever need. The linens and towels all smelled clean, the bed comfy, and the hot tub was such a welcome relaxation space. The surroundings were adorable and quaint - filled with nature and a view of the sheep and chickens on the property. We could not have asked for a better stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place and very peaceful
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our time in Arcola.
We visited the Hippie Wall and Raggedy Ann and Andy Bench.
We had dinner at Shae's Grub and Pub. The food was very good and the staff was extremely friendly and efficient !
Breakfast at the Hen House was excellent and filling. Again, great service along with generous portions.
Your Tiny House was just what we needed, and the bed was the best so far on our “Trip Across America”! Thank you so much for your hospitality!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was a great getaway for me and my partner! Enjoyed the hot tub. Definitely will recommend this location for a small private getaway
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very nice lil getaway spot! the place is very cute. the hottub is a really nice treat after a long day of sightseeing. there is more than enough to do in the surrounding areas, high probability we will be back! amber is very responsive and the place was spotless when we checked in."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best little getaway spot. We really enjoyed our stay here!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Short stay while visiting family. Nice country vibe, convenient to rural areas."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Didn't realize there was not a tv though when we booked. The hottub was great and we built a bonfire one evening. They provided the wood which was nice. Very cute home! We enjoyed going to broom town cafe and visiting some attractions in Arthur. Only cons: it is not as secluded as we thought it would be but the owners never did bother us. Highly recommend if you are looking for a place to getaway for a few days!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The tiny home was wonderful. The home was very clean and I loved the decor. The farm animals were so enjoyable to watch from the kitchen window. The hot tub was a perfect way to end the day.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the little brown spring lamb dancing across the paddock in front of the mamas! The little house was wonderful place to stay and was very comfortable for my husband and me. Everything was laid out so plainly and was easy to find. I wished we had more that a night to stay and could have explored the area more. The little red hen saw us off in the morning with a friendly conversion and walked us to our car.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I would love to give this place 5 stars but I feel there was a few things that make it not a 5 star. The hot tub had no real privacy, the house is much closer than I expected and only had a few small shrubs between it and the house. I think a privacy fence would be perfect here along the walkway and in front of the hot tub. The other reason was the hot tub was slightly dirty, not bad but it could've definitely been cleaner in my opinion. I still really enjoyed my stay and would go again especially if there was a privacy fence."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend!
Great place to stay and visit!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice and cozy perfect for a weekend to just get away from it all
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice quiet getaway at the Tiny House, it was a simple, modern, quiet, peaceful place for my husband and I to unwind for his birthday weekend. The house is located on Amber's property and you can see her home, but no one bothered us and we didn't even see anyone. We did see several sheep and chickens which we loved. Overall it was a nice experience would recommend :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay!!!! The landscape was beautiful and the hot tub was so relaxing!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very comfortable and nice here loved it
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This small and quaint place packs a punch. It is in the same premises as the main property but somehow you still feel isolated and in total privacy. We were greeted by two roosters and it gave the atmosphere character. The inside of the small house was spacious and welcoming. The decor and layout is very farmhouse modern and gave us ideas foe future decor. There was a lot of towels, and more than basic kitchenware.
The only suggestion is if you're going to cook, Crack open a window to let any smoke out. This place lives up to its stellar reviews and we definitely recommend you to come and stay.
The host was extremely responsive as well which is always a huge plus in the instance that there's any last minute mishaps. Great stay at a great place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay for the weekend. Amber is very responsive and the home is perfect!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely one-night stay at Amber’s place. Soaking in the hot tub at sunset was absolutely perfect. Comfy bed, pictures are accurate, perfect escape from the city."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an awesome little house- the hot tub is amazing, and the interior looks like it’s from a magazine. Definitely worth it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tiny home, we loved having out little getaway for a few days. The only thing that was different was that the tiny home looked out to a farm area with sheep and free roaming chicken, and the front door looks out to the owner's main home with nothing blocking that view. Based on the images I did think it was going to be a little more remote/private. The free roaming chickens were very cute but the house was also right next to a road where we could hear the cars/trucks throughout the evening. The light outside the front window is pretty bright and doesn't have a light switch, which can be fixed by using the breaker box switch on bottom right- only issue is that it turn off the outlets on the back wall. Don't forget the bug spray when staying here, but 100% recommend El Toro Mexican down the street, we loved that for lunch. Overall, we quite enjoyed our little getaway, everything all said and done. Decided not to use the hottub as there are so many bugs at night. Beautiful home."

The full kitchen and washer and dryer was very nice to have as well.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Clean and easy check in. We celebrated a romantic NYE. Hot tub was the best. Thank you so much Amber!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A perfect getaway. Will look forward to visiting again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amber's suite was beautiful and exactly as described. We had a peaceful and perfectly quiet stay. I would recommend this rental for couples looking to disconnect from the hustle and reconnect with one another.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber was a very gracious hostess. She was very flexible with our arrival time and everything was as described. We especially enjoyed the hot tub.
The mini-split HVAC system seemed to struggle a bit, but the provided space heater kept us warm enough.
Great stay close to Arcola/Arthur which was exactly what we were looking for."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing birthday night ;)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked this place on a whim and Amber was a responsive and friendly host from the get-go. The house itself has modern furniture that is well kept and very clean. The bed was SO comfortable! The area is quiet and peaceful. In the morning we visited the chickens but we did not see the goats (it’s probably too cold for them!). My favorite part was staying in the hot tub at night and soaking in the sights and sounds of the countryside. This place is perfect for quiet and romantic getaways and I would highly recommend this to others! My only complaint is that the value seems a bit high for having no internet/wifi or tv. However, the hot tub and full kitchen is a GIGANTIC plus. But we were not bored, we enjoyed being present with each other and I would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Some of the concerns others noted we did not experience at all on our 2 day stay! It was the perfect little place and hot tub was easy and amazing!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice time away from the stress of work and everyday life.

2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was pleasant and lived up to its descriptions. I particularly enjoyed the hot tub and the host’s responsiveness. Nonetheless, there was an unidentifiable stench and problems with a clogged bathtub, but apart from those issues, it was an excellent spot for a getaway."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amber immediately helped us when we had an issue. great communication
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay! We were stopping for the night on our road trip and it was convenient and perfect for our family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Intimate and private
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, peaceful and beautiful little home. There is no privacy though if that is what you are looking for. If it were my place I would put up 3 or 4 privacy panels between houses. That would make this place awesome instead of good. I rented primarily for the hot tub. I was disappointed in it because it barely has any jet pressure and again no privacy. It was more like a bath tub instead of a hot tub. It was clean and nice also though. If you want a little camp fire bring a bucket so you can fill it up with water. We were a little worried about the tall grass next to the pit catching on fire. The wood was all wet also and did not want to burn. Thank goodness we brought our own dry hard wood and a fire starter. Bring a roll of paper towels, ice and pest spray. There are a ton of flies but that comes with the country. The bed was super comfortable. We also saw a jaw dropping new moon that was right up there at the top of my favorite moons ever. The bathtub drained slow also"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing would come again!
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was cute, well decorated, and looked like the photos. The hot tub was a nice amenity. It was quiet although the owners do have a house on the property, it isn’t super close and we didn’t even see them. However, the inside of the home REEKED. The kitchen sink and shower drain were both obviously clogged and hardly drained the water. The shower water was freezing cold pretty much immediately after turning it on. The outlets on each side of the bed did not work. One of the outlets in the kitchen was hanging out of the wall. One of the lights next to the bed was missing a lightbulb. The entire place had moths, flies, and ants inside."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great night staying at Amber's tiny house, and are already thinking about how to plan our next trip to stay here! Although it is on a busy road, inside the house is quiet and peaceful, and the setting is just great, with fields all around, and chickens and sheep to greet you in the morning. The house itself is cute, small, and comfortable. Amber was very responsive, and left a light on for us so that we could easily see and find the house when arriving after dark. Just no complaints whatsoever, and looking forward to staying again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very sweet , peaceful, and full of the Goodness of God loved the white and purple lavender ! takes you away from the busy world"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber was very quick to respond and had clear instructions. The home was amazing and exactly as described but even better in person. We would definitely stay here again and most likely will!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully comfortable, lovely space, would stay again in a minute!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful country retreat! The hot tub was impeccably clean, and having the fire pit so close meant we could have the best of fireside & soak! The kitchen was spotless, and well stocked with everything we needed to cook during our stay. Literally the perfect spot for a girls’ night away. The Broom Corn Festival happening the same weekend was good timing on our part. Would highly recommend, and hope to return!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay very clean and good energy. We got to see the farm animals in the morning and got to enjoy the hot tub as well. Everything we needed was right there we packed only very little which was nice. So well organized that even though it’s a tiny home it’s spacious. Given it’s in the farmlands there isn’t much to do but it gives you a nice break from reality tech free to spend time with your significant other. We had board games and got to enjoy cooking together and talking!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful country setting, coming from downtown Chicago we enjoyed the animals and corn fields. We came in after dark and it was very hard to find the turn in, it would be helpful to have at least a reflector or even a solar light at entrance off highway 133."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place out in the country. Well furnished. Great town and neighboring towns as well. Super friendly restaurants and bars. Hot tub was a nice add.
Outside light in front of home had no switch to turn it off. Was difficult to sleep as it was right outside front window. Just a call out that there is no TV or WiFi. My bad as I probably would have passed on it if I had realized that. Otherwise great accommodations."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we were looking forward to a quiet, relaxing getaway... This was fantastic. Check out the library, which is gorgeous, and the Walldogs murals, they're amazing. and the painted brooms too. The Visitors Center, next to the groovy Hippie Memorial, are both worth the stop. Aikman's Zoo in Chesterfield is very nearby and the drive through was cool. If you're hungry head to Yoder's Kitchen in Arthur, the Saturday buffet was plentiful and replenished often. Thank you for allowing us to stay in a great place to explore and chill."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I came with two teacher friends, it is our 11th end of summer girl’s trip. We came on an unusually hot day and didn’t get to enjoy the beautiful setting, hot tub or fire pit. But they are great amenities. The tiny house is as tastefully decorated as the pictures show!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome as usual! We’ll be back to unplug again soon!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful, simple place to hang out and relax. We would definitely do it again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a cute place to stay! You can tell they put so much thought and love into all the details. The hot tub was wonderful - lots of fire flies! 😍 We loved that it was on a little farm and we got to see sheep and chickens.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay so much. It was rainy and storming but that was fine. Oddly, the best part was no tv! We talked and played trivia allowing us the reset we needed. Gorgeous place with great surroundings. Loved exploring Arcola and Arthur."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A cute little cottage for those who wish to get away from it all, sit outside and enjoy a bucolic setting near chickens, corn fields and sheep. No wifi so you can really relax!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a very cute and comforting space. The decor and setup was lovely. The host was extremely kind and flexible with check in. We had been traveling with a toddler and this place was wonderful to stop at a relax for a night. It was very clean which we appreciated and the layout was perfect.
We did come during a thunderstorm which didn’t allow us to utilize the outside space. I’m sure on a nicer day that outside patio would have been awesome.
We appreciated our host and our stay and love their little plot of land."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great stay,
such a cute little place to get away and relax!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,lovely place. very private.Great place to get some rest.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Went out there to tour EIU & UIUC from Chicago. Right in the middle and not a bad drive! It doesn’t have a TV or WI-FI but like if you’re looking to disconnect, it makes the perfect choice. Hot tub was amazing, and shocking to see actual stars in the sky. You can hear the cows mooing and have a straight view of the farm animals the host has.
Overall i would definitely love to come back and pretend to live the farm life."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ambers place was super peaceful. We definitely enjoyed it!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here! It was the perfect spot as we were traveling through Illinois. Easy to find and cozy inside!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay in the middle of nowhere! This really is a ""Tiny Home"", perfect for 2 people! The only thing I would bring is maybe a bluetooth speaker. There is no radio or tv."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. It was everything the host advertised. Great place to go to get out of the city and relax.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amber's was so comfortable and relaxing. Everything in this tiny house is beautiful and clean! The hot tub is a great feature! We also enjoyed the fire pit. The view of the cornfield and chickens and sheep just add such great character to the place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Amber’s place and everything was just as perfect the second time around! Looking forward to visiting again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Tiny House! The smallness of the place creates closeness. The lack of technology was actually a plus! We loved having no TV, it creates conversation! Even though it was quite windy outside, we still enjoyed the hot tub and our friends to the south: the sheep and chickens. My wife loved the Farmhouse decor.
Great visit!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was adorable. It is simply and fashionably decorated. When the new landscaping grows up a bit, the privacy in the hot tub will be excellent! We only went in at night, as it felt the most private. We enjoyed seeing the farm animals out the windows - made it feel that much more quaint. We enjoyed our time very much!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable place. Easy check in and amber is great with communicating!! Would definitely recommend if anyone is looking for a nice little get away!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little Airbnb, adorable decor, cozy, easy check in, cute sheep outside, quick communication, close to restaurants. Other than us not being able to use the hot tub, it was a great stay. :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host! First time AirBnb user and wasn't disappointed at all! Pretty cheap in comparison to a hotel. My only cons are that I would prefer an AirBnb that isn't on the owner's personal property, even though that wasn't an issue during my stay at all."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very clean and cozy place to stay. This is a place where you can come to relax if you come from the city. This is what my fiancé and I were looking. A peaceful place to relax. Amber was excellent and gave clear instructions, which was a plus for me."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice little cottage, we enjoyed it very much. Everything was clean and welcoming. The hot tub was great! Nice to be in the country, but not far from multiple towns. I think the only drawback to this location is that there is a bit of traffic noise through the night. We would stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful experience filled with quality time and great memories. We booked for the hot tub and it did not disappoint! The cleanliness of the entire home was pristine and we would absolutely return to stay in this home.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place to stay while my husband and I went to visit his family. It was super cold and she left an extra heater for us which helped so much even though we lost power for a couple of hours one night. I’m a little sad that we didn’t get to use the hot tub but we will definitely be coming!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! Great cozy place to have a night away. Everything was great except a slight sewage odor especially when flushing or using water. Overall it was a nice Airbnb.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great place to rest for the night while traveling through many states. It was big enough for toddler, husband, and I. I loved that it had all the amenities of an actually home—just in a smaller square space. We don’t make this trip often, but when it comes time, we would come back again! Also, the comfy bed and robes were a great added bonus 😃"

There was attention to detail in everything from the decor, to a tea kettle on the stove, to the provision of robes for the hot tub. The space was spotlessly clean. What a find! Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was so clean and charming! Would def stay again!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot! Very quiet but just a couple minutes from restaurants in town. Will stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a special place to stay. Great place to sit outside and enjoy a fire. Take a dip in the hot tub. Then a comfortable night's sleep in a comfy bed. Thank you for creating such a perfect place to get away. ❤️
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The was such a wonderful place to stay! Between the hot tub, the sunsets, and the beautifully furnished home, it was so peaceful and relaxing. Amber was a wonderful host and a lot of thought was clearly put into making the place cozy and comfortable for guests. Would absolutely recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our brief stay at the tiny cottage. Very tastefully decorated.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A luxurious space! Thoughtful host!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber is amazing and this place is just as adorable and comfortable as the pictures let on.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little house was fabulous! Fresh, homey, clean, simple. We hiked at Charleston Lake and Fox Ridge. We ate at Yoder’s and shopped at Shady Crest Market. We visited the pumpkin patch in Arthur.
Amber was a PERFECT HOST and went out of her way to provide dry wood and new lighter fluid so we could have a fire after the rain!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber was always very responsive when I had any questions. House is perfect for a couple or close friends/family as it is a studio. The space is of much higher quality than other Airbnbs that I have stayed-quality craftsmanship and very clean. I look forward to staying again in the future!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Gave our family some nice quiet time to reconnect. Super clean and cozy. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. Would love to visit again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and great host!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful property out in the country. Very clean and peaceful environment. Perfect to getaway from the noise. It is located next to the primary home so privacy when using the hot tub or fire pit may not be possible. Still was worth the stay. We loved it.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute camper on a beautiful property. Lots of trails to hike in the woods on their property and a lot of other hiking nearby. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the outdoors. Rebecca and her husband are both very nice and very welcoming. I hope to be back in the future.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was pretty good. Jennifer was a very responsive host and was willing to answer calls or messages within a few hours. I had a longer stay.
My only critiques were regarding cleanliness and noise. I will say that when I checked in there was a lot of white pet hair on the ground scattered throughout the place and a slight odor too. The owner has a dog that is sensitive to outside noises and will bark anytime you go in/out of the door, which can get annoying at times.
Newer privacy curtains were installed in the bedroom, but they still let in a lot of light in the mornings. The kitchen ones are the same and none for the ones in front of the sink. If you’re staying for a longer period, you’ll want to bring your own pots and pans. There are the minimal basics but you’ll want more if you like cooking. The shower and bathroom are nice. Overall, for short-time stays I think it’s a good place but it’s unfortunate it doesn’t have washer, dryer, microwave, and tv."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Jennifer’s place was so cozy! It is a great location and the perfect size for my needs. I’d definitely stay there again!
2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was glad to find an Airbnb in Charleston, but would have appreciated a little more privacy. No curtains in the kitchen which looks straight into the bedroom and very sheer curtains in the bedroom. The host was very nice and lowed the heat after we requested."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice stay. the room was quaint, comfortable, clean, and very peaceful. I enjoyed the amenities and especially liked the shower. The room is also in a great location in relation to the town, the freeways, and surrounding cities. I recommend a stay at this location."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was clean and neat. It suited our needs for a short visit. Definitely read the narrative - there really ISN'T a TV, microwave, coffee pot, or toaster in this cottage apartment. Could use some window treatments for privacy at night - just sheer curtains in bedroom but none elsewhere.
Enjoyed the coffee shop just a few blocks away."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,7
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, but no curtains in the main area hang out area, the kItchen. And the curtains in the bedroom are sheer like. It’s just nice to have the choice of privacy, especially in the evenings.
I had read a previous review regarding lack of window treatments but thought it would have been taken care of as mentioned in the response.
Also, the bedroom door was broken at the top hinge. So you have to lift the door a bit, then push it to get it to shut.
But otherwise, very nice, clean, quiet and close to the main street square. The Bluetooth was a nice surprise for my daughter.
Thank you."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! There is a cute garden in back and the location is perfect. Everything you’d need is in the Airbnb and it’s very considerately put together!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Pleasant stay, quiet neighborhood, attentive hostess!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer was a fantastic host! The place was peaceful, cozy and impeccably clean. The host is very responsive to any needs or questions. The unit was set up to be a wonderful retreat and is just minutes from everything in the area. Highly recommend it."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable. Great value
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jennifer was very accommodating and the house was super clean!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, clean and close to downtown"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and convenient space. Easy check in access and great communication with the host. I enjoyed the back porch in the mornings and waking up to the beautiful gardens outside the windows.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice unit for short stay
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jennifer was a great host and the place itself was nice and cozy. Only drawback for me was that there were almost no curtains, except for thin ones in the bedroom. Otherwise the area is nice and quiet and this is a great place to stay if looking for a place while in Charleston or Mattoon."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay! Check-in instructions were easy to follow and everything was just as we expected. The high ceilings and big windows made the space welcoming even on dreary days. The porch and all the wildlife (squirrels, bunny, cardinals and other birds) in the backyard were a nice bonus. It was great to be in a residential area and a short walking distance to the square."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was perfect for a weekend getaway. It was within walking distance of downtown and campus. It was also within driving distance of Fox Ridge State Park which made for a great day of hiking. The place was cozy, clean, and exactly what we had in mind when we booked it. Jennifer made check-in very easy and was very informative and responsive. Definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue House was an inviting, relaxing space to spend a weekend away. Jennifer made some great suggestions on things to do around town - from the lake to the local coffee shop! The light filled space was clean, well appointed and as advertised. The soaps and shampoos were lovely as well as the bedding. Mornings spent on the porch with coffee were a delight as was finishing a long day next to the fire pit in the back. Parking was easy and so was communication during check-in. If you find yourself in Charleston for work or a weekend getaway - this is the place to stay!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a very cute unit and the host is very responsive with issues. However, if your renting for a longer stay it does lack some essential ammenities. First off there is no living room and no window treatments in the kitchen. You'll need to bring your own TV and microwave and if you want a quick morning coffee there is just a stovetop percolator or a teapot."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Private cozy and comfortable
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great property- very clean, easy access, and close to town"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was great! Booked our trip the night before and she accommodated us and got the place ready in time! She was very fast at communicating. While there were no blinds in the kitchen area, Jennifer said she will have them the next time I come back! The place is wonderful and very very clean - not a spec of dust in sight! Nothing but great things to say about this place."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place for anyone visiting EIU or Coles County. Also, if you are a runner, there's a perfect running spot just down the road. Will definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for 3 nights. Communication was very good. The neighborhood was quite & easy to get to. The cottage was very clean and had everything we needed. We thought there should have been some curtains in the kitchen for privacy.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was just what I needed. A nice, cozy suite where I could get some work done and get some rest.
The most outstanding features were the quiet neighborhood, Jennifer's responsiveness/ease of check-in, and a really comfortable bed.
I'll almost certainly be back the next time I have to stay over in Charleston."

Jennifer was great to work with. The refrigerator broke before our stay and she notified me right away. We decided to go ahead and stay and I’m glad we did. I would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host who is very responsive. Wonderful little spot. I appreciate that there wasn’t a TV to distract. Perfect place for a long thoughtful weekend. The sound of the actual bell from the courthouse took me back to my small town roots. Really charming area.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very homey and clean! Comfortable bed. Clean and was an overall good experience.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place! Super clean! Cute little side porch to hangout on. The host was very accommodating and all out just amazing ! I will definitely be visiting here again next trip in town.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute place in a nice, quiet neighborhood. It is in walking distance from the square which was great. We walked up there every day. The weather was beautiful while we were there and she has a couple chairs out on the porch which we really enjoyed. She also has a fire pit that she let us use which was very enjoyable also."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the Blue House. The space was perfect for a couple and the decor was adorable.
You can walk to a coffee shop in the town square. There is a gorgeous hiking trail a quick 7 min drive away at Lake Charleston. And Jennifer is the perfect host."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place is comfortable and convenient for anyone traveling to Charleston, IL. She is a very attentive host and communicates promptly and clearly! We'd stay there again."

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay while visiting EIU.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Really cute place for two! Very clean and cozy. And Jennifer left chocolate so she’s got my vote for sure!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, clean place. Walking distance to a cute coffee shop and a couple bars. Very quiet at night and a peaceful retreat from a bigger city."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! Bright and cozy with everything one needs. Clean and super well located (couple of blocks away from downtown and the Tarble Art Center). The apartment has a sweet side porch attached, perfect for a morning coffee. Jennifer was very attentive and very respectful of my privacy. Will stay here again, no doubt! I recommend it 100%. Thanks for everything, Jennifer! (Love your cherry tree, by the way)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place to lodge if your in town.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My only recommendation is longer strings on the fan/light. We were two older women and we had to perch on a chair to change the settings. A little precarious.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Truly an outstanding experience. Not only is the property outstanding and exactly as described, the owners were friendly, responsive and went above and beyond.
A storm came through the area early in our trip and it knocked out both the WiFi and television. The owners had a repairman out within hours and showed up themselves with a GIANT new TV.
Plenty of space. Clean. Quiet neighborhood.
Wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in the area. 5 stars isn’t enough to capture the experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very helpful and responsive
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at Jill's place 2 separate times on our 18 hour road trip. Once on the way to our destination, and once on the way home. We had a good stay- plenty of space for a family, friendly hosts, nice neighborhood, and it was within walking distance to a park.
One thing I would like to mention is that there are train tracks close by. The train blows it's horn several times in the late evening and early morning (between 5-7 AM.) It's not ideal if you are a light sleeper like me, or have kids that you don't want to wake! Otherwise our stay was nice."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great choice usually stay in hotels while there won’t be doing that anymore great space with good communication from start to finish highly recommend
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute place! Charming, clean, and beautifully decorated, not to mention spotless! My friend and I needed a place to crash after a concert in Effingham, and we got that, plus a lot more. I would definitely stay here again if I was ever in the area!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jill‘s place was perfect for our visit to Mattoon!
The house is spacious and stocked with all the necessities we needed for our stay.
It’s in a nice and quiet neighborhood near everything we needed to do and get to in Mattoon.
Jill and Jerry were great hosts! We received information before arrival, they checked in with us during our stay and quick response when I had a question while there.
We had our grandsons with us and the two bedroom layout worked out great for us. Having the half bath in this home is a plus!
Totally recommend Jill’s house for your travels.
We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay here. the house was much bigger than the photos looked. we were surprised to learn the couch was also a sofa bed, although we ended up not using it. The kitchen was super functional with all the basic essentials included. Jill was super responsive and even agreed to late check-out in case we needed it, even though we ended up leaving right on time. Loved the cute foyer and open kitchen and dining space. will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House is quite nice, pleasant, easy to find, get into, a few stairs, as older houses do. Nice neighborhood, quiet. Enough cooking and eating items, condiments, etc. which is nice! The bedding; no luxury, I sweated a bit, but - decent, fine.
Only prob – I am so sensitive to fragrances that I must use fragrance free soaps, detergents, cosmetics, etc. (It’s a pain). I asked before I rented. (Answer: only Tide free and clear was used.) Alas I came late, tired, and went to take a shower-- I ended up with towels, bedding, etc. all washed in Tide Ultra :~(( not good. Host might have tried to help but discovered too late. (also I like to just text em)
I had severe problems; itching and rashes- all over – for about a year and -drs!
I am also making a mental note to always inquire if there is a handheld shower head in the shower. They have a very nice tub and shower – wall fixture only - still nice! I appreciated the place very much! Thank you!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved Jill's home. It was one of the best Airbnb's we have stayed at. She thought of everything from extra blankets to stain remover for clothes.

I will definitely stay at Jill’s place anytime I am in the Mattoon area. The house was spotless and very comfortable. We used the house as our base for a hunting trip and it was perfect for our needs.
I highly recommend stay at Jill’s place. The price was extremely fair and the ability to cook our meals at the house helped stretch our vacation budget dollar’s.

We would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was well stocked & is updated. The area surrounding the house is quiet. The only problem I encountered was finicky WiFi & that may have been an area problem. Queen bed is comfy but I would use different sheets. I would recommend staying here
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Jill's Brickway Retreat exceeded our expectations. The home was spotless when we arrived. Jill was flexible with regard to our check in time as one of my son's was arriving ahead of me which was very much appreciated. The home is in a well established neighborhood close to the downtown.

,,,"I would like to start off by saying the place was beautiful, but there were some very alarming things. I arrived to my airbnb late at night so I awfully tired. I first tried to take a shower only to learn that the shower didn't work, as this was not stated in the description of the airbnb.lastly once I picked a room and laid down only to jump up in shock..the top decorative pollow and decorative blanket had a really obnoxious odor, I quickly sat up with discuss and began to worry that I might be laying in someone else's body fluids. I then hurried over to the room my daughter was about to lay in ,and what do you know yet another disturbing disgusting odor of some body fluids.and God knows what that could mean. I didnt want to travel again due to me not being from the areaand I had already traveled 3hrs on the road helped my daughter unpack. So my daughter and I began to wash the smelly blankets in order to get some sound sleep. the next day I contacted the host and mywassherude"
