It’s tucked into a cute suburban neighborhood that is so peaceful and quiet. The tiny home itself was very beautiful & had everything you could possibly need for your stay. We even cooked our dinner on the stove with the provided kitchenware. Devon is an amazing host, very responsive and attentive.
Don’t forget to say hello to StreetTaco the neighborhood stray kitty :)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable place! Made me wish I was staying longer!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in a nice and peaceful neighborhood. Guest house was clean, and the amenities were good. I will definitely stay here again when I come back in town. Devon was a great host: friendly, responsive, and easy going.
The only things I'll note that might be an issue for some people are these two things:
- If you use the restroom a lot like I do throughout the night, then you do have to go downstairs to use it. The bedroom is upstairs.
- The shower is small. For me it wasn't an issue, but if you're a person that needs some space to shower, then it'll be a tight squeeze."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little house! If you’ve ever been to Ikea you’ll feel like you’re in an IKEA showroom (which was fine with us- we love Ikea). We didn’t stay long enough to need the kitchen but it had all the appliances, dishes, spices to make a meal if we needed. The night lights on the stairs helped during the night. The wicker swings were nice in the early evening. Close to the highway. Safe neighborhood. Very good find!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We passed through Wichita Falls for a move and had a '16 foot Penske truck. Devon made sure the truck was accommodated for by making space in their driveway. We felt extra safe with our belongings there in the cul de sac neighborhood.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Devon’s place. It was cute, clean, and well-stocked. The only caution I’d give is if you’re severely allergic or reactive to air fresheners or artificial fragrances like I am, maybe message Devon ahead of time to let her know. There was a wax warmer plugged in when we arrived that I unplugged immediately and was able to manage through the night, but Devon was kind and accommodating in other ways and I think this is something you could be open with her about. Otherwise no complaints whatsoever!"

It is tastefully decorated and the bedroom on the second floor has an extremely comfortable bed, but best of all….there is a private balcony to enjoy your morning wake up cup of coffee. If you are an early riser you will get to enjoy many birds cavorting and swooping around the trees in the neighboring yards. I loved the view into all of the neighbors’ yards and got to see a happy little girl swinging in a hammock with her puppy while I was doing my morning Chi Qong exercises in the early morning sun."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is so cute but in an older neighborhood. The outside could use updating…has old wood siding…some broken in the back, but the inside was as pictured.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was a very responsive and thoughtful host! We had a couple issues with a leaky ceiling and bugs but she was very responsive and fixed or planned to fix the issues. The main space was darker than we like with no lighting overhead. The neighborhood does not have sidewalks for strolls but around the corner is MSU with a great campus to walk through. The mattresses could use some updating, there were foam toppers but we still fell towards the middle of the beds. We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen and found almost everything we needed!

I highly recommend this home to anyone traveling to anyone traveling to or around Witchita Falls."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was great and quick with responding to our messages. The home was a bit old fashioned for us, but that’s just a matter of taste/preference. We would’ve enjoyed more lighting throughout the home to brighten it up as it was dim throughout. We weren’t able to use the TV as it had a purple hue on any settings/channels we used and made it difficult to watch anything."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Shanon was great…quick on communicating and the house is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood behind the university close to everything especially the mall. The beds are comfortable, the house was neat and the decor fits…she even ensured the temperature was set to our liking prior to arrival.

The neighborhood is quiet, safe and well kept. The house is super cute, comfortable and well designed. All the appliances were in great working order. The beds and furnishings were very comfortable and good quality. Not sure if Shannon is an Interior Decorator but if she isn't, she should be, the design is very nice and relaxing. Our dog, Oliver, enjoyed the back yard, which has a nice wood privacy fence and lots of trees. Nice patio area to enjoy a glass of wine or coffee while your pet runs around.

The most amazing thing about the stay was communication with Shannon. She really always responded very quickly to all the queries and was able to answer any questions we had. Every now and then we also found a little surprise at the door (the banana bread was great!). Shannon was also very flexible when we had to book an additional 2 nights at short notice.

2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Shannon's house is wonderful! My family of 6, which includes four children 10 and under, stayed here for 6 weeks this summer. We all had plenty of room and we were very comfortable. The house is in a great location. It is a nice quiet street that is only minutes from everything you would need. Shannon was great too! She went above and beyond when it came to making sure our stay was perfect. When small issues came up, as they do in any house, she addressed them immediately and it was like it never happened at all. Normally being away from home for extended periods of time is stressful, but Shannon made sure this wasn't the case. In addition to the wonderful hospitality, she was also very knowledgeable about the area and recommended many places to us when we asked. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely stay at Shannon's again!"
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Setting up our stay and communicating with Shannon was seamless. We were able to get settled without any troubles and the home was set up nicely. Each room and bed were comfortable with nice touches to give a home like vibe during our stay. The kitchen was larger than expected and the backyard had great potential. Although it was very hot once the sun baked it. We enjoyed nice conversation on the patio and porch with multiple outdoor seats and a table.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for us and Shannon was amazing. We actually split our time between both this and the Glenwood Haus. the Fain Casa is nicer and in a slightly better neighborhood. Shannon was amazing at working with us as my schedule adjusted twice and we needed to modify dates for our stay. She also was quick to respond to any questions. There was an issue with the freezer and she was there with a replacement in less than 24 hours and even brought us a cooler of ice the same day I notified her. I highly recommend either of the houses and Shannon for your stay in Wichita Falls.

My family and I had a wonderful and very nice stay in Shanoon house. The house is lovely, and even more spacious than we thought (by the photos we saw). Location was good and just 12 minutes to Sheppard AFB, and just 5 minutes driving to the Sikes Senter mall. The house is on a major thoroughfare which made it easy to find but we did not get noise from the street. I'm so great full for how kind that lovely hosts, they were available for any questions I had. The neighborhood was a beautiful and very safe and secure. Close walk to nearby restaurants.

The house was very clean and organized, yet cozy and we felt right at home as soon as we walked in. It is nicely furnished and though an older home it has been updated with modern appliances and other touches. Shannon had purchased some food for us which was a nice touch and much appreciated!
The house is well situated being only a few blocks from 3 major thoroughfares and Midwestern State University, yet the neighborhood was very quiet and there was little traffic in the area.
The carport was a great plus since we didn't have to leave the car in the hot sun on an asphalt parking lot at a hotel.
We'll be back!"
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We are happy to have found for our first stay in US and Texas Shannon's house. The description was perfect and corresponds to what we have found. Her house was comfortable and cozy accommodation with all that is desired in travel. Not only, but important: hairdryer for the ladies, a quiet place for the men and a large TV service for the boy. We have received a small impression of life in a Texas town, from the manicured surroundings, the friendly neighbors and what it means to live in a hot and dry country. Thanks to Shannon for the peek into their beautiful decorated privat environment. Shannon great host and she was immediately in support when we needed help."

2014-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shannon was a great communicator, and we had no trouble coordinating our arrival. The house was spotless, charming and very comfortable. We only stayed one night, but ate some really delicious Thai food nearby (Orchid Thai), played putt putt golf on one of the nicer courses we've seen (The Plex), played 18 holes of golf the next morning (Champions Course at Weeks Park) before hitting about 5 different antique stores in the old downtown area. If we were there longer, I would have loved to ride bikes around the neighborhood or parks."
2014-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Shannon has worked on the house since our last stay, and the results are pleasing."
2014-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the outside, the home looks like the rest on the block, but once we went in, the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming.

There were plenty of towels, a gift basket with some toiletries and popcorn waiting for us in addition to food in the fridge.

It was a good overnight experience overall."
2014-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable warm cozy house. Shannon was very kind to deal with. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2013-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although I did not get to meet Shannon face to face, she was a wonderful host and extremely easy to work with and get ahold of. We rented her entire place for a weekend while we celebrated my grandmother's 90th birthday. Shannon lives in a nice part of town that was conveniently located to everything we needed access to. Her house was clean and extremely comfortable. We even brought our dogs who loved to lay out in her spacious backyard. I would recommend a stay at Shannon's home to anyone! I hope to someday meet her face to face and will remember this listing for my next visit to Wichita Falls."
2013-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fifth time staying at Shannon's home and we can't imagine a better place to stay. I do love the new addition of the "" Welcome Basket"". It has everything you could need to make yourself at home and brochures on local restaurants and things to do that can make your visit even better. We sometimes forget our toothbrushes and usually have to make a late night run to buy some, because of your thoughtfulness in including toothbrushes in that awesome basket you saved us a trip to buy some. Love that you are always coming up with little ways to make every visit even better. Can't wait to stay on trip number 6. Thanks so much for opening your home, it's so comforting knowing that we have a home away from home. : )"
2013-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect. Shannon is a lovely host and her home has everything you need and feels very cozy. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Shannon is very responsive and helped us navigate all things in Wichita Falls. Thanks Shannon for a great stay!
2013-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My party of 6, 3 adults and 3 children came to Wichita Falls and stayed at Shannon's place for 2 nights. This is not ordinary rental, barely furnished and cold; but instead it was warm and decorated with love, it was home away from home.
Shannon was there when we arrived and greeted us with a smile, showed us around the house and then exited with the reminder to contact her if we needed anything.
Wichita Falls is HOT in summer and the central AC was more than adequate. The king bed was firm and the queen soft. There was plenty of seating, and a fully fenced private backyard.
We had a great time there and will definitely be repeated customers of this delightful home in a nice university neighborhood, near everything!"
2013-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our fourth time staying at Shannon's wonderful home and it feels like our home. We are so comfortable there now that we just couldn't imagine staying somewhere else. And even though we keep missing meeting each other in person Shannon it truly feels like we know you and have met you and we consider you a true friend. You are super sweet and always accommodating and get back to us with anything we may want or need. We know Sanity is staying with her Grandma now but we came to know and love her as well, and she will truly be missed. We will back for time number five soon, we can't wait. Thanks again Shannon! You Rock!"

Our stay at The Vault ArBnB was really great. Much better than staying in any hotel room as you really feel at home the instant you walk in the door.
The accommodations worked out nicely, as it was very close to Sheppard AFB, and our reason for visiting this area to see our Airman stationed there.
Super-hosts Cody and Shea were extremely easy to interact with and very responsive to our needs. Great people and I would highly recommend staying at this place.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. Really unique location. We were driving from Colorado to Texas and needed a place to stay. A few quick thoughts:
1) Extremely well decorated. No clutter. Minimalistic. Modern.
2) Beds were great. Nice pillow options. High quality memory foam type beds.
3) Unique location. So, so cool to park in what used to be the drive-through teller. Loved that it used to be a bank.
4) Big windows. We love lots of natural light and this delivered.
5) Very downtown feel. But without the complexity of complicated parking. We almost could have fit our 30' travel trailer in the parking lot (although we didn't have it with us).
6) Lots of walkable things. Love that.
7) Kitchen was minimally equipped. Don't expect to cook a Thanksgiving meal but enough for very simple cooking.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique place and location. I am from Wichita Falls and remember this place when it was a Bank, to see it in transformation into two apartments was amazing. The space was bright with ambient light, tons of parking, and quiet (even though it was at the intersection of downtown streets). The two rooms were separated by the kitchen/dining/living area which gave great privacy to each guest.
Shea, allowed us to check in early, I did not even have to ask, I only had to notify her of our travel and arrival plans. They were readily accepted when I had to change my dates of travel, and even offered a refund when my new dates were cheaper.
I will deffinatly seek out this location for my future travels to Wichita Falls."

We hoped that we would be near the center of all the action while having a comfortable place to stay. Well, this BnB WAY SURPASSED that! As the listing notes, this converted bank (how cool is that?) is super cozy, well accommodated, and within walking distance of the Multi-Purpose Event Center, along with a ton of excellent restaurants. Seriously, it felt like it was almost too good to be true! Additionally, Cody and Shea, the hosts, were quick to answer any question and provide info and local guidance upon request.

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cody’s place is unique and charming. We found it surprisingly quiet considering its location in the heart of downtown. The location was easy to find, had ample parking, was close to some great restaurants and only a short distance to the freeway.
We loved the decor and the natural light in the unit, and found it to be the perfect size for our extended stay. It is easily accessible for someone with a wheelchair or other limited mobility, and was also just a short walk to our favorite coffee shop (8th St. Coffee House).
Cody and Shea were very responsive to our inquiries and all of our interactions were pleasant and polite. They have a real hidden gem here with the Vault.
We enjoyed our stay here very much!"

All of my questions before the trip were answered very quickly, I’ll definitely be staying here the next time I’m in Wichita Falls."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a perfect spot … we’ve stayed in several hotels and other Airbnb’s in Wichita Falls … this was the best experience, by far 😊
All the amenities were first rate … wouldn’t change a thing."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed in penthouses, townhouses, condos and luxury apartments since I first started using Airbnb. This has been my favorite. So cute, just enough space for 4 people, no space is wasted. Super quiet (at least over the holidays when we were there), we felt safe the entire time. Plenty of supplies, more than most airbnbs I've rented. The door code didn't work for us at 11:30 p.m. Christmas Eve night but Cody was quick in answering our phone call and we promptly got in, even at that hour. The most original stay we've ever had - a former bank! Very well done, lots of care and thought went into the reno. We will certainly use again. Thank you so much for an unforgettable, comfortable stay for my family during Christmas."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are stopping in Wichita Falls - this is a great place to stay. Unique, clean, amenities are great. WAY better than staying in a hotel. Will definitely check the availability if I am going that way again. Super Host!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was the first guest to stay in this Airbnb and it was so much more than expected! The location is prime with several places to eat and drink within walking or a short driving distance. Cody was very communicative and checked in to make sure everything was good a few times. There are several neat things about this home not to mention, it’s an old bank. Water bottles, coffee, and even a delicious piece of artisan chocolate were available for me. The home was very stylish with good quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash available for use. It took everything in me to not leave with a few of the plants that are used as decoration in the home, but available for purchase! However, I was staying here for work and wouldn’t be able to transport them back! I highly recommend this place! Can’t wait to visit again and check out the other side!"

Best of all was that it was one of the better stocked homes that I have stayed in. Dishes, pots, pans, blender and more! Plenty of washcloths, towels, paper products (except tissue) and extra blankets to snuggle up under while watching TV. I had a very nice stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Marilyn was responsive. She allowed us to check in early, which was a godsend for me as we were there for a funeral and had a lot of family issues to take care of and she gave us that space. Her home was a beautiful oasis for us to retreat to and be with our family."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a very good stay here. House was clean and in a great location for my short visit. Marilyn was extremely responsive on the few times I reached out to her. It was so hot while I was there so it was nice to be able to cool off in the pool. The pool was a nice size and the only negative thing is that there wasn’t a vacuum so I spent a lot of time skimming it so we could swim. it collected a bunch of leaves and grass and then when the kids would get in it would stir up what was in the bottom of the pool and float to the top. There were several floating devices in the barn which was nice. The bed in the master bedroom is very firm but the other beds in the house are a little softer. Overall, I enjoyed staying at Marilyn’s place and would stay again in the future."

When we return to Wichita Falls next summer this will be the first Air bnb that i will check for availability. Thanks again for making our trip relaxing and affordable!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great little getaway! Marilyn was nice enough to let us stay longer on the day we checked out due to the next people canceling. A great location and easy access to the highway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Marilyn's! The home was clean and comfy and had everything we needed for the week. We loved the pool, and the kids had a ton of fun with the provided pool toys and riding toys in the garage. It was great having garage access due to the heat and storms and there were games and some toys inside for when it was too hot outside. As a parent with small children, having the pool behind a locked gate was a huge plus, and we wouldn't have felt comfortable staying otherwise.
The location felt very peaceful and private and provided easy access to main roads and restaurants, attractions, etc. Marilyn provided easy to understand instructions for check in and out and we appreciated that the required check-out cleaning was minimal. She was very easy to reach when we had questions and was quick to respond. We'd love to stay again if we're ever back in Texas!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is one of my family’s favorite places to stay. It’s quiet and comes with everything you need for a getaway and to unplug (but also a work area if you need to get things done while away!). I like that there is plenty of space for kids and parents and grandparents without feeling like we are on top of one another. All the cookware you need and a beautiful backyard oasis just as described!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is great, very roomy and comfortable. We will definitely be staying here when we come back!!!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house itself is wonderful. I would suggest the Host add a Nest thermostat to remotely adjust temperature as the house rules of 80 in the summer meant the home did not cool below 78 until after 10pm. Also, being a first time AirBnB customer I had no knowledge base upon which to judge the cleaning fee of $150. After viewing the House rule requirements of guests the amount seems excessive and not in line with comparable AirBnB properties. As for the value, upon reflection a charge of over $600 for one night is a large sum but I was able to spend time with all of my children and grandchildren for the first time in over 2 yrs. My desire to visit with family outweighed my economic sensibilities, so for most people the cost will far outweigh the benefits. As for me, we will go back to a few adjoining suites and pocket the savings."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place with absolutely wonderful backyard! Loved the location! Marilyn was an accommodating host!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home! Perfect getaway for us and our son to get off base and relax! Pool and hot tub make it worth it!

2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"My stay at Marylin's home with six of my adult children/significant others/dear friends was filled with difficult car rental, multiple cancelled flights, and nearly not being able to see my Seabee son due to the base being closed.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Wichita Falls for our annual participation in the Hottern Hell Hundred. Our host, Marilyn, was very responsive prior to check in and during our stay.

The patio and pool are the stars of the property as well as the provided Starbucks coffee!"

We want to go back and stay for longer!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for our small family of four. We were in-town to visit family, and the Oasis was the perfect place to wind down at the end of the day. We used the pool less than we thought we would but it was great when we needed it. Check out instructions were simple and easy to knock out on our way out. Area was quiet, but close to shopping and restaurant options.
We will be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW!! This place was AMAZING! The house provided space and plenty of area for our family to relax and enjoy. The pool and hot tub are still being talked about by our kids (teenagers). Our host answered all my questions quickly and was very welcoming. We don’t come to Wichita Falls often, but the next time I’m even remotely close to the area, I’m going to try to book here again! If you’re lucky enough to find this house still available, you better book it fast!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic stay!! My first Airbnb(less than a year ago) had us sweep, mop, do alllllll the laundry; and they had a $200 cleaning fee. This experience was amazing; no stress of cleaning the whole house. Fantastic pool, hot tub, and house. We cannot wait to come back!"

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"House was nice, hot tub worth it and clean but pool was full of bugs with lawn not cut all the way down (host let me know on lawn care hold up due to rain) so mosquitos were rough.

Everything is well stocked. The kitchen has all the items you need. Beds are nice, bedding and towels are plenty.
Also, plenty of area in the house to lounge and enjoy the quiet."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came into town to visit my son at the base. Having a house was so helpful! The pool and hot tub put it in a perfect setting for us to relax, eat and enjoy rhe company while not trying to find things to do in town. Everyrhing was wonderful. Our visit was beyond amazing before he heads over seas. Thank you so much for having us!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a fantastic find. The owner has put in so many thoughtful convenience items. We were traveling with a 10 month old. She had baby shampoo and a baby spoon! Both items we had forgotten. The most impressive part of this is the floors. It was spotlessly clean. I was totally comfortable with my baby crawling around. The kitchen has everything you need to make family meals. The wifi and TVs have tons of entertainment options. Lastly the check in was via lock box. We will definitely stay here again and again!!!!!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easiest check - in we've ever had in 9 years and Air Bnb! The place was incredibly clean and the instructions were easy to follow.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jorge was an excellent communicator and always available to answer any questions. Other family members were supposed to be staying with me and that changed last minute, so I stayed alone. I have to admit that I was very nervous due to the area. It looked run down until you drive 5 minutes out where everything appeared to be. I was not bothered by anyone, the area just didn't feel safe at first glance. You had to really work with the door to lock and unlock it. I was only 15 minutes from the AFB to attend my son's graduation. All in all, the place was close to everything; shopping, dining, etc."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was okay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was a great and blessed experience, he was very responsive and great to deal with"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the start everything was great messaging with Jorge and getting all the information about our stay, but Jorge had an issue with my first booking at one of his homes where we couldn't stay because of some extra cleaning he needed to take care of because of the previous renters. he called immediately to offer another location at the same cost of the first only five minutes away from the first house. The house was very clean and the kitchen was fully stocked for cooking. if I'm ever in the area again I will definitely use Jorge services again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay very much!! It was very cozy and peaceful and everything we were looking for in a home away from home!! Jorge was amazing to deal with and was always very responsive!! Overall amazing stay!! Thanks Jorge!! 😊

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Visiting my youngest at Sheppard Air Force Base for the long Thanksgiving weekend. This was the perfect house for us and a couple of his friends. We felt very comfortable in the quiet neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with the items needed for the food we made. Only 15 minutes away from Sheppard AFB. It's an older house that's a bit worn but still comfortable for 4 adults. WiFi and streaming Roku TV available. Would recommend.

Both bedrooms were spacious and attractive. The living room was relaxing. Thanks for having us, Jorge!"

On a side note: there was a major water leak in the area (not at the house). When we alerted Jorge of this situation (late at night when we arrived back at rental) he went above and beyond to relocate us to another property if necessary. Fortunately, that wasn't required as the city workers repaired the water leak in the neighborhood overnight. It was very professional that Jorge responded quickly with a solution if needed."

I use air bnb a lot and this has to be one of my favorite places I’ve stayed! I was in town visiting my husband for his birthday who is currently training at the Sheppard Air Force Base, which is conveniently located less than a 15 min drive away. This is a safe place if you are solo traveling. It just so happened that 2 of my favorite places we ate at are less than a 5 min drive. If you’re looking for quick fast food check out Braum’s, and if you’re looking for somewhere a little fancier we went to Fox Hill Restaurant & Gardens for his birthday dinner. I’m very thankful for Lisa & Norm, they made my stay in Wichita Falls a memorable one! I highly recommend staring here (:"

The hosts were super helpful and accommodating throughout my stay. They even left some muffins and a sweet card when I arrived!

Lisa and Norm go above and beyond for all. It was an honor to be their guest.
Be well,
Kelsey"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband John is a repeat guest at Lisa and Norm's lovely guest house. They are always so responsive and accommodating. He works as a traveling ER doc in Vernon from time to time, and on this trip, he had the unenviable job of working 24-hour shifts on Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas. He spent Christmas Day resting up at the guest house. It is such a lovely and comfortable place, with beautiful gardens and decor, that it is surely the best option for him in Wichita Falls. A nice restaurant, Fox Hill Restaurant and Gardens, is 3 minutes away. He is delighted with this Airbnb and had a peaceful stay."

Lisa Or Norm made sure that I was comfortable, had everything I needed, and that they were accessible throughout my stay. It is very small, as long as you are prepared to not have a spacious environment, you'll be happy. They also make their back patio available for dining or just relaxing. It's a VERY quiet neighborhood. I would stay here again."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not say one bad thing about this place if I tried. I stayed here with my boyfriend because he is currently at Sheppard AFB, and it was a perfect little casita. It had everything you could need and Lisa and Norm even provide some things that you might have forgotten such as body wash, loofahs, deodorant and more! We stayed here over Thanksgiving and they went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable and they would always respond right away to any questions or anything we had over text. While we were staying here on Thanksgiving, Lisa and Norm provided a delicious meal for us because everything was closed and that meant a lot to us. I read a comment that said “you can tell that they host because they love it” and I couldn’t agree more. I will definitely be staying here if I am ever in Wichita Falls again if I could rate this place a 10/5 stars I totally would! Their hospitality is something that you can’t find often so I had a lovely experience."

Their patio area was extremely relaxing and a great place to watch the sunset.

I will repeat what another reviewer said I kind of feel bad I gave all those other 5 star when they Do not come anywhere close to this AirB& B . I give it 10 stars!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful people. Tucked away in a private little neighborhood, came to town to see my girlfriend at shepherd afb, not far at all. Lisa even baked some absolutely DELICIOUS muffins as a welcome gift. I would for sure book their spot again just for the muffins!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing value. Best Airbnb I’ve stayed in, maybe best lodging I’ve stayed in, and I recently had my honeymoon in Italy. Lisa has spared no expense and has thought of everything- homemade muffins, hand-written thank you note, face masks, wonderful smells, chocolates, candles and jazz music greeted me as I entered.

Lisa was very welcoming and went out of her way to show me the MSU campus and where I needed to be. I got a slice of zucchini bread to snack on; on my drive home. If I’m ever in Wichita Falls again, this is the place to stay. I validate all prior reviews of this guest house. Meets all your needs. The neighborhood is quiet and safe."

Tiny but has everything you need! And I mean EVERYTHING! That could be done by lots of host but the way they decorate the place is SO UNIQUE! So artistic! So thorough and so thoughtful! It shows how much they care! Not sure if there are enough words to describe the warmth and thoughtfulness you feel when you enter the place! Everything is marked to make your stay free of stress! Sparkling clean! And small but very comfy bed! I DEFINITELY would rent again if and when I'm in the area and need a place to stay!

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traveling alone and concerned about COVID exposure before seeing vulnerable family members I decided that airbnb might have less risk of infection opportunities. Lisa and Norm's apartment was amazing, not only was it super-clean, nicely decorated and more amenities than you'd find at a luxury hotel but in a quiet, charming neighborhood. Lisa made me very welcome and answered all inquiries quickly. This may be the first time I've ever given a place all 5 stars. Whenever my future travels go through Wichita Falls, this is the place I want to stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for me while working in Wichita Falls !

It’s in a winding street neighborhood with lots of trees and a little pond too. Lisa greeted me very warmly and provided helpful info about where I could pick up dinner. The cottage behind the main house is a perfect retreat for one guest. I was amazed at how many thoughtful amenities were packed into the space, yet it felt spacious! No detail was left out! There was a place for luggage, a cute writing desk, FULL kitchen and everything needed to prepare a meal, if one should choose to cook. Lisa and Norm even prepared a delicious dessert snack and a thoughtful welcome note. The place was spotlessly clean. I would highly recommend this charming rental for a solo traveler and if I travel through this way again, I’ll hope that it’s available! Kudos to the hosts, Lisa & Norm."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think the best thing I can say about this space is that when I called to tell my husband about it after arrival, I said ""I wish I could go back and adjust all of my other airbnb ratings because THIS is a five star.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem!! I was in town for a high school graduation/party, and this was the most beautiful, quiet, cozy place to retreat. The bed is SO comfortable, every detail and available item was thoughtfully selected, purified water cold in the fridge, fantastic A/C, easy in and out. I felt extremely safe as a solo traveler, I liked that I wasn’t inside their house so I didn’t have to be perfectly quiet, and I had every amenity I could have hoped for. Michelle is a thoughtful and helpful host. I found wonderful shops on her suggestions. I will 100% stay here again. Pictures are completely accurate. The bathroom is small, but functional and so cute. Wifi worked great! Sound machine was awesome. Oh, did I say this place was cute?? Soooo cute!
