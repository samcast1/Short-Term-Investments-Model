2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sheryl and her husband were great hosts and their place was clean and welcoming. Loved the cabin feel inside. Sheryl was a delight to talk to, I had to peel my sister away so we could get on the road. Room had everything we needed, including breakfast bars, and we were lucky to have the large, clean bathroom all to ourselves. Their golden doodle, Luna, was a sweetheart and a great co-host. Minutes to Scotts Bluff National Monument. Would definitely stay again!"

Next time I will try to book way in advance if at all possible. I have to mention Luna. What a bonus. The fact they share Luna with their guests is the cherry on top. Luna is no ordinary dog. The absolute best airbnb you can imagine. Thank you so much Sheryl , Jim and Luna for your hospitality, kindness and and extra care. I will definitely be back.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent two evenings at your home and enjoyed the relaxing and quiet moments. The shower was GREAT as was the COMFORTABLE bed and pillows. Where did you get those pillows! I really appreciated the refrigerator in the bedroom as well. Luna was a wonderful dog to offer her home too!
Your home was very calming. If I had any suggestions, I could have used a bit more light with my eyes. I wasn't able to work with the TV without having to had asked for assist and it wasn't that important. We have DISH at our home so wasn't familiar with this TV setup....this wasn't the first home I've had any concerns related to the TV. Just sharing with others the TV is not of DISH or Direct TV...I am rather old school but certain most people would know how to run the TV. The bathroom sharing worked out fine but just so others know, you maybe sharing a bathroom with a single or a couple.
I had a great time in Scottsbluff and I appreciate your warm hospitality. I'm sure others will too."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience! The bedroom has lots of pillows and space to unpack and settle in. It’s right between the bathroom and the hosts’ bedroom.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stop your scrolling and stay with Jim and Sheryl and Luna! An Airbnb experience I will never forget, although I honestly felt like I was welcomed into their family too. The most adventurous, generous and caring individuals that go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and their hospitality is off the charts, having anything you might need or have forgotten! Their home is stunning and the rooms are extremely cozy and you get to hang out with and love on their beautiful pup, Luna. Thank you so much for putting me at ease with my long drive. I had a wonderful night sleep and was completely relaxed. I hope to come back soon!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Sheryll and Jim's place for a week while working at the hospital. This is a bedroom with a very comfortable memory foam queen sized bed, a bedside table, bedside dresser, sitting chair, large closet with a dresser inside, two luggage racks and a small drink size refrigerator in the bedroom. The bathroom is just down the hallway and shared with another guest who rents the bedroom across from you. Sheryll and Jim use the bathroom in the basement. The shared space is a sitting room/living room, huge kitchen/dining room (one large space), outdoor porch, fenced in back yard and two street parking spaces outside. The community is a lovely subdivision where children still play outside and couples go for walks. Sheryll keeps you updated on all family activities that will be happening that week. I was able to witness a children's birthday party and participate in a girl's night Bunko game (dice game) when someone no-showed ( I won 20 dollars!) I was less than 10 minutes from the hospital and it worked great for me."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time in 3 years to visit the Bluffs in Scottsbluff and we prayed that we would be able to stay with Sheryl and Jim again. Miraculously it worked into their schedule. They are both so gracious and fun to visit with even concerning their own world travels. The room is spacious, the bed very comfortable and the hospitality is superb. It is so close to the Bluffs also for a great tourist attraction. We will gladly tell others to look them up for a stay.

Our host was in the driveway, so we visited with her. She gave us the tour and explained things to us then. This was great, because they were leaving for an event before our check-in time and would be back late that night. The neighborhood was very quiet and the Temper medic mattress allowed us a great nights sleep just like ours at home!

Special touches in the room and around the house are very comforting. I won't tell you to expect it but breakfast was either made or supplied to us which is huge. EVERYTHING there is thought of believe me. Make no mistake, these are world class people and we were fortunate to have met and stayed with them. They're personality and kindness are rare. They're home is also very nice so if your conditions are a concern this is the place for you. Make the right decision and choose Sheryl as your host."

2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sheryl's place was beautiful. We shared a bathroom with one other room and both our room and the bathroom were so nice. When visiting, we found out that Sheryl and Jim knew people we knew and were married by our brother-in-law. Sheryl served a delicious breakfast in the morning. She provided bottled water and snacks in our bedroom and also hangers on the wall for our towels. We really recommend this place."

The little extras like area maps and refreshments in the room just made it more special. Top notch experience!!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can't describe well enough how Mrs Sheryl and her family welcome me in their home. Their home was perfect home away from home. She takes care of her guests, she communicate with me in the morning before leaving the house. Breakfast is always offered even though I'm not a breakfast fan. And if you need help with whatsoever, she's willing to help you. she offered me ride back and forth to my orientation site, she showed me around town, dropped me at the airport. I accompany her and her grand daughter for ice cream which was fun. Amazing and stylish place to stay in Scottsbluff, absolutely lovely I every way. the house and the entire place was extremely stylish, clean and green. The room was clean and has this cool calming energy to it. The mattress is soft, very comfortable and suiting. Me being a morning person I always sleep pass my wake up time due to the comfortability of the mattress. There is just so much I can say about my staying at Mrs Shery home, I'll submit y saying it was way more than what I was expected being my first time there. THANKS THANKS THANKS"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great stay. Sheryl and Jim have a warm and welcoming home that was the perfect place to crash after a long journey. Some highlights were the extremely comfortable tempurpedic queen sized bed; homemade chocolate chip banana bread, bacon, eggs, and multiple servings of coffee; and most of all the friendly and familiar conversation with Sheryl and Jim. This place makes you feel at home and like a member of their family. Truly a gem - stay here!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sheryl and her family are super nice, friendly, warm and respectful. We enjoyed the conversations and interactions with them so much.

It was a perfect stay! Highly recommended to everyone who is looking for a great and warm stay."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wish we could have given Sheryl 10 out of 5 stars! Our bedroom was great (temper-pedic queen mattress), their wifi worked flawlessly so I could get some work done, the house has great space indoor AND outdoors (had breakfast on the back deck and listened to the birds sing). The house was within a 6 minute drive of anywhere we needed to go also! Above all, Sheryl was the best host- she made us breakfast both mornings we were there (cinnamon rolls and crepes)!!! Absolutely loved our stay, thank you Sheryl & Jim for your kindness & fantastic hospitality! =)"

Everything was perfect, from the super quick response, to the very comfortable room and bed with bottles of water and shower gel etc. The amazing breakfast in the morning and of course Sheryl and Jim.

2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, wonderful hosts, beautiful home, amazing bed and overall heartwarming hospitality. Would recommend time and time again."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House is split level with stairs up and stairs down, so if that's an issue, be aware. They do have an absolutely lovely Boxer who is your instant friend. You are staying in either the bedrooms on either side of the master bedroom, all sharing one bathroom, or using the two-bed basement room with an adjoining bath. You are treated like a member of the family and encouraged to use refrigerator. Inside and outside are amazingly decorated -- this house can hold a lot of people (they had five kids and are now empty nesters) in different areas without impinging on anyone's personal space. Lovely hostess-supplied gift baskets with toiletries, and tempur pedic mattresses! I could not have asked for a better stay in someone's home. Sheryl even cooked breakfast for everyone every day, taking everyone's dietary restrictions into account. I highly recommend this B&B."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying at Pinecone Beach and I can honestly say we will never stay elsewhere when visiting the Scottsbluff area if this place is available. Lawrence is always a wonderful host and our dogs are so obsessed with his yard that I think they were a little sad to come home!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing place to stay! We visited family and it was perfect, we had our family over for dinner a couple times because there was so much to do and it was spacious and clean. We had a big group and it fit everyone perfectly.

The outdoor space was fantastic with a fire pit, wood, patio furniture, corn/hole game, horse shoes. Excellent place to star gaze and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Walking distance to the lake.

Lawrence was very responsive with any questions we had, was also able to check in early! Overall cleanliness was ok. But I’m a clean freak so no matter where I go I think it could be cleaner! We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a little gem a stone’s throw away from the lake. The rooms are spacious, the living room is comfortable and the kitchen is large and well stocked.
The outdoor space is incredible. Two fire pits, horseshoes and a corn hole set are available to help entertain you and the family.
Loved the ample seating options in both the backyard and inside the house.
You won’t be disappointed if you book this Airbnb. Great place! Five stars!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Awesome house and an awesome host. Thank you for letting us stay!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Definitely want to stay there again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't tell you how happy I am with this rental experience. From the moment I booked the reservation to the end of my trip, Lawrence was in communication with me. I rented the house for a week when my daughter was getting married. He allowed us to have family dinners there as well as the rehearsal dinner at the lake house ( as my grand kids called it) The open space of the living area & kitchen made it easy to prepare meals and entertain. The bed rooms were comfortable. The main bedroom was gorgeous. The back yard was huge. The pictures don't seem to show how much space there is to entertain. There are more than enough for large gatherings. He provides tables & chairs for us. There are two fire pits which the kid enjoyed making smores one evening. Lawrence went above & beyond as a host. You can tell he truly enjoys sharing his family home. He even made a point to stop by to check on us. You won't be disappointed with this house."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host and great place to say. We had a severe storm pass through with tornados, large hail, and everything in between and Lawrence made sure we were safe and that our cars did not get damaged. We was AWESOME!! Jo"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location with a quiet neighborhood. The outdoor space was awesome. The host was extremely friendly, helpful and responsive. The place was very pet and family friendly. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lawrence went above and beyond to accommodate us like no host ever has in my 4 years on air Bnb! We were greeted with gifts and big spray upon arrival and made us feel more than welcome! The space is setup amazingly with cornhole, a shade area, fire pit (and yes he provided a bunch of wood) and motion activated lights outside so you can enjoy it at all hours. The inside was spacious and clean with an amazing master bedroom. 11/10 will definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house far exceeded our expectations. It was perfect for our family - the kitchen had everything we needed for our meals, it was very clean & welcoming. There were indoor and outdoor games available for everyone. There was wood supplied for the firepit. It was dog friendly with toys & treats for the dogs. It was a perfect stay & I would highly recommend this place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. We'd come back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pinecone Beach was a great stay. We were in town for an AKC Dog Show. The home was set up great for dogs. He left us pet friendly toys and treats along with pet covers for the furniture. Not to mention the HUGE fenced-in back yard for exercising our dogs. It was a fabulous stay for us and our dogs.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice location. Great value compared to hotel rooms cost.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Id like to give a shout out to the host Lawrence, he was very responsive and there was a few issues being the first tenants to be in this AirBnB recently renevated. I let him know about the issues and he was out there trying to make it feel like home. A decent sized piece of property to play horse shoes and corn hole he also has a fire pit to hang around and have a grand ole time. Also considering its winter the lake is dried up but i can only imagine the summer time when the lake is filled up. Not to far from Scotts Bluff which is a decent size town to get your amenities but very quiet neighborhood its very safe. I'd say bring your family and friends if your wanting to escape reality for a little bit."

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for a convention at a nearby hotel. The cost of Donna’s place was comparable for what we could’ve paid for a hotel room, but instead we got a whole lot more than just a hotel room. We were able to spread out and really enjoy our space, which was really nice. Everything was clean, tidy, and we had everything we needed to cook and clean up after ourselves.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our son's wedding and needed a home away from home. Donna's house was just perfect! Her house is very clean, the beds are super comfy, and the kitchen was outfitted with everything we needed. Donna even has some basic food items in the pantry! An added bonus is being able to park in the garage. We also loved how close this place is to everything in Scottsbluff. We even loved that Scooters is very close. I would stay here again if I am ever in Scottsbluff."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's property is as advertised. It is in a nice, quiet, safe community. I ran every morning that we stayed there. The cities/towns of Scottsbluff, Terrytown, & Gering are all easy to get to from it and it is close to places to eat and shop. Donna does an excellent job of communicating with those who are staying in her property."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was wonderful and clean, especially for the price. My kids loved it, and the location was in a nice, quiet neighborhood yet perfectly located for visiting attractions and stores. Donna was great at communicating and thoughtful in what was provided at the house. Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is in a central location convenient for western sight-seeing and great for a family. The kitchen is well equipped and has plenty of utensils and cookware one might need. Same for the bathroom and laundry room. So nice to have a spotless, cute house for our stay!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect home for our family. We had me, my 4 little kiddos, and my parents. The basement was a great hangout for all the kiddos and the back yard was a nice space for the kids to run around. Donna was a very nice host and communicated quickly."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Donna's place. Lots of space, clean, and well maintained."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful home and the pictures do not do it justice. The home has three bedrooms up (one has two twin beds) and another bedroom downstairs. The washer and dryer are newer and are a nice perk. The brand new grill in the garage was awesome to use on the hot days so we didn't cook and heat up the home. There is a TV and the WiFi is excellent. The home is more spacious than the pictures lead you to believe. Wonderful home and close to food, shopping, etc! Do not hesitate to book this property."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Donna's lovely, clean home. It was perfect for our family get together!

2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice home. Great communication and hospitality from Donna.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the largest, full-house Airbnb we’ve stayed in. It’s very spacious. I loved the decor and the vibe of the house - very, very relaxing and comfortable. Some may consider parts of the house ‘outdated’; but its well-maintained and so charming...I hope they never ‘update’ it! It was so comfortable and welcoming, we were anxious to get back after our day out exploring Scottsbluff to spend more time there. The water pressure in the shower was top-notch and the towels were the fluffiest, softest towels I’ve ever used. The internet is super fast and we enjoyed the apps on the tv. Wonderful stay!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is spacious, has 3 bedrooms plus one in the basement. I liked to sleep in the basement as it's quiet and stays cool in hot summer. The home has a good AC unit, good speed
optical internet and a big 2 car garage. Very good value!"

We made good use of the pots and pans that she has available to use. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone passing through Scottsbluff.
My one suggestion would be some kind of covers for the small windows in the bedrooms. We had a hard time sleeping in because the sun was rising very early every morning.
Overall we had a great stay!"

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean, cool set-up, comfortable, with plenty of room for the three of us. Located in a nice neighborhood, near to all the popular monuments or just a short drive away. Kitchen was well supplied with pans & utensils. Handmade soaps were a nice detail. Donna added a new gas grill; we weren’t prepared to use it but I would definitely go back and grill some grass-fed Western Nebraska steaks on that bad boy.
My two kids (21 & 16 y.o.) went for a long weekend to get away from Omaha during the pandemic. Figured we could see the sites on a scenic drive across Nebraska on Hwy 91 and Hwy 2 and around Scottsbluff with minimal risk, and it worked out just as we hoped it would. Donna’s house and her hospitality made the Scottsbluff part of the trip easy. I’d love to go back after the pandemic when we don’t have to social distance and would definitely stay at Donna’s place again."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna was an awesome host and house was a comfortable stay for our families visit to the area. One of the nice things we like about the house is the garage, even though its a nice safe neighborhood it's convenient to be able to stow truck in the garage at night so we don't have to unpack truck from day trips. Looking forward to our next stay!!"

I was able to message her and explain to her that I was in a car accident and that my car had been damaged due to hitting an Elk. She was so understanding and kind. She didn’t worry about not having someone stay at the AirBnB. She worried and cared about me as a person and wanted to make sure I was okay. That was the biggest blessing in this huge moment of chaos and anxiety to know that someone far away cared. She is an amazing person and I feel so blessed to have been able to have her there via the AirBnB app. She was so understanding. Amber thank you, from the bottom on my heart am so sorry I wasn’t able to enjoy your beautiful Airbnb because of my new friend who damaged my vehicle. Am so thankful though that you were there in this time of chaos. Anyone reading this long review make sure you stay at this amazing Lady’s AirBnB for me. Thank you again Amber. You are a Blessing!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's house is an independent apartment. The car can be done under a carport. That was convenient due to the bad weather.
The stores are close by.
The home features a good bed and washing machine and dryer.
The kitchen we found to be at least rested to make a meal.
The house is a good base to visit the rocks of Scottsbluff and Chimney Rock."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a spot to do laundry and give us a little extra space and this place was perfect. Clean space, comfortable beds, and everything we needed for a short stop. Check in directions were clear and there was plenty of parking. We parked in front as it was easy to get our stuff in and out instead of walking around the building from the covered parking. No issues at all but Amber seems like she'd be very responsive. Recommended to anyone needing some extra space when staying in Scottsbluff!"

We loved it! Such a convenient location too! Gas station, WalMart, Chili’s , Wonderful House Chinese, other restraints and Home Depot right there. The nearby park was very nice.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, everything was as listed. The space was easy to find and felt comfortable. Plenty of furniture but all on the smaller side and beds were very comfortable on the firm side. My only complaint is if you have sensitivity to scents it might not be for you. The laundry detergent was sented, the trash bags were sented, and they had a very strong plug in. All in the place was as expected and a great price for the space."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was short (traveling) but it was a safe place that was very cozy. Would stay again if ever I was in the area!!!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved this AirBnB. It was quiet and clean and they even provided K-cups and a few snacks which was such a thoughtful touch. We stayed for 5 nights. Having the carport with the 10+” of snow that arrived was especially nice. It was nice having Netflix in the evenings as well. Amber was so responsive and polite and we appreciated the work she has done to make the Airbnb a great place for a short or long term stay. Definitely recommend and will look to stay there again when visiting.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stop for my road trip! As a solo traveler, this was a safe and quiet neighborhood. I needed to work during the week, and the WiFi was great. I also selected this place because it was close to Scotts Bluff National Monument and Agate Fossil Beds, but the town of Scottsbluff is great - Cappucino and Company was a nice place to work, grab a sandwich, smoothie, or salad and a latte. There’s also plenty of stores, Safeway and so much more nearby. For one person, it was so spacious - even two couples or a family would be more than comfortable here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely would 10/10 recommend this amazing place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay while in town for work. Awesome communication from host.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a great time we were stuck in the town due to a storm in our way back from Sturgis and they were able to accommodate so quick. The internet was down but we made the best of it. Great communication and a really clean place.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I dont want to write a public review.
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"Cute, Clean, Cozy apartment. Walking distance to shopping and a great park. Easy to find and quick to check in. We really enjoyed our stay and will plan to stay again soon."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"the appartment was spacious clean, well equiped and good located.
A good place to stay"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great comfortable place! Amber is an excellent host and checked in to make sure we had everything needed during our stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,spacious. plenty of cupboards in the kitchen. convenient location .
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this space! The apartment was very spacious, it worked so well for our family. Tons of room for our toddler to run around and play, an eat in kitchen, and laundry in the unit. The laundry room was so big we actually put our baby’s pack and play in there because it was nice and dark but had good airflow. My toddler loved her time there and kept calling it her “holiday house”. We’ll definitely stay here if we’re in town again."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice rental. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Will rent again in the future! Thanks Amber"
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"My cousin and I spent 2 nights here. It was fine for a short stay as we didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment. There were good and not-so-good things about ""Cozy Apartment"".
I have stayed in dozens of AirBnb's and have friends that are hosts...and in comparison this apartment could be taken to a new level with a few tweeks in terms of communication, maintenance amenities, and decor.
Good: 1/Apartment was roomy 2/Location was central 3/Carport was an added bonus.
Not so Good:
1/Communication:
Had the host checked in with us after arrival a few issues perhaps could have been remedied.
2/Maintenance.
Bath tub drain toggle would not close so was unable to take a bath. There was an older/rusty faucet in bathroom.
The exterior entry door to apartment was filthy (not very welcoming or hygienic)
Hot water was adequate and was unable to turn it up to be hotter.
3/Amenities:
Kitchen had a Keurig machine but no pods or any other type of coffee maker.
No dish towels, only one dish cloth. Fortunately, we found a roll of paper towels under the counter.
No amenities such as coffee, creamer, salt and pepper, etc for even a one night stay.
Found big bottle of body and shampoo in bath cabinet but had to search.
4/Decor:
Apartment didn't feel cozy, it felt more like a Motel 6 with a kitchen. Very basic decor without a lot of attention to details or aesthetics.
No place to hang or put coats, etc inside the door.
2nd bedroom had very flat, old pillows and the tiny, disproportionate bedside lamp was inadequate. No tables or benches to lay things out.
Upgraded curtains would make bedrooms much more inviting.
There were multiple screws in the walls with nothing hanging from them.
Overall, it was okay, but nothing special. I think for the price, we could have done better perhaps at other Airbnb's or at a motel in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,..
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in Scottsbluff! Would recommend 100%
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were pleasantly surprised by the location of the Airbnb. Close to eating establishments and Walmart. Very easy to locate and convenient to both Scottsbluff and Gering. Kitchen well supplied. Owner very helpful with all needs. Covered parking in back convenient for inclement weather. Enjoyable stay!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit provides a comfortable, quiet, and a clean retreat. It was such a surprise to find an Airbnb like this in Scottsbluff! Its location made for easy commutes to Gering, Lake Minatare, Scottsbluff, and local shopping."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My second stay at Amber's place was just as good as my first. The tiny house is phenomenal; very clean and like new, comfy, and in a peaceful and quiet location. It was very enjoyable to just kick back on the deck and soak in the spring evening while i was there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay! Super windy evening and night but once we were inside you could barely hear the wind. Everything inside the house was great! We were traveling with our dog and 2 children and it was a perfect place to have dinner and get a great night’s sleep. I definitely enjoyed the coffee before getting back on the road towards Chimney Rock! Great place!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, comfy, clean. Hosts are responsive. Would stay again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,we had a lovely relaxing time at Ambers cozy tiny home! It was very tidy and equipped with everything we needed to make ourselves at home! Thanks again! We will definitely visit again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place. They really did a great job of making you feel welcome and it didn't feel like we were staying in someone else's house; it felt like we were staying in a really cool, tiny house that was designed exactly for what it is being used for.
The place was squeaky-clean and well appointed. It was fun to go into town and grab a meal and a drink and then a really easy drive back 'home'. Hosts were very nice and super helpful, although we really didn't need anything because instructions were easy and they've pretty much figured out the whole hosting 'thing'.
The weather was really nice so we got to open some windows. The cows in the adjacent field were awesome to listen to; the cars on the highway were audible but not overpowering.
Would love to go back some day."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice tiny home. It was great place to stay on our thru.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Looking for a unique and wonderful staycation? Stay at Amber’s Tiny House! Upon arrival, the he tiny house beckons to have you visit and kick off your shoes on the porch! You can see Chimney Rock from the front door and we especially loved seeing the cattle fields around the property! We were bummed we could only stay one nite! One of our favorite stays!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was just what we needed. We were amazed at how efficient this Tiny home was with everything you would need. It is a private get away, so not within walking distance, but town is only a couple miles away, so it worked for us. Thanks, Amber!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber`s bnb is amazingly clean,well stocked, fresh throughout. Outdoor fireplace was a top feature. For sure highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful little house on prairie!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here. Beautiful views, great amenities, and local recommendations!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was perfect place for my visit to Chimney Rock and my only regret is that it was only for one night!!
Loved the Tiny House and so peaceful looking at the clouds as they rolled over the hills that surround their property. You can tell they take pride in the way its furnished and well stocked.
Will visit again if I'm in the area!!
Bill"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful to stay at. The cabin was clean and cozy, the view was incredible and the environment was quiet and peaceful. Also - Amber was incredibly responsive to our questions and requests. If you're in passing or need a place to stay in the area I would highly recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cutest tiny home and lots of accommodations and recommendations for what is around the area. Communication with Amber was also very easy, and plenty of space for me, my partner, and 70lb dog. Would absolutely book again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pleasant snd relaxing stay. Amber had everything we needed in the little cabin ready for us. Will recommend this cabin to our friends.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I loved staying at the tiny cabin. Spent a couple of days here while working in the area. Check in was easy and Amber was friendly and always responsive while communicating. The place was spotless and had all the amenities I needed. Everything was super cozy inside and the location is very peaceful. I hope to be back for another stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay and even booked an extra night. Our hosts we awesome and and attentive but at the same time respected our privacy. Great place to stargaze plus got to use the outdoor fireplace. Even though I had to work that week, this was the perfect setting for me and my lady to talk, cook and just hang out."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice, clean and cozy little house. Absolutely loved my stay! Amber was very nice and quick to respond."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice accommodations! Lots of good dishes to use for cooking. Nice coffee selection!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amber and Jase were nothing short of amazing. They were helpful and thoughtful during our stay. When the temperature dropped below 0, they offered space heaters to warm the place up even more.
Can’t thank them enough for our trip."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place to stay!
Easy to find and has great parking.
Nice setting on some acreage.
Very well insulated. During my stay the temps in Bridgeport, NE got down to about 5 F and the heat was set at 70 and we were comfortable the whole time."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! It was very comfortable and couldn’t ask for anything more. Thank you, for sharing your tiny home (that didn’t feel tiny at all)
Karen and Wes"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice little house. Clean and just what we expected. Better than getting a hotel in my opinion. The kitchen was probably the best supplied of any Airbnb I have stayed at. There was a full spice rack and the pots and pans were good quality, not the random thrift store finds a lot of places have. The beds were comfortable. The sofa folds out into a bed so it fits a family of three nicely."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! Private cozy cabin, with everything we needed. We'll stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at this spacious tiny cabin! It had everything we needed, comfy and cozy and we felt right at home. We especially loved that we could bring our dogs, they loved to explore. I would highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amber & Jace's place was a wonderful place to stay while we were visiting family! Before we even arrived, Amber reached out to connect about our upcoming stay, asking about anything we needed. She was so personable in the communications and went as far as to set up the pull-out for our daughter, since our travel was delayed and we were arriving unexpectedly late in the night. This was above and beyond, and I could tell she really cared about our experience.
The tiny home itself was so lovely and well-outfitted, as well as quiet, private, and comfortable - a great place of respite after each day spending time with grieving family members. A bonus for me (since I like to cook), was a beautifully filled rack of spices, so I didn't have to shop for those things while on our trip.
We look forward to staying again on future family visits in this ""home away from home."" It was just perfect for us! :o)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I absolutely loved this tiny home on our journey from Maine to Washington. After a long travel day, we arrived just in time to witness a beautiful sunset from the porch. We were both in awe with respect to the western Nebraska scenery. The town is small, but definitely has everything you need. The host was also willing to provide recommendations. If our next cross-country trip takes us through Nebraska, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks Amber!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location and beautiful home! The home was located a few minutes from where we needed to go. The home was cozy and we felt right at home. The house was very clean and well taken care of. The beds were comfy and we got good night rest. The kitchen was supplied with everything you need if you are cooking. The house was supplied with lots of extras like waters, snacks. toilet paper, paper towels, and more. The washer and dryer was a bonus for us. We enjoyed coffee every morning from the Nespresso machine. We will definitely be using Troy’s and Erin’s again in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Troy’s place was perfect for our needs. The place was so cute, updated and comfortable. The location couldn’t have been better, only 2 blocks from family we were visiting. Communication was great. Troy even let us check in a little bit early."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really nice place in a central location. Beautifully remodeled and really spacious. It was very comfortable for me, my husband and our two daughters. The main areas are large and the basement has a large space as well as an office area. We enjoyed the fireplace and the Nespresso machine. The bathrooms are also nice and big and one has a tub( (which was perfect for giving our girls a bath). Definitely recommended for a stay in Scottsbluff."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was in a great location. Close to restaurants and the hotel that the rest of the group was staying at. We were able to use the kitchen and living room space for our group to have dinner and play games one evening. We were all in town for a funeral and it was great to be able to be together in a home environment.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with everything we needed. A storm rolled through one evening and we lost power for a couple hours but had candles available to continue our card game and fireplace to stay warm! Bathrooms and kitchen were beautiful and beds were so comfy! We had a great time and will definitely stay here the next time we are in Scottsbluff! Thank you Troy and Erin!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an incredible place to stay. So very well done. If you are looking for a place to stay in Scottsbluff, I can’t imagine that there would be a better place. Would highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed here three times now and it feels like home. :-) The house is beautifully appointed and well cared for--the hosts have thought of everything to make traveling easy; so helpful when doing business in a small town!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Troy was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The home had been remodeled beautifully. It was well stocked with everything you could need, including linens, cleaning supplies, even coffee, and tea. The pots and pans were nice and new. Everything was very clean and organized. I will definitely return to this property."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for the four of us. Everything was updated and in great shape. The floor plans nice and accommodating. They go the extra mile with a lot of small little touches to include plenty of coffee pods and phone chargers. Appliances are all modern and easy to use. We will definitely plan to stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful property. The owners clearly care about the overall aesthetics of their home and comfort of their guests. We particularly enjoyed the coffee bar and nespresso machine. Drinking a coffee by the fireplace while it was snowing outside was one of my favorite parts. Our dog enjoyed the backyard and nearby park. I believe in the future dogs are not allowed, otherwise we would absolutely be returning guests."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Century-21 house is well equipped with everything you can imagine -- great value, especially for longer stays during which you can take advantage of all the amenities. It's well appointed and state-of-the art for Scottsbluff, and Troy was responsive and accommodating with some last minute changes in our travel plans -- well done!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in! Beautiful, cozy, SO well stocked with anything we could need. The nespresso machine and very comfy beds made it even better."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect for the four of us to stay in Scottsbluff this weekend. The space was clean and it had all the amenities we needed for our short stay. The location is great for walking to food, brewery and close to the riverfront trail as well.
Thank you Troy for providing such a wonderful experience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Troy’s house is beautiful!! We loved the updated bathrooms, kitchen and backyard. And the beds were very comfortable. The bonus is you can walk to the park and to the brewery. We would love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful, well-appointed gem, has everything to make your stay perfect— plush bedding, thick towels, a comfy TV area, and a Nespresso bar. Small but meaningful details made us feel like welcomed guests such as organic bath products, face masks, and snacks in the kitchen. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this exceptional property."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,A very beautiful home to stay at! We loved it! Totally recommend this house to stay at! It's super clean and has the amenities you need for your stay!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I hate to say anything good about this place, I want to keep it all to myself.
The house is beautiful and comfortable walking distance to down town.
Neighbors are great I look forward to coming back"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had never stayed at an Airbnb… and was unsure of what to expect. Troy and Erin’s home more than met expectations!! We would highly recommend their home if you are in the Scottsbluff area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely one of the best places I’ve stayed. Everything was like new and there were so many thoughtful extras throughout the house. Highly recommended!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was just lovely with many extras provided by the hosts. We enjoyed staying there and felt right at home.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best place to stay in Scottsbluff. Convenient to sites, restaurants, grocery and golf."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this Air bnb!!
Everything was labeled and organized so finding a speaker, blankets, washer/dryer, the coffee pot was awesome. The “open can” trashcan feature was a hit for all of us. The beds were very comfortable and for someone who travels multiple times a month, good nights sleep was awesome. The value of this space was beyond excellent.
Our check in/out process was easy and communication with Troy was timely and helpful. I felt like if I needed anything, they were only a text away. The decor was hip and the tributes to our community was welcomed with nostalgia and pride! We found the yearbooks!!
Thank you again! We are sure to stay here again on our next trip back to Bearcat Country!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The Century 21 House is a wonderful place to stay. It makes a great base to explore the area from.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little apt was fantastic, I loved the layout of it and it's close to stores and restaurants.

Would stay their again if I ever have a need for a place in the beautiful Scottsbluff area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here a couple times and each time we have been satisfied with the cleanliness and affordability of this apartment in Scottsbluff. Good place to stay when you are in the area.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Holly was a great host. Very responsive and easy to work with.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was very short as I arrived late and left early the next day, so I wasn't able to enjoy all the amenities, but everything was great, clean, and super comfortable."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed at this location several times. We find it clean, welcoming and homey. Holly is always accommodating."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice inside. Kitchen was well stocked including some milk and juice. I would definitely stay here again. There is no yard but I didn't need that.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was just as described. It is an older house and smelt like an older home, but the inside was very clean. It is worth the price. The location is in a more run down area of town, and that is reflected in the price of the unit. I enjoyed my stay. If you are looking for inexpensive with a clean interior this is a great place to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Holly’s place was perfect for our weekend trip in Scottsbluff. Comfortable and clean!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our overnight stay! The TV is dated and had dark lines going across the screen, but still pretty much watchable. There was a motel type smell, but plenty of Febreeze to spray! Quite a few crumbs and some stains on the counter, but the rest of the home was spotless! The beds were comfortable, shower was great and it was a quiet neighborhood. We felt safe and got a great nights sleep."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Well stocked with all the appliances you need, as well as coffee!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,I am really happy I got the chance to stay at this place. It was very clean and the host was really supportive! I highly recommend this place.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We were very pleased at the attention to every detail in the apartment. It was charming and very well stocked. We will book again if given three opportunity. Great job Holly!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well kept, clean, easy to find residence in working class neighborhood. A few cars in the morning, and after regular working hours, but otherwise very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Close to downtown bars and restaurants. Comfortable beds and living room furniture."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worked perfectly for what we needed. Thx so much!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. On the small side but had everything we needed and lots of treats and coffee which was great. If I have to travel to Scottsbluff-Gering area again I will definitely stay here. Thanks Holly!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect little apartment to stay at for a long weekend. Home away from home. Well stocked with linens and kitchen supplies to cook with. Host was great and accommodating.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My crew enjoyed their stay - thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Holly’s rental is exactly as described and shown in the photos. We had a great and comfortable stay. Spacious rooms, clean home, plenty of towels, laundry access and bottled water in the refrigerator. Appreciated (personally) that the beds were firm (soft mattresses wreak havoc on my back). Quiet neighborhood with quick access to restaurants. My mom and I traveled here for a family funeral and found the rental to be a better deal than a hotel plus we had the comforts of home and our own rooms for privacy. We were so otherwise occupied with extended family, the funeral and area sightseeing that we never sat down in the nice living room or watched TV! No long list of check out protocols (we know to do our dishes, empty garbage, and strip bed linens) which was nice as we were in a hurry. Holly was responsive to messages and gave us recommendations for restaurants. I don’t know when I’ll be back in western Nebraska, but I would recommend this place to anyone considering it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a one night stay between the long drive from Helena MT and Wichita KS, and Scottsbluff NE seemed to be
perfect for this. We appreciated the basket of breakfast bars and snacks, as well as the Keurig coffee — this helped us get on the road early when leaving. Some have mentioned the neighborhood, but we had absolutely no problems, and did like the off street parking which was illuminated by a streetlight and a next door neighbor’s light. This was our very first trip through Nebraska, and we’d certainly stay here again if going through Scottsbluff."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute spot, close to Gering and right in Scottsbluff with so many beautiful hikes and trails nearby. The downtown is less than a mile with several adorable restaurants. We had an absolute blast!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute home close to everything. The house was clean, quiet and stocked with things needed. Would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a nice place to stay and felt like a safe neighborhood. Would stay here another time.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Much more value than motel stays that cost just as much.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful host, she got us in early and made sure the space was up to par. Will stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was exactly as advertised. Tasty food is close by (I highly recommend Backaracks bar and grill!!!) The house was clean and comfortable and the host was very helpful and communicative.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful neighborhood, I like the off-street parking. Only minutes to grocery store and restaurants."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cute place! My friend and I had separate sleeping areas, and we both slept great! I’d stay here again, especially if I was staying more than one night."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very comfortable, clean and home-like atmosphere. Everything we needed was provided and Holly was prompt to answer any questions we had! I would totally stay here again!
The neighborhood, as others have said, was a bit ran down. But it was quiet and we felt safe. It is not something that would
affect my decision on whether or not to stay!
The Bluffs, Chimney Rock and surrounding areas are so beautiful! I highly recommend this place for folks wanting to explore the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little two bedroom place. Quiet neighborhood, only a few minutes away from grocery store and convenience stores."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Was a great weekend staying here. Holly was very responsive, and a great host. Nice place, just as the pictures and description showed it. I mistakenly forgot about the time zone change, and actually arrived in town earlier than I expected. Worked out fine though, as the cleaner was in the place getting it ready for us, so as soon as they left, we were set. Really appreciate the attention to detail, with it being freshly cleaned just before check-in. Will for sure check for availability of his place again when in Scottsbluff again. Thanks"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stop for the night! Right between Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff National Monuments. We loved both. Plenty of extra blankets and pillows for our large family.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great price and was a quiet neighborhood.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and very accommodating
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Apartment was as described and great value for our brief stay in Scotts Bluff. There is a running trail not too far from here as well, if that's your thing."

We arrived a bit later in the evening, and were greeted by neighbors across the street shouting at each other with lots of “f” bombs. This was not a great start, but as mentioned in previous reviews, this is a different kind of neighborhood. Once we got everyone inside, the place was great! There was plenty of space for the 6 of us, and it was warm and welcoming! The kids loved watching a movie on Netflix when they woke up. Definitely much better than a hotel!"

Walking up their steps is like coming to a palace. Arriving on time at: 3:00 p.m. check-in, the lovely and gracious hostess, Linda, opened the door. She had the biggest smile & welcoming words. We felt important & welcome. Everything inside their gorgeous airbnb was sparkling and pristine. The colorful decor could not have been more pleasing to the eye. The view from the homes back, felt like being in the country, so pretty! The room upstairs is darling. It was thoughtfully set up with water, etc. The bathroom, & laundry room, were also set up perfectly. The host & hostess are so accommodating & helpful. My friend's stay, was a HAPPY experience he will remember all of his life; it was that good!: Thank You!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Didn’t get to use the pond as we hoped due to the wind, but that’s to be expected in Nebraska. Overall good place to stay and was perfect for my bachelorette trip! Close drive to the Bluffs and lots of room to host and sleep."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our party of 10+ had a fantastic time at Brian’s AirBnB. The house was beyond comfortable, and there was so much space for everyone to spread out without feeling like we were on top of each other. The kids loved the small lake with the paddle boat, as well as the gaming room and table. The house was clean, and quiet. No one bothered us, and we had an amazing time. We will definitely be staying here again.
My mother in law:
At almost 70 years old, it was a blessing to be able to get the family together under one roof. There was plenty of things for the family to do and keep busy without anyone wanting to leave the premises to find entertainment. The airBB provided so much for the family to do together. Everyone had a very very good time.
Negative: there isn’t much to say that is negative other than the coffee pot and tabletop cooker were dirty when we arrived. It was easy enough to clean up."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The interaction with Brian was smooth, the house is very nice, everything was perfectly clean and tidy. There are lots of games and entertainment available inside and out. Great stay, thanks again Brian!"

This place is a dream spot for kids of all ages - shuffelboard, foosball, ping pong, electronic game table, the slide, popcorn maker the list goes on and on. We saw lots of geese and deer! Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and the kitchen is great. Even has a pack/play and high chair for the little ones. Wish we had known about this place before and will definitely come back."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Needed a place for our large family gathering. It was perfect, better than expected.

We hope to go back for a stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our Christmas gathering with our immediate family - including my parents, siblings, and their adorable kids - was made truly special thanks to Brian's wonderful abode. His place wasn't just spacious and immaculate; it also radiated festive cheer with tasteful Christmas decorations that made us feel at home.
What set our experience apart was Brian's hospitality. He wasn't just responsive; he anticipated our needs. For instance, he thoughtfully provided a high-chair without us even asking. This gesture of kindness left us deeply impressed. Furthermore, Brian showed incredible understanding and flexibility towards our family dynamics. He graciously allowed us to host a few relatives - uncles, aunts, and cousins - during the holidays, making our family reunion all the more memorable.
We are grateful for the warmth and comfort Brian's place provided, making our Christmas celebration one for the books. A heartfelt thank you, Briann, for going above and beyond!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"13 of us stayed at Brian’s place for 3 days over Thanksgiving and we had a blast! The property was just as described! The pool table, ping pong, foosball, shuffleboard were all in great working order and provided hours of fun!!
The kitchen was completely stocked with just about every utensil and cooking ware required to prepare our Thanksgiving feast! Except a potato masher lol!!! But we made do.
The area is of course beautiful with views of the western Nebraska bluffs. We made a trek to the Scottsbluff National Monument; the 1.5 mile hike to the tunnel is worth the effort.
I personally enjoyed being able to see the coal trains passing just on the horizon and hearing their horn faintly in the background.
Really nothing bad to say! Exceeded our expectations.
Brian is a kind and responsive host!
Thank you Brian for making this a memorable Thanksgiving with family!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay at Holly's. The neighborhood was fairly quiet and was close to restaurants and stores and was a great value.
