2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Her houses are equipped to make you feel right at home. Lynel is the best host so far for me since I‚Äôve started using the platform.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was so thankful Lynel was such a fantastic host, as we had to travel for a family death at the last minute. Her responsiveness and helpfulness really made the trip a lot easier. The house itself was super cozy, clean, with a nice bathroom (yay decent water pressure!) and a nice sized kitchen. 10/10 recommend Lynel and her space, no complaints!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice house and fit our needs well.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Very responsive and understanding
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house was very central to the places I visited and easy to access from the highway. It was cozy and welcoming. Lynel was easy to work with. I highly recommend this booking
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel was a great host that always responded whenever we had any questions. Very nice space with cute decorations. Thanks for everything!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was as listed. There is only on street parking or a very small space, in front of a rear detached garage. There are two very large dogs (GSD & Hound dog) in the yard on the other side of chain linked fence, so if you have a timid dog be aware these two dogs are aggressive. The kitchen is uber tiny, so of you're a cook be aware the space is not friendly to large meal preparation. The only bathroom is on the first level and the two bedrooms are upstairs. Stairs are narrow and typical to older homes, again if you're not sure footed be cautious. There is a right-a-way adjacent to the home and garbage trucks are loud. Home is close to hospital and relatively central to most highways."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Comfortable stay perfect for our work trip, would definitely stay here again! Thank you Lynel!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable, well appointed, convenient location & a Kitchen providing anything you may require.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was exactly as described and was a very good value. Nothing fancy, but it was clean and well supplied.

We enjoyed sitting in the side yard in the evenings. We would happily stay here again."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean older home with nice size living space and large main bedroom. Both bedrooms had good closet space.

Host Lynel was great, quick to respond when we had any questions or concerns."

Lynel was a very responsive host and was very pleasant and easy to communicate with
Only downfalls: as people who do a lot of cooking, the lack of counter space and dishwasher/garbage disposal in the kitchen was a little inconvenient, but we made it work. Additionally, the neighbor has dogs that are frequently barking.
Otherwise, would recommend this place if you need somewhere to stay in St. Cloud!"

AmazIng environment.
Very welcoming neighborhood."

2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a charming, nostalgic house to stay in, look no further! This little home is very cute, perfectly decorated to enhance its already adorable features. Lynel is such a dream to work with, she is very responsive to questions and concerns and very reasonable to work things out if plans must change. The sleeping arrangements would be fine for a family with kids as its 2 people to a bed and one of the beds is a hide-a-bed. The full bed is a tempur-pedic mattress, so make sure to adjust your settings before you crawl in (unlike my poor mom who had no idea why the mattress felt weird but didn‚Äôt want to say anything :-D
If you are in St Cloud and need a place to stay, I would recommend Lynel‚Äôs little home away from home!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like going back in time to grandma's house. Loved the decor. Beds were super comfy, even the hide a bed. We were in St Cloud mainly to check out the bike trails, so didn't have time to hang out on the front porch. I'd love to return, and would definitely recommend this house to others."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place in St Cloud. Close to shopping and main highways to get around. Was great for a small family. I appreciated the smart TV that had all the apps I usually use downloaded so I could just log in and watch what I wanted to.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,The house was clean and organized. The host was easy to reach out to and extremly friendly.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. I‚Äôm normally a Marriott hotel guy and was in St Cloud for business. Thought I would try Airbnb and was very pleased with my 3 day stay at Lynel‚Äôs place. Hope it‚Äôs available next time I‚Äôm back in town.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in St. Cloud while visiting some extended family. While the house is older, it is well-kept and served our purpose well. It's a two-story, which provides plenty of room for a family to not feel cramped. It turned out to be a great location. Nearby were all types of restaurants (like House of Pizza, which has pretty good gluten free crust), a decent mall, yummy bakeries and fun parks."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Punctual communication, and an excellent bnb right by the Mississippi. Walking distance to a park. Lynel was great, and we‚Äôd definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house. Comfortable living room and master bedroom. Great for pet owners with a small fenced yard, and only five blocks (at most) from a park overlooking the Mississippi River. Washer/dryer downstairs (which I used). Highly recommend"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfy house super close to downtown St. Cloud. Loved the little welcoming details."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brother and I recently stayed at Lynel's place for the first time and were utterly impressed. The home was SO clean, organized, beautifully decorated to fit in with the age of the home and the neighborhood was quiet. Lynel added many nice small touches to make the stay so easy. If you are in need of a place to stay in St. Cloud, the location is perfect too. We had a terrific experience and will certainly book the next time we are in St. Cloud. Thank you Lynel for your hospitality!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a very nice home that is great for extended stays. It's location to the park on the river is wonderful (and that park has GREAT sledding in winter), and downtown is walkable (my 8-year-old did it). The porch is enclosed and great for sitting in all kinds of weather."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love this place and Lynel it‚Äôs very nice and communicative
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Parking in the back driveway was a bit difficult with a van but would have been fine in a smaller vehicle. The street parking was easy though and the street felt very friendly and safe so we had no concerns about parking on the street. the beds were SUPER comfortable and the A/C worked great and was much needed after a outdoor even on a over 90¬∞ day. The house was cute very well and comfortably decorated. Overall it was one of the best airbnb stays we have had.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place and extremely well kept up. Lots of charm from yesterday with a all the conveniences of today. Charming neighborhood and only 5 minutes from pretty much anything you want. Highly recommend!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed here for 8 nights. This home is charming, comfortable, convenient, and clean! All the important C‚Äôs. Lynel is the best Airbnb host I‚Äôve experienced. Great St. Cloud rental for a great price. Highly recommend! Hopefully it‚Äôs available next time I have to travel to St. Cloud. We also cooked/enjoyed a Thanksgiving Dinner for 5! And did laundry. You can‚Äôt do that in a hotel. Great amenities."
2020-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,Cute cozy comfortable house! Great host she is absolutely delightful and accommodating! And my son loved the butterscotch candies she leaves he ate them all. The king size bedroom was elegant and wonderful. And the lounge chair in the dining room a nice treat. Loved the front porch. And the sofa bed in living room is a definite plus.
2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Good communication and fast responses. Nice place for a quick hideaway.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel went above and beyond to accommodate us with an earlier check in request and a later check out request. She repossessed quickly to messages.

Lynel is a terrific host who aims to please and work with her guest to make sure they have the best possible stay.

2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Quaint, older home with plenty of space, but set up a little odd (see: older home). Kitchen and bathroom stocked with the very basics. Cute neighborhood with park a few blocks away, but was loud with traffic and barking dogs (even with the window AC blowing!). King suite is beautiful, and the kids loved finding all the chocolates in the rooms."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We totally enjoyed staying at Lynel‚Äôs place. We wanted to ride on the Lake Wobegon Trail. The front porch was perfect for storing two adult bikes on, when not riding. We also could ride our bikes down to the river and got on a trail downtown. Lynel‚Äôs place was clean, charming and had everything to make our visit enjoyable. Would diffidently stay here again. The washer and dryer came in handy to wash our biking clothes after riding 100 miles in one day. Lynel‚Äôs messaged us to make sure everything was ok. The house was so much better then a motel for about the same cost."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely adorable and amazing place! Amazing communication and adorable little house! I would 100% stay here again and will recommend this place to everyone!

2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay very much. This is an adorable 100 year old home in a quiet neighborhood. So many welcoming touches including a personalized welcome note! The location is convenient to everything in St. Cloud and Lynel is very quick to answer when messaged and is very helpful. This is a 2 story home. The stairs are narrow and a bit steep. This was not a problem for us at all, but potential guests should be aware. I highly recommend this home."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a beautiful home and definitely worth it!
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Lynel was a fantastic host to a perfectly cute little house in St. Cloud! We had a great time there, and Lynel was super thoughtful planning for our visit."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Lynel's cottage. Her personal touches inspired us to come back again. Our second visit was just as good as the first.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a lovely time at Lynel's place. It was cozy, comfortable and great location in reference to the VA hospital. We appreciated the special little touches that made us feel quite welcome. Highly recommend Lynel's place for any visit!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,A great and clean place to be in. It was very well taken care for
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Lynel's house. Lynel was always very quick in her responses to me, almost quicker than I could keep up with! She was very welcoming and friendly without being overbearing or intrusive---my idea of the perfect host. The house was spotlessly clean, in a nice neighborhood, and was very comfortable. Although the weather happened to be unusually cool when we were there, I did make use of the window air conditioners in the bedroom and the living room and found that they worked very well. I am a hot person so I really appreciated them. If we visit the St. Cloud area again, we would most certainly stay at Lynel's place. I can also recommend the Lake Wobegon bike trail in St. Joseph for those interested in bike rides. I did a fairly short ride on it and found it to be fun for my non-athletic self and also very, very pretty. I saw some wild turkeys!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, super clean and easy check in. Lynel is nice enough to leave a book of instructions. Would stay again."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint, charming, spotless and cozy."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest and well maintained homes I‚Äôve stayed at. It was comfortable and well stocked. We truely enjoyed staying here. The neighborhood was really a nice surprise with just a short walk to a park and river walk. Lynel was a great host. The bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom on the main level which may be hard for someone who has difficulty with steps.
Lyft service was excellent from the location"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Generous hospitality, excellent communication, a great place to stay during a conference at River‚Äôs Edge Convention Center!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lynel‚Äôs place is a super cute, older home. It‚Äôs in the Hester Park neighborhood, which is very centrally located. In 5 minutes you‚Äôre downtown or in Sauk Rapids. In 10, you can be just about anywhere in the city limits. The house was sparkling clean and very welcoming. Lights were left on in case of a late arrival and there was music playing which I thought was a very nice touch. I liked that there was a house manual. Whenever I stay in an Airbnb, I always wonder, ‚Äúdo I wash my few dishes? should I take out the garbage?‚Äù so it was really nice to have a reference instead of having to bother the host with questions. Also, since my stay was in the middle of an 11 day trip‚Ä¶LOVED that there was a washer and dryer in the basement.
In the end, I will definitely be checking if Lynel‚Äôs house is available next year when I make my annual trip to the homeland."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and nice, clean neighborhood. We really enjoyed the screen porch for early morning coffee. Everything we needed was in the house."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy home close to everything in StCloud! And Lynel was great to work with!!!

2019-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lynel was the best host I booked with. She was available to answer questions any time. Lynel made me and my family feel really at home while we are far away from home. She was super friendly, very helpful, and respectful. The house was beautiful and I would recommend anyone to stay at any of lynel's places."
2019-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"As advertised. The host had made light of all of the ""need to knows"". The home was clean from top to bottom. We drive an extended SUV and it still fit in front of the garage when parked at an angle. Would be a great place for 1, 2, or the whole family."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel was an excellent host. The house exceeded expectations. I would recommend this house and host to anybody!

This home will be my first choice when I return to St. Cloud."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel was a wonderful host that had so many nice surprised for us upon our arrival. The home is incredibly inviting and feels so welcoming that it can be easy to forget that it is not actually your home.

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this for its perfect location: within walking distance of our daughter's house, hence perfect for ""overflow"" Thanksgiving guests! Lynel was amazingly prompt in replying to our queries, and graciously allowed us to check in a few hours early. We were struck at once by how sparkling clean the house was. ""Old house charm"" but a thoroughly updated bathroom with a nice shower. Everything was just as described, and we appreciated all the hostess touches throughout."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I have stayed here a few times when we are in town for school. It was the perfect house to call our home for the week. Lynel is quick to respond to any messages. The house was clean and welcoming.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and Warm. I love staying here.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay. The welcome book that was available when we arrived was extremely informative and was personalized for myself and my brother.
Beds were beyond comfortable and house was extremely clean."
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,This is the perfect home away from home! There were so many little things added that made me feel like I was staying with family as opposed to a random stranger‚Äôs homeüíó. We used Lyft to get to the school/downtown and it was only a couple of bucks. I loved staying here. It was clean and warm and welcoming! Fantastic stay! Hopefully will get the chance to stay here again!

Cute little touches everywhere, sparkling clean and fabulous towels and beds. Great place and we will definitely stay again."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, old world charm with modern conveniences. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were super soft, so much so that it was hard to get out and start my day, I just wanted to stay in bed. Lynel was a great host! She responded right away when I had a question. She checked in each morning to make sure everything was fine and if I needed anything! The little touches Lynel left throughout the house were so nice. Everything you might need was here. If I'm in St. Cloud again overnight, I will definitely check to see if this place is available first and book it. Thank you Lynel for a wonderful experience and stay!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel is upfront about the stairs and it is true that since it is a charming older home the stairs are steeper and narrower than modern ones. It was easy to haul my roller bag up but large pieces of luggage would be very possible but require some nimbleness and strength. There is offstreet parking for one car. There is a grocery and liquor store about one mile away.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel‚Äôs place is in a great location and was perfect for the trip we took for a wedding. When we are in the area again we will be booking this place!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great house to stay at! The host was amazing! The linens were so soft! Would definitely stay here again!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Lynel's was great. The house is cozy and a stone's throw away from the downtown area. The house was clean and came packed with a host of thoughtful touches such as coffee, various treats and suggested activities. If you find yourself in St. Cloud, this is a great spot to stay. Thanks for the stay, Lynel!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little home near river-town-hospital I will be back
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynel was a great host! Very quick response time! I was absolutely in love with this home! Such charm and comfort! I wanted for nothing! I would highly recommend!!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house and host went beyond our expectations! Exceptionally clean and she had thought of everything you might need during your stay! Beds were very comfortable! Loved the quaint neighborhood great for walking/ running and a couple blocks from a park and the river! Lynel responded immediately to my questions and was very accommodating!! Would live to stay again!!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Three of us were at the house for about a month and had a great stay! The house was very clean upon entry, it was nicely furnished and there were lots of thoughtful touches. All appliances worked well, had new washer / dryer and all beds were comfortable. The house is situated in a nice older neighborhood near a park and is close to downtown. Lynel was awesome to work with: she responded almost immediately every time, made sure our stay was going well and check in was easy. We liked the house and Lynel is a great host!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place to stay. I highly recommend it.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic! Highly recommend.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed this turn-off-the-century home with old-time wood trim and radiators but with a beautifully remodeled bathroom, beautiful wood floors, and a functional kitchen! The space is super clean and the sheets and towels are high quality. I really appreciated the higher toilet, great shower, and the makeup mirror in the bathroom. Lynel is a wonderful host who is very responsive and provides all kinds of special touches to make her place very welcoming! The window air conditioners work well in the two bedrooms upstairs, and there is a fan in the living room where the sofa sleeper is. Be careful if you are tall when coming down the stairs from the bedroom and be sure to duck! Another reviewer mentioned the obnoxious barking dogs next door, but thankfully they didn't bother us at night."
2018-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great time at Lynel's place. She had thought of everything to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Stocked kitchen allowed us to make breakfast in home, cozy bedrooms with window AC to keep cool, and lovely pillows and the best towels ever (seriously I'm going to buy them for my house). There is quick access to St Cloud and 94, restaurants and shops too. There was no AC unit for the downstairs of house so it did get a bit warm and stuffy even with the fan on but it was a hot weekend, the neighbors' dogs were pretty loud and seemed to be just left out in the yard and barked and bayed for long periods kind of sad. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who wants a cozy and cute home to relax in."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Lynel for being such a wonderful host to our family! Our sons (4,2 and 1yr olds) enjoyed your home as much as my husband and I did. Your thoughtful touches to your home made it extra special and little surprises you left for our kids made it easier for them to transition into staying in a home where they are not familiar with. The location of the house was just perfect. Loved your house was close to many parks and a great library! An easy access to grocery stores and restaurants were also a plus! We will definitely stay again if we ever visit St. Cloud! Thank you again :)"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a gem!!! Nearby park was lovely w a wading pool for the kids open until 7. Lynel was kind enough to accommodate us on short notice. She was very responsive, easy check in, nice touches. Really appreciated the comfy beds and a/c units in the bedrooms. Would definitely stay again"
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a SCSU girls reunion weekend. The 6 of us had a great weekend and lots of space to have fun. Lynel has furnished the place great with plenty of extra special touches.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a comfortable space. Absolutely clean, welcoming, in a lovely neighborhood. It was just what I needed; space to unwind, create some art, do lots of reflection, and prepare healthy food for myself. Even the acoustics in the basement were perfect for my private solo performance. No doubt, the host is a wonderful balance of loving hospitality and giving the guest privacy. If you‚Äôre looking for a cozy space with all the comforts of home look no further! ‚ú®üíê"
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,Family and I had an amazing time. We weren‚Äôt in the house much but it was very clean and the rooms where stylish/well kept. Also very close to the downtown night life ! Thanks Lynel :)
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We just loved the ‚Äúold house‚Äù feeling with very comfortable furniture and thoughtful touches everywhere we looked. Lynn was very helpful and the beautiful yard was an extra bonus.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything with this property worked out great for our stay. The place was clean, well equipped, the coffee was great, the area was nice, and Jeremy was easily accessible. We needed nothing during our visit. The only concern I may have had was the level of noise from the adjoining apartment. They were up late, but so were we, so it didn't really matter to us. The area is really safe and so is the property. We will stay there again if we are ever back in Sauk Rapids."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying here and we absolutely love it!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy‚Äòs place was just as described. Cozy, very clean, comfortable, and well stocked in the kitchen. Great location‚Ä¶ A short walk to a grocery store, short drive to Starbucks and major shopping."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at Jeremy's place several times and it's always wonderful. It's our go-to place in the St. Cloud area. The linens are high quality, the bed comfortable, and the kitchen well stocked. I'm always amazed how quiet it is even though it's centrally located. It's an easy walk to the grocery store, pharmacy, shops, and restaurants. I feel safe in Jeremy's place even when I'm alone. Jeremy is very responsive and the keyless entry is easy. Plus it's perfectly clean and nicely decorated. Stay in Jeremy's place if you have the chance!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay at Jeremy‚Äôs place and we love it. I have a feeling we‚Äôll be back. Thank you, Jeremy!"

We will definitely stay here again if our travels allow.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though there were things out of Jeremy's control, he always took care of this fast. I loved his place. The detail and care he has put into the whole unit. So many nice little touches. Location was fabulous, park and river near by and a grocery store again the street. Close to freeway. Fantastic. I would definitely stay again."

We have stayed at this same Airbnb one other time and that is why we chose to come back. The one drawback is that there is a fairly steep set of stairs to get to the Airbnb but my husband and I are quite active and are able to make the hike. The historic building is superbly done. Tasteful decor with modern amenities. As well as a nice touch of the historic glass door knobs and locks and the windowed headers. It‚Äôs a work of art no doubt! We thoroughly enjoyed the space!!! As long as the prices stay competitive, we will definitely be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second wonderful stay at Jeremy's place. Book it now if you can!!! Clean, convenient, safe, and stylish. This time I did a lot of cooking. Great kitchen. The knives and vegetable peeler were super sharp! Plenty of cooking equipment and food storage containers. As before the linens are quality, the bed comfortable, and the place dark and quiet for sleeping. I was sad to leave this wonderful place. I had a glitch caused by me and Jeremy was responsive and accommodating. I stay in many Airbnbs in the US and abroad each year and this is one of the best! Thanks, Jeremy."

We also did a lot of hiking in the area. The location was great, as it was located just a couple blocks (short walk) from the Southside Park, which has fantastic views of the Mississippi. There are many other nice parks within a short drive too. The apartment itself was clean and modern. The only thing you much be aware of, which is noted in the description, is that there is a steep set of stairs you must climb to reach the 2nd floor apartment. If you have any difficulty navigating stairs, you would not want this place. Otherwise, it is a nice place and location at a reasonable price. We would definitely stay here again."

The property boasts a wonderful, vintage covered bridge on the property with magical lights at night( great for selfies), a creek, sporting activities and walking paths galore.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had such a wonderful stay at this fantastic cabin. The surroundings are as beautiful as the pictures show. There was so much room for our dog to run around and explore. The cabin was very comfortable and just lovely. Gretchen was so kind and wonderful to work with. We are already hoping to book again in the fall.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous place to stay! Cozy, comfortable feel to this adorable cabin. Gretchen's attention to detail and personal touches went beyond our expectations. Entering into this property through the lighted covered bridge was magical! A peaceful, relaxing, beautiful place. Thank you Gretchen and Dan - we wish you all the best!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a cozy and extremely peaceful location. We had hoped to enjoy it with our dog, but at the last minute the dog became sick and stayed with our son. It is not often that dogs are welcome so we appreciated the option. Many thoughtful touches like Aveda bathing products and Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products available for guests to use. The bed was comfortable. The directions with photos were extremely helpful. If only we had the luxury to do this trip a month later when things had greened up! I can only imagine how gorgeous the area would be then!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We keep returning to Dan and Gretchen's cabin because it feels like a cozy escape for us. One of my favorite things to do here is grind my own coffee beans and watching the sun come up over the fields behind the cabin. On this trip we enjoyed streaming our favorite shows and watching the rain out the windows. Our pup enjoyed all the smells of spring. We ordered dinner from a restaurant in town, but otherwise felt at home preparing meals in the kitchen. Dan and Gretchen are responsive whenever we have questions or if anything comes up. We appreciate everything about this creekside cabin!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great weekend stay at the cabin in late March. It is small and cozy with beautiful surroundings. Gretchen and Dan provided a welcoming message, thoughtful amenities, and recommendations for the area. We enjoyed hiking in the nearby Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge where we saw swans, otters, bluebirds, and more. We had supper at the Brickyard Bar and Grill in Clear Lake. The beer cheese soup is delicious. Thank you for the delightful stay and the warm welcome."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really feel like you‚Äôre getting away even though it is relatively close to the twin cities. Lot of thought clearly has been put into the space.

It's just a magical get away from the cities and it is perfection."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Maybe a little overpriced for the size, although we did not venture into the basement. Everything was very clean and welcoming with great snack and breakfast options if you're rushed on arrival and didn't buy groceries yet.
Our biggest issue was the size of the bathroom. Another 12"" of width would have made a big difference while navigating the toilet and shower accommodations.
The convenience of Briggs General Store and the beauty of the area are great amenities to this property. It was great being creekside with a picturesque covered bridge right out the back door."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in the area for my mother's funeral and needed to shorten our drive time so we stayed here. We had been making the trips from our home to Princeton for a few days and were feeling burnt out on driving. Staying at the cabin was a great break from all the driving, arrangements, and stress. The walking trails were just what I needed to clear my head and listening to the birds, and the sound of the wind rushing through the pine trees took my mind off the sadness for a while. At night we went outside and looked up at the stars...I had forgotten what its like to look at the night sky away from city lights. The cabin itself is so homey and comfortable. I wish we could have stayed longer than one night to fully enjoy it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"probably the best air b&b I have stayed at.
Beautiful area, remote and peaceful.
Nice little cabin with great kithen equipment and fresh eggs in the fridge. Just a stop over coming home from a long trip but wish we could have stayed longer. we didn't rush out in the morning which we normally do when heading home because it was so comfortable.
highly recommend"

We liked having a space all to ourselves. They had photos that showed what it looked like in the winter as well as in the summer, which was what I was looking for during my search. Our stay was in mid-March, lots of snow and cold during that time. The photos showed exactly what it looks like. The kitchen is fully stocked with pans and utensils for cooking. We cooked all of our meals and never left. It was just what we needed. Very comfortable, modern, private, quiet. Nice amenities, thick towels, good WiFi and tv. The bed was very comfortable also.

We will definitely be coming back again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It's a wonderful place to get away from the cities and hope to go back soon. It was very quiet while I was there and you'll love the coffee grinder that's on the wall. Very cool thing. It's beautiful on the inside and the wood covered bridge just adds to the place to help make it kind of special. I forgot what the stars looked like. Grin.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gretchen and Dan‚Äôs cabin was a wonderful place to stop on our road trip from WA to SC.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our short stay was perfect. The location is only an hour away from Minneapolis but we still felt like we were out in the middle of Minnesota away from all our city stressors. We were planning on cross country skiing and brought our skis and boots but... forgot our poles! I messaged Gretchen through Airbnb and she responded within 15 mins letting me know they had 1 pair of poles but would ask their neighbor if they had others we could borrow. 30 mins later we had 3 pairs of poles. Gretchen really went out of her way to make our trip the best.
The cabin is so cute, cozy, and so so clean. The property is beautiful, we took a short snowy hike around their land, sledded down their hill, and walked along the creek. It was all perfect.
I'd return monthly if I had the time!"

The cabin was warm and cozy with all the things we needed. It was too cold while we were there, so we were not able to get the chance to explore the hiking trail.
I am looking forward to spending more nights at the cabin and having more time in the little town as well as the view. Thank you Gretchen and Dan again for hosting us!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan and Gretchen were wonderful hosts. They communicated well and efficiently when we had questions along the way.

Overall a truly great place to stay that we would highly recommend!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this property. Not only was the space welcoming and perfect for our weekend, Gretchen and Dan added special touches that made it all the more amazing.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a completely peaceful and beautiful place to stay. Gretchen and Dan have created such a wonderful retreat, and they were both so kind and welcoming. They were also extremely considerate of our privacy and safety during this pandemic. The home itself has everything you could need, plus countless thoughtful extra touches: we were greeted with a fridge of snacks and water, fresh eggs, fresh veggies and herbs, fresh-to-grind coffee and teas, hot chocolate mix, s'mores ingredients, and certainly many other goodies I'm forgetting. Everything was spotless and smelled great, and we felt very comfortable staying there for our first vacation since the pandemic started. Gretchen was careful to leave the windows open for us, and she provided many disinfecting and cleaning supplies for us to use. The outdoor areas and trails and stream are really lovely. We loved sitting on the porch with our meals to enjoy the view. Thank you so much. We can't wait to be back someday."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! We loved having our ""private"" entrance over the covered bridge to the guesthouse, and the view of the bridge (especially at night, all lit up) was very charming and unique. The house itself was a good size for two people, but I could also see the location--with its peaceful walking trails and quiet creek--lending itself well to a solo writing residency, meditation retreat, etc. Although you have plenty of privacy, you don't feel too isolated with the main house close by. As a nature lover I was happy to spot sandhill cranes on our way in, a great blue heron in the creek, and hear barred owls at night while we sat by the firepit. The guesthouse seemed well-equipped for any season, which in Minnesota is always great to find. We also appreciated that we could bring our dog with us--she had a great time, too!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gretchens cabin is a great setting with creek and covered bridge for a private getaway. The kitchen was well supplied with extra food treats. I highly recommend

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The perfect place to stay and unwind after a busy summer. We loved that it was only an hour-ish out from the Twin Cities. Gretchen and Dan were responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. We will be sure to return!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Rice Creek Guesthouse- beautiful environment with a cozy and very clean cabin. We loved the shady patio and spent mornings with coffee and evening with a glass of wine there. Not too far from St Cloud so you can still enjoy the city.

Our hosts were very responsive, communicated clearly. The land is beautiful and peaceful around there as well. Truly recommend it!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy little cabin is a great getaway from the cities. Gretchen has great attention to detail and thought of all the little things that would make our visit better. The highlight of our stay was the bonfire. Gretchen put together a cute little box of treats and wheeled a wagon of supplies over to us. She and her family are also very courteous and maintained their distance around the cabin for our privacy. However, they would still wave and make us feel welcome if we crossed paths. Gretchen was also prompt when it comes to addressing our questions and concerns. Lastly, the scenery is very therapeutic. Sunrises and sunsets accompanied by the birds chirping took our breaths away. We strongly recommend this little cabin and we look forward to returning someday."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely little cabin get away! I was looking for a quiet place to get away and unplug and that's exactly what I got.

The bed was so comfortable we wanted to sleep in each day. The views‚Ä¶. did we say the views? If you are wanting a quiet, adorable, romantic cabin, don‚Äôt look any further.

As we were leaving, my husband suggested booking another stay. We hope to return again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't think I can stress enough how wonderful this place is. The kindest hosts, and the coolest place to get away from the city.

It's awesome, Don't miss out on this awesome space."

Quiet neighborhood convenient to grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants. Our only problem was connecting the television(s) to wi-fi.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was well put together. The kids and enjoyed our stay. The only thing was the second bedroom sleeping area was extremely small. Only a small child can sleep in there. Suggest putting a actual bed in that room. Other then that five stars ü§©

She is so thoughtful and it shows. She has thought of even the tiniest of details, as to what someone might need or just like during their stay. She is so responsive and easy to communicate with and did I mention THOUGHTFUL!! She put an extra light next to the outside stair entrance when she realized we weren‚Äôt going to be back before dark.
I don‚Äôt have enough room to write all the positive things‚Ä¶.Thank You Elle for creating a place to relax and share memories.üíù"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elle's Granite City Green House was spacious, charming and Elle was a delightful host. I stayed one night, breaking up a road trip to be able to drive during daylight hours. Everything was exactly as pictured. Elle was very responsive and my initial concerns about if I had parked in the right place were quickly resolved by her. Very quiet. I slept well. High quality bed and mattress. Excellent water pressure in the shower, with superb shower head. Best towel rack I have ever seen. Large bathroom. There were many, many charming details. For those with mobility issues, there are about 5 small steps up to the door to the unit then 14 steps upstairs. I would definitely stay here again. Elle was so nice and her place was fabulous."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elle is a savant at hosting and was above and beyond in all areas. Granite City Greenhouse is such a gem! Surrounded by lots of places to eat and things to do.
I myself was in town for a wedding and wanted a nice peaceful place to stay instead of a blocked off hotel room. My stay was exactly what I'd hoped for. A nice cozy environment with Elle providing an assortment of goodies and accompaniments to make it just that. A few nice areas to lounge around for the day or evening and enjoy a good book. Would 100% come back again if I'm in the area.
You're in good hands will Elle!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elle was extremely hospitable, flexible, kind and thoughtful. She went above and beyond to provide yummy hot breakfasts for our family! She was quick to respond to messages and showed such generosity and thoughtfulness before and throughout the stay. Would absolutely stay with her again!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Some places feel like home right away. Elle‚Äôs is filled with great art, cozy furnishings, and plenty of welcoming details (cocoa in the kitchenette! mini toiletries!) that made our brief stop in St. Cloud go by too quickly.
Elle was extremely helpful in finding great local restaurants that would accommodate dietary restrictions. Her suggestions helped us make the most of our time in the area.
Personal touches mean so much on a long, cross-country road trip, and I‚Äôm so glad to have found this gem."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I of 44 years wanted a quiet place to stay, reasonably priced with the amenities, and Elle‚Äôs place fit it all! If Elle will have us back we will plan another trip, not in winter weather but probably in the spring! Thanks so much, Elle. Cindy and Deb"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Elle's decorating style...her place was comfy and felt like home and her bubbly personality felt like you were with family! would definitely stay there again if she'd have us!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're staying the night in the St. Cloud area, this is definitely the spot to stay! Elle was so sweet and constantly went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. From offering us a ride, to bringing us ice water on an unusually hot day, to surprising us to a cute little note and gift just because she knew we got married recently. She is so thoughtful and communicative. Not to mention her space is darn adorable!
We'll most def be staying there again if we're ever in the area again. Hopefully next time we can bring our fur babies üòä"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodation, well air-conditioned, well decorated!
A beautiful little table with bites‚Ä¶yum!
She is very responsive, always willing to help us and answer our questions (texts).
I will go back for sure!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Third time staying here and I absolutely love the place. It feels like my home away from home. Elle always responds and is flexible with check in and check out times. She provides food and snacks that are so tasty! Every time I book this place I know i'm in good hands.
Amazing host and house:)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We we felt welcome and well taken care of.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I absolutely love this place! This is our second time staying here and we feel right at home. Elle provides amazing snacks and even made me an amazing dinner:)
I work overnights and was able to sleep so comfortably during the day. It was quiet, and so peaceful.
Elle is so helpful with anything you may need! She helped me every night by taking my pup out on walks so that she wasn't stuck inside my whole shift.
Elle adds such cute touches to every room and her decor is top notch!
We will definitely be back!
Thanks for everything Elle. We appreciate everything you have done for us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay in St. Cloud. The suite is clean, comfortable, charming and offers privacy. Bathroom was spacious and well equipped with toiletries and product. So many lovely touches- from the amazing art- to the delicious snacks and tea selection! Thank you, Elle!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay in St Cloud - nothing in the area compares. Clean, easy, comfortable, amazing communication, safe, very accommodating. Thank you Elle for saying hello!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was so cute and comfortable! Elle had such amazing little touches throughout the home. Elle was very responsive and even helped take my fur baby outside to play:) There is a park right across the street that we loved! We will absolutely stay there again during our next visits.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Elle was the best! They were super communicative and even offered to let our dogs out knowing we would be at a wedding most of the afternoon! Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Personable, private and pet friendly. Elle offers the extras with snacks, baked goods, fruit and other breakfast options. She was spot on with her instructions, friendly communication and quick to remedy any problems. Nice speaking with her directly. Love the homey feel of this updated 1925 home with its original wood floors, comfortable bed, eclectic decor and furnishings. Large bathroom is a plus with nearly all the toiletries you may have forgotten. Future plans should hopefully remedy the need for a better kitchen, as only a toaster oven, hot water pot and Keurig is offered. Also, the small AC unit barely cooled the bedroom with the door closed leaving the rest of the space insufferably warm. Would be nice to add an additional unit. Our two furry traveling companions enjoyed the fenced in yard and small wading pool. The steep wood steps proved to be a challenge for our smaller one and we found ourselves having to carry her down. Just a heads up. Off street parking is available."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had an absolutely lovely stay in St Cloud ‚Äî great host, space was clean and exactly as described. Wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Great communication. Easy !"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the very best Airbnb I‚Äôve stay at in St. Cloud and probably ever. It‚Äôs super cozy and clean. The bathroom was nice, especially since my bathroom at home is under construction. The shower was clean-I did not feel like I needed to wear flip flops in it, which was nice! The bed was extremely comfortable. I slept better than usual for my stretch of night shifts. The whole place was tidy and had everything I could possibly need. There WAS air conditioning and it kept the bedroom nice and cool on 85 degree days.
Elle was a great host. She was very responsive! One day she even picked up a charging cable for my MacBook since I forgot mine at home. She provided abundant snacks and left some food for me. She certainly went above and beyond! I plan on staying here as much as possible through my travel nurse contract!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,everything was great except the place has no kitchen or kitchenette. Also no AC. Other than these everything great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"First and foremost: this place was CLEAN and the bed was oh-so COMFORTABLE. Thoroughly enjoyed having a mini fridge and toaster oven so I could bring my own food to make, but also appreciated the snacks that were left out. Many nice touches added to the place to make you feel right at home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elle was born to host. She's truly a natural. She knew we were coming in town for a sports tournament so she bought snacks for my daughter that she knew would be good for her during her tournament. She knew we had to leave early in the morning, so she put out bagels. Elle couldn't have been a better host. She went way above and beyond. I'd love to stay at Elle's place again. Thank you, Elle!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Frank Lloyd Wright said ""Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art."" FLW's student Thomas H. Olson captured those qualities well when he designed Ashera. Host Thom is responsive and accommodating. We are especially grateful for the most dog-friendly stay we have found."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for a relaxing and quiet one night stay. Overall, Thomas was very communicative and the place was in great condition. Wish we could have stayed longer. Will recommend to others when traveling this way."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property was quiet and peaceful. I felt right at home with the river close by and seeing the chickens in the morning. The kitchen was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable, and the area was peaceful for sleeping. Please keep in mind this is a studio vs a one-bedroom apartment. So, if you have two people sleeping separately as we did one will have to sleep on the floor on a small mattress and there is no door to the bedroom separating it from the living area. I would have enjoyed staying here a couple of days to enjoy the peace and quiet this property provided."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thom was very helpful and informative. Great setting away from the city, surrounded by trees overlooking theMississippi River. A unique experience."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thomas was a great host! They were accommodating and allowed us to have a later check out, PLUS I forgot some clothes in the closet and they mailed them to me, which I really appreciated. The guest house was a perfect little getaway for us. The space is unique, cozy and it has everything you might need in the kitchen to cook a meal. It was so nice to be able to make some breakfast and take a slow morning here. Wish we had more time to explore the grounds since they looked beautiful. Definitely would love to come back sometime!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location, private wooded area. This Frank Lloyd Wright style home and the grounds are very well taken care of. Thomas was so hospitable and friendly.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We just loved this cozy little apartment. The surroundings were fantastic! We loved staying right on the bank of the Mississippi. The bed was comfy. The apartment was charmingly decorated. We want to go back. Thom‚Äôs neighbor Paul was extra friendly. We stayed in the apartment on Halloween. Paul invited us in his house and gave us candy to pass out to trick or treaters. So much fun! We really loved our stay there and so did our dog.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thom's place was very peaceful and quiet. it was the perfect getaway for our anniversary/birthday celebration. we had a great place to play and walk the dogs, beautiful oak trees all around and very serene. We will definitely consider this place again when we are in the area or need a getaway. thanks!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn‚Äôt have gotten any luckier choosing the time of year to go. We celebrated our one year anniversary surrounded by beautiful fall colors and the temperate was perfect.
Hidden little gem!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,this was my second stay here and everything excellent again. it is so peaceful here. I felt very safe and great parking if you're traveling across the country with a lot of stuff in your car. Thom will take good care of you!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thomas‚Äôs place was available last minute as we were driving through the area. Definitely more peaceful than a hotel!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to relax. Very quiet. Could hear different types of wildlife at night. Thom is a great host. We invited him to hang out with us around the fire pit. He had a lots of great stories and was a great historian of the property and the area. We were even able to grab a couple of eggs from his
chickens for breakfast!! Will
definitely stay there again if in the
area."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, beautiful surroundings. Quiet, clean, private space. Perfect for one person or a cozy couple."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great, cute little place and very peaceful setting. Tom is very kind and responsive. Clean inside, but worth opening the windows to air it out, as it has somewhat of a stale, smoky scent. Also, while it does sit on the river, there isn‚Äôt an easy way to walk down from the property. There are some wonderful spots to get to the river close by and Tom had excellent recommendations to do so. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ashera is a beautiful, quiet space and Thom is a wonderful host. It's clean, small but quite functional, and in a lovely location. You get quality for the price, and if you're lucky you might get to meet and play with the two great four-legged co-hosts! We'll be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Ashera was a special experience. The property is lovely, and set up and maintained with obvious thoughtfulness and care. The space is small but so tastefully designed and nicely appointed that we felt very comfortable and happy to be there. The outdoor garden is also exceptional. We appreciate being able to bring our dog."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thom was an extraordinary host, always in the background but there if you needed something. Loved the FLW themed design and landscape features. And thanks to the hardworking girls that provided the fresh eggs. A wonderful experience."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a contender for our favorite AirBnb in Minnesota! Thom was a great host. He let us know when there was a severe thunderstorm watch, and provided recommendations for things to do in the area. We appreciated him sharing eggs from the chicken coop. The property was beautiful and felt very restful; plentiful places outside to sit and enjoy all of the birdsong. Plus, bug zappers and bug spray provided -- so mosquitos weren't a problem even in July! The guest house was very cozy and well appointed."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a quick stay at Ashera but it was clean, peaceful and relaxing."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a peaceful stay in a beautiful location! The grounds are amazing with thousands of hostas planted in raised terraced gardens. Fresh eggs for breakfast!

Thomas is a wonderful host -so friendly and welcoming! We would stay again if in the area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thom was a friendly and accommodating. He set up the house in a very welcoming manner. Breakfast table set for the next morning, snacks for watching TV, a cute mini kitchen and a very comfy bed. Overall peaceful and holistic feeling. No other BnB like it!! We especially enjoyed the labyrinth."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thom was a great host and was very accommodating for all of our needs. The airbnb was very cozy feeling.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an incredible spot! The house was beautifully redone and had everything we needed. Plenty of space for my husband and I, our 6 month old in crib and our dog. But the showstopper is the outdoor space. Thom's place is truly a hidden paradise and pictures don't do it justice. The grounds are so peaceful and idyllic. We especially loved the labyrinth. We only stayed one night passing through, but this place is a destination in itself. Thom is a great host and was there for whatever we needed, while also giving us plenty of privacy. We hope to go back!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thom and his place made a wonderful getaway for us. The photos are nice but really don't do it justice. It is all beautiful. I'm not really sure how/if one would get down to the river, but we were only there one night. Very serene location and experience with an interesting historical/architectural story. The place has everything you need--quite thoughtful. Wish we had more days! Thank you for being so accommodating and for sharing your place with others. Excellent hospitality."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful and peaceful guest suite on the banks of the mississippi! my wife was extremely excited to learn and read about the frank lloyd wright connection, including the floorplan in the bedroom of the suite drawn by the architect. kitchenette and snacks were great, along with breakfast laid out on the table for us! quick tip: also placed out on the counter were two spray cans of OFF, you'll definitely want to use them if visiting when there's high humidity.

Emma"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This MIL apartment has everything you need for a quiet, comfortable stay. Thom provided clear instructions in advance, and when we arrived, he pointed out a few more things about the apartment. Fully outfitted galley kitchen, small office sized fridge/freezer combo. Thom even left snacks & beverages for us. This unit is comfortable for 2, I wouldn't recommend 3. The gardens/landscaping are gorgeous. Bed was softer than we're used to but comfortable, sofa/futon in living area . . . not so much. Overall clean, good amenities, peaceful, beautiful & a good price."

Oatmeal and cereal bars for breakfast. Bed and linens were very nice. Could have cooked simple meals in the small but well-outfitted kitchen.
The grounds are very peaceful. Multiple nice places to sit and eat meals or just enjoy the calm. Very cool to see the mighty Mississippi up where it is not yet so mighty, flowing just a bit down the hill from the main house. Fun to see the chickens as well.
Highly recommend for a getaway."

There is nowhere on the property that doesn't have a beautiful view with a peaceful setting. The guest quarters are perfectly quaint with everything you could need and more (just don't plan to spend much time inside, you'll want to enjoy the natural beauty the grounds have to offer). Thom had everything you could need from kitchen supplies down to a beautiful setting for breakfast and dinner and even provided snacks. A gracious host for a perfect property, truly a wonderful experience."

The peacefulness, birdsong, and quiet; coupled with the beauty of the suite and the many thoughtful touches Thomas incorporated; made us desire a stay that was longer and wanting to return.
As a host, Thom ranks among the best. He truly was concerned for our comfort and satisfaction with our stay. He was easily accessible yet respectful of our privacy.
We felt fortunate to be the first guests at Ashera and believe Thom will have a very successful venture."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This recently renovated house is located in a nice, family-oriented neighborhood. Emily is a great host.
The neighborhood is walkable with some green spaces around. The house itself has a clean grassy area as well, where you can toss a ball or so. Downtown Sauk Rapids is maybe a mile away. Typical small town. So, if you need more you have to drive to StCloud, but it is a short, easy drive.
The house is clean, very comfortable, and the amenities are great. The beds are clean and comfortable. Couches are good.
You really do not need anything beyond what the house offers, but just in case Emily is proactively checking if things are OK and she responds quickly.
We definitely think it is a great Airbnb and we will be back!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emily's place fit our needs for a 4-generation family get-together that included six adults and three children. The layout worked very well; and, the house was quiet and in an established neighborhood. While the yard would have been great for the kids (ages 7 and 8), it rained; however, we had plenty of inside space for playing cards, board games and doing crafts. Good stay for us. Thanks, Emily!"

There was plenty of room for all of us to hang out, eat and sleep. We had a great time and Emily was very helpful with suggestions of where to eat in the area and things to do nearby. She was quick to respond to my questions and even let us check in a little earlier. If I am ever in the area and need a place to stay, I will definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emily is an amazing host ‚Äî house was exactly as advertised. I cannot overstate how wonderful every single detail was.
My partner and I traveled to St Cloud to welcome our son into the world and there was nothing to worry about with our accommodations. We stayed for a few weeks and house was excellent in all ways. As a bonus was conveniently located close to downtown (walkable to pharmacy and grocery store) and the hospital.
Emily was very kind and responsive ‚Äî look no further, this is a great place to book.
5 STARS ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We flew into MN for a funeral and Emily‚Äôs house was just perfect. It was great for chatting with our three families who stayed here and was a great ‚Äúbase camp‚Äù for other travels over the weekend visiting other friends and family while in the area.
Very easy to major roadways and the house was even decorated for Christmas. I would highly recommend and would stay again whenever in the area."

A couple recommendations were made at the end of our trip & she was very receptive to them. We also asked for lunch recommendations & went to one of the suggestions; so happy we did!
Thank you for providing a quiet homey stay with our friends!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Easy to find, clean, spacious!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will plan to be back next year, thanks again"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm so happy we found Emily‚Äôs home in a lovely residential neighborhood for our family base while attending a wedding. It was so nice to have an entire home to spread out and relax instead of hotel rooms. I messaged a few days before checking in to ask if there was an iron and she kindly brought one before we arrived. Check in was a breeze with the keypad on the door instead of keys to keep track of. There is plenty of space to get ready with the extra vanity sink in the upstairs bathroom so we weren‚Äôt bumping into each other. There was plenty of space to relax, loved the sectional in the basement, so cozy. Nice deck with seating and a grill. If we are ever back in the area I would love to stay again. Well done!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily was very easy to communicate with and has a truly beautiful place that is close to many amenities. If you choose to stay you will be happy.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very helpful and friendly host, nice and tidy home, was a great experience for us!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very nice & spacious. My husband & I were there with our adult daughters and their husband/boyfriend, it was great to each have our own bedroom. The full kitchen was great to be able to make breakfast & also prepare food for my mother in law‚Äôs celebration of life. There were just a couple cleaning items that could have been a little better, the porch was full of leaves and had a half drank water bottle, some corners were dusty and there was a dirty rag in the downstairs bathtub. But we enjoyed our stay so much more than a hotel so we had a place to have a family game night or able to relax & watch a movie!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We drove in from out of state and this was a wonderful place to be able to take a couple of days to rejuvenate. Emily is a great host!
One thing to note that I missed in the listing: this is a split level house.
When you walk in, there are about a dozen stairs that go up to the main floor and about a dozen stairs they go down to the daylight basement. The kitchen is on the upper floor and the family room with the TV and the fireplace is on the lower floor, so if you intend to use both locations you'll spend a fair amount of time going up and down the stairs. Both my wife and my 90 year old father-in-law had some issues going up and down the stairs so for the most part my 90 year old father-in-law spend his time in the basement where the kids were hanging out watching TV and my wife spent most of her time on the upper floor where the kitchen and our room was located.
If your group doesn't have any mobility issues this probably isn't an issue at all but I thought it was worth noting."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very close to the hospital!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay at St Cloud.
Comfortable, Cool, and Clean!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Emily is a great host. She is very quick to respond to all texts. The home is exactly as pictured and has everything you need to make your stay feel ""just like home."" We stayed for a month using this as our ""home base"" to take day trips all over Minnesota. It worked wonderfully for us as we were able to see most of what Minnesota has to offer. We would definitely recommend Emily's house to anyone visiting Minnesota."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,It was all very convenient and a comfortable place for larger groups of people. And being able to step outside in a private back yard was wonderful.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This home! We could not stop saying, ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù upon arrival. Such a great space for our family to spread out, relax and catch our breath on a long road trip. Loved all the little details that made our stay a great respite‚Äî from the immaculately cleaned off driveway and walkway to the front door‚Äî (no snow or ice at all!) to the luxuriously soft towels and sheets, we felt so refreshed and ready to hit the road again afyer our stay. Recommend Grizzly‚Äôs Wood Fired Grill (if we would have stayed longer we would have definitely gotten some groceries and used the kitchen and huge fridge.) Rock Creek Coffee house is awesome, too, but Emily‚Äôs place has a Keurig and an electric kettle so we enjoyed both options. Thanks, Emily, we appreciate your hospitality!"

The home was clean and has a very nice layout for a family or group with the 2 bedrooms/1 bath upstairs and 1 bedroom/1 bath in the lower level. The kitchen has a nice island and the furniture in both the upstairs living room and downstairs family room were very comfortable and in good condition. The home was stocked nicely with coffee, kitchen dishes/utensils and linens. I would highly recommend this home!"

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Emily's home is simply lovely, spacious and beautifully furnished from top to bottom. We are a group of 6 retired friends away for a yearly holiday gathering and shopping trip in the area. Her home was extremely clean, decorated for the upcoming Christmas holiday (tree and all) and had every amenity that we could possibly have needed. The beds were extremely comfortable also. A few in the group had never stayed in an Airbnb and just couldn't believe the value for the money! We had an amazing stay and would highly recommend her home and are hoping it will work out next year for our annual stay. Our thanks to Emily...the hostess with the mostest!!"

2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,15 min walk to great bars and restaurants in St Cloud which was great however we had to walk past a homeless camp to get there which didn‚Äôt feel safe. The back yard was right on the river however it was very overgrown and not as picturesque as the pictures implied. The entrance screen door was broken. The bed was comfortable and the TV worked - it even had a cool feature to stream TV apps from your phone however the utility room had no door on it. The bathroom door was difficult to open. The shower was super tiny and everything was very basic (reminded me of my college days). Kitchen was minimally equipped but there was a large refrigerator. Christie was fast to communicate and very helpful. The place allowed dogs but didn‚Äôt smell like dog or have any dog hair which was great. Overall there was nothing wrong with the place and if you‚Äôre just looking for a no frills basic stay in St Cloud this would probably be fine.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy was absolutely amazing. This was a lovely little spot in St. Cloud, and I cannot say enough about the outdoor space overlooking the Mississippi River. I had work to do while I was there, and I loved getting it done, surrounded by wildlife and so many trees.
The outdoor space, and Christy‚Äôs incredibly responsive communication were the most exceptional aspects of my recent stay. Christy was beyond accommodating, and made my stay easy, delightful, and memorable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was just what we needed and exceeded our expectations. Christy was an amazing host, very responsive and kind. She also cleaned the space early in order for us to check in before our wedding event! Nice quiet neighborhood and being a quick walk over the bridge to downtown made it a great location. Definitely recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a joy staying at Christy's place. The patio overlooking the river was really beautiful and peaceful. She had many flowering scrubs and trees and a lovely yard in general. I had my dog with me and there was a dog park just 6 blocks of all.
Christy was extremely available. I had some trouble with something and I emailed her expecting to have to wait a bit for a response, but she responded within minutes of my email through airbnb.
The bed, sheets, and pillows were the softest I've ever slept in at any airbnb - I usually bring my own pillow, but it wasn't necessary. Best of all was the heated bathroom floor.
I highly recommend this little slice of heaven!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed sitting outside by the river - very nice. The unit was comfortable and spacious with everything we needed, including good coffee. When we had trouble getting on the WiFi, Christy was very responsive, coming back to restart the modem; it worked. Would stay here again if in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christy‚Äôs place was comfortable, with a lovely deck overlooking the river that we wish we‚Äôd had more time for. In an older area, it was easily walkable to restaurants across the bridge. Christy was a very responsive host."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If your in the downtown St. Cloud and looking for a place to stay I highly recommend this Airbnb. The owner was very responsive and informative. It is only 6 minutes to the Kelly inn convention center and was the perfect location to get away from all the downtown traffic without having to drive a long ways. The Airbnb felt like an extension of home. Very clean and organized. Its the perfect spot for a work trip spot to stay.

2022-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Christy was a very good communicator and I really appreciate that!
Her place was good. The shower is very small and dark but for a short stay it's not the end of the world. There was no way to complete close yourself into the basement which I did not enjoy (there was one door that opened out and did not have a lock). Bed was relatively comfortable, and location of the house was in a cute neighborhood and close to a cute park with good sidewalks to walk on and get some fresh air."

2021-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"The host was very nice and had great communication however, the place was a basement guest room which was cold and had many bugs buzzing around and in the shower. We didn't like that there wasn't a lock or separate door to get into the basement. It didn't seem like anyone was in the upstairs main house part and we would have rather stayed there. It was not the most comfortable stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view of the river and nice seating area outside to enjoy it. Perfect hostess and nice clean area with everything you need to be comfortable.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a renovated basement space. It is a high quality basement apt for 1 or 2 people! The view from the back patio is lovely. Entering the apt was a challenge, but Christy was there in 10 mins to help with the lock. Understand that you must turn the deadlock manually to enter the house."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy place was a great value for the price. I had a girls weekend my two older teen granddaughters.
Check in is easy.
Bed super comfortable
Fast response to any communication.
It is near the center of town but back on a road that backs up to the river. So very private small town rural feeling.
I had a injury while visiting St. Cloud n Christy was very accommodating to extend my visit so my husband could get down to drive.
I will definitely see if this location is available when the girls n I meet up again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks again! We'll definitely be on the lookout next time we're up that way!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our purposes. 1 couple and 2 singles were in our party. We did not have to use the basement bedroom. While the bedroom is nice, the rest of the basement has not been updated yet, so it would have been a challenge for any of us to feel comfortable down there. But I feel that is a personal preference and others may not mind it. We did use the twin bedroom upstairs ( as well as the 2 queen rooms ) and it worked, but the sloping roof in the twin room would make it hard to use for anyone taller than 5‚Äô3‚Äù. The main floor is fully remodeled and very nice. We didn‚Äôt cook much, but the kitchen was well stocked! Coffee bar was awesome!! Overall, we had a great stay, and the owners are super responsive to all messages!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for a great stay! It was so nice to have a home base while down in St. Cloud to watch the Huskies.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our reason for visiting St Cloud was for a family funeral. Obviously a very sad event, so It was especially nice to be able to regroup and relax by coming back to a cozy home rather than just returning to sterile hotel rooms.
The living/dining/sleeping areas were very comfortable for our family of four. Everything was immaculately clean. There was a lovely welcome note and a basket of goodies in the kitchen, and the coffee setup was great. We also really appreciated the Brita filtered water in the frig.
Finally, we really enjoyed the record player and albums! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Overall great stay and we were very comfortable. Quiet neighborhood. We had a few hiccups along the way and host was always helpful and responded fast.

Parking was on the street, and it feels like a safe neighborhood so no worries at all. Thank you for sharing your place, I will definitely be back if I‚Äôm in the area!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved my stay here Melissa and Brent's place. The room and bathroom was very clean, and the mattress was great- I slept like a log every night! I had everything I needed for a very comfortable stay.
The house is beautifully decorated, and the location is perfect- close to all amenities and has very convenient on street parking. I felt very safe. Melissa is a very friendly, kind and welcoming host. I didn't get to meet Brent, but I have no doubt he would have been the same!
I'm not a cat person, but the two cats were very sweet and friendly. I was quite smitten by the time I left.
Would highly recommend staying here."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I really needed to give a 5 star rating. Unfortunately the host fell under the weather the day before I arrived. She gave me the option to keep the reservation or to cancel. I decided to cancel and she gave me a full refund (fees refunded as well).

It's warm and inviting and we felt right at home as soon as we walked in; both from the home itself as well as meeting Melissa at the door when we arrived. Melissa keeps an immaculate home.

The upstairs bedroom I stayed in was very comfortable and the guest bathroom had everything you could need. I really enjoyed getting to know Brent and Melissa (and their cuddly cat Max!).

They are so nice and I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with Melissa about our travels, theirs and mine. Their home is lovely and ultra clean in a very nice neighborhood. Their kitty is so sweet and loving. My bedroom was very cute and comfortable. I was even able to park in their garage...a luxury.

2017-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My stay with Brent and Melissa was great! Melissa was very friendly and flexible with my check in. The place was very quiet and peaceful. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting that area. They also have a map with pins from all visitors in the dining room that you tag when you leave which I thought was a cool touch being a big traveler myself.
2017-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The house is very well-organized and clean. It was convenient having a garage to put my car in, and I especially loved the adorable, sweet cat!"
2017-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful stay -- You would be a fool to stay anywhere else around St. Cloud! I stayed at this location for about 4 weeks for a clinical rotation at St. Cloud Hospital. Location is about 10 min drive from hospital. Brent and Melissa were extremely accommodating and friendly. Amenities were fantastic. This is not just a spare bedroom they decided to rent out, B&M plan to be an airbnb location and you can tell. I had a wonderful experience for an extended stay. Neat, clean, friendly, very accommodating, would absolutely recommend."

2016-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Melissa and Brent were wonderful host! My stay was very comfortable. I stayed for 2 weeks and felt at home. They are sociable and friendly but also considerate (if wanting privacy). Their home is close to restaurants and shopping areas. They like to travel and it was nice to hear about their adventures. Highly recommend! Would go back!
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brent and Melissa's place was a welcome retreat. Excellent location and they were very kind and communicative. They also have the cutest little white cat. I definitely will return if I need to come back to St Cloud.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time that I stayed at Brent and Melissa's. The second time was just as good as the first. Clean room, easy communicatin, easy check in and out, and a friendly cat."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brent & Melissa's place is the ideal Airbnb. They are very friendly and accommodating, and their place is cleaner than a hotel! It's a very cheery atmosphere with a very comfortable bed, super soft pillows, and a congenial cat. Although we didn't get to know then well, we could tell right away that they were ""kindred spirits"". :) Highly recommend!"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a lovely stay with Brent & Melissa. They were more than accommodating and their house is beautiful and very comfortable. 10/10 :)

2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brent and Melissa were fabulous hosts! This was the perfect stay for our weekend of hockey games. The location was close to everything we needed. Melissa made us feel totally welcome in her lovely home. Kitty was a bonus! We enjoyed talking with Melissa about world travel and added our own ""pin"" to their map. Overall, a great experience and we'd stay here again! Thank you!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were amazing! We came into town for a 3 day competition. Melissa gave us a welcome tour at arrival. The house was clean and as pictured. Brent/Melissa made us feel like friends visiting from out of town. Super supportive and gracious! The neighborhood was quiet but close to some great restaurants, Target, gas, etc. We enjoyed breakfast one morning on the swing taking in the beautiful weather. We'll definitely stay here again if we are fortunate enough to be in the area next year."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Melissa and Brent were absolutely wonderful hosts! My husband and I felt welcomed right from the get-go and both Melissa and Brent were always happy to help us with any questions or needs that we had. Their house was very well kept and just as it appears in the pictures -- cute and homey! We honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience during our three month stay there.
2016-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a good visit with Brent and Melissa. Melissa keeps a good house, and is warm and welcoming. They have a very friendly cat, and the house is well kept and orderly."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brent and Melissa are very down to earth people. While my stay was brief it was great to learn about their travels and interests.
Their home is very clean and they both made me feel very welcomed in their home. The room was just as described.
I hope to stay with them the next time I am in town."
2016-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I spent a wonderful week with Brent & Melissa. The accommodation was comfortable and cozy and in keeping with the listing description. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. Their home is within walking distance to shopping malls, restaurants etc. Though we had no occasion to use the bus, the bus route is also in very close proximity to the house, which is a great advantage.
We really appreciate their hospitality. Melissa went out of her way to make us feel at home and also to show us some interesting landmarks in the city (which she need not have done - Thank you again Melissa!). We have no hesitation in recommending their home to anyone who would like to spend a quiet, comfortable and homely stay in Waite Park, Minnesota."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brent and Melissa's home was very comforting and inviting. I had no trouble finding the house and it was in a very nice neighborhood. Had I stayed longer I may have even taken a walk around. They have a very friendly house cat named Kitty who I just adored and fell in love with.
2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa and Brent were fantastic hosts and the bed and pillows were super comfy. I arrived after a very long drive so I was to tired to talk in the evening but had a lovely chat with Melissa in the morning. My favorite part of the stay was pinning their map that shows were all their AirBNB guests have been from.
2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Brent and Melissa's home was perfect for our weekend. Very clean and comfortable with great proximity to St Bens. Much nicer feel than any expensive hotel option. The communication for check in quick and easy. We would definitely stay here again!
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this sweet young couple's charming house was a delight. Everything was clean, tidy and comfortable. The location is fantastic, Melissa and Brent are kind and interesting and they didn't seem to get sick of me.....even on day five. ""Kitty"" is one the friendliest cats ever and kept me company quite often while I was working on schoolwork. I look forward to my next stay already!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"With both Brent and Melissa working, it was a treat to have Kitty welcome me upon arrival. The house is just as lovely as the pictures and description claim and the room was very clean and comfortable as was the bathroom. The only negative would be was having the bathroom directly off the living room when I would come in to get ready for bed in the evenings; but most nights the hosts were not even there, so it was not even a problem, and they were gracious to allow me use of their bathroom upstairs throughout the night when I awoke. I also felt quite at home in using the kitchen and dining room for my needs in cooking and eating. I would definitely recommend Brent and Melissa as host's in anyone's travel plans."
2016-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice house and hosts. Close to shopping and parks, and on a quiet street. The price is good and all necessary items included."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! We were made to feel very welcome and comfortable.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Melissa was a great host and made me feel very welcome. Kitty also rolled out the red carpet - she is the most affectionate cat ever! The room is on the small side but has everything you'd need, with a decent sized closet. The house overall is absolutely spotless and they've decorated it really well. The kitchen is also well stocked if you need to cook. If my travels ever take me back to Waite Park again I will be staying here!"
2016-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa was SO incredibly sweet! She greeted me and had two lovely kinds of tea waiting for the snowy day that had just happened. We got to sit and chat and talk about travel; something we both love! The room is nice and quiet and even a pillowy mask was provided to keep out the morning light. Had a great stay with Brent and Melissa!
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Brent and Melissa were amazing!! Brent welcomed me when I arrived and gave me a tour of the house. It was great. I got to meet Melissa once she got off and she was so friendly. I would definitely recommend their place for someone looking to stay in the area.
2016-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I made this booking for a young lady travelling to the US for the first time. Brent & Melissa were so helpful when taking the booking and so kind and helpful when the young lady was staying with them. Lovely, comfortable room. Can't express how grateful I am to Brent and Melissa. Really good people!!!"
2015-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Brent and Melissa were amazing hosts! My friend and I were traveling through so we were in need of a relaxing environment and that is exactly what we got and more! Unfortunately Melissa had to be at work while we were there but Brent was home to greet us and show us our room and the amenities. They were both a huge help messaging before and even had fruit for us to have in the morning and take on the road!
2015-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Brent and Melissa are welcoming and friendly hosts - as was their cat! Their house is very clean and tidy and was an excellent location close to downtown. I'd highly recommend this spot.
2015-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed with Brent and Melissa for a long-term stay while I working a 4 month contract in the area. Their home was a great fit for my long term purposes as Brent and Melissa are great people, I had my own bathroom space, Melissa opened her kitchen to me, and covered parking. (I never had to scrape off my windshield before work!) My stay was very comfortable and I would recommend staying here for a short or long stay!"
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience in a very spacious, organized and comfortable home. Excellent location. Melissa and Brent are great hosts who made me feel right at home. I look forward to staying with them during my next trip to St. Cloud."

2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brent & Melissa were fantastic hosts. They are super nice and their house is clean and welcoming. They also have a very sweet and affectionate cat. We stayed in a comfortable bedroom and were given a private bathroom. We would gladly stay there again and would recommend them to others without hesitation. Thanks Brent and Melissa!
2015-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, are these people nice! They made us feel at home right away. They have a nice booklet including nearby attractions, which made it very easy for us to set our schedule. They even made an last-minute adjustment to our itinerary--flexible and nice people. To top it all off, they left US with a thank you card. Nice!"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brent and Melissa's house was immaculate and has the friendliest cat ever. We met Melissa only briefly, having arrived late the night before, but thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Melissa and Brent's place was so rewarding that I don't even know where to start. I may say it has been my best AirBnB experience so far. She is very friendly and their house is beautiful and comfortable. It just perfectly organized and full of details that makes it feels like home in every single corner. I am really thankful of having find her place. She is the perfect host and will make you feel you are really at home. Brent is rather quiet but friendly at the same time, which was totally fine since my son who stayed with me at their home is the same :D
If you have to choose within other places, chose this one, you won't regret it. Thank you Melissa, Brent, and of course Kitty, for making us feel very comfortable. We were very happy to meet you and stayed at your lovely home <3"
2015-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay with Melissa and Brett was short and sweet. Though we did not have an opportunity to get to know each other due to my schedule, they were more than accommodating for a pleasant stay and a possible late check-in (thanks again, Melissa for being hospitable when I arrived super early!!). The home and bedroom were cozy and comfy-- Which was nice to come home to at the end of the night. Upon checking out, a note was left for me which made my stay even sweeter."
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brent and Melissa are great. from the beginning the communication was quick, and accurate. Check in was a breeze, with easy access in and out of the house. the neighborhood is safe, good for walking, with well manicured lawns. The neighborhood feels residential, and you are within walking distance of twenty five to thirty restaurants, and a quick drive to downtown St Cloud. The house is very clean, the room has a comfortable bed, and ample closet space with plenty of extra blankets if you needed. They have an awesome cat that is a real lover. if you don't like cats you can just keep your bedroom door shut. If you plans take to you St Cloud I highly recommend staying here."
