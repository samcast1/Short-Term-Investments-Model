2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a different place that was canceled day of check-in. Able to get Glen's place on short notice & was very glad that I did. Was a much better place and cheaper price than my original location. Wish I would've found here first, because I would have definitely booked this place. I travel to the area for business once a month. if this unit is available I will most certainly book again in the future."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My only suggestion would be to lower the cleaning fee because I had to remove the garbage and strip the bed. You don’t clean every day so I think the fee is too high.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I create inspiring home spaces professionally. I have never stayed in a space that had so much emotional intelligence, inspired design, and was set in nature like this one. I literally looked out of the kitchen window and saw a Fox. Paige is an absolute treasure of a host. No words to express how much she cares about guest experience."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Glen and Lucy were excellent and proactive hosts. We had a storm roar through Maine during my stay and they kept me readily informed with information about outages.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little spot in downtown Augusta! Walkable to all the great restaurants and bars on water street and the kennebec river trail. Glen and co-hosts were very responsive and even accommodated a last minute request from us! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Working in the area and needed somewhere to stay for a few days that wasn’t an hour away. I can see now why this place stays booked up.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in Augusta
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay in a quiet location that was still very easy access to downtown and various Augusta hubs of business and shopping/dining. Entire space was very clean and the check in procedure/orientation was fantastic. The hosts were quick to respond to questions and were able to accommodate a slightly earlier arrival so I could run an online meeting from the AirBnB instead of having to find somewhere else to post up until the normal check in time. Bed was great for those who like a soft mattress and the windows allowed plenty of natural light as desired. Great shower water pressure with adjustable head for different spray modes. Kitchen sink was incredibly spacious and kitchen as a whole was set up well. Easy plugs for phone charging on the night stand was appreciated and warm glow bedside lamps that had different brightness settings was great for nighttime reading.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greatly enjoyed our stay and may want to book again next time we travel to the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is super close to downtown Augusta! You can walk to restaurants & a great walk to the river! Beautiful 😍
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are traveling to Augusta, please consider this quaint little studio. Centrally located, and a mere block from all of the riverside restaurants. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Very comfortable and quiet place.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I asked about check out time, My flight was later that afternoon, I only asked if i could stay another 45 minutes...the young lady told me she would call the Police. I was only asking a question...I did not say I was staying or wanted to stay...I thought her answer was a little extreme. I was already packed to go, I just left that's all. Communication and kindness can go a long way. I was asking a question it was not an argument. I am a professional, here at the behest of the State of Maine."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good central location for my particular needs -- driving to/from Portland airport, getting to various places for weekend wedding activities, day trip to nearby Camden, and exploring the area. I ended up not going to any restaurants or shops in Augusta, although the waterfront street was very convenient and within a quick walk of the rental unit. I was not interested in the selection of places along the waterfront street, so I went elsewhere.
The rental unit was exactly as advertised and the pictures matched exactly. Keep in mind that this is a very basic unit, although I did appreciate the coffee and coffee supplies stocked for my use.
My only issues were external noise -- heavy machinery showed up at 5:30 a.m. to remove old structure and debris in the lot right behind my room, and the neighbors upstairs had a kid (or kids) that were running around and noisy -- but these issues were out of the control of the host, and they are things you can encounter in any rental."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Glen's place while visiting our daughters in their summer camp. The studio was very comfortable. It is a short walk from good restaurants, and a short drive to stores and other lovely towns.
We'll be returning at the end of the month to pick up our daughters, so I am looking forward to another great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location in Augusta, very cozy studio apartment perfect for a couple. The hosts were very flexible with check in time which was very appreciated and provided check in instructions well ahead of time. Would absolutely consider booking again"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive host, very clean I would definitely recommend and stay again thank you"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here - it is such a convenient location and has everything you need. Cozy little space with all the essentials. Will be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice small apartment, conveniently located. Has all the essentials. Was surprised how nice the location turned out to be. We had a tiny tot who needed to get out of the tiny house, and we found a playground, river, historical fort, and library with an awesome kids section all within walking distance. The laundry is shared, but we were able to access when needed. The bed is much softer than we personally find comfortable, but overall we were happy with our stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bang for your buck!
Great little place to stay at with kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom amenities in a GREAT LOCATION. Very close to downtown and walkable to most places.
WiFi was great! The TV was also a bonus with access to a Netflix account for those nights in. Full sized refrigerator, cooking utensils (make sure to bring your own spices), and laundry room were all amazing features to this stay.
Bed was a little too soft for our liking, but if you like sleeping on super soft clouds, stay here for sure! The couch was firmer than the bed and just as comfy, if that's your thing, too. Nightstands had charging ports for phones and watches, which was very convenient."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would have been nice to have more towels and blankets. But very nice otherwise, good location, quiet. Thanks!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and complete
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I needed a place to stay while movers moved my stuff. This place was affordable, right by downtown, and easy to get to."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really enjoyed my stay! The space was clean, well organized and had everything I needed. I worked a few days from the apartment and found the internet connection to be great for that. I liked the quick walk to the downtown area and trail along the river. I would definitely book there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Glen was very helpful and responded immediately when I had a question. The place was super clean and had everything we needed. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Glenn is always very friendly and responsive. The apartment has been clean and tidy for all my stays. Highly recommended!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had another great stay at this apartment! Glenn’s place is always extremely clean and looks just like the photos. Highly recommended!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying here. It’s a great little place, and it always extremely clean. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice small apartment. Bed was very comfortable as others had described. Private entrance and parking spot right beside it. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there could be a couple upgrades that could be made to make the stay even better... Better couch and Room Darkening Shades. Would stay again if was in the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and had everything I needed for my stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed an excellent stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great little place for a stay. Had everything you need. Clean, easy check-in. Bed was super comfy!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My stay at Glen's place was comfortable and reasonably priced. The studio apartment was just the right size for what I needed and close to downtown for restaurants and shopping. Its proximity to downtown was very convenient. During my stay it snowed a couple of times. The stairs and porch were cleared of the snow right away and sand and salt were used to keep the sidewalks and driveways safe. Glen definitely cared about the safety of his guests.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really easy to get to and to use. Just what I needed. Bed was super comfortable and bathroom was very clean. Would stay again if I came back to visit.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A clean and comfortable rental located conventional near downtown Augusta.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Glen was an amazing host I actually extended my stay! The laundry room was very convenient.. Very appreciative for his services & I will definitely stay here again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just had my second stay in this unit, again Glen was a fantastic host! I really do love the space and setup. I hope to stay again in the future!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is super comfortable and cozy I highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice apartment to stay in. I travel for work and stay in a lot of airbnbs, the bed here was one best I’ve slept in so far so far so I was pleasantly surprised. Great tv setup as well!! Glen was an extremely responsive and respectful host I hope I get to stay here again in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, a cozy and comfortable stay. Many thanks!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Travis' place. Simple and met our needs for the long weekend. We only spent evenings there as we spent most days out and about at the Windsor Fair and visiting family. It was tidy, floors and bathrooms very clean, plenty of coffee available for the mornings. Good water pressure in the bathroom, ample toiletries and towels, easy TV set up for guest access to netflix, amazon, etc. Neighborhood quiet and people friendly.
Travis was friendly and gave us good recommendations for breakfast, dinners out, etc.
Quick response time to our pre check-in questions as well. (Enjoyed meeting his sweet dog too.)
Overall...worth the money."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis is accommodating & responded quickly to questions. Apartment was perfect for one to two people. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. Beautiful scenic location, only a few minutes to Augusta and a couple of minutes to downtown Hallowell shops, restaurants & bars, and the beautiful scenic Kennebec river.
Travis is a super host and I would choose to stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay! The airbnb was full of high quality amenities, clean, and comfortable. The bedding and towels were well kept and new linens and towels were always available. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking and had a great coffee maker. There are some steep stairs up to the apartment and some tight corners in the space getting into the bed and shower which may be difficult if your mobility is limited, but I had no problems and a wonderful stay in a great place. The Wi-Fi was fast as well, and the airbnb is a 20 minute walk from downtown. The walls are a bit thin between you and the outside world, but the area is secluded and the garage below you is rarely occupied. I would highly recommend this airbnb and will be keeping it in mind for the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about how perfect Travis’s place was. The adorable apartment was cozy, spotlessly clean and comfortable and had everything I could possibly need. It was very close to the amazing town of Hallowell, and Travis even left recommendations for some great places to eat. I look forward to staying there again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here during my travel healthcare assignment as my previous living situation had been quite hostile towards my dogs. My dogs and I felt very comfortable while we stayed here for a few months. Both dogs had a lot of anxiety, and they were not themselves during our stay due to our prior living arrangement; however Travis and Chelsea were completely understanding. We absolutely loved it here. Travis and Chelsea left me great restaurant recommendations, and I tried every single one of them. We were close to so many hiking trails which was fantastic for my days off. The apartment was clean, quiet, and it looked exactly like the pictures. I highly recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed by the hospitality Travis and Chelsea demonstrate."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Was a perfect 1BR garage Apt! … clean, plenty of space, and attentive owner!! Will definitely rent again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Again, a comfortable and convenient base for our Hallowell visit. Thanks for your hospitality!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Travis was an excellent host! I was there for a couple weeks, and so he made sure to check in occasionally to see if I needed essentials like dish soap and towels. I felt very welcome, safe, and comfortable in the place! Their lovely giant dog would bark at me at first, but eventually we became friends and she was the sweetest girl who just wanted pets. The location is very close to the main street in Hallowell, and Travis left me a very thoughtful area guide of restaurants to check out. I highly recommend Travis' place to anyone looking for a cozy, comfy place in Hallowell!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Travis is an excellent host and very accomodating.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had an awesome stay in Hallowell. Travis was super accommodating, the space was comfortable, and well furnished. Wifi was strong enough for simultaneous remote work and tv watching. The town was easily accessible with a good hilly walk or a 2 minute drive. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Close to downtown and very spacious. Host was attentive and kind. One of the best places to stay in the area !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location if you need to be near Augusta. Perfect for the three nights we stayed. Dog friendly which we needed.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful apartment close to downtown. We can’t say enough about the accommodations. The hosts communicate so well with guests and the apartment had everything we needed. Looking forward to the next trip up to Maine so we can stop by!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, clean, private space above the garage with a separate entry. Basic amenities all available along with a full kitchenette. Host was very communicative and responsive to questions and requests. Air conditioner in living room window was a bit loud (visited on a hot summer weekend), but the queen bed and couch were comfortable, towels soft, and water pressure was good.
Located in a cute, safe-feeling family-oriented neighborhood that is incredibly convenient to the shops & restaurants in downtown Hallowell, an adorable riverside destination of the Augusta area. Hosts provided a great list of dining suggestions and I’m sure would have provided additional advice for local destinations if I had needed any. Fast wifi, had no problems getting onto my VPN to do some work. I did not use the television or kitchen appliances other than the microwave and refrigerator.
Would stay here again, happy to recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Words can not describe how kind Travis and Chelsea are. They are amazing hosts and are very accommodating. Their little haven in hallowell is the perfect little retreat! I stayed here for a month while I started a new job. The space is clean, modern, quiet, and cozy! It has everything you would ever need! 10/10 would definitely stay here again. Was very thankful that I got to call this place home for an entire month!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is well-designed and functional. The host is very nice and accommodating. We had fun in the town of Hallowell.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We found everything we needed in this modern apartment — so close to downtown Hallowell, but with lots of room for our dog to romp with Del! Thank you, Travis and Chelsea, for your hospitality! We hope to return for another visit."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location - walking distance to downtown Hallowell. Warm and comfortable apartment. Great communication from Travis along with restaurant recommendations and pastries from the local farmers market.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful apartment. Very modern, clean and comfortable. Perfect for two people. Quiet and friendly location. Very close to restaurants. Hosts were very helpful and considerate. Very central to area attractions and highways."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and great for our quick stay in Hallowell. The Host was easy to communicate with and we will definitely be coming back next time we are in town.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was relaxed and cozy. We chose this air bnb because not only was it adorable, it was also close to a wedding we were invited to. We were very happy with our stay- we had plenty of towels, face cloths and there was soap and body wash available to use. There could have been a few extra blankets, however that was my only gripe! Travis is incredibly friendly and communicative, while even offering nice local restaurants to try. He was kind enough to let us stay a little longer past our check out time as the next guests weren’t coming for another day or so. I highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a cute and cozy place to stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful visit! Perfect place to stay and convenient location to a welcoming town in Maine.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Travis and his wife are great hosts! Very friendly and welcoming. Prior to our arrival, they asked if we had any special requests and offered up toys, pack and play, etc as we were traveling with a toddler. They were also gracious enough to let us use the swing set in the backyard. The apt is great— well thought out design with lots of bright light, storage and very clean. Travis is incredibly communicative and immediately addressed any questions we had. Highly recommend their place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Travis is an excellent host he made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The apartment was extremely cute and clean. Overall an excellent stay.I definitely recommend this place.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Travis' place is a perfect place to stay if you are in the Hallowell or Augusta area. It is a 1 or 2 minute drive to downtown Hallowell and less than a 10 minute drive to the capitol building in Augusta. And it is in a lovely neighborhood on a ridge from where you can see incredible sunrises! The apartment is super clean and organized, the bed is very comfortable, the shower is really good. Also the wifi works great. I had to work remotely via computer two of the days I was there, and I had no problem connecting and having enough internet speed to do what I needed for work. Travis had a number of suggestions for good places to go eat and drink in Hallowell. I think we went to them all while we were there; we were not disappointed in any of them. Hallowell really has some good restaurants and pubs and even a really nice cocktail bar where I had the best cocktail I think I've ever tasted."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very tidy and lovely apartment equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom, and perfect little kitchen! Travis is an outstanding host and there when you need him. Located in Hallowell, ME this is the perfect stay in the cutest town. I highly recommend!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome space located in a beautiful area & great hosts!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was great- cozy and clean- and Travis was quick with responses and left great recommendations for local places to eat and visit!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Travis’s place! Check in was so easy and the apartment was very clean and cozy. I loved the personal touches and the recommendations that were given to us as a personalized note. Would love to stay again.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent spot, excellent communication, highly recommend."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect spot in Hallowell! I stayed at Travis’ place for a wedding and it was great. He was quick to respond to messages and accomidating to a late check in. Very thoughtful touches as a host as well. The area around is absolutely beautiful! I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a place to stay.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis + family are great hosts. Travis responds to messages in a timely manner and is quite generous. The place is above the garage, but don't let this sway you away as a guest. I hardly heard the garage and when I did it occurred during the day time. The neighborhood is silent (minus a few crickets at night) and incredibly safe. There were zero concerns about my valuables. The bed is a bit stiff, but i slept well each night. The apartment contains an AC unit and a functioning kitchen. Overall, this unit contained everything described in the ad and was better than expected.
The house is at most .5 mile from ""downtown"" Hallowell which is a tiny town on a river. This area offers a fair amount of food options such as a juice/smoothie/coffee/tea/salad bar, restaurants and a bakery. Augusta is a short drive (maybe 1-1.5 miles) away and is easy to navigate.
Overall, this was a fantastic stay and I'd recommend if you're looking for a place to stay."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area for a wedding and had a lovely stay at Travis's place. The pictures and descriptions are accurate, and Travis was very responsive. We weren't able to connect with Travis due to our schedule, but getting into the apartment ourselves was a breeze. We also appreciated his helpful recommendations and took advantage of one of the local bakeries he had recommended. All in all -- a fantastic stay."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful space in a wonderful location. Clean, roomy and bright. Hosts are friendly and responsive. Highly recommended."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. Really nice neighborhood, close enough to restaurants and shopping. This was our first experience with using AirBnb and based on our experience with Travis we will 100% do it again. If we are ever back in Maine we will 110% look for Travis’ place!!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis was a super-responsive host (and was thoughtful enough to ask if I had any questions prior to staying at his place). When I checked-in, he had left a note for me with answers to my questions. Also, really comfortable bed and can't beat the proximity to downtown! Would definitely stay here again."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space is modern and well laid out. We were very comfortable and appreciated the ac unit on a hot day. There were plenty of windows and everything we needed (kitchen, bath, etc) was there. Super clean & comfy stay!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the In-law Apartment in Hallowell! Travis and Chelsea were consummate hosts, kind and accommodating. We loved the apartment -- cozy and comfortable, warm when it was cool outside, and cool in warm days, with a good air conditioner. The bed was comfortable, as were the sofa and chairs. The kitchen, though small, is well laid out with nice appliances. The house is in a quiet, friendly community with plenty of opportunities for walking, restaurants and stores nearby, and easy access to Hallowell, Augusta, and major thoroughfares. Travis and Chelsea were responsive and helpful and always cheerful! They were so kind, leaving small gifts such as flowers and bread from the local farmers market for us. They encouraged us to use their lovely patio and occasionally joined us (along with their darling little girl). We had a very comfortable and happy stay, and would definitely go back if the need arose. Highly recommended!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Hallowell for a family wedding, and this was a great place to stay for the weekend. The unit is super cute, clean, and very comfortable, with cozy leather couches and a comfy bed. Travis was very friendly and helpful in recommending places to eat while we were in town. Highly recommend!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was the perfect place to be close to work and out of our home, while renovations were completed."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis' place is great! My family has a place in Maine that's under construction this summer so we opted for Airbnb and had an amazing time! Downtown Hallowell has some cute shops and restaurants, Portland is easy to get to as well as the lakes. The apartment is cute and quaint. Very clean and easy to relax there. Travis is responsive and welcoming. 10/10 would reccomend!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis and his wife were some of the nicest hosts we've ever had a chance to meet. My wife, son, and I really enjoy their beautiful, thoughtfully set up accommodations. I'd recommend them highly to anybody."

2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Travis was a wonderful host. Great communication from pre-check in to greeting us at the door. The space is immaculate, comfortable, private & nicely furnished. There were lovely fresh flowers put out and a bottle of wine. A very enjoyable stay!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis & Chelsea were great hosts! They offered suggestions and guidance for places to visit, including wonderful restaurants. They were gracious hosts and we would highly recommend staying with them."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis was a wonderful host. He was great with the communication and helpful with suggestions. Above all, was the care in the details, like flowers in bathroom, a welcome msg along with freshly picked tomatoes,a well appointed kitchen, and toiletries in the bathroom. It really enhanced our stay and made us feel well taken care of. Not to mention letting us keep our bikes in his garage and being flexible with the check out.
If he is not a super host, he should be one!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay, would come back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pamela's apartment was spectacular!

Next time we travel to Maine to see the relatives I hope it available, we would rent it again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, conveniently located on a quiet street. Hosts were responsive and helpful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home is well stocked and very clean. The York peppermint patties were a nice touch. The water pressure in the shower was spot on & the towels are fluffy & luxurious. If you enjoy a softer bed, sleep in the bedroom. If you need something firm to sleep on, the pullout couch works well. The place has a significant pitch to the foundation, so wouldn’t recommend for people who are susceptible to vertigo. I would stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great three nights here. The apartment was beautifully furnished and comfortable. There were a dozen eggs in the fridge for us, so it was like breakfast was included. Close to shops and restaurants. I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in or near Hallowell (unless they have small children because of the stairs and breakables displayed)."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really well located in the little town of Hollowell. Easy walk to good food and drinks. Place was super clean, with plenty of room to spread out.

Definitely our first choice when we come to the area.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this location because I lived right across the street while in high school and college - seeing my former home through the window of such a beautiful space was wonderfully nostalgic. The gas fireplace and beautiful kitchen created a perfect get away for us while visiting old friends - and then it was just a short walk to some of the best restaurants in Maine. This place is a real gem!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,location is perfect. space is wonderful. will stay again for sure
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This property is described accurately. The apartment was spotless, comfortable with lots of natural light. The location couldn't be better, one block removed from downtown and any night time traffic sounds. You're able to walk to lots of shops to poke around in and eateries too.
The bed and furniture was comfortable and the linens high end. I feel like I got my money's worth and would stay again.
*My only frustration was that the lockbox is quite worn and not easy to figure out how to open or lock. I eventually got the key out but was unable to lock it when I left. It wasn't a problem just a temporary frustration.
Best"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was so tasteful. The craftsmanship exhibited may have been subtle, but was much appreciated. From the displayed artwork to choice of furnishings it felt that a lot of thought went into creating a welcoming and comfortable space.

We highly recommend this great find."

The apartment is one block from the downtown shops and restaurants of Hallowell, and one block from the river, making it extremely convenient. We also discovered the charming public library close by, built to look like a church, and learned that it is the oldest library in Maine. We enjoyed our stay here immensely, and highly recommend it.

It was unfortunate, especially on a nice chilly night, that the fireplace wasn’t working, but the host was very responsive and sent a super nice handy man right way, though he wasn’t able to fix it.

Pamela has thought of everything, in my opinion. Easy in, easy out and soooooo pleasant in-between. Hallowell is a lovely town filled with delightful people. If you stop and chat, they chat back. Get a haircut at Dom's. Eat at, well, pretty much any place. Hike in the Vaughan Wood. And come home and wake up in the best Airbnb you'd ever want to stay in. This sounds like a review I'd write for a friend, but I never met Pam except to quickly exchange messages. And when I say quick, that means she was right there with a direct response. Oh yes, we'll be back."

Pamela was super responsive whenever I had a question and was happy to answer questions ahead of time about COVID-19 and cleaning, etc. The amenities were also fantastic! There was a shelf of basic kitchen staples (jam, salt, oil, pepper) and even a bottle of wine in the fridge! I came here because I just needed to work from home...in a place that wasn't my house after several months. It was great. I'd stay again in a heartbeat! I was sad to leave."

Pamela was very nice and responsive and made sure we were aware of the staircase. I would not recommend if you are traveling with a curious little toddler!

There is nothing you could fault, great kitchen, comfortable beds, spotlessly clean, even all sheets and towels of top quality. Aircon for summer perfect and a few steps to a well serviced township, with several restaurants in short distance.

She even stocked the fridge with milk, eggs, water and wine. There's a narrow pull-out cupboard with LOTS of extras - peanut butter, jam, all kinds of spices, even snacks! Fresh bread, butter, and delicious muffins were left for us also. See what I mean? Her communication was always quick and informative. The bed was super comfortable. Lots of extra cozy blankets too. The apartment is very spacious, and pristine. The town is awesome - everything is in easy walking distance: shops of all kinds, delicious restaurants, a nice river to relax by in adirondack chairs. There's even a library down the street. It's about 40 minutes to Freeport (LL Bean and lots of other shops along the street), and an hour from Portland. I wish I were closer to Maine because I'd go there again and again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first time staying in Maine. Very happy that I choose this place for my first visit. There is a lake 1 block away will be beautiful in the summer. The house was very clean. It’s small but roomy at the same time. Private parking at entrance. Everything nice & clean. Bright white towels, dishes to use, lots of condiments, bottle waters, eggs, milk, coffee, chocolate on counter. There was a bottle of wine in the fridge of a nice welcome treat. The beds were comfortable. TVs in every room & Free WiFi. Location was close to restaurants. 10 drive to Walmart. My only challenge was I had my 8 yr old granddaughter who is a busy kid and quiet time start at 9 PM which is really hard to keep a kid from making noise, but I did do my best to respect the rules. so if you have busy children, I would say find another location to stay with kids. other than that I only great things to say about my stay here￼. I would 100% stay again and recommend to anyone. Worth the price. Thank you Pam"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Great spot in funky hallowell.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pamela’s place was the perfect spot for a quick stay in Hallowell. Pamela was responsive and her place was comfy and thoughtfully decorated. It is a one block walk from Pamela’s place to some great restaurants in downtown Hallowell. My family and I will definitely return. We highly recommend it.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great “mother daughter’s weekend getaway” in Hallowell. We spent the afternoon shopping on Water Street and then headed to this immaculate accommodation which is conveniently located to all the shops and restaurants. The apartment was stocked with everything you need, plus some extras like eggs, milk and a bottle of wine in the fridge!! What a nice unexpected treat. Thank you, Pamela, for making our weekend so memorable."

Thank you Pamela for everything. God bless you!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great community. Hallowell Seafood is within walking distance to get lobster and clams! (Hallowell Seafood will even cook them for you). You can walk to a variety of restaurants. You are 5 minutes from a grocery store. Great communication with the host. No issues! I would choose this place again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay here. It’s a great apartment in a great location. The nice toiletries (and even some groceries in the fridge!) make the stay even better.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Pamela's place in Hallowell; It's obvious that much time and care were put into curating the mid-century décor, and it was very generously appointed with kitchen and bathroom supplies. I felt welcome and comfortable from the moment I walked into the immaculately maintained space until we left. She had even decorated for the holidays, which was a lovely surprise.
Although this charming town had experienced some major weather issues the week before we arrived, most of the businesses were still open and serving guests with friendly and welcoming attitudes. There was a very slight gap in communication with the host at one point before we arrived due to most of the state being without power, but Pamela still responded in a VERY timely manner to find out if we had any issues or concerns. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. 5 stars!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was fantastic, if short. Great layout, great decor, impeccably clean, and very comfortable beds. We had dinner and breakfast out in two of Hallowell’s best restaurants, but the kitchen is fully equipped as well. Thanks to the hosts for sharing this gem!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Perfect location in Hallowell. Pamela responded rapidly to any questions. Good space for 4 people.

The Keurig with a selection of coffees was an instant hit! The place is conveniently located near the waterfront, riverside walk, and restaurants. Although it still felt like quiet and residential. The place was spotless, had plenty of space, and natural light. My family and I loved staying here. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the Augusta-Hallowell area."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place was lovely. The kitchen has all very new appliances and the shower is great. An additional living room lamp next to the couch would have been great otherwise you need to use the very bright overhead light to read, watch TV, etc."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed in this apartment twice for about 2 weeks and enjoyed our stay. Pamela is a great host who was quick to respond to questions. It has furnished the charming apartment with a lot of commitment and attention.
The apartment is also perfectly equipped for a longer stay: open interior design with well organized kitchen and well furnished living room. A spacious main bathroom with 2 sinks, a spacious bedroom with washing machine, dryer and ironing board, and another bedroom with a small en-suite bathroom.
In the refrigerator, Pamela had brought some food supplies as desired,

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very nice place and very clean! Pamela was very responsive and made us feel comfortable. there were a few places to eat, but not much to do the locally had to drive out. My error is not checking throughly before booking. As for the apartment, it was nice for a family of 4, not more."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed for one night in this 2 bedroom 1st floor unit of a 2-story house and found it to be immaculate, beautifully appointed with modern amenities and decor, well stocked with kitchen supplies and so many coffee options! There were flat screen TVs in both bedrooms and the living room, 1½ baths, fast wifi, and a helpful binder with nearby restaurant menus. The main bathroom seemed newly renovated - beautiful, spacious, plenty of hooks & corner bath shelves and was spotless. I felt like I was staying in a luxury suite hotel.
Pamela is also a responsive host who was quick to reply to questions. Shades were easy to open/close for light vs privacy, and the neighborhood was quiet on a Friday night. I also love Hallowell - it’s such a cute town with some great dining options and a pleasant river to look out on, and a very welcoming vibe.
We look forward to coming back soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We've stayed at this Airbnb three different times. It has always been excellent for accommodations and the location in Hallowell! Pam has also been very responsive as our host. This Airbnb is very clean with all the necessary amenities including three TVs with cable and Roku for each TV. Internet worked well for us. Pam also included bottled water, eggs, and some other food items for our use, if desired. Hallowell is a great, unique area/town for walking around with friendly people at the restaurants and shops. There's a fairly wide selection of restaurants as well and one in particular has occasional outdoor entertainment that's always enjoyable. This Airbnb is about an hour from Portland and within an hour's drive to the central part of the coast. We'll definitely be back to stay at this Airbnb!"

A true gem."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this place. The owners were incredibly considerate and provided all the necessary cooking essentials, including a variety of cooking oils such as Olive and Avocado. Although we brought our own, they also supplied eggs, whole milk, butter, and even bottles of water as a thoughtful gesture. While we didn't end up using them, it was heartwarming to see their attention to detail and it made us feel like we were at our very own vacation home. We sincerely appreciate their hospitality and we will definitely return in the future. Thank you so much!"

The apartment doesn’t have one single inch of wasted space, the layout and design were both very functional and cute. This was the most well stocked and comfortable air bnb I have ever stayed at.

I’d definitely recommend staying here, and I would definitely stay here again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a family of 5 travelling through for one night (wish it was more, because it was a great spot). The apartment was exactly as described, in the sweet little town of Hallowell, I had never been and would love to come back and explore the area more.
The apartment itself was beautifully furnished, I’m a bit of a self proclaimed furniture connoisseur, and some of pieces in the space are absolutely beautiful. The theme of the decor is really pretty and well put together. The amenities available went above and beyond.. coffee, creamer, condiments, toiletries.. lots of little extras, wonderful. The linens were very nice, all the beds were comfortable (including the pull out, which is a rarity). Walking distance to some nice shops and restaurants.
Why spent $$ on a generic hotel when you could spend the same or less on a space like this? Will definitely be adding to my airbnb favourites list!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite AirBBs to date!

Pamela was quick to action delivering candles, flash lights and even offered a generator if the blackout continued. The fact they put up a Christmas tree for us also, was such a wonderful touch. Clean, well laid out, thoughtful touches (with the basics already in the fridge, and the coffee machine ready to go, honestly - I can't even speak to how great it was. Next time we're in Hallowell, we will certainly look to stay there again."

It has the most comfortable AirBnB bed I have ever slept in, the kitchen is well-enough equipped for real cooking, and the furniture is stylish and functional. The bathroom's fluffy towels and separate heat controls complete the luxury experience.
It is an easy walk to the beautiful Kennebec River Rail Trail as well as a full selection of restaurants and pubs, and a few minutes' drive to Augusta shopping or I-95 to explore Central Maine.
Communication with the host and check-in with the lockbox were both straightforward. Other hosts take note: this is an example of a top-notch listing."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We were blown away with this cozy airbnb.

Pam, the host, has done an excellent job of renovating the home for an Airbnb with a retro style of furnishings and decorating. The Airbnb was very clean upon our arrival! It was fully furnished and Pam also included nice amenities that were thoughtful.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough good things about Pamela’s place or about Hallowell. The apartment is decorated perfectly, with SO much thought given to what it’s like to actually live there. There’s everything you need and more. For example, we celebrated a birthday, and the place came equipped with a covered cake display plate, of all things. We bought the cake at Slates Bakery, which is one of the many great restaurants in easy walking distance of the apartment. We also ate dinner at Slates restaurant. It was excellent. Hallowell is one of those places that is so charming, you kind of want to keep it a secret. And Pamela’s place is the ideal spot from which to experience it."

The decor had a European flair which was surprising, with very clean lines, lots of space and very comfortable beds. Easy to get to, within easy walking distance to the center yet still private and quiet at night. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return again next year with the opportunity to take in more of the local ambience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here! It was super cute and decorated. Probably the cleanest air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. Comfortable beds and pillows. Very close to town. Would definitely stay again! Our host was VERY kind!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time in Hallowell. This apartment is steps from shops, restaurants and the beautiful river. We loved being able to walk every where. The apartment is stocked is everything you could possibly need, and then several extra special touches, like bottled water and eggs. The mid-century decor is lovely. We would love to stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This condo is super cute and convenient to both downtown Hallowell (walkable) and to downtown Augusta! Had everything we needed and a some nice surprises, we would definitely stay again and will recommend to others!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was absolutely wonderful. It was exactly what we needed for our quick visit--right in the center of it all, walkable to food, friends, entertainment, and the Kennebec River! We especially appreciated the AC during the crazy heat wave--I'm not sure you can get that in many other Hallowell homes.
When we come back, we will definitely be looking for availability in this Airbnb--we loved it so much!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this location due to the close proximity to the apartment my mother lives.
Ther were others to chose from, but none compared to this."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Pam's place is simply amazing. We loved the decor, the efficiency of the space, the banquette, the comfortable beds, the awesome blinds, the clean spacious bathroom, the extra supplies (we loved her teas!), the aesthetic kitchen (blie cabinets were gorgeous!) and sunny yellow dishes, the fabulous efficient appliances, the snacks, the welcome wine, the garden, the view of the Rail Track, the proximity to watching jumping sturgeons in the River at dusk, and pretty much everything. Having stayed at many rentals over the years we decided this one was tops. Would love to come back! Check out the Vaughn Woods hiking, Maine Cabin Masters, the Riverside BBQ in Augusta and walk over the bridges across the Kennebec River while you're here. Awesome stay and thank you!!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning, immaculate, and comfortable. This place is a true gem! A one minute walk to the main street, but far enough away to avoid all the noise and traffic. Modern amenities, easy check in, and communicative host. You won't find a better place to stay! Thank you Pamela for offering such a lovely place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great apartment,pleasantly surprised how much fun we had in town,only steps away. Walk down to the river and watch the eagles hunt! Loved it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're on the fence about booking, this is a sign to go ahead and book! It is an impeccably clean and lovely Airbnb in a charming little town. The parking situation and check-in was extremely convenient. Highly recommend this to anyone traveling to ME - I have this bookmarked for future stays :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pam's place is exactly as pictured. Great space for a 14 month old, a couple 60 year olds, and a few younger folks. We loved how walkable the location is to downtown Hallowell (shout out to Traverse Coffee Co for the great morning coffee and Kennebec views!). Communication with Pam was super easy and check in was a breeze. We stayed here twice on our most recent trip to Maine - before and after visiting Acadia NP! Don't hesitate to book Pam's place. I just hope you don't take the days I'm wanting to book in the future!"

We will definitely keep her home in mind for recommending to friends and family!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is spacious, clean, cute and great location 🙏🏼
Pamela’s place was amazing in every way. Complimentary bottle of wine , coffee and water. Two spacious bedrooms, all with TVs including the living room! I couldn’t have asked for better location, just above the Main Street and perfect walking distance from whatever we needed.
DEFINITELY stay here if you have the chance."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam was a fantastic host and the apartment was immaculate and very comfortable! We had everything we needed and we appreciated the little touches (items in the fridge and bathroom) for us to use. The heated floor in the bathroom was an extra treat! There is plenty of space and natural sunlight. She did a fantastic job and it made for an enjoyable weekend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is a completely perfect location to downtown, a very small walk to the best restaurants and down by the water. Very clean and beautifully decorated! 10/10 recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the apartment! There were 6 of us and there was more than enough room. It was extremely clean and well stocked!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s as clean and bright as the pictures imply. The beds, sofa, and banquette were all comfortable and cozy. The back porch felt private and peaceful. A wonderful home away from home.
An easy one block walk to downtown, and yet the street is quiet and quaint.
I recommend checking out Slates Bakery for morning muffins or coffee cake. You can walk there in your slippers. The new vintage store Rusticators on Water Street is also worth a visit, just leave room in your suitcase for your finds!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and one block from restaurants. Could easily drive and visit my son at Colby during the weekend .
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE THIS PLACE! THIS is the BEST AIRBNB I'VE EVER STAYED IN, and I've been in a bunch.
Fantastically well set up, impeccably clean, with stellar combination of modern and heirloom furnishings, with extremely comfy beds. We will definitely return. Love the town, with wonderful shops & restaurants very nearby, with a beautiful trail on the River for walking, jogging and biking. SO many well thought out nuances (inc dining cubby, adjustable shades in all windows, large shower, lots of mahagany furnishings and top of line washer / dryer.)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderfully convenient as we toured colleges and very well appointed. Lovely space.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is an amazing place! This was our 2nd time staying here and loved it just as much we did the first time.
It’s so cute, comfortable, and feels like home. The kitchen is awesome! Large and well stocked with a nice breakfast bar and the dining table nook was a perfect spot for family meals.
The location couldn’t be more convenient. We walked to the restaurants and shops everyday. We will return again and again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This unit was the perfect place for our staycation! It was quiet but still close enough to restaurants, stores, and sights to see. The shower heated up quickly and the heated floor was perfect after a day being out in the cold. Kitchen had everything we needed and there were a lot of extras, including everything a coffee lover would want (we didn’t get to enjoy since neither of us drank coffee). A snowstorm hit at the end of our trip and the snow was cleared quickly. The driveway is mostly just dirt and since the weather had been weirdly warm and then cold again, the mud tracks froze in a way that might have made it hard for a smaller car to drive over - just something to keep in mind! We would definitely come back if we were ever in the area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing home for the price with stocked amenities.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great space in a great location. A quick walk to downtown Hallowell, where you can find great food, drink, and other things to do along the Kennebec River. The apartment itself was warm and cozy, with a retro-craftsman kind of vibe that worked really well. It worked as both a place to retreat to after a busy day, and as a place to gather family and friends. I enjoyed my stay here, and plan to book this location again in the near future."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back! Pam was very responsive and helpful. The place was immaculate and we enjoyed the fun design and comfort of the place! The variety of coffee and eggs in the fridge was an added treat!

Mary"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute and in a perfect location! We love the mid-century modern furniture and everything was decorated very tastefully. Plenty of coffee and even had mini shampoo and conditioners in the shower. There were plenty of extra blankets, which is great since i am always cold! Can't wait to go back when the weather is a little warmer and we can sit outside. Perfect location to all the little shops and restaurants that Hallowell has to offer."

Every detail in the apartment was well thought out, and we would definitely come back and stay here again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely adorable, spot on perfect. Incredibly clean and everything that one would need. Beds were comfortable and cozy. A three minute walk to Main Street in Hollowell where there were adorable shops, pubs and restaurants. We will be back :-)"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful find! A hidden gem in Hallowell a block off the main strip. My wife and mother-in-law are still talking about how nicely appointed and clean the apartment was. We didn't quite know what to expect as this was just a stop as we made our way across Maine, but it turned out to be a gem that we'll likely visit again. Dinner at Slates was wonderful and right down the street. Cant' say enough great things about the mid-century modern decor. Everything was spot on! The heated bathroom floor was a pleasant surprise first thing in the morning. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful and clean home, great stay"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far one of the best AirBnBs we’ve stayed at. The space is spotless, well curated, and a great size for the price. We really enjoyed our one night stay, I only wish we could have stayed longer!
The host was clear and communicative. She was also very understanding when we had to return for a forgotten item.
Can’t wait to stay again!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pamela’s place was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our quick weekend stay! Right in downtown with a few restaurants and breweries within walking distance. We also loved the heated bathroom floors! Thanks again Pamela!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this place. It’s our second time staying, and I’ll always stay here when we visit my family in Hallowell.
It’s a beautiful renovation to a classic old home. Wonderful kitchen, lots of storage in bedrooms and bathrooms, comfortable seating and dining, enough to sit around with a group of people and not feel cramped. Private off street parking. Super easy code access, and truly the most comfy mattress/pillows/sheets ever. I slept soooo well in this bed. The second room worked great for my two small kids.
I almost don’t want to give a true review because I’m hoping it will always be available and not be booked when we want to visit😝 seriously it’s lovely."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! It was clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable. It had everything we needed and was walking distance to town. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this airbnb to anyone traveling to Hallowell."

I was in town for a conference, so was out much of my day, but being able to come back to a space with just about everything I would need as if I were coming home to my own place, was very nice. Entry was super easy with use of a key pad for both the main entrance to the building and to the unit itself- making it feel safe and secure. It was conveniently located with walkable dining and shops just down the road. It was also only about 10 minutes away from grocery stores, eateries, and shopping plazas. Which was great because I had left my laptop charger at home about 5 hours away."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for being a great host. It was an amazing weekend and we loved the place and the beds were comfortable !
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The space was clean & very comfortable w a nice layout. Beds were especially comfortable. Getting inside was a little tricky at first & we had a few other issues that we tried to contact the host about (which I did by text & not through the app) & didn't realize until much later that my messages probably didn't go thru & by then, we'd already done our best to make due.
The kitchen was adequate w most essentials w the exception of a decent can opener. We had to borrow one from another tenant.
There was also a jerry rigged drawerfront at the sink that kept falling out when doing dishes and there were no kitchen trash bags so we used an extra bag we had w us.
The 2 bedrooms each had missing screens, 1 of which was WIDE OPEN (w no screen on 2nd floor) & only shade down when we arrived.
For us as 4 guests there weren't adequate bathroom supplies. There were just 2 bath towels,
1 face cloth & 1 roll of toilet paper.
*I realize now issues may have been addressed properly thru the app."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the second floor apartment an easy walking distance to restaurants.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best airbnb on the Kennebec! Clean and comfortable in a FANTASTIC location just a block from the river and from Otto’s - the best restaurant on the Kennebec! In winter, there is a clear view of the river and the sunrise! Great wifi and includes a little desk; fantastic for remote work. Across the street from a very cool historic library. Location is very quiet - could not hear people in other apartments. Felt very safe."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and a quick walk down to the restaurants on the river
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place is bright and open, with windows on all sides - even on winter days it was very inviting. It was clean and well laid out, with plenty of space. And it is close to the downtown and the riverfront so there are a lot of options for places to eat."

The hosts were very quick to respond to questions and the arrival instructions were very clear. The apartment is neat and clutter free, very relaxing! The location’s proximity to great restaurants is a big asset: Cushnoc Brewing, State Lunch, Otto’s, Riverfront BBQ, and more!!! (We did drive because of the winter temperatures but they are all in walking distance.)"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose to stay here instead of a hotel while visiting for a nearly college family weekend. Everything was as expected, clean, great location and value! Would stay again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My third time staying at this unit and again it was 100% up to expectations! You really do feel like you are at your home-away-from home here. One thing to note, in prior visits there was a home next door that looked like no one lived there. To our surprise on this visit, the house next door was GONE! No trace, if you can believe that. The reason I mention this is because we noticed that while sitting in the living room, you can peek through the trees and see the sparkle of the the flowing Kennebec River. I can only imagine that if you were to stay here during the months that the leaves have fallen from the trees, you should have a fairly clear view of it.
Just peaceful, relaxing, quiet neighbors- and you can do your laundry there too! Can't wait to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect size and nice space.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Glenn made checking in so easy! He provided pictures that walked us to the door.
(we are directionally impaired :) )
Security was excellent. Codes to the doors worked well. Well lit and private parking lot.
The price was so reasinable.
The apartment was immaculate! Each bedroom had a roomy closet. The beds were very comfortable! Plenty of fresh linens were available.
Pleasantly surprised to find a hair dryer provided.
As a cook, the kitchen was well equipped with full size appliances.
We spent many mornings drinking coffee and visiting around the kitchen table.
The living room area with TV was a comfortable end to the day.
Bonus perk was having a washer and dryer to use.
We will recommend this to everyone we know!!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good location. Clear instructions from host. Overall the apartment was very clean and had what we needed - however, there were barely enough dishes/glasses/silverware. The apartment is efficient but not very inviting. We did appreciate the coffee and toiletries."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest Airbnbs we have stayed at. It's super clean and well laid out. 5 minute walk to downtown. I would highly recommend Glen's place. Augusta is a beautiful town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay and the place was amazing!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The location is amazing. Just up the hill from great restaurants (Otto’s!), a beautiful waterfront park, and the rail trail. Place has everything you need. Very well stocked. So many outlets! Cool spot by the library. Felt very safe. Amazing value. I hope to be able to stay here again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be staying here anytime I go to visit my friend in Maine. I absolutely loved this Airbnb. I was actually very sad to leave. My host was great and I think the value was excellent for what I got.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for easy proximity to the Ironman Maine location. It’s was perfect for walking to everywhere I needed to go, plus only a short walk to the restaurants on Water St."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The place was easy to find and had great parking! The location felt safe a welcoming for our family. The beds were incredibly clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts, clean and safe building with three window ac units. If you travel much in the Northeast, you know that most places have no air conditioning at all, so it was really nice that both bedrooms had their own window unit as well as an additional unit for the living room/dining/kitchen space.
This would be a convenient location for someone who wanted to explore Augusta or who was there to work. The apartment was very clean; the kitchen had the basics covered and a very nice Keurig coffee machine; the building felt safe.
Remember this is an apartment building where other people live - the neighbors may complain if you have heavy footsteps or children who play by running and jumping indoors. We didn't spend much time in the apartment, so we just used our apartment time to teach the kids more about how to practice quiet time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If planning a few days in Augusta, this place is a good option. Easy parking and entry. Communicative host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location with attentive hosts.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and spacious apartment!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location within walking distance of downtown Augusta. The apartment was just as described and very private. The beds are so comfortable we slept like babies! Would definitely recommend if you are looking to get a taste of Maine's capital and away from chain hotels.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Comfy, soft beds and quiet surroundings. Perfect for our trip to visit family."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property had the softest fluffiest towels ever.
I appreciated the use of the shared laundry.
Good location. Great parking. Mostly pretty quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a steal! Just a walk down the hill to downtown. Clean and easy to access. The mattresses are super comfy. Glen and his hosts were highly responsive and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was easy and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean and very close to where we needed to be.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place and host all around!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had everything we needed and the place was very clean. It's 2 blocks from the historic waterfront district, which looks like an up and coming neighborhood for dining, art, shops."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my gosh I can't say enough good things about Glen's place. It was very easy to find, clean and welcoming. We were in Maine for a girl's trip and spent most of our time hiking. It was so nice to be able to come back to a quiet comfortable place with a hot shower and THE most comfortable bed!!! I'm a terrible sleeper but let me tell you the 5 nights I stayed at Glens place was the best sleep I've had in a long time. The kitchen had everything we needed to get our day started. I also appreciated the closet space with hangers and an iron and ironing board so it didn't feel like I was living out of my suitcase. I would recommend Glen's place to anyone traveling to Maine! On a side note we didn't notice any vagrants hanging around and some days we were gone by 6am and some nights we didn't get back until 11pm"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my 2nd time staying at this AirBnB, and my experience was just as good as the first! The location is perfect, walking distance to the shops and eateries on Water Street. The interior of the apartment is cozy and clean. They have the tv set up for Roku Guest and you can link right in if you want to watch tv... but there is SO much to do and see around town and the surrounding areas!
The finest point about this place is that once you step foot in the door, you already feel like you are at home. (or... a home away from home, in our case!)
Thank you to Glen and his team for such a wonderful stay, twice now! (about to book my third!!)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place checked all the boxes. Clean, adequate, walkable, quiet and safe. Overall a great place at a great value and I’d stay here again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed a pleasant stay! These were excellent accommodations.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Would’ve been 5 stars across the board if I wasn’t required to do my dishes by hand, then hand dry and replace them while being being charged a $100 cleaning fee. A large cleaning fee should be associated with no requirement to clean basic things like dishes in my opinion."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host as always.. Very convenient.. Highly recommend : )
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in units hosted by Glen many times and much like the rest, this unit was a great stay. The listing was completely accurate, clean, and met all expectations. It is also great to be within short walking distance to downtown Augusta and my favorite brewery (Cushnoc)! I will certainly be staying again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this AirBnb - Thank you so much to the host Glen!
The unit was immaculate and the beds were SO comfortable! This unit has a small work desk that sits up against a window overlooking State Street, and it was so nice to work and watch the snow falling outside. Location wise, the place is a very short walk to all of the shops on Water Street where you can find good food choices and quaint little stores. The kitchen area was stocked with appliances and utensils which helped us save some money instead of having to eat out every night (the grocery store and Dollar Tree is a short drive away). I am definitely looking forward to staying here again!!!"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,"After a few hiccups with missing essentials things were okay except for tv.Couldn't find any local channels on the ROKU tv and there were no instructions in the unit. You need to use your own apps if you want to see anything other than news, weather and 20 year old game shows and tv programs."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Airy, clean living space located right in the middle of Augusta. The host was extremely responsive to all my questions."

Cannot wait to get back up there - looking forward to seeing you again!
Nancy & Co"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was a wonderful host that greeted us on our arrival. He made us feel like home. The place was in pristine condition and was everything he described. Wonderful cozy place with plenty of room. The couches faced the lake so the scenery was fantastic, as we sipped our glass of wine. Kitchen was very spacious and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet place to spend time. We found a little hole in the wall breakfast place called ""Greg's"" down the road great food, cheap prices and sassy owner, we loved it. Went there everyday but Tuesday because they were closed. We loved the layout of the cabin and would not change a thing. Web are sure everyone that spends time there will love this place like we did. Thank you David
Sincerely, Mike, Ruth, Todd & Mary"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at David’s cozy cabin. We were just passing through so didn’t get to stay long enough. I would love to come back in warmer weather and take one of the kayaks out on the lake! But since it was chilly, we curled up near the fire and enjoyed the peace, quiet and lovely view of the water. Everything in the home is brand new and high quality. Slept wonderfully on the comfortable mattress. Would highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute spot. We didn't get to utilize the outdoor space given the weather, but had a very nice, cozy space indoors. Would love to go back sometime."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was warm and welcoming. Has everything you will need. The corn hole and fire pit are a huge added bonus.

Over all great stay and will absolutely be staying here again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had the pleasure of staying at David's Airbnb and it was truly an exceptional experience. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the beauty and tranquility of the location. The property itself was stunning, offering breathtaking views and a peaceful atmosphere that allowed me to truly unwind and relax. David, the host, exceeded all my expectations with his hospitality. From the very beginning, he went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. He was incredibly attentive and always available to address any questions or concerns I had. The attention to detail in the Airbnb was exceptional. The space was immaculately clean and well-maintained, with all the necessary amenities and more. David's thoughtfulness was evident in every aspect of the accommodation, making it feel like a real home away from home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is perfect for a weekend or short get away. I had work in Augusta, and could walk to the State Capitol buildings as well as to many restaurants and a walk along the river. The owners are extremely nice and helpful. The spacious studio is brightly lit, comfortable and clean. Overall, my partner and I had an excellent time."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really great stay in Hallowell and the apartment was very spacious and clean. Our only complaint was that its VERY bright in the mornings (the bed is below skylights), so we woke up very early each morning. I would just recommend an eye mask if light bothers you. The town is really nice and has some great restaurants while being ver close to Augusta. We have another event in a few months and will definitely try to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am so thankful Jeannie and Steve's place was available. It was lovely, conveniently located, and clean. I highly recommend it."

Best,
Deysi + David Vatman"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent studio close to downtown Hallowell! Especially in nice weather, you have no issues walking right to the Main Street. The binder filled with local recommendations is awesome. They promptly made sure we had no issues with check in or check out and were readily available for anything that could come up. We’ll definitely recommend to our friends and family and would be happy to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hospitality. Beautiful space above garage. Spacious. Lots of windows, bright and cheery. Everything you need. Close to downtown. Walkable.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Dad stayed here during his Thanksgiving break, and he spoke very highly about how kind and welcoming it was. The host was very responsive in me setting my Dad up, and it was like talking to a long-lost friend. My dad said the place was immaculate and cozy. He was really nervous about it not being a hotel, but all of that was put to bed after this experience. I will be booking here again, if available, on my father's next trip to Maine!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeannie & Steve’s place was amazing! All the little details, like a welcome postcard she left for us, local craft beer and cold water in the fridge, coffee amenities, little snacks on the table, shampoos & such if we needed them, (we didn’t but thank you!) the towels were super soft & absorbent, the antique door headboard and the style of the studio was perfect and just so beautifully done! I can’t say enough wonderful things! The village of Hallowell has so many shops and great restaurants! Lucky Garden Chinese, The Quarry Taproom, The Liberal Cup, Hallowell Seafood & Produce Shop are MUST visits!
The local vibe and sense of community is truly unique and you really “feel” it! The only downfall is that we didn’t stay long enough! Lol… that’s on us and we hope to see Jeannie & Steve another time soon!"

The area feels like a charming small town, but there always seems to be something going on. There are great restaurants and bakeries to choose from within walking distance. We loved sitting at the river side park watching the sturgeon jump. We also saw 2 bald eagles. There are many other great towns in the area, just a short drive away. The hosts had everything we needed, and were always quick to respond to any communication. We would highly recommend this place to anyone."

I was visiting family in the area and this provided me with a welcome sanctuary at the end of each day. I really appreciated great seating and lighting for reading. Jeannie and Steve provided so many lovely touches- even a couple of craft beers in the fridge and non-cane sweeteners. And coffee and creamers for early morning coffee. I was there by myself but it will work well for my husband and me, too. I look forward to returning again and again!"

Great people know the area well and very approachable. The studio was perfect. It's very spacious. I was flying solo but certainly room for more. The weather. it's Maine. and not July!;. Still the river walk is lovely and sometimes ya just have to go to a new Home Goods or Water street shopping with a stop in between for a great bite to eat.. If good clean air is. critical. This newly built ""nest"" ( because it looks out to trees not because it's small it's huge with skylights Is perfect. I have allergies. No problems here. The best. Happy travels."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Brown House was an absolutely FANTASTIC place to stay while we visited family. We are so pleased with how easy and relaxing it was to enjoy this beautiful studio apartment. Jeannie was a perfect host and always communicated quickly.

Definitely recommend if you're in the area (also, super close to Augusta and the freeway, too!)."

Spotless and very clean, and very well appointed home, it had everything that is needed for a great stay, felt like a home away from home. And Elizabeth thought of everything and more that a guest might need while being her guest. I appreciate very much being Elizabeth's guest."

Very great host!! Check in and check out were very easy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay at Elizabeth’s and both times have been great. The place is always extremely clean, stocked very well with anything you’d need, quiet, and a great location to hit a bunch of different spots."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is an excellent host. She gave us complete privacy and was available to promptly answer all questions. Her cottage is gorgeous, exactly as pictured. Exceptionally clean, the cleanest rental we've ever stayed at. She welcomed us with a lovely gift, fresh flowers and candy. There were several bottles of cold Poland Spring water waiting for us in the refrigerator. Elizabeth thought of everything! She left many toiletry and other helpful items in case you forgot to bring something. The bed with the provided linens was very comfortable. The bathroom towels and washcloths were plush. The walk-in shower was great! A beautiful washer and dryer are also provided, which is most helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed staying here and we could not ask for a more fabulous vacation rental! Easy access and a short drive to Augusta with its many restaurants, shops and attractions. Thank you, Elizabeth!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was cozy and comfy and had absolutely everything I needed.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough good things about our stay at the cottage! It was extremely clean and so many thoughtful touches. Elizabeth had fresh flowers from her garden for us, sweets and all sorts of other nice little things for us. It was a wonderful stay! She was also kind enough to reach out to check on us to see if we needed anything. Just overall amazing! The location is super easy to find and is in between two really great towns. I would highly suggest to consider your stay at this wonderful place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elizabeth was always prompt when asked a question (even when it was a silly one) and pro-active with instructions for arrival and check out. The cottage was kept clean and smelled fresh, as well as kept cool for our summer arrival. Amenities were available as listed and I really appreciated the motion sensor lights outside for when we came and went at night. The area was quiet and peaceful, perfect for stargazing, and the yard that was cornered off was surrounded with beautiful garden boxes where we watched hummingbirds flit by while enjoying the floral fragrance. I would love to make use of this Airbnb again in the future! Fully recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, very well appointed place with great thought put in to all the details. Would definitely stay again when I come back to Augusta!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place to spend a few days. Very quiet and peaceful. Lovely gardens and comfortable couch.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was probably the cleanest and nicest of anywhere I’ve ever stayed. Elizabeth asked how we were doing every day and if we required anything else. Very peaceful location near centrally located Augusta, which made it easy to drive to Acadia NP and other attractions. She also provided some streaming services for times you just want to relax in front of the tv. Excellent place to stay ! If I visit Maine again, I’ll be sure to book here. Thank you Elizabeth!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Elizabeth's place this year and last year, both times I had a great stay. Very comfortable and spacious place and very clean, with well appointed kitchen and bathroom; very easy and convenient to get to, and I enjoyed the setting and privacy."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and roomy. Elizabeth had nice touches throughout including drinks in the refrigerator and cream for our coffee. The tea lights in the rooms were a nice touch and prettier than night lights.
The handicap accessible bathroom was welcomed since my elderly mother was staying with us.
Although on the same lot as the owners home, we felt this separate cottage offered plenty of privacy and seclusion.
We definitely would stay again next time in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend Elizabeth’s Airbnb. The space is so welcoming , clean and well stocked. Elizabeth is the perfect host, leaving you to your space however, if you need anything she’s available. I will definitely be in touch with Elizabeth when retuning to Maine!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth's hideaway cottage is everything and more. First, I need to say her place is the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Elizabeth's communication is great she gets right back to you. As far as amenities she has ever you will need and more. The beds are super comfortable. The towels for bathing are extremely soft. Elizabeth really makes you feel welcome for the moment you walk into her cottage. Also, her place is close to everything. (go to Hussey's general store in Windsor) 😊 My husband and I go to Maine often to visit our family. We will definitely request to stay at Elizabeth's cottage again. ❤️💯"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy country get-away.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This hideaway is amazing. This was my second stay because I enjoyed the space so much. Clean, plenty of room, stalked with all you could need."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elizabeth is a great host. The place is clean neat and has everything you could possibly need. nice area, quiet just great overall. we are very happy with our stay. thank you very much."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth’s Cozy Hideaway is a perfect location! We were in town for a wedding and the cottage fit our needs wonderfully. The little touches throughout the home make it one of the best equipped Airbnbs we’ve stayed at. Elizabeth was proactive to give us weather updates and advice on how to prepare for the stay. We definitely plan to return!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect with the stay. The kitchen was well-stocked. The place was clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed the stay and would love to return. The cottage is well stocked, clean, comfortable, and very peaceful. Elizabeth has done a fantastic job and paid attention to the details which made our stay lovely. There was enough kitchenware for us to cook a big batch of soup. The master bedroom is spacious and affords a super comfortable and solid bed. Exactly what we wanted. Thanks again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hideaway was very welcoming and made our stay very relaxing and enjoyable! The cleanliness was impeccable and the snacks/drinks was a nice touch! Thanks Elizabeth for everything!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host goes above and beyond. There were all kinds of little things the host left in case you forgot like toiletries. The host even left things like maple syrup and chocolate! The 2bd/1ba cottage was perfect in every way! We didn't pack a lot of clothes because we knew we could just wash there. The kitchen was stocked as well! We will definitely book again with this host!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will not find a home better equipped or a more friendly hostess. This was a beautiful little house with literally everything you will ever need! I am so impressed with how Elizabeth thought of every detail. We can’t wait to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt, Elizabeth is the best AirBnB hostess we have encountered in our years of vacation rentals. The amenities she provided for us in terms of food, drink, and bathroom supplies far exceeded anything we expected. There were fresh flowers on the counter, chocolates, eggs in the fridge and shampoo in the bathroom. She also allowed access to her veg/herb garden and her cherry tomatoes were delish! The house was comfortable, immaculate from top to bottom and Elizabeth's communication was beyond efficient. I never waited more than a few minutes for a response -- and she accommodated our wonky travel plans with grace and kindness.
We were a short drive to Augusta and Hallowell, and I highly recommend this rental.!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location is great, nice and quite and homey. Felt like we had our own backyard in the country. Outside lawn furniture overlooking the small garden and a gas grill which we used a couple of times. Entering the cottage was impressive, large and very functional. Large combination living room, kitchen with one large bedroom and a smaller second one. Both had comfortable queen size beds. Large bathroom with washer dryer and a large walk in shower. The extra amenities were greatly appreciated. Elizabeth went beyond what was expected. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were thoroughly satisfied. We didn’t expect to feel so at home and have as much privacy."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay!!!! Elizabeth is incredible! So very kind, helpful, and the home is beautiful! Perfect place to stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful little house. The host was very responsive and very accommodating. The house was easily wheelchair and walker accessible from the car, into and throughout the house, and the bathroom. There was lots of room to move about. The bathroom and shower were above and beyond! Very accessible as well. Beautiful property. Nice gardens right outside the window. Excellent touches throughout the house. Starting with nice chocolates and vase of flowers. Truly great place to stay and awesome hosts! WiFi was excellent. Washer and dryer in the house was great. We will be back! Thanks."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tidy and very functional space. 10 minutes from the heart and activities of Augusta. Functional floorplan plus the beautiful yard/garden allowed our family of 4 to spread out. The thick woods around the yard made the space feel very private. Multiple smart TVs, disc golf putting green and extremely well stocked kitchen make this place a great stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,House was exceptionally clean and hostess was very accommodating. It is located far enough away from town to feel secluded but it only a 8 minute drive from downtown.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth's cottage was the perfect place for my getaway to Maine. It was clean, cute, comfortable, and spacious. I'll definitely be back to this Airbnb the next time I am in Maine!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really comfortable and spacious, and private, cottage is situated in a very nice setting. Really nice place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stellar property! It is clear that Elizabeth put a lot of thought into designing the space to be bright, welcoming, comfortable, and well appointed. She was the quintessential host - available to be helpful, but respectful of privacy. Next time we're in the area, we'll stay here again. It's a little slice of heaven in the countryside near Augusta."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect !! We had such a great time there ! Thank you very much Elizabeth :)
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, private, easy access to Augusta downtown, beautiful setting!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little hideaway. Clean and cozy. Had everything I needed for my week-long stay. Check in was super easy and I had a great stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Exactly like the pictures and very clean. Elizabeth was a great host. She left chocolates as a treat when we first got in and communicated with us perfectly. We had a brief moment where the pipes froze and the water stopped working (it was very cold outside that night) but it only lasted for a few hours (we just went out for dinner and it was fixed by the time we came back) and Elizabeth made sure to supply us with plenty of drinking water if needed. Definitely would recommend. The price was great, very clean, and spacious."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, easy check-in and great location. Elizabeth was a great host. Hopefully this property will be available for a future trip to Maine!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth is a wonderful host
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hideaway was one of the best vacation rentals we have stayed in. Clean, spacious, well-stocked. Nice people. Elizabeth thought of everything to make us feel welcomed and relaxed. Great location, surrounded by trees but still close to lots of shopping & restaurants. The Western View 35-par golf course & pub is just 2.5 miles aways. Centally located to explore many different parts of Maine. Thank you, Elizabeth, for the nice hospitality."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hideaway was absolutely perfect for our needs. This cottage is immaculately clean and it is stocked with anything you could imagine you will need. It is quiet and one of the very best places we have rented.
Communication with Elizabeth was also easy and almost instant.
Thank you for allowing us to ""borrow"" your hideaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful cottage! I was pleasantly surprised to find that the cottage was not only immaculately clean but super stocked. Lots of cleaning supplies, antibacterial gels, paper goods and the loveliest chocolate welcome gift. The cottage was much more spacious then the photos suggest and our family was able to sprawl out comfortably. The beds were comfortable and open concept kitchen living area was perfect for just hanging out. We used herbs from the wonderful garden for cooking and appreciated the abundance of modern and new appliances. Elizabeth responded immediately to any questions and was super knowledgeable and sweet. We used the information book in the cottage for restaurant suggestions and we were glad we did. A great stay in the beautiful cottage that we will definitely book again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hideaway was an amazing choice for our first Air bnb. It's just off the beaten path enough to not feel the grip of the city, but still near enough to enjoy all Augusta has to offer. The place was very clean and spacious on the inside. Everything you could think of was covered in her instructions. Elizabeth was very quick to respond to any messages we sent her and even checked up on us. We were nervous at first staying anywhere other than a hotel but know this is for sure the route we plan on taking in the future."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be returning
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely cottage! Excellent amenities and Elizabeth's attention to detail is impressive. From the offer of fresh produce from her kitchen garden to the beautiful seasonal bouquet on the kitchen counter, chocolate treats, and a well-stocked kitchen, this place is a gem!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is not only such an easy host to work with, but her space is absolutely lovely. I told her I didn't want to send a review for fear that her cottage would become too popular! The space is incredibly well-cared for, modern, and spacious. It was the perfect place for two friends looking for a writer's/work retreat, and knowing how crazy WFH has been this pandemic, her place was absolutely amazing. I'd love to come back for a Maine vacation and getaway, without any work, but this space is one where you can either be productive or relaxed. The home is fully stocked for everyday living, which is a real treat for anyone looking to cook in a home that is free of their own at-home messes (a godsend during quarantine living), and there are so many little touches throughout that really truly make it feel like you're in your own home, but better. Note: there's a little garden that Elizabeth mentioned we could have fresh tomatoes from! We didn't get to try any in our short stay but it's little thoughtful things like this that make this a no-brainer to rent."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Elizabeth’s apartment very much!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elizabeth’s place will provide you a perfect place for a Maine vacation. The cottage is beautifully decorated and very clean. Her gift made us so welcomed and we felt comfortable right away. The flower /veggie garden is a happy surprise for us! My daughter was very excited to see tomatoes and zucchini growing on plants!
Elizabeth is very responsive and always answered texts in a timely manner. You can tell from her texts that she deeply cares about her guests and makes sure stay in the cottage is comfortable.
We are looking forward to spending another summer in her cottage!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host that paid attention to the small details. Communication was good, she gave clear details for check-in/out, and even left small flowers out for us! House was quaint but was fully stocked and had everything that we needed. House was also immaculately kept and cleaned - would definitely visit again next time we come back to tour Maine!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a home away from home! Clean, comfortable & accommodating!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
And this place is as clean as a pin.
The U shaped driveway is great. You don’t even have to back up your vehicles."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Augusta - Winthrop area for a surprise party. This was our first trip to Maine. The AB&B was fantastic. The house was very clean, well stocked kitchen, fantastic location, comfortable and affordable. If we are ever back this way, we will stay here! I highly recommend this home."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Enjoy the adventure
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place to stay - well outfitted and cozy. It was perfect as a home base for us during a trip to visit family nearby. We will absolutely stay here again. Elizabeth was communicative and welcoming.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was so beautiful and perfect. Thank you so much for being so accommodating when we had trouble shooting the wifi. I would love to come back and stay at your gorgeous cabin again.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Stay here! You WON’T regret it!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space in Augusta is lovingly designed, thoughtfully appointed, and meticulously maintained. It was peaceful and cozy; a perfect getaway. We would absolutely stay again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay, Elizabeth went out of her way to provide little things in the place that was very thoughtful, such as a book of things to do and places to eat around Augusta! Will definitely come back here!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean , quick replies and beautiful place."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This modern hideaway is exactly that. The house and everything in it is practically brand new; the space is immaculate. The house is adjacent to the owner's house in a more rural part of the town, so it's quiet and remote. The owner is right there if you need anything, but not intrusive at all. The house was decorated festively for our arrival in December, which was so kind. The owner was really understanding when I needed to make some last minute changes. I would stay here again."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth’s spot was super clean and accessible! It was In a great location, a great value, and Elizabeth is easy to get in touch with!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I loved staying here! It was nice and relaxing in the home and not too far from town to find things to do, would reccomend!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy space! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a home away from home in the Augusta area!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is beautiful and clean so comfortable will definitely be going again
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elizabeth's place was wonderful. It was super clean, spacious, and stylish. In fact, we took note of some of the decor as we really admired it. The location was peaceful and quiet but not too far from stores, businesses, etc. We really enjoyed our stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here!! If you need a central spot for traveling through the state, a beautiful space to stay and hang out on the evenings you’re there, this is absolutely it. This Airbnb was the best any of us have stayed in before, we’re so thankful for what this stay added to our trip. Stay here!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth’s hideaway was prefect! It was clean, homey, and spacious. She provided yummy treats that we really appreciated. Would highly recommend."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was a great and cute stay that was perfect for a getaway weekend! It was impressively clean and was in a great location. We enjoyed our stay and will be back next year!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, pristine actually. Comfortable sleeping accommodations and great bathroom. Easy access for handicapped or older folks. It's everything you'll need and a great central location. No water view but who cares...we slept and ran around all day. Still a serene inviroment."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great! Added touch of masks and chocolate made our day after a long drive! Thank you!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hidden gem near Augusta. Beautiful spot and the host Elizabeth is awesome! This cottage is spacious and super clean. Has everything you would need. Price per night was very fair. We will be back!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth's place was perfect for our needs. My colleague and I were looking for a retreat to work remotely to Boston, and this spot was perfect. It had everything we needed in terms of quiet, good internet, cooking hardware, the space to take calls in different rooms, and during the evenings we found ourselves an easy drive from Augusta and Hallowell for runs along the river and microbrewery visits. I recommend this spot both for during-week remote work and weekend retreats."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Glen and Lucy were fantastic very helpful with directions and instruction on how to get there, get in! Was a perfect fit for our stay in Maine! Spent more time out and about in maine but very comfortable to come back and rest your head. Was quiet and peaceful even with a bar across the street.was a great place, great vacation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The loft was better than the pictures. I was here on a work assignment and I felt like I was on vacation. It was less expensive than every hotel in Augusta in April. When I come back to work again, I will definitely be reaching out."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the middle of Augusta. Well taken care of loved the coffee station
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was crystal clear, check in was flexible, within walking distance of a few restaurants and close enough to others. Parking was very easy and plentiful. Everything seemed intentionally well equipped.
The bedroom has no windows and only the one door out. That made me wife uneasy. If you want a pitch black room, it’s GREAT. We slept with the door open and the light that shines in through the big kitchen/living room windows to the bedroom was a pleasant alarm clock.
We’d stay again. No doubt about it."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful. The view from the deck was amazing. I would definitely book again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a pleasure to stay at this location and Christine was great to work with. No issues during our stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine, I cannot thank you enough for everything! To say this place was so incredibly gorgeous is an understatement, it's better than the photos. Super clean, beautiful, private, peaceful, as soon as my friend and I checked in we felt right at home.
I was going through a tough time before and during this stay. My friend and I were looking for a quiet getaway just to escape the chaos for a few days and Christine went above and beyond with the level of compassion and care she had shown all throughout. I've never met a sweeter host. You made this trip exactly what was needed and I truly thank you for that.
Her communication is super transparent, consistent and so kind. I loved it here, we both did! Thank you!! from the both of us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed 5 nights and the cottage was perfect for the two of us and our two small dogs. There is plenty to do locally, but nothing can beat sitting out at night looking at a beautiful starry sky and having a campfire, and listening to the loons. Christine made sure the lights were on for us, because we were delayed getting there and she had dog bowls out which made our thirsty dogs happy. The kitchen has plenty of things to use for cooking, which I was thankful for. It’s a beautiful cottage with an amazing bead board ceiling. There are a lot of outdoor steps, but the upstairs had everything we needed on one level. There is a door to the upper level; however, if you parked there you would be blocking a driveway, so we did not use that. We used the down stairs space to store our extra things we brought for our trip. If we had more people with us, it would have given them privacy. Hope we can return."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This one really earns its 5 stars. I am considering planning another trip to Augusta just to get to stay in this place longer. First of all, Christine went out of her way to be extremely helpful and friendly and make sure we have everything we need. Second, it is so cozy in there - it is even better than the photos make it look. It honestly does feel like a place a person could live instead of the ""bare minimum"" approach you will sometimes find in other places. The beds were so comfortable and there are many thoughtful touches. The upstairs and downstairs are not connected but they each have their own bathroom and fridge. The view of the pond is incredible. Really a delight to stay here."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Even though the weather was a bit rainy, we can’t wait to come back and take advantage of the beauty. The view was breathtaking, especially at sunset - keep an eye out for those golden treeline. Christine thought of everything. Thank you again!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Christine communicated well, and the place was cute, cozy, and clean. She even left a handwritten Christmas card & gift for us!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely little place! Clean, cozy, and comfortable. Thoughtfully renovated. Quiet and private. Beautiful sunrise over the lake! Space downstairs isn’t connected (you have to go outside to access it), but it’s a beautiful and peaceful space. We definitely recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little cozy getaway!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,wonderful location! the view is outstanding.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely adored this place! The owners are super sweet! Exactly like the pictures! Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place and spot. Super comfortable and cozy. Extremely clean
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,One of the most relaxing weeks I’ve had in a long time. Great space and well kept.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy clean cabin with a beautiful view of the lake. Sunrise over the lake was especially gorgeous. Worked from the cabin one day and the WiFi was reliable. Had a huge yard which was good for walking dogs around. Only downside is that cabin is near a main road so you do hear some occasional road noise. But overall a very nice place. Would stay there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I have been renting for 21 years for our annual girls wknd away and we’ve never entered a rental that welcomed us so warmly. Clean, classical music, bottle of wine fitting for the fall season, a thank you card and it smelled amazing! The owners did a beautiful job on the cottage, open concept, designed with fun but modern feel. Appliances & bathroom exceptionally clean and a gorgeous view of Kennebec River with a big backyard. You wouldn’t even know there were neighbors.
Christine & Calvin’s communication was very attentive when we had questions. We both would recommend this cottage to adventure this beautiful location in Maine along the river with lots to explore. Thank you very much for your hospitality and sharing your home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything was perfect! The apartment was clean, spacious, and cozy and in a great location. Jordan was an excellent host and was always quick to offer assistance when needed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Jordans place for 3 weeks and It felt like home. The place was very clean, quiet and beautiful. When I arrived Jordan had a welcome gift for me with goodie's, restaurant recommendations and places to visit. I enjoyed cooking, turning on the fireplace and watching netflix after a long day of work. Also, a great thing is that the parking has a rooftop so I didn't need to worry about cleaning my car when it snowed. Will definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful hosts, extremely clean, great area with lots of food/store choices and a great little park for kids right across the street. One of my favorite Airbnbs to date!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed in multiple AirBnB’s in Augusta but keep coming back to this location. The covered parking in the winter is the best!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Exactly the same as picture.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Perfectly acceptable for a short stay
2023-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great for the price
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I worked remotely at this location for five weeks. After two years of living/working in Airbnbs, I would say this one is top 3. Well thought out layout, no clutter & plenty of space, parking & washer/dryer included, lots of well placed outlets, responsive hosts, fireplace was a bonus! Only negative: it's located on a busy street - it can be noisy with car traffic & the park across the street. I love to keep windows open & blinds up, but it wasn't an option due to noise & privacy reasons. You adjust to the hum of noise quickly though. Internet was quick & reliable for zoom calls & regularly downloading large files. Gym, food, groceries all within 5-10 min. Ample space for single or a couple - wouldn't recommend for three (all one big open space, no privacy/sound barriers). Bed was comfortable, closet large. Bathroom & shower off the bedroom is on the small side. Half bath on the ground floor. Someone comes by daily to blow leaves & water plants & can assist with any needs!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved staying in this cute loft. It had everything we needed for our month in Augusta. Walkable to coffee and a couple of restaurants. Great space. Extra comfy bed. AC was a plus. Great hosts and great communication. We loved it so much we booked them for next summer!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The unit itself was perfect for our needs and was clean, comfortable, and a modern space as described. We did however run into one snag with the front door lock (do not turn the inside knob that looks sort of like a deadbolt) which left us locked out for the majority of one day due to slow response time. If that issue had not occurred this unit would have been a perfect 5 stars."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Jordan's airbnb for several months while working in Augusta. The space is exactly as pictured. Super clean and updated with all the necessary essentials. Highly recommend! I had a few instances where communication directly with Jordan was delayed, but her Co-Hosts were very responsive and kind.
At no fault of the hosts, this is just an FYI. The unit is located on a busy street and road noise can be noticeable at times, but during sleeping hours it was quiet for the most part. The unit is also very bright even with shades drawn. For someone who personally prefers pitch black while sleeping, I would recommend an eye mask.
Other than that, the stay was exactly what I needed. Close to the hospital I worked at with groceries and some great restaurants all nearby."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always a joy staying at Glen's! Always clear instructions and easily reachable with questions. Unit is accessible to local amenities and is a in a nice area. We will be staying again for sure.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was as I imagined, really cozy place to be 🫶🏽"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After the power went out during this last hurricane, we needed a place to stay that night and then needed to extend at the last minute. Very accommodating. The apartment is very comfy, with everything you’d need from k cups to a washer and dryer."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here following a major storm, in which we lost power at our own home for several days. All hotels in the area were sold out, however I found this apartment and it was available. The host was very responsive when I checked to see if the apartment had power following the storm. Luckily it did, so we were able to stay here for a few days, with heat, hot water, and a kitchen to cook in, while waiting for power to return at our house. Thank you for having us!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is PRISTINE!! It looks brand new because of how clean it is. The kitchen is stocked with many extras that you typically do not have; a large variety of spices, salt & pepper, a variety of k pods for coffee, tea and hot cocoa plus sugar & creamer. There is even a hair dryer in the bathroom! The apartment is easy to find and in a peaceful area. I received instructions plus pictures of the apartment bldg, parking, and the entrance which made it so easy to find. Even my husband was blown away at how nice the place is!! For the cost of one night at a hotel we were able to enjoy this lovely place for TWO nights!! We will definitely be back the next time we are in Maine. HIGHLY RECOMMEND - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, homely place. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental had everything I needed. It's a great cozy space. Everything seems fairly new and in working order. The bed and couch are comfortable. Having the washer/dryer access was very useful. The property is conveniently located to many stores and places I needed. The kitchen was well equipped. I'd highly recommend staying here and would love to stay again. Thank you! The only thing I would recommend is a step stool to assist in opening the kitchen window and a dimmer switch on the lights because they are bright which is also helpful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. The apartment was modern, convenient, clean and quiet. It was conveniently located. The hosts were great with the communication. Thank you for a great stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, newly renovated apartment. Great central location for our road trip all over the state. Everything was clean and nice. Very responsive to questions."

The quiet neighborhood at night and the comfortable bed made or restful sleep.

Overall, it is a good price for a place to stay. I would stay again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay and can't wait to visit again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I loved this apartment. It was pristine, private and had easy parking. We wanted to see more of Maine so didn’t spent time cooking or staying at the apartment during the day much, but the kitchen looked lovely and we definitely made use of the Keurig, the assortment of teas and coffees provided and the large mugs ☺️☕️.
Highly recommend and will definitely consider staying here again if we choose Augusta as our hub next time we visit Maine. Thank you 🙏"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay. Very nice location. We felt very comfortable, enjoyed staying in, and were local to everything nearby.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,comfortable space
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very good and cozy. Friendly host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrea’s place was very nice and comfortable and the location was fantastic. We have never seen an airbnb with so many extras! There were extra conveniences tucked into every corner and shelf. A truly amazing apartment. We hope to stay there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very pleasant. The loft was everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the added amenities were a nice touch. Very close walking distance to the downtown waterfront area. Would happily stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at Andrea’s! The space is charming, and her attention to detail in the decor was an added touch! We couldn’t have been more comfortable! She even had a salt lamp foot warmer warmed and ready for us when we got upstairs! Highly recommend this accommodation!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrea's space had everything we needed, and we could tell she wanted people to feel comfortable. She had clearly put much thought into what items might help guests relax. It was a nice location; we just walked to dinner and easily explored the main street."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrea”s historic home(and Hallowell itself) was just delightful and very interesting Nothing was spared to make the stay comfortable (like her hot salt block for my feet.) as we’d been moving.
what a gem along the Kennebec River."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very relaxing and homey space with lots of extras. Location was very close to town. We only stayed one night, so we did not get a chance to use the hot tub. Very welcoming hosts!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and organized. The only disappointment was the location of the hot tub. We thought it was in the back yard but it was around the corner on another street. We didn't use it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying here, and it was just as perfect as the first time! It's cozy, clean & the host is amazing! I will definitely be back again! 🤗"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrea's rental really felt like home and her attention to details and thoughtful features were remarkable. I liked the pleasant smell, the Himalayan salt foot warmer and even the copy of the US Constitution and History book of the neighborhood on the dresser."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,nice location near the Main Street of Hallowell. Easy walking to town. Convenient location for visiting the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Very clean and as described. Would stay here again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my daughter and I had an amazing stay here. The loft was cozy and inviting. made you feel at home. It was exactly as described. The hosts were really nice.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,nice clean beautiful location
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super friendly host and comfortable living space. I loved it!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice location with scenic surroundings. It was cozy and has everything you need in a room. Walkable to stores and restaurants as well. Great place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely studio in the wonderful town of Hallowell. Lots of nice restaurants right at the bottom of the street. The space was beautifully decorated and had all of the amenities we needed for a one night stay. Andrea was very helpful and even stopped by to say hello to us. Very reasonably priced too.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrea’s place was extremely clean. The house is close to restaurants and the beautiful river. She was very helpful and kind. We hiked the trail that she recommended. It was perfect and I highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect spot. We will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,2,Stayed over a week,"I rented 5 rooms in Andrea’ s boarding house, and two of her apt’s for two weeks for members of my theater troup. The places were clean, however, I cannot recommend ANY of Andrea’s properties for the following reason: Andrea. She is someone who should NOT be an Airbnb host. Too many rules (signs EVERYWHERE), too much “presence” (including being in/around the properties constantly, enforcing rules), and monitoring guests every move with multiple camera’s (inside and out). All of this made the guests VERY uncomfortable. But the worst part was when two guests checked into her 2-bedroom apartment to discover that construction would be going on (IN THE APARTMENT!) for the next 4-6 days! Yes, Andrea had scheduled ALL the windows to be replaced during a time period that she had guests staying in the apartment. UNACCEPTABLE! There is MUCH more and I could go on, but out of space. Bottom Line: Andrea is a nightmare host with severe control issues and a blatant disregard for her guest’s."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was above and beyond my expectation.
Very cosy"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We weren’t here for long but it was a perfect stop in between Boston and Acadia. Our expectations were surpassed. It looks nicer than the photos!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,You can tell a great deal of thought and effort was put into making guests comfortable. Loved the small details and kindness of the host. Highly recommend!!! :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This space was exactly what we needed for this night on our trip! Thank you so much.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’re happy with our one-night stay at Andrea’s place. Everything went smoothly. Andrea was very quick to respond. She gave clear and detailed instructions before our arrival. When we arrived, she greeted us nicely in person and introduced all the amenities. There was more than everything we needed, plus many thoughtful and stylish touches. The rooms and bathroom were very clean, and the two twin beds were very comfortable for the tired travelers. It was also quiet at night. We would love to come back to Andrea’s place if we visit the area again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in the loft apartment in Hallowell for one night. The place itself was easy to find and we walked a couple blocks to eat dinner at a nearby restaurant downtown. Check-in was flexible and the host was actually there when we checked in. Andrea (the host) was very helpful. We made use of the hot tub and also watched some TV on the Roku. The place felt home-like, with books to read, a selection of teas, and house plants in the room as well."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I cannot say enough good things about the beautiful Widow Avery House. A friend and I stayed there for just over 3 weeks. It was homey and comfortable with everything we needed, exactly as described, including nearby laundry facilities.
Andrea is so responsive and helpful with questions, friendly and very accommodating of our schedule that changed slightly a couple of times.
The restaurants are amazing, the hiking trails, including along the beautiful Kennebec River and the Kennebec River Rail Trail, no less so!
We can’t wait to visit again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and accommodating. Andrea is a lovely host and felt right at home. Thank you for a lovely stay
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very cute room. Refreshingly affordable for Hallowell."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were comfortable during our one night stay at Andreas. We hope to make it to the hot tub/gym next time! Thank you again for your hospitality
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely charming suite in a beautiful, historic New England town. Andrea has created a beautiful apartment with many special touches of comfort and whimsy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was spotless. The beds were very comfortable. The hosts are very friendly and welcoming. We left feeling well-rested and refreshed!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location of this property cannot be better - right off the main street yet quiet enough and 2 blocks to the river or 10 minutes walk to the nearby trail to see the falls. We had a great time riding the bikes provided and got to enjoy the rail trail with dedicated lanes for bikes. The unit is full of old world charm and we loved chatting with Andrea and her husband.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot. Cozy and has all the amenities you could ask for! Lots of personal touches. Communication was excellent and check-in effortless
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,..
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent, comfortable and lots of room with the 2 rooms. It was in a great location."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea was very communicative, open and friendly throughout my stay. The room was also very comfy, clean and amazing!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful historic home experience away from traffic and noise. The town Hallowell sets along the river and offers some good restaurants and nightlife.
If wanting more, Augusta is a short distance away. Would definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but it was a great place! Really a great value!! Very clean, nice little touches, very comfortable beds. I also appreciated the little living room adjacent to the bedroom. It has a small fridge (with a freezer!), distilled water ready, coffee machine (keurig cups provided along with milk, everything!!) Andrea was very nice and personable! The only thing I would recommend is that for the door to access the loft can be locked by the renters. There is a barn door to access the loft and there is a lock on the bedroom door but the code is written on the lock so anyone can easily access. However, there was no one else and Andrea and her husband seem very trustworthy, I felt safe. But I like to feel I have control on the access to my things when I rent. I felt very safe and there are locks (hooks) so you can lock when you are inside. It is so close to walking to the main street, a choice of great restaurant. Charming place! I highly recommend and would go again!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great area! short walk from the river and good restaurants nearby. Clean, organized and lovely home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy room, lovely view of Hallowell's rooftops."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea was an excellent host. This air bnb was perfect for this travel nurse to rest her head after a long night shift. Everything was perfect and as described. Would definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Five stars isn’t enough!! The place is clean, charming and convenient. Andrea is an outstanding host! I wished I had spent more time as I basically just slept and showered there. It would be great for a longer stay as there’s ample room for 2 persons to spread out, work at the desk, prepare a basic meal (she’s got lots of small appliances), etc. Did I mention charm? It’s oozing with it! There was also a cool collection of books! Didn’t have an opportunity to use the hot tub, fire pit or computer, but great to know their there for next time."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrea is an amazing person. My friend and I felt so welcomed when she gave us a personal tour of the house and wanted to know more about us.
What was really touching was the greeting note with my name and my friend’s on it. Also, nice touch with the chocolate truffles!
Overall, the room was super comfy and the space was so relaxing. Definitely an experience I hope to have again while there. Also, shout out to Andrea’s family - they are awesome as well!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this location was perfect. We would stay there again.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a very pleasant stay at Andrea’s Airbnb. Be aware that there’s a staircase leading up to the rooms but it’s well lit up and safe. Hallowell is a lovely town and it’s a lovely neighborhood.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice private en-suite guest room with separate stairs, separate tv room, super nice shower, and new firm mattresses. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrea has a pretty awesome Airbnb. First, she told me that she was happy that i made it. It was upstairs, and the room was very clean and roomy. I absolutely loved how comfortable the beds were, and i really enjoyed the shower. It was very clean and cool inside. I also love this little town. I had the best mussels I've ever had. Really cool host and location."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She is a very good host, have a cosy, quiet and comfortable place near downtown and Augusta."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrea is a great host. Beautiful room at the historic house! I want to come back here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute place, close to downtown Hallowell Maine, perfect for what I needed. Very clean and good coffee for the morning :) Communication was great."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrea’s place was absolutely amazing!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,so beautiful and cosy space ever.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay at Andrea's properties in Hallowell. She very helpful with any minor questions we have. The level of cleanliness is outstanding. Andrea is very knowledgeable about the history and ecology of this place, and she provides fascinating old pictures and writings about the history of the houses and their past residents. Lots of little things make the stay comfortable, including a large selection of teas and coffees, and relaxation and sleep aids, and a variety of extras from L. L. Bean."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderfully comfortable place to stay and walking distance to all things Hallowell. The room has little extras I never expected, like an electric tea kettle and pillow spray. My next trip to Maine will definitely have me here again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and cozy place that would recommend to anyone visiting Hallowell or Augusta. Andrea makes sure you have everything you might need. Your place will have little details that make a difference. It was great to jump into the hot tub after a long day :)
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a convenient, clean, comfortable and charming place to stay in Hallowell. Within walking distance to the main hub of this quaint town along the Kennebunk River. The owners are friendly and very accommodating. It has good Wifi, a space for parking in front, a nice private bathroom with a shower stall, a small but comfy room with a sofa, big screen TV, small kitchette with a table, 2 chairs, microwave, toaster oven, Keurig with pods, large mini fridge with a freezer, and all the essentials you'll need. The bedroom is spacious with 2 comfortable twin beds, plenty of storage, and good temperature control no matter if you want fresh air, A/C or heat. You'll love staying here no matter what time of the year it is."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Super accommodations and hospitality. Great location with fun shops and Slate just around the corner.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Historic homes in the Maine town of Hallowell, adjacent to Augusta, which is the capital. Andrea is amazing! She has thought of everything to make the stay in one of her homes a cozy and relaxed experience. Lovely touches in every nook and cranny, as well as extras such as well-appointed fitness room, sauna, hot tub, and the most comfy bedding ever! The price is fantastic. The focus on ""being green"" is excellent! Shared common spaces, but attention to noise reduction is excellent."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a wonderful place to stay that is clean, unique and convenient to many places in Hallowell! The beds are very comfortable in a good size bedroom. All the amenities are there so you can leave the hairdryer, soap, shampoo, small mirror, and more home. The towels are luxuriant and large. The hosts are friendly and very accommodating to any special needs you might have. This is our 2nd time staying here and we will be using it again on our next visit to our daughter and her family. Thanks again Andrea for your great hospitality!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"As always, Andrea’s place was spotless, convenient, with the little special touches that go a long way."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"OK: Best. AirBnB. Experience. Ever. I'm serious. Nicest bedroom/bathroom/sitting area I've ever seen at AirBnB. This place is gorgeous, parking provided, the entry system was super easy (no need for coordinating check in time). The town has a lovely waterfront/river park with bike trail and the ""colorful adirondack chairs."" There's a great little burrito/quesadilla place downtown near the bridge. FYI this town is directly south of Augusta, the capital of ME. We biked up there and saw the statehouse and we went across the river to see some historic landmarks. A GREAT waystation if you're headed north to Acadia or downeast/Bar Harbor -- a perfect place to land partway through Maine. Can't recommend highly enough!! 10 stars :-)))"

This home is within a block of the main street of Hallowell..where there are wonderful restaurants, bars, and live music. Enjoyed walking around town and reading all the historical plagues on the various homes, businesses, and places of worship.

There were so many little amenities that made our stay perfect. Beds were super comfortable, along with a nice little private living area and bathoom. Keurig coffee maker, fluffy towels. soft bedding, big screen tv, desk w/computer, small fridge, toaster oven, microwave, bottle opener, corkscrew ... everything we needed all within easy reach. Plus, the entire space was very clean.
Andrea was very accommodating and pleasant (even when we forgot our key one night and had to wake her up to let us in).
The Widow Avery House is definitely a gem in the little town of Hallowell. Excellent value.
We loved it!"
