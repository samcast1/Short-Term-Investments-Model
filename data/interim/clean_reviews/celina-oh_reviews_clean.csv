2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What fun and cute place! We had such a great time with family here. It was very convenient to all of the places we needed to go and also the amenities the house had was great! Kristin was very responsive and the area was so cute. We will definitely be staying here again when we come into town for another family event!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a 10-star property to make other Airbnb hosts look like amateurs! Very well appointed and accommodating with clear attention to providing guests a home away from home. The property is so complete it gives the impression the hosts actually live there and gave us the keys while they were out.
Comfortable and quiet. Board games and puzzles. Hot tub and fire pit. Complete kitchen with washer and dryer. Clean and organized. Walking paths and lake. All exceeding expectations.
The best compliment is that we were there four days and our teenagers wanted to stay longer."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a wonderful time relaxing and playing board games. the lake was easily accessible. nicely decorated clean home and hot tub with lots of amenities. I would visit again in the summer, to utilize the nature trails and the lake."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in several Airbnb’s and have to say this has been my favorite stay. My husband and I drove through the area once while I was working and had always talked about returning for a long weekend visit.
I booked the Cottonwood Cottage and the host reached out promptly. I was given instructions on how to reach location ( I did get a little mixed up at first, but found my way), and there was a binder in the home with details about the home as well as the surrounding city.
Not only was the home immaculately clean, but the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The host also provided items that you don’t tend to see in these types of units. There were plenty of cleaning supplies, make up remover wipes, some condiments and spices for cooking, and plenty of linens and back up items, such as paper towels and toilet paper.
Additionally, the property was adorable and decorated nicely. I definitely plan to return!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin was amazing in getting back to me, with the questions that I had. And her place was the perfect get-a-way for what I needed in the moment."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this! Very relaxing and cute. The only thing I would say is grocery shop before you get there! The closest grocery is 15 min away and all directions.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was a lovely home!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, was wonderful for our stay. It is rather tricky to find in the dark, GPS does not take you to the correct location, it's a few hundred feet off. Otherwise, wonderful place, wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in the area for a family wedding, and the cottage was the perfect quiet getaway for us to rest in between events! It is beautifully decorated with lovely views of the lake, and totally comfortable for our family of three plus one other visiting family member. We highly recommend this cottage for anyone coming to the Celina area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay at this adorable cottage. So close the lake! The hot tub was great. Lots of places to just hang out.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,My guys love this house and will stay anytime is it available.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint cottage just off the lake, was updated and clean. Well-stocked kitchen. Sofa was very comfy with a large smart TV in living room. My kids really liked the bunkbeds.
The hot tub was great, felt nice even though it was cold outside. We went off-season, so didn't do anything on the water and it was rainy so couldn't use the firepit either. Short drive to St. Mary's or Celina. I'm pretty sure we'll be back in the summer so we can enjoy other outdoor activities."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you so much for the great place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful little place for our family! It was a perfect size for the 6 of us. We thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor area with the hot tub, fire pit, and location to the lake. The place was extremely clean and literally steps away from the marina if you had a boat to enter the water. Would recommend 100% for anyone needing a relaxing and peaceful location for family or friends! If we make it back to the area, we will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is lovely. Clean. Nice decor. Inviting. Games, books, bags, s’mores... All the little things are there. Just a lovely place to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Took a gamble on 220 Lakeland and boy did it pay off! We carefully selected this property in order to have an unobstructed view of the April 8th total solar eclipse. The location did not disappoint. We met a few of the neighbors and everyone was very kind, one gentleman even allowed our daughter to take his kayak onto the lake. The surroundings were so peaceful and calm which made it easy to unwind while we were there. The beds were comfortable and the whole place was well appointed. We spent most of our time playing in the yard though. The lawn is immaculate! We travel with various sports gear and really enjoyed playing catch barefoot in the backyard. The only suggestion I have would be to supply some items that would encourage future guests to unplug and take advantage of the outdoor areas beyond the spacious patio. If kayaks were an option, we definitely would have put them to good use!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,very clean inside plenty of space comfy beds would 100% stay again and recommend to other people!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay. The 3 bedroom unit was our favorite with the high ceilings and large rooms.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, comfy beds and couch. We booked for a weekend volleyball tournament, great location just a few minutes away."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I only needed a place for a night and Steph’s place was cheaper than a hotel and had more room to spread out. We had no problem getting in, instructions were clear and keypad entry made it so easy. The place was clean and comfy. Beds were great! The rental is so close to downtown. Great restaurants too! A short walk to the lake. So much to do here."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apt that was located within walking distance to all the highlights in Celina! Steph was great with communicating.
Recommend 10/10 if you are looking for a place to stay in Celina!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great listing with wonderful access to the lake and surrounding area and within walking distance of the main street restaurants and shops. The stay itself was very comfortable.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We booked a short overnight stay just to get away. The apartment was easy to locate, but the entrance took a few minutes to find on the building since there were a few possibilities.
Inside, it was VERY clean with all of the amenities that were listed. Decor was sparse, nothing on the walls, so it appeared more sterile vs ""homey"". Floor lamps or table lamps in the living room. All that was available was the recessed lighting in the ceiling, which made it VERY bright for relaxing or watching a movie.
The beds were clean and had several pillows. The mattresses were on the firm side (in our opinion). Nice blankets on the bed for comfort.
We enjoyed our brief stay and would recommend it to others. ❤️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing ! Definitely exceeded our expectations. And was an amazing deal for the price. Everything was spotless and clutter free. We were able to walk easily to town to grab food at the local restaurants. 10/10 would stay again

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay. We were there for a wedding, so we pretty much used this as a place to sleep. It is clean and comfortable. And right in the center of town, but very quiet. There were a few bugs to work out, such as no closets or hooks for our wedding clothes. Steph is working on this. Furniture they ordered months ago has not come in yet. We had that same problem last fall. Also the elevator was not opening when we pushed the button on the ground floor. I had to walk up the stairs to send the elevator to the first floor so my daughter could get in. Steph says she also is working on getting that repaired. We would definitely stay there when we visit family again. It is a very nice place."

There was brand new furniture in the living room and the old furniture is in the back screened in porch. No furniture on the front porch, could’ve been a great place to watch the world go by or for morning coffee. Bedding was comfortable. Walkable downtown area and restaurants within 15 min. We would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. A feel of home. Walking distance to a good place to eat. price was great. Very quiet. Grand lake is in walking distance. Ryan answered all messages quickly. Will be booking again for sure.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time stay here we were in Ohio visiting family we had a great time,"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was great!
Everything as advertised and perfect for what we needed!
Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ryan’s place was exactly as pictured! The house was spotless and had cozy amenities. I really enjoyed having the yard for my pup to play in for a little bit after the car ride! If you want a nice weekend getaway near the lake this place is perfect! The town is quaint and small but provides the essentials! Highly recommend Ryan’s listing for a weekend or if you’re just passing through.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying with Ryan. Extremely satisfied and will DEFINITELY stay again. Very responsive and easy to work with. If looking for a quiet relaxing stay on Grand Lake St. Mary’s…this is it!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We always stay here when we are in the Grand Lake St Mary’s area. It’s easy access for boat parking . The host will go out of his way to see your comfortable . Thanks! Ryan
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"We didn't get to do much in the area because we were only there one night on our journey further west, but the house was nice, clean, and we enjoyed our overnight stay.
We would consider Ryan's house in the future if we need a stopping place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Loved the sunroom and the big yard that was mostly fenced in. Loved the lakeside hideout restaurant that’s near by and the lake is within walking distance. People in the area seem friendly and Ryan is super nice.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed our stay! Ryan was so kind and accommodating. Place was nice and clean and spacious. Would definitely stay again!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I would definitely stay at Ryan’s home again on our next visit. He was very accommodating and let us have our puppies with us… which not very many hosts allowed here in Celina.
Thank you for sharing your home and being a great host Ryan."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was helpful and quick to respond. Had an easy stay. Would highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ryan was very helpful on our last minute reservation. The home was comfy, beds were soft. The home has a great lake location."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, spacious home with lots of room to spread out and feel at home. The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood quiet, so it was a great night’s sleep. Everything was very clean and Ryan was a great host. A great place to stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan is a great host! His place is as described and squeaky clean. He responded quickly to my stay request and and any questions that I had. We were in town for a family member's birthday that actually lives in the same neighborhood where Ryan's place is located so it made things super convenient. Ryan's place is in a neighborhood setting and is literally a stone's throw from a local bar (which does serve food), a restaurant (open seasonally) and Grand Lake so you'll have plenty to do without having to get into your car. The only thing I would advise anyone that Ryan approves to bring their dog is that the yard is not fully fenced so you'll need to keep that in mind. The fencing is privacy fence in the back and sides, which is great for relaxing on the screen porch but an open fence along the front of the yard and not enclosed by the driveway."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ryans house was a great place to say, fully stocked and clean!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan’s place was perfect for our short stay, as a stop over on the way to our destination. We wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all the things the house had to offer. One of the bedrooms has a great en suite with nice touches. The location was perfect and felt private, despite being located around other houses and was quiet while we visited in winter. While there was just two of us, the house is large enough to accommodate several people and the layout is not crowded, so there’s plenty of space to spread out. The attached “three seasons” room would be an awesome place to hang out, especially in summer and fall. Ryan had great communication and it was very easy to access the code to get in the door. Thank you for your thoughtfulness in leaving treats for our dog and for hosting us in your lovely home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this location as it is close to family; which we needed during this Christmas Holiday. The accommodations were very comfortable and clean, easy to get to, secure but easy to get in to. Ryan was very responsive and helpful. Like any house, a few things need adjusted, but he's working on them."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ryan was awesome and his place was very cool near Grand Lake St. Marys.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recommend this place we going to visit our family again I would like to reserve this place again
What I liked about it was that they were nice people and thank you once again RYAN"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our short stay in December was very comfortable. Everything we needed was provided. It was a convenient location for us to visit my mother at Otterbein every day and we definitely plan to stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house and Ryan was very easy to work with. House would be perfect for a lake getaway. Unfortunately we were hoping for something closer to the downtown area. Not Ryan’s fault at all, but something for future guests to be aware of."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for being such a great host!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Plenty of space and everything needed for a good stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean. loved all the spices in the kitchen. Easy to get where we were going.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as I expected.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will stay here again if I’m in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place for Family, Ryan Respond Quick"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have a camper at Duckfoot so Ryans place is perfect for guests when there isnt room in the camper. Its clean, spacious, and has everything needed! The host is very responsive which is great. Will be renting again any time extra company visits at the lake if it is available."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is walking distance to a local bar and eatery, after hours taxi will take you where ever you want to go for a reasonable price, the bedrooms are fairly large, and the driveway has plenty of room for at least 3 vehicles. The kitchen was stocked well with pots, pans, a griddle, and plenty of plates and silverware. The icemaker does not work and no ice trays were present. The listing is for 6 people but the kitchen table only has 4 chairs and the living room only has 5 seats. The enclosed patio has no furniture, bring chairs. I would revisit this location but would have to bring a few things."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful time at this place. The house was amazing very clean and cozy. I would recommend this place to anyone .
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house , very clean and comfortable. Great location."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to water and a few restaurants. House was very clean and spacious. Plenty of extra supplies."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you so much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place as described, very spacious rooms. Found the inside of the house clean and stock with towels as stated. Not far to walk to the lake and enjoy the night. There a couple of bar restaurants within a 2 block walk for dinner or drinks. Food was OK service is not the best."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect home love the lake - plenty parking for a trailer
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Right by the water. We drove a tiny ways and spent most of the time at a gorgeous park right on the water. Ryan's was impeccably clean and a great launch pad to stay at.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very roomy home with an open concept feel. Bedrooms were adequate size and it was nice to have 2 full baths. Short walk to the lake and to a restaurant by the lake. Enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house served our needs well enough. Very very basic, similar to a hotel with less amenities but very affordable and more space. We stayed at the house while shopping the 127 yard sale trail and were not at the house very much. The beds were comfortable, which is what mattered most after long days treasure hunting. Very loud live music from a neighboring bar but we didn't mind bc we knew the music! There was a cleaning issue but Ryan stopped by the next day to check in. He also brought a grill, which was nice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. A very nice place to stay. Would recommend it highly.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was beautiful and a perfect location for visiting the lake! Will definitely be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty plain place but good location, great price & a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"excellent location. clean, quiet area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place. As a matter of fact, I extended my visit. The place was very clean and comfortable. We had a wonderful time hanging out by the lake. There is a Bar/Grill about a block away and the Behm's Restaurant about 2 blocks, but we mostly cooked every night. Both establishments are both on the water. So peaceful, friendly neighbors, and a nice yard. Bring you corn hole game. The location is perfect because of my friends in New Knoxville."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for us. House is very clean & well equipped. Nice neighborhood. It's a short walk to the lake & to 2 close restaurants nearby. Would recommend staying here.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Mom and I rented this home in Celina for a weekend so we could attend a family reunion. Overall, Ryans place was very nice. It was clean, in a nice area close to the lake, and quiet.
From the check-out cleaning instructions it sounded like there was a washer/dryer in the home, but the host confirmed for us that there is none. If you need to do laundry there is a laundry mat about 15 min away in downtown Celina.
The only real issue we had was that the house was advertised as 3 bedrooms but the 3rd bedroom was locked. My sister (who is 5 months pregnant) was feeling exhausted after the reunion and wanted to lie down. I invited her back to the AirBnB to nap for a bit but the 3rd bedroom was locked. The house was advertised as 3 bedrooms and if I’m being charged for 3 bedrooms, I expect to have access to all 3 rooms for the time I’m renting the home. I did not pop the lock and my pregnant sister ended up napping on the couch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for several days during our trip to race at Eldora up the road. The place was easy to find and very close to the lake. Had we not been busy at the track everyday this would have been a great little vacay spot for lake time. House was as described. Beds were comfortable we had plenty of towels, etc for our needs. I will warn you of the mosquitoes and gnats outside due to the proximity of the lake so if you plan to be outside at the house a lot you may want to bring mosquito spray this time of year. Overall we would happily stay here again without hesitation."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The Celina house hosted by Ryan was perfect for our annual fishing weekend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rya was extremely accommodating and very easy to talk to, can’t thank him enough for the accommodations."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Larger living room than I expected which was nice!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan’s place is great especially if your are fishing Grand Lake St Mary’s. The place is quite, clean and near anything you want to do. Doesn’t get any better!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not do this place justice - the rooms are huge and lots of open space in the house. Ryan was a wonderful host - great communication & very responsive. And the location is awesome - a short walk to an amazing view of the lake. Sunsets were incredible. Would definitely return!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice host, nice home, quiet neighborhood. 👍🏼"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We arrived after dark and left before sunrise, so we didn't get a good view of the surroundings. The house worked well for us and we would likely use it again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean home! More than enough space for us and our 3 kids to stay while visiting family and friends in the area. Plenty of linens, towels, cooking supplies, and even coffee in the cabinet (which we were grateful for!). There was even some body wash and shampoo available, which we forgot to bring. Look forward to coming back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! It was spotless, and in a great location - just a quick walk to the lake and also within walking distance to a bar with delicious bar food and a sit down restaurant on the lake. All of the rooms were so spacious and comfortable! If we ever have a reason to be back in the area, we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We took a short fall break with our grandkids, and went to Minster, New Bremen, Jackson Center and Wapakoneta. This was a great central location. Very quiet, comfortable beds (and great internet.) Great check-in and a great stay."

Please refer to review the make some small changes"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the house was amazing. It was far greater in size than I realized. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying here and yet again another 5 star experience! Thank you 🙏🏼
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean, well maintained property. Ryan made it very easy for check in. While location is a bit off the beaten path, the quality of the home is worth it. Convenient to bar and restaurant. Quiet and friendly neighborhood (be ready to wave hello to the neighbors :)!) Very comfortable stay, would recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ryan is an outstanding host with a very nice property! Very clean with many amenities! Looking forward to our next stay!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious house, comfortable beds, good location. Decently stocked kitchen supplies if you're not particular. Easy check in/check out!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect for a weekend getaway. Very spacious
2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Overall enjoyed our stay. Could tell things had been recently renovated. I'm sure it will be even nicer when they finish decorating. There was some confusion about pricing when we booked and the host asked us to re-book with an extra $30 charge since we had 6 people (which is what the house sleeps?) Not sure why there was extra charge for that. Did allow us to check in early which was appreciated.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would certainly stay again, we had 3total people, everyone got their own room and bed, Ryan was very easy to communicate with, 10/10 would recommend. Location was very nice and quiet"

the host Ryan was quick to respond and very helpful. looking forward to staying again"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an exceptional house, immaculate, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Our host, Ryan, was very communicative and welcoming. We couldn't have asked for a nicer stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, nice stay, well-stocked kitchen. There's some truck noise from nearby Market Street, but it wasn't a big deal to us. Just northwest of the house is a lovely neighborhood to walk in. Check out The James Watson House for excellent dining. Nearby Baker Woods was a pleasant walk. The lake is close, but you have to navigate Market Street and walk a bit west for better access. Celina is a pleasant little town."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful place you can see the lake from the front yard. Very clean house. Outstanding amenities. This is our second stay with Stacey Wood highly recommend this place. We will be booking again with Stacey.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute house worked out great for our needs! We are Moose Lodge members and we visited there several times during our stay as it was only a 10 minute walk. Great Mexican restaurant, La Careta, as well as a nice breakfast/lunch place, Pullman Bay, all in walking distance. 2 block walk to be able to sit and view the lake. Great location!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice and relaxing house right in the heart of Celina. It’s tucked away enough for you to be left alone and relax, but also anything you could want to do in the area is right there. Would go back to this place for sure!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Screw paying a hotel the same price for something you’ve probably seen already. Not much to say besides all around I’d 100% book here again. Thanks!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We’ll be back! Perfect little getaway within walking distance from the water, a cute park and Main Street. The street was quiet and nice to relax on but close enough to everything there is to do. House was very clean and set up perfectly. It was nice that the garage was an option too! Check in was super easy and we had everything we needed!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice. I would stay here again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time at Stacey’s house in Celina. Perfect for our family. The house was clean, well-stocked and comfortable.
Thank you!"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tidy, lots of space in master, decent kitchen for food prep.
Cookware is meant for smaller portions, so bring your own large skillets/pots if needed. No cleaning required at check-out (or at least none in the guest book), so it’s easy to get on your way."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect stay for your family or a trip with friends! This place is so clean and cozy! Everything you'll need is right here!

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a great place to stay in Celina. The house was so clean and very comfortable. We really liked the extra large bedroom with a couch and television. It gave the kids a separate place to hang out away from the adults. I would love to stay here again the next time I visit family in Celina.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy check in. Comfortable beds. Washer and Dryer are nice.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No urber or other transportation but main street is only 14 mins walking. Something to condiser.

Stacey is very prompt to respond to questions.
We would certainly stay here again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey’s place was great. Loved that the kitchen was like an actual kitchen! I didn’t feel like I had to get creative to cook with minimal supplies like most air bnbs. There was a keurig, with a reusable cup so you could use your own coffee. Keurig cups were provided, and sugar/sweetener packets.
Available utensils, fully stocked pots and pans! The little things most places don’t have, Stacey had. I was impressed.
Smart tv in the living room, enjoy streaming at night to wind down. A binder with maps of the area and suggestions… we spent a day out on the lake after renting a pontoon boat! We had a great time!"

2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey's space is wonderful for families. It's an open-concept home and very few things that my 5, 3, and 20-month old could get into. It's close to everything you might need and only minutes from the lake (by foot!)."
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were very pleased when we arrived at Lakeview Inn! So clean and spacious and a perfect place for my family and I to stay for the weekend.

It was nice to be able to park in the garage. She was quick to response and answered all questions. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area. We would highly recommend Stacey's place. We would also highly recommend Pullman's Bay Restaurant just around the corner. The staff is friendly, the food was great, and the desserts are out of this world."

Thoughtful touches, comfortable beds, bedding and pillows (thank you!) and the awesome back patio under the big maple tree made out stay exceptional. We were in town for 4 days and loved relaxing back at the house. We will be back next year!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stacey's home is beautiful! The photos really don't do it justice. Every space in the home is updated and clean, and it is very spacious. It is well-equipped with dishes, appliances, and toiletries.
A huge bonus was that Stacey allowed us to bring our dogs, which feels like a rare find on Airbnb. While the yard isn't fenced in, it is relatively large and Celina is really walkable, making it very easy to keep the pups happy.
I highly recommend Stacey's home if you're in the Celina/ St. Mary's area."

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay we had our 3 year old grandson with us, he was so excited to see the flagpole and a TV antenna (2 things that he truly loves).

Having a washer and dryer was a plus! Stacey was very responsive and answered any questions we had. We really enjoyed this space and would recommend to anyone:)
As a side note: There is not a fenced in back yard for dogs. Will have to leash up before hand."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here the night of our wedding - overall fairly good. Only complaint is that the staircase leading up to the Airbnb smelled like marijuana and smoke which we are assuming is from a nearby bar/restaurant. Balcony view is beautiful in the morning.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at The Loft. The space worked very well for 2 adults. We had 1 problem and Brian was very responsive and it was resolved quickly.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days while waiting for his apartment to be painted. Nicely decorated, thoughtfully stocked, and cozy little apartment. Brian was friendly and provided helpful information via email and plaques throughout the apartment."

A lot better deal than the hotel!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy & tidy place. Lots of original wood trim, which is awesome! Noise from the semis on Main Street could be annoying, but that's not the host's fault. I was solo; two adults who share a bed would be cozy; three adults is doable but a little crowded."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The loft was the perfect place to stay for a long weekend. It was in the middle of downtown with a good selection of bars and restaurants to visit.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, second floor apartment on Main Street, right in the heart of downtown Celina. You can walk to several bars/restaurants in a minute or less. There is plenty of free parking (on street and in a large municipal parking lot directly across main street.) This is a great location to explore the lake, dine, or enjoy an adult beverage and meet the very pleasant locals. Everything is within easy walking distance.
Located in a historic building (1902?) there are some artifacts, newspaper clippings and photos in the main room, which also boasts a tiny balcony and an absolutely giant bay window overlooking Main Street. Some of the original woodwork is still preserved in the main room, as well.
The bed was quite comfy, and the keyless entry made check-in and access a breeze."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Loved that we could walk to restaurants and the path by the lake. Brian was quick to respond to our questions. Overall a very enjoyable stay.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really fantastic place! Huge and comfortable for a large get together. Nice kitchen, comfy beds, space to spread out and places to come together. Really cute town too, not too much to do, but great for a relaxed time with family and friends."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect place for our family get together to celebrate our daughter’s Law School graduation.
Every nook and cranny were well thought out and something to do every where. Kitchen was well equipped and we had a great barbecue night. Enjoyed the pool every day and the fire pit at night.
We would definitely come back when in the area again.
Ideal for family reunions, etc."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terry and Cecelia's bungalow was the perfect place for me and my daughter to relax and get some rest during a weekend volleyball tournament. It was conveniently located one house from the lake in a residential area, offering beautiful views and peace and quiet. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the surrounding parks and features because we only had time to visit local restaurants before crashing for bed to rest up for the following day's tournament games.
Each of the rooms had a separate thermostat which was nice for each of our individual comfort levels. They were also kind enough to stock the fridge with bottled water and the cabinet with k-cups for the Keurig.
Only area that needs improvement is the fire stick, which appeared to be outdated and was glitchy and sometimes unresponsive. However, Cecelia dropped what she was doing, dropped off an adapter to connect my phone to the tv and have since upgraded the fire stick so the next visitor doesn't have any issues."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth the price and close location to the lake
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was warm and inviting. Everything was set up and it was an excellent stay. Thank you guys again. I'll be back!!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a lovely stay.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Beach Bungalow was a great place to stay. We were in town for a family wedding and so the Airbnb met the needs. The only negative thing that I would say is that the furniture could use some upgrades.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you. A nice, clean house in a location that worked so well for our needs. We had a lot to accomplish in a short time (not a leisure trip). This neat bungalow met our unique needs."

I asked in the early evening if they could add a app to the TV so I could access my You Tube TV account. Cecelia came over within minutes and between the two of us we were able to figure out how to add the app to the TV so we could have the access. Terry & Cecelia were fantastic hosts.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Small and quaint little bungalow. Me, my son, and husband stayed 2 nights as we were going to the Eldora Speedway for a 2 night show and didn’t want to drive all the way back back. Quick 23 min drive and well worth the price we paid. The lake there is absolutely beautiful and they have a brand new park with great equipment! Owners did a great job describing the place and even allowed early check in. If we ever come to Eldora we will for sure look them up again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place within a few steps of the lake! Comfortable and very reasonably priced for the number of guests it can accommodate. It's not a far walk to a park where you can sit by the lake and take it in. Cool downtown area is just a bit farther. Great hosts!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little home felt exactly like visiting with Grandma! Cozy and warm, with good porch sittin' and comfy furniture! The hosts were super communicative if you needed them, and had stellar local recommendations, as well as gave me directions any time I needed-super friendly folks! You can walk to the end of the street and gawk at the water and bird watch, or take a short 6 mile drive to the state park in one direction, or a four block walk to a small park in the other direction! We truly got to unwind and experience 'lake life' for a few quiet days! We will absolutely be back if they'll have us! <3 thank you Terry and Cece!"

Great location, too, with the lake on one side and the town on the other."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. Just the right amount of space that we needed for a weekend. It was close to the race track which made the drive after the race easy.
The pictures are very accurate. We did not cook during our stay but the kitchen was well stocked and would have had anything we needed to cook. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable as was the bed in the second bedroom. Wish we could have used the patio but rain kept us from it. The two window air conditioners cooled the bungalow nicely.
We are already looking to reserve it for next year's race weekend."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terry and Cecelia were absolutely amazing hosts and we adored our stay!!! The location near the water is awesome, the town is so cute, and the lake is stunning. The only real issue we found was that the lake apparently is very polluted (all the locals told us) so it is used way more as a fishing lake than a swimming lake. The hosts were communicative and helped with all of our questions. We loved it and will be returning! Such an awesome trip!!!"

House has everything you need for stay, from plenty of towels to everything in the kitchen you could possibly need. you could stay a weekend or a month and be perfectly comfortable. Parking is at a premium, so if you plan on bringing a boat you will need to make arrangements to dock or park it somewhere. The owners can help you with places. Will definitely stay here if we return to Celina. Close to downtown and other places of interest.We give this property the highest rating we can."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were so glad to stay at the Bungalow once more! Terry and Cecelia are perfect hosts and the accommodations are stellar. The side street is quiet and close to the lake. The layout of the house is great to get walking in during extremely frigid outdoor temperatures was the great discovery this trip! The house is well stocked and supplied and for coffee aficionados, you have your choice of a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee machine. We came home after long days, and truly felt at home.

Tip for anyone staying with more than 2 people - the hot water in the shower runs out after about 30 minutes. So take breaks in between showers.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for the two of us. Beds were comfortable and the house was nice and clean. Wish we would have had better weather to enjoy the patio.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent, CLEAN, little home, centrally located to everything. The kitchen was very well stocked, although we didn't use it ( who wants to cook when you are on a 1 day/night ""vacation""?? Not me). The bed was very comfortable, so was the couch apparently, because that's where my husband slept, and he was snoring, so that's where I left him. 😌
I was pleased to see the shower had 4 full size bottles of shampoo/ conditioner, and body wash. The towels were soft, not thin and scratchy like some places have. There was a drawer with a hair dryer, first aid kit, even makeup wipes. The neighborhood was cute, and quiet. Considering we came on the very last weekend of October, we weren't able to get out on the water, but we drooled looking at the pontoon boat parked just beyond the sliding glass doors. Clearly, the hubs and I will return in warmer weather, and if they're lucky, we might bring the kids.😃"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little place to stay while in town for a wedding. Close to downtown. Cheaper than any hotels and with some privacy.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay and Terry and CeeCee’s bungalow. Their bungalow is in an excellent location, very central. Spotlessly clean with what we need while staying in Celina. Cee Cee and Terry are great communicators and quick to respond. This bungalow is our first choice while staying in Celina!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,lovely place. It was 4 miles to the church for the wedding and a mile to the reception hall.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed one night, I was there to run the Grand Lake Marathon that is held there every yr. Terry and Cecelia place are just beautiful people with a beautiful home. Super clean, super easy check in and checkout. Literally everything you need for a short or long stay. They quickly got back to me on any questions and, the house being located just 1 mile from finishline right on the route, they cheered me on, kept my family company and even took some pics and videos for me! like that is just awesome. they totally didn't have to do that but that's just what extremely hospitable people do and they were nothing short of it.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little bungalow 2 doors down from lake. You can see lake from road or looking between homes out the front door. Wished the little patio had water view but no fault of owners. Good communication with owners and nice touch of fresh flowers on dining table. Local information and booklets in home to browse. We were in town with the heatwave and the window air conditioners kept it comfortable along with fan. The house has plenty of kitchen necessities (silverware, dishes, pots and pans). There is a washer and dryer available also. This place served as a good home base to come back to after day trips."

The kitchen is well appointed with everything you could possibly want. The rain shower head in the bathroom was heavenly. The beds were very comfortable and the two a/c units cooled the house nicely despite the hot days. An added wonderful bonus was meeting Cece and Terry and their cute, friendly dogs. The hosts are the greatest, and had good advice about local restaurants. We ate at La Carreta based on their recommendation, and were not disappointed.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I traveled with someone who was unable to get around very well so we couldn't enjoy walks or bike riding but I bet when it's warmer and if you were able those things would have been wonderful you do.

They also provide all the special touches that make your stay easy as can be.
My family will definitely use it again in the future!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is exactly as advertised: clean and cozy. There is a nice yard to sit in and view the lake. A pleasant park is very close by. I was there just to get away and relax and this was a good place for that.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is one house away from the lake. It is close to everything you need to access by the lake. The house itself has everything you need for a stay including a kitchen and washer/dryer facility. The house has been thoughtfully decorated and had all the amenities we needed. The wifi connection was good as well.
Terry and Cecelia are wonderful hosts and even gave a tour of the lake! Their dogs are lovely and friendly. They have experience about the area and can recommend things to do. The place was a good for a short and quiet getaway!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication and check in was quick and easy. The home is so cute and clean. The location is amazing and quiet. Just a short walk to lakeside and a beautiful view.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, decorated well. Would recommend"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little property near/next to the lake. Good amenities and Terry and Cecilia were kind hosts. They provided a lot of recommendations on where to go and what to eat in the area. All of their instructions were clear and understandable and provided an enjoyable experience. Jaxson and Tia were the sweetest dog greeters. Would definitely recommend for a trip for a little R&R.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,All I can do is brag about our stay. Everything was great! Very welcoming and comfortable. We had a super nice and relaxing boat ride. We loved our Terry and Cece engaged with our children. They even gave us vegetables from their garden. Super nice couple! We had a wonderful experience and we plan on coming back! Thanks a million!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,🌹 Red Roses net us at entry and host Terry was Awesome! Hope to meet Cecelia next time 🤗
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came into the area to visit family who don't have extra space for us to stay with them for a week. Terry and Cece's place was a great place to get away and relax in a very nice, quiet home. We live in a large metropolitan city, and being out of that environment was much needed. Terry and Cece's place was exactly what we needed.
The home was very clean and well-equipped. We were there for 6 nights, and had everything we needed amenity-wise to have a very nice stay. We had a chance to meet Terry and Cece and spend a little time chatting with them (they live next door). They are both very kind, welcoming, and hospitable people. They even shared fresh vegetables with us from their garden. It was very nice. They have two cute little dogs that make the place even more welcoming and sweet.
The house is situated at the end of a quiet street with a view of the lake. There are many stores and restaurants nearby, so every need was met. We didn't get out on the water, but that wasn't part of our plan so it's OK. We did go to the state park on the lake (about a 10 minute drive down route 703), and enjoyed walks, runs, and a picnic in the park by the lake. We would highly recommend staying here if you are coming into the Celina area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little place right by the lake to get away and relax. The house had everything you’d need!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The bungalow is very close to downtown Celina. It makes it easy to be able to go and do things in town or farther out. It was only 1 house away from the lake so there were beautiful views of the lake the minute we walked out the door.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy space right on the lake, kind and considerate hosts, and beautiful views! The only bummer in my book was that the lake is not safe to swim in (which I learned after booking). But the lake views and small town calm made it all worth it. Very relaxing trip! Thank you, Terry and Cecelia!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Lake, Great Time, Great Hosts"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Terry & Cecelia’s home was exceptional. It was clean, an amazing location, and set up very well to accommodate for our baby and our parents. They were quick to communicate and had amazing hospitality. Thank you! We will be back!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Terry and Cecelia were amazing! They gave me my space while letting me know they were there to help if the need arose. They were quick to respond if I needed assistance with any of the logistics of the house and the dogs running in the yard were a plus!

2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The little bungalow by the lake is a perfect spot for those wanting to explore the lake. We were there on a work trip, but even so we enjoyed canoeing in the lake and taking walks at a nearby waterfront park. The area is greatly located with groceries/restaurants close by. Terry and Cecelia are very welcoming and are there for you if you have any issues or questions. I would definitely recommend this stay."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Out of all the airbnb's we have stayed in Celina, we have found the best most comfortable at Steph's place! This is also a great place to bring kids since there is a Burger King right next door that has a play place as an added bonus. 😁"

We absolutely loved it and will return! Steph was great to work with and we could not have asked for better. Perfect spot.
Only con- (and it isn’t awful) but the firehouse is literally across the street so you do get woken up rather loudly if they have to go on a call."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem in downtown Celina. Steph’s place was perfect! The cleanliness was impeccable and the house was spacious. My family had plenty of room and the kitchen was perfect for preparing breakfast and coffee.

Loved the location too. Celina is a very cute town."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Steph and Corey's was for two nights, over a weekend...and was fabulous! The space is enormous, nicely appointed, comfortable, well-equipped and meticulously clean. It's also within a very short drive to the lake and various establishments. After we figured out how the door works, it was a breeze to come and go without having to worry about a key or card. Communication was immediate, helpful and very friendly (always a plus). Having a parking space onsite was super convenient and appreciated. The layout is unusual but works well, once settled in. We actually wished we could have stayed longer! Thank you so much, Steph and Corey!"

This apartment is exceptionally spacious, pristinely decorated and immaculately clean.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed here quite a few times and you can see in my other reviews that I think the accommodations are great.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great apartment. It is so spacious. I have stayed in the 2 bedroom unit in the same building twice before, but that was not available this week so I reserved this one. I liked it so much I reserved it for 2 more of my upcoming trips. To be clear, it is way bigger than I need for just me. I only use one of the three bedrooms, but The bigger kitchen and common area makes it worth it for me. As always, Steph was a great host. Very responsive and helpful."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great Airbnb! We recently stayed here while visiting family in the area.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for family members to stay for a holiday get-together in Celina. We could walk to our in-town relatives' home several blocks away, and Unit 3 is HUGE! Kitchen and shared rooms are welcoming and roomy, and the size of the unit allows lots of privacy for those who stay. Great to see an old, well-known Celina building find a new purpose as a B&B. And the price...can't be beat!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay in less than a month. This unit is so spacious and open that it feels like a second home. Every bedroom and the living room have TVs and the kitchen is well equipped. I can’t imagine anyone would be disappointed in this Airbnb.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steph and her family are some of the nicest people i have ever met. They helped us any way they could. The apartments are new and had everything we needed. Will definitely use them again if i am back in Ohio.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed Steph's property during our stay for a family member's wedding in Celina. Apparently, the property is an old mansion built in 1908, separated into multiple apartment units and common spaces. We stayed in Apt #3. Although the property is being renovated, we were not at all disturbed. What has been renovated looks amazing, with modern features. The apartment was decorated extremely well, and we were pleasantly surprised by the architectural features and abundance of space. Our 12 yo son loved the TV consoles with electric fireplaces in every bedroom -- what a fantastic choice! The trendy gray/white color palette was perfect, and the beds were comfy. AC is via window units with remote controls, but they worked extremely well and kept us cool without problem. I couldn't tell if the property still relied on radiator heat, but there was a radiator in nearly every room, which does date the space a tad; we hardly noticed them, though. We appreciated the color-coordinated baskets in each room, which we used for dirty clothes before replacing with our linens when we left. Steph left a bottle of wine, sodas, waters, and snacks out for us, which was a nice touch. Just note that the wine is red but sweet. There was a well-appointed laundry room and a lobby of sorts, as well. The location was central to everywhere we needed to go. This really was a great space!
There were a few things missing that would have made the experience better and more convenient: A coffeemaker and an iron on premises, although there was an ironing board. To us, these amenities are standard, but going back to the listing, I saw that they are not listed. Such an easy thing to overlook when making a booking because these amenities are rather standard across Airbnbs and hotels, at least in the US. Hopefully, Steph makes the small investment to provide those for future guests. Also, the entry hall is extremely dark at night (and a bit spooky, especially with doors that have no door knobs). Again, the space is being renovated. We left the light on once when we were away at night, but we thought that a hall light with motion-sensor would be better.
Overall, we would happily stay at this property again! Our friends and family in the area had no idea that the property existed, but we raved on about it and recommended they consider this option when they have family come to town. Once we confirm our holiday plans, we'll be sure to look to this listing for availability. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Steph!"

We watched the beautiful sunsets, enjoyed the large, fully equipped kitchen, ate on the balcony overlooking the water and so much more. A great value for 6 people needing seperate rooms. We were very happy with the space & would highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful getaway right on the water. Great layout. It was just me staying the two extra bedrooms were spacious if I would have needed.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to enjoy a peaceful few days away from home in lovely surroundings this is the place. Relaxing on the balcony listening to the gentle waves lapping at the shore while watching a bald eagle soar over head was the highlight of our trip. Yea, a bald eagle. We had been enjoying watching fish jump in the lake, ducks play in the water and seagulls fly overhead when we spotted the eagle. It was just magnificent."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, cozy, clean get away with a gorgeous view of the lake from every window! We loved having access to the lake right outside the door. The condo was roomy and stylishly decorated. Lynn was helpful when we had questions."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Had a dock where we could tie our boat up which was nice. Neighbors got a little rowdy and loud but that’s not Lynn’s fault. It is a condo unit and the couples the rented the downstairs unit partied until all hours of the morning and you could hear them in our unit.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This condo was really nice— elevated furnishings and decor, and a beautiful view of the lake from the deck. Very peaceful!
We really liked the welcome amenities too— nice to have coffee and toiletries A little expensive per night but a very nice condo."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn's place was just as wonderful as pictured/described! Every detail seems to have been thought of...we felt right at home in this spacious, well decorated home. The view of the lake f from the large balcony was amazing. We enjoyed watching the American White Pelicans and the Red Breasted Mangansers!

Enjoyed local diners for breakfast: The Pullman and The Fountain!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful weekend getaway. View is absolutely stunning and the home is done in beautiful decor and very clean.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Felt like Florida in Ohio. Lynn was a fabulous host! The condo was professionally organized and stocked. We loved sitting on the back porch watching the sea gulls, ducks, geese, and boats.. highly recommend!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay with beautiful surroundings. Hope to be back next year.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super clean place, super nice on the inside. Has all the pots and pans you’ll need to cook, blender, coffee pot.
Washer & dryer in the apartment.
Awesome view of the lake and super close to everything in town. Plenty of parking. They have a Roku in the tvs so you can sign into your stuff. Extra blankets inside if someone is cold in the group.
We are definitely staying here again when we come back to see family"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn is a great host, and her property was top notch! She communicates well and is quick to answer any concerns. The property is great: comfortable beds, well stocked amenities, and the view! We'll be back!"

Fully stocked with everything we needed and more. We cannot wait to come back in the summer time so we can enjoy even more!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean with a beautiful view. We were there celebrating our family Christmas on New Year’s and it was a nice touch to see a Christmas tree in the living room when we arrived. Lynn even made sure we had salt to put on the steps when we woke up to a snowy & icy morning. Look forward to going back again in the summer.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great views, very clean, quiet and convenient."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This condo is the most beautiful inside and incredible view that I could have ever imagined on Grand Lake. I sincerely would have mistaken the views for being in Florida. It's got all updated cabinets and interior design. It really felt like a retreat.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the space! It was jaw dropping for us. The clean, modern feel made us feel like home. The lake (which has great history) was such an added bonus and a sense of tranquility for us in the morning ! It was perfect walking distance To the Eagles for a wedding. I wish the beds were not rock hard - for those who have bad backs - however, we still slept so sound ! It was quiet, peaceful and just so so beautiful! The entire place was so big and had 3 bedrooms with an open kitchen / living space concept. Thank you for letting us experience this beauty ."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lynn’s space was wonderfully clean, accommodating, and really made us feel at home. Only reason I’m giving 4 stars is the AC was not working for the first night when we arrived due to the very high recent temps. This made for a less than desirable experience for us and our baby for almost half of our 2-night stay. However, Lynn acted very quick to have a technician come out as early as possible the next morning which we so appreciated!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice accommodations. No problems or concerns to report.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lynn’s place was beautiful! So organized and clean! Beautiful view of the lake!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, clean, clean and just as pictures depict. Loved this place!! A+!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beyond my expectations! GORGEOUS! I only wish their was a hot tub or pool. The property includes a boat dock but since it’s not in a channel it can be impossible to use if it’s windy which was the case for my stay. But the condo is huge!!! Master bedroom w amazing lake front views 55” tv large attached bath! Pics don’t do it justice! We loved it!
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Super clean condo with loads of updated furniture and appliances. Great Lake access and close to bars and restaurants. Communication with host was very easy. Two huge thumbs ups!

2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is PRISTINE! Lynn is easy to work with, timely in communication! The place was immaculate, fresh, with all the comforts of home. Soft throw blankets, and comfortable beds. She even has crock pots and blenders to use. We did use the garage as we were driving to a wedding, which was over the top!! When we were stressing a bit, we sat outside by the lake, and a bonfire!! Cannot thank Lynn enough for allowing us to use the place!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication and the unit was extremely clean and well cared for! We hope we have the opportunity to stay again in the future; plan for extra time to unwind and enjoy the beautiful views and surroundings!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Third time we've stayed at Lynn's Beach Club Resort. Always perfection!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing! So beautifully decorated, clean and omfortable. We enjoyed the balcony and it's wonderful views. Also enjoyed the use of the grill and the fire pit. Would highly recommend to anyone staying in the Celina area. Thanks Lynn!"
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was clean and laid out well. There were instructions for how to use the remote and suggestions available for food and entertainment. We were disappointed the screen was broken so we couldn’t keep the patio door open and the beds were more firm that we like.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and furnished with everything you need for a home away from home.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great stay! Super clean, cute and cozy spot. You can't beat the view here either."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time - the condo itself was surprisingly nice, and the beds were comfortable. It was clean (though the fan in the living room could use a very thorough dusting), and was well-appointed - really appreciated the binder with recommendations and several brochures. It’s worth noting that no one really goes in the lake due to toxic algae issues, and that some restaurants aren’t open during the week. The pier pictured in one of the photos isn’t available to guests of this condo, which we were bummed about since it’s beautiful! Overall, though, it was a lovely time for a quick getaway with beautiful views and comfortable, quiet, and relaxing accommodations, with just about everything you could need!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, spotless and the view is AMAZING!! The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed! We truly enjoyed our stay! The host is very responsive and super sweet! Looking for a place to relax, relate and release......This is it!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was great. It had everything we needed and then some. The listing was spot on.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Lynn’s place was perfect. We had a group of six and there was plenty of space. The home was clean and very organized. The home is right on the deck and the porch is lovely. We will be coming back to stay here!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Looking for a place to escape close to home? This property provided an amazing getaway opportunity for our family of 6. Beautiful view, perfect decor, quaint shops, excellent wi-if in case you have to do a little work on your break. We enjoyed breakfast on the balcony every morning and ate at nearby restaurants in the evenings. The sunset was amazing as well. We will definitely visit again, perhaps in just a few months! Thanks, Lynn!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was beautiful perfect little getaway from the fast pace of the city of Columbus. Will definitely be going back.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is awesome! I went down with a group of 6 for a weekend stay and the space is exactly what we were hoping for. It was very clean and Lynn was a fantastic host. She is very quick to respond and is a very welcoming person! My group and I would definitely stay here again.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynn and her place are top notch. If you’re looking for a place to stay, look no further. We were debating on a couple of local places and I’m so glad we needed up with Lynn. She is the perfect host, there when you need her, never when you don’t. The place was new, stylishly furnishes, sparkling clean and had wonderful views. Lynn had the place nice and cool for are hot summer arrival. We parked out boat out back and the convenience of everything was impeccable. A must rent!!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel like I keep saying amazing too much but that is just how I feel after a much needed covid-19 getaway. I have asthma so I am in a group of people that really fear covid but I am also in tune with myself to know when I need to get away. I researched for weeks and this home was perfect. We didnt need airports or flights so I felt safer. We arrived at the home it was spotless. The view from the living room and kitchen. Absolutely priceless. We loved it so much my group and I decided to look for a place there. We found a great amount of shopping which I did not expect, you can rent a pontoon boat nearby (no jetskis) and a great waterfront restaurant right next door. We used the gas grill to do steaks and crablegs and Lynn had everything we needed. This home is great for family trips, girls getaways, covid getaways and couples. The balcony I could have just slept on. Stay here you will not regret it. The towns people were so friendly too!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay. Beautiful location, clean rooms, great hospitality."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This space was beautiful and just what we were looking for. Employees used it as an extended stay (2 months +) instead of staying at a hotel while working on a job nearby. Check-in was convenient and she also set up a cleaning schedule to make sure things stayed nice. Would highly recommend this rental if looking for a long-term space, or even a weekend getaway. Thanks Lynn!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Outstanding! We highly recommend this rental. It has everything you could need, is incredibly clean, and so well decorated. Lynn is uber responsive, too."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lynn's place was amazing! Everything is just as it looks like in the pictures. Many amenities we're awaiting us in this super clean home. But, the best part was the location right on the lake. We will definitely return!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay here! Highly recommend! The home was beautifully decorated, tidy, and the host thought of every single thing you could need. She had a binder full of local information (restaurants, coffee shops, etc) and there were specific instructions for each thing- for example, how to use the different remotes to watch cable/Netflix etc. The view from the back windows and patio is GORGEOUS. I wish we had been able to stay longer! It was a very peaceful and relaxing."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beach Escape #304 is an immaculate condo right on Grand Lake St. Marys. The view is as amazing as it is peaceful. Both my daughter and I saw an Eagle flying, which was very cool. The condo itself is very spacious and had plenty of room for our family of four to spread out and not be on top of each other. You will not find a more organized rental anywhere; there is literally a place for everything. Lynn has thought of everything one could need. The absolutely only con, as small as it is, would be that the master bed is very firm to sleep on. The unit provided a very relaxing and enjoyable Fall break."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second year staying at Lynn's place. Always a wonderful experience. Super clean, thoughtful touches, great organization and communication. We'll be back next year!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Beautiful view.
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful condo. Great space for a family. Water looks great, but the blue-green algae problem makes you think twice about going in the water. We did and it was refreshing. Would stay there again in a minute."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space with amazing views. Very well organized and good written instructions on everything. You will love it.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A true lakefront living experience you wont regret. Beautiful view of the water right from your doorstep with plenty of amenities to make it feel like your home away from home. Very thoughtful hosting on Lynns part, we were very pampered and cozy and wouldn't hesitate to return."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The beds are hard to sleep on but everything else was great

2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We came to Beach Escape #304 for a relaxing weekend getaway. The space was just that and more! The space is extremely clean and well decorated. All furniture was comfortable and there were SO many helpful amenities including utensils and cookware, extra blankets and pillows, shower supplies, an amazing view, WiFi, television, and much more. I would highly recommend this space to anyone visiting the area. Thanks, Lynn!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place. The host is awesome, gracious and very hospitable. Highly recommend this place. Beautiful doesn't explain it entirely!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The condo is beautiful with a full kitchen and a great view. I would highly recommend it. The only negative thing was this lake had blue green algae so we didn't want to chance getting sick from getting in the water. The area was nice and much to do for bars and restaurants and parks for the family. We will be back when water conditions improve.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing condo with a beautiful view. A great space for friends and family.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house had a great view and a spacious interior. Lynn had everything sparkling clean and ready for our stay. I'd highlight recommend this second floor condo to anyone with young children, as the balcony is enclosed and the children can't get to the lake."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic views of the lake! This condo is fabulous! Our host has thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and relaxing. The condo is super clean and has every amenity you could dream of. The decor looks like it was professionally designed and the furniture was very inviting and comfortable. The fire pit and complementary wood made for a fun night making samoores while laughing and telling stories by fire light. Fishing off the dock only steps from your door provided hours of enjoyment for my entire family. We can't wait to return and create many more family memories.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo is just like brand new and right on the lake. The boat slip was a nice touch as it allowed us to dock right there. We enjoyed everything and would stay again.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is top notch! Absolutely Five star accommodations! It was nicer than any condo I have rented!Beautiful views of the lake, even from the master bedroom. It was perfect for a romantic get away or for a family! The owner Lynn, was wonderful! We hope to return soon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were well satisfied with the whole experience. Close to lake, downtown and easy to find what we were interested in doing.
Thank you very much for the chance to stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was centrally located in the middle of town. It was within minutes of many restaurants and the lake. The host was responsive with communication.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying here! Lovely home!!! The only drawback was the constant traffic on the main thoroughfare. If you’re a light sleeper I would not recommend it

The laundry room even has a utility sink! The living room boasts comfortable furniture and a big screen TV with numerous cable channels. Cable TV is also in both bedrooms. The rainhead shower was wonderful, and plentiful hot water was never an issue for the three of us staying there. We were so grateful to have such a nice place to come back to for relaxing after long, full days visiting relatives in nearby Indiana. The beds were very comfortable. For those who are light sleepers like me, turn on your white noise app at night. I slept very well. Highly recommend breakfast at The Fountain down the street (nice walk too) to make your stay complete. Friendly, communicative host. Looking forward to staying at Stacey's place again!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely apartment. It was clean and tidy and updated. It is on the main road and there is quite a bit of traffic noise. If you are a light sleeper just pack a sound machine or use an app on your phone and you'll be fine. The place is across the street from the lake and we enjoyed walking around and exploring. The location is also convenient to the major stores or restaurants if you would need. We mainly stayed in and cooked and there were plenty of dishes and cooking utensils to use.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here! Very clean! There are new couches that as of 6/23/19 haven't been included in the photos. They are super-comfy. There is a soaker tub that I didn't notice in the photos either. Also, Celina is such a cute, quaint little town. The lake is beautiful and practically across the street (bring bug repellent because... lake). There wasn't much space to walk the dog as it is a busy street, but I threw him in the car, drove less than a mile to a beautiful lakeside park. I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stacey's place is in a very accessible location with great parking. There are tools in the kitchen for those who like to cook while traveling and the kitchen is very clean and updated. The rest of the house is in the same condition.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey was a great host. We had fast responses to our questions and the house was well stocked with the basic necessities and more. She had breakfast bars and cereals available and K-cups for the Keurig, which was nice since we don’t have one at home. The home is very clean and comfortable. We didn’t spend much time there as we were there for our granddaughter’s grad party; so we didn’t do any cooking, but there seemed to be everything available to cook with if you wanted to. This is the second time we’ve stayed and we look forward to staying there again in the future."

Stacey had a notebook out for us with maps and information for local businesses. Good parking right next to the house, walking distance to fast food places. The other comments posted are quite true, there is a lot of noise from the main street where you enter. One of the bedrooms is right by Celina's main street and we heard cars/traffic all night."

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Stacey. The Market Street Inn is perfect as a base For us while visiting family nearby. We really appreciate how clean the house always is. The kitchen is very nicely equipped. Has ample dishes and dining space for 6-8 people which came in very handy for hosting a couple of meals for nearby family. Beds are comfortable, with good quality linens. As others have noted, the front bedroom gets a good deal of traffic noise until late in the evening, but earplugs and white noise app helped quite a bit. Stacey is very responsive to any inquiries - we requested to stay over an extra night at the last minute and she graciously and quickly agreed. All in all, a very good place to stay in Celina, and very good value! Will definitely return on future visits. Thanks Stacey!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our first airbnb! It is on a main street, which we also enjoyed. I was able to run to the park and back for 2 miles in the am. We also took advantage of the Wendy's across the street and delivery pizza for our busy schedule. The traffic dies down around 11pm and it didn't bother us much. Knowing where the house was located, I expected it. The house is spotless. Everything was perfect for us. We liked it so much that we hope that our friends will rent Staceys other house next year and we will return! I hope that I have just as good of luck the next time that I stay at an airbnb."

2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really clean and cute. The kitchen is the best part for sure. Definitely the nicest kitchen I've had while away.
Road noise is really loud in the front bedroom. If you are used to city living, it probably isn't going to be a problem for you. My house is set back from the road and the road I live on is a quiet road with little traffic. I'm not used to hearing traffic. I would still stay here again if in the area but I'd bring a white noise machine or something as it was disrutice for me."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, Location, Location. This house sits on Grand Lake St Mary's a short (very short) walk across a small road (very slow if any traffic) finds you sitting in Adirondack chairs enjoying the lake. The sitting area comes with the property and the listing agent was nice enough to share this information with us upon our arrival. Entry was easy and the house was very nice. All amenities listed were present. The large screen TV in the living room was like going to the movies. We used our Netflix membership to watch. There were a few items that would have made our stay a little nicer. 1 a table. There was only a picnic table on the deck so when it was cold we ended up using tv trays and sitting on the floor picnic like when the trays were used. 2. A workspace. I needed to do some work while at the house, internet was great, but with no table and no workspace it was difficult. I ended up standing in the kitchen while working. We would return."
,,,"PROS: beds were comfy, quiet area, 2 bathrooms
CONS: 3 bulbs in dining room were burned out as were three in kitchen, 3-panel mirror in the bathroom had one panel that was completely gone, door in master bathroom doesn’t close, we’re okay with taking out the garbage when we leave, but the garbage in the kitchen pantry was full when we arrived
What sealed the deal though for us not returning to this location was seeing 20-25 bags of garbage in the garage - one of which appeared to have been torn open by an animal"
,,,Don’t book Lynn me an my family feels racially profiled and I will never be staying there again
