The location was perfect. Just a few blocks from downtown. If it wasn‚Äôt freezing out (we‚Äôre Floridians) we could have totally made the walk to local restaurants and shops. It is also a very nice, quiet neighborhood.
Her home supplied us with everything we could have possibility thought of. Fresh sheets, towels, full dish & silverware sets, crib for our baby, etc. It was all remarkably clean - the whole house!
Check-in process was easy and there were zero communication issues with Kelly or other hosts. She always quickly responded!

Kelly‚Äôs home very beautiful and nicely decorated. Kitchen was well organized and stocked with everything you need to cook a great home cooked meal with your own groceries of course. Upstairs attic is very spacious and comfortable aswell as private, if you have kids a great playroom with toys and a beautiful doll house. Bathroom in attic has a big tub to bath. Patio was beautifully light up and a great escape from the mesquites while still enjoying the cool night breeze. Highly recommend if hotels make you uncomfortable.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Highly recommend staying here when in Williston.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful! It is bright, well decorated, and incredibly spacious. The front porch is the perfect place to relax and step into the quiet. The hosts are so quick to respond and incredibly accommodating, they worked with us to get in prior to check in time so we could attend a big family function. The location is awesome.
However, she does note this is her primary residence, what isn't noted is that the fridge is so full of her stuff that you can't put anything in it and the house is full of personal things (including closets and dressers). There isn't anywhere to put your own things, as all surfaces are decorated or covered. There was even a loofah in the shower. It was very awkward and I truly felt like I was staying in someone's home, so we were never able to feel fully comfortable while we were there, because we didn't know what we could touch and use and what we couldn't.
Again, amazing host and home!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautifully decorated and centrally located property. Walkable to downtown shops and restaurants. I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the area. There is not a ton of storage for guests since this is Kelly's actual house and most cabinets and drawers are full of her things.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a very beautiful, well organized and stocked house! We were a party of 7, and there were many extra covers, pillows and sheets that our littles one could sleep on the cough. A spacious house, well taken care of and beautiful design. We can highly recommend this house!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our second stay was just as fabulous as our first. Kelly‚Äôs place is simply amazing!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd like to say I am not new to Airbnb. My
husband and I are regular renters of
Airbnb's on the West Coast. I must say
the pictures do not show how beautiful
and comfortable this home truly is. This
home should be featured in Dwell
Magazine. Besides the exquisite
furnishings, fixtures & linens, the beds
are heaven! I never once tossed and
turned throughout the night. 5 Star
accommodations! I cannot wait to book
this home again!"

2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a gorgeous house and clean. We were not prepared to not have any space for our own things though. The owners clothes were on the drawers. The bathroom was full her personal belongings. The kitchen had no space for our groceries. I‚Äôve stayed at several Airbnbs and this was a new and awkward experience for us. The tenant in the basement was a bit awkward as well since it‚Äôs an older house and every step is heard throughout the house. I can only imagine that our noises were probably obnoxious to them.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kelly is such a wonderful host who is quick to respond. She has this place perfectly decorated and it is STUNNING.

2018-05-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"First, Kellys home is lovely. The furnishings are comfortable and stylish, the sun room was delightful. The bed is so comfy! The location is perfect, close to Williston State College and downtown. Communication with Kelly/Jo was very prompt. There were a few bumps that I wasn't expecting such as no closet, dresser or hangers in the main bedroom, the dishwasher was broken, there was very little room in the refrigerator and for me- maybe not others the tenant in the basement threw me off just a bit as I could hear her so I assume she could hear me. Would I recommend Kelly's home? Yes, I believe she is going to address these few things to make her next guest's stay better. Enjoy!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly's home was absolutely stunning. You can tell she takes great pride in her home and surroundings. Communication was superb and responses within hours.

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was a treat to stay in such a beautiful, comfortable home that has such a great location and fantastic hosts! We highly recommend it.
There were just two of us, but it would still be very comfortable for 3-4 (one queen bed and one full, so it would depend whether 2 we're comfortable in a full or one in the full bed and one on the comfy couch) including that there is an extra sitting/TV area in the upstairs suite if someone wanted a little space to themselves."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kelly's home is beautiful and comfortable. The location is great (walking distance from downtown and from a nice park).

If you get a chance to stay at this gem in the middle of the Bakken!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Love the place as well as the hospitality! Juan has done an excellent job accommodating my needs for my extended stay. I've stayed a month at his location and plan to stay another month or as long as he'll let me while I'm on a temporary assignment for work. Everything in the house is immaculate and the master bedroom with the blackout curtains and comfy bed are perfect after a long day. I can't promote staying here enough. From the responsiveness of communication, ease of check in, flexibility on check in, and just the overall willing to work with you. You couldn't ask for a better host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and super understanding about being there for work

I would recommend this place to anyone! I cannot say enough good things about Juan and this home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property is absolutely pristine and a wonderful place to stay! The living space is large and luxurious and the separate sleeping area/bedrooms are great for larger parties or kiddos. The amenities are updated, clean, and upscale. These are things you‚Äôd like in your own home, which made it all the nicer to stay in. There‚Äôs an incredible attention to detail, from stainless steel cookware to soft towel, no detail went unnoticed.
Beyond that, Juan was such an incredible host. I truly cannot say enough about how attentive, responsive, and flexible he was with us. Extremely accommodating and kind, he allowed us to extend our stay when our circumstances changed! It made such a difference to us that he was so wonderful. I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone staying in Williston."

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,Really nice apartment extremely liked it but was trying to stay longer. The apartment was no longer available and wanted to move into a different apartment. Made several calls and finally got a response the day before we had to move
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a wonderful place to stay. It was 5 minutes from my son's house. Lamps would be nice it was dark. We are card players and book readers.The one thing that I missed when we stayed in other airbnbs is that they gave you ideas of places to eat, things to see, rules of the house in a binder. But if you'd ask me if I'd stay there again, I'd say yes."
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were unable to get a hold of Amelia at check in time to get our entry codes. We were three hours late getting into our room. We finally got a hold of her through text messages. She never returned a phone call they‚Äôre only 2 towels in the entire apartment no hand towels, towels, washcloth just one towel for each bathroom. The faucet in one bathroom was so loose on the sink. It moved all over. The worst part was unable to get a hold of Amelia at check in time. Supposedly she was traveling and out of service and that cost us a three hour delay, being able to get into our room and after a long day on the road, that‚Äôs not what you want"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The address is an apartment complex NOT a home- this should be made clear with directions.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The apartment is great. Extremely quiet and peaceful. The location is first floor so incredibly easy access from the front door. We did not hear any neighbors the entire 5 week stay. The place is literally next to a hallway and the gym. The amenities were great and expected. I highly recommend this place for even a weekend stay but especially for an extended stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful and clean apartment with plenty of room. Tastefully decorated. Could‚Äôve used kitchen seating at the counter and/or a kitchen table and a toaster but other than that it was perfect for our needs!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place at a good price
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything met my expectations
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good about Devin and his communication. To be fair, I didn't even make it in the room as my Mom is 80 and couldn't do the stairs (steep stairs as well) which were not in the listing. The surroundings were questionable...alot of smoking right outside the main door etc. Not a place I would feel comfortable at myself but would be a good deal for some. Devin was extremely helpful and gave me a full refund so I could find something elsewhere as we had been driving for two days in a snow storm. I would also like to add that everyone I came in contact with was very friendly. Although this didn't work out for myself, I can see where it would be a good deal for some."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To start off we gave the place 5 stars because it was clean, nice and you can't beat the price. The kitchen was fairly well equipped. Neighbors were nice.

We enjoyed the kitchen as she has kitchen electronics and spices. The living room is comfortable and very inviting for conversations , even if you are assigned in the kitchen you can still hear and be in conversation. It is closed to Restaurants and groceries. It is 1.5 to 3.5 hours drive going to North and South Dakota National Park. Elasha is great in communicating via BNB messages, text and phone call. You will feel at ease and comfortable that she will answer if you have queries. I recommend Elasha‚Äôs place."

The kids play area downstairs was a delight to see as we had not packed any toys for our littles. There are 6 spacious bedrooms, plenty of room to spread out and lots of spaces to come together and enjoy your time. It was exceptionally clean and welcoming. The hosts communicated quickly and we never had any issues. If you are looking for a treat away from home this is the place. 5 minutes from anything you could need in town and located in a beautiful family friendly neighborhood on a cul-de-sac. We look forward to our return next year."
