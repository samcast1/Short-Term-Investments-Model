The cottage is a short walk to downtown and many local parks. It has everything you could want and then some. Comfortable for 2 adults, it is clean and cozy. We love the 2 parking spaces(one big enough to fit our one ton truck) and spacious locked and fenced back porch where we were able to store 4 bikes and still have space for grilling lounging and eating outside. Towels are fluffy , water pressure is strong, there is the cutest tub I have ever seen, bed is comfortable and the internet is fast and consistent. The washer and dryer work well and quickly!

The Cottage was clean, bright and well stocked for any type of cooking (incuding spices). Towels and bedding was luxurious, including the snuggly handmade quilts that I used often on the leather couch. The appliances were large capacity and worked well, including the full sized washer and dryer downstairs. Julie & Mike provided every comfort needed to stay a day or a month. Including hand soap, dish & dishwasher soap, lots of dishes, glasses w/wine glasses, silverware, pots/pans/cookie sheet/ blender, coffee pot and a full Humming Bird feeder for your bird watching. They also provide picnic items for having your lunch under the Grape Arbor. Festive lights on a timer make the magic come alive in the evening.

I would recommend this Airbnb to others if planning a trip to Albany!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting friends in Albany, Oregon and were looking at hotels for lodging. The only choices were close to highway 5 which is noisy and would have been kind of spartan and commercial. We decided to look at AirBnB and were pleasantly surprised at what we found. There were two places listed for Albany and the listing of Julie and Mike stood out over the other place for several reasons. First of all it was a better deal because of their more reasonable cleaning fee. The other was the charm of the cottage and the privacy that it provided. Because we were able to park beside the house in its own driveway it felt more like we were part of the neighborhood rather than intruders.
Instructions for accessing the key were straightforward and easy and when we walked in it was such a beautiful little cottage with a fully functional kitchen, lots of suggestions for local restaurants and eateries, activities, places to visit, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

When we arrived, AC and music was already on to welcome us. (there was a heat wave that weekend and the house was nice and cool!) Hosts provides some water and yogurt as a welcome gift. She also has a nice folder of recommendations. House is located in a very safe area but walls are thin and the neighbors rise early so no sleeping in if you are a light sleeper like me. Kitchen and Bedrooms were very clean. Bed is on the harder side but not uncomfortable. Very nice bedding and bath towels. Overall wonderful stay in Albany and we recommend this house to anyone!

The house is old but clean and in a safe neighborhood. As my wife said ""it's cute."" It had everything they needed and the beds were comfortable. When a can opener was broken, the hosts immediately bought a new one. When there were no wash cloths, the hosts immediately brought some over. They checked every day to make sure everything was A-OK.

My fianc√© and I enjoyed how quiet the area was especially at night. Albany was a nice go between Salem and Portland which we also enjoyed exploring. The neighbor‚Äôs cat, Hobbes, is especially a sweet addition to staying here. He kept us company every day and demanded constant pets whenever we went outside.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My co-worker and I ended up trying to go into the wrong door which was to the main house, but other than that little hiccup the whole experience was good. The room was comfortable and very clean. Loved the shower, but couldn't enjoy the tub with it being glass French doors into the living space and a co-worker vs significant other in the next room. I think couples and small families would love the space. Parking was interesting because we ended up parked in front of the neighbors house instead of the place we were staying as there were several vehicles parked on the street out front. It worked for us and we enjoyed out stay."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"New addition to their home - very well done!
Sandy and her husband very accommodating!
The neighborhood was quiet and the guest unit surprisingly wonderful given the very average houses.
The new side gate was a little hard to open so need to give a good push."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space with top of the line appliances in the kitchen. Bathroom was spacious. Comfy bed and couch with sleeper. Only comment is the kitchen window does not have a blind and the patio light from the main house kept shining into the den area where my daughter was on the sleeper sofa. But other than it is the best equipped and spacious AirBNB we have stayed at for the fee.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice cottage. Well appointed and modern.
Our only complaint was the air conditioning. Very loud and didn‚Äôt keep us as cool as we would have liked. In Sandra‚Äôs defense- it was an extremely hot day.
It was also a little smaller than what I expected. Comfortable for two and perhaps a child. But we were three adults and felt like we were on top of one another."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy space tucked into an older neighborhood. Worked well for us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sandra's place was super clean and perfect for a stay with our toddler.
There was a small hiccup trying to find the place since our navigation kept sending us to a different location that had the same street. We loved that a kitchen, bathroom, bathtub, backyard was available just for us. Our only suggestion will be for the owner to place some kind of shade or curtain on the kitchen window since you could see the owners kitchen window too, which ended up taking away some of the privacy. We had to put a small blanket up in order to feel more comfortable. Other than that, it was one of our favorite Airbnbs that we have stayed at, plus there are plenty of stores near if needed to do some quick shopping."

2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our group of nine women pushed the limits of the sleeping accommodations‚Äîespecially since none of us wanted to share a bed. But we got by just fine. Several of us brought sleeping bags and pads. (All of us are members of an outdoor club so are accustomed to camping out.)
One gal set up her tent in the back yard, another slept in her portable reclining patio chair on the back deck. We used the cot provided at the house, and I brought an additional cot and pad for myself, which I set up in the Master bedroom.
Everyone loved the spaciousness and cleanliness of the house. The backyard and deck are lovely. Several people brought camp chairs to use outside (per my suggestion since there are only two chairs on the deck), and we found it very pleasant indeed, to sit outside.
There were so many choices of nice places to gather and visit and share snacks both inside and outside the house. At the same time the bedrooms upstairs provided quiet space for anyone who wanted to drop out and rest. It was ideal for our group.
We were very pleased to find that there are three bathrooms: A half bath downstairs in addition to the two full bathrooms on the second floor.
Several people chose to walk to and from the Hot Air Balloon Festival, rather than deal with the crowded parking lots near Timber Linn Park. Having the Festival venue within walking distance was a definite plus for us.
If we decide to do the Balloon Festival again next year, we will definitely want to rent Henk‚Äôs house!"

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing , comfortable , spacious home. We had to stay in Albany for court purposes and although the week events we had to attend were stressful, there was nothing better than looking forward to going back to the place you are staying, away from home.
There were so many welcoming touches to the house.
Hell was very responsive and accommodated to all of our needs.
I recommend this home to any and everyone interested. I know we will definitely be staying here again if we are ever in the area."

We didn't see the him at all during our stay. However, his communication with us was prompted, should I have needed anything. We will definitely be using his place again!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location in Albany (near the freeway, but without the freeway noise!!). Big house with lots of room and very comfortable. We felt right at home. If we end back in Albany we will surely stay here again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is everything it says and more. Best air b&b I‚Äôve stayed in so far. Hot tub was so perfect. The kitchen had such sweet and smart things to make the stay perfect.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. About 10 minutes from town. Very comfortable house and the kitchen was stocked with anything you would need.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Deborah was very kind & responsive with any questions we had. The house was clean, cozy, warm and peaceful. We really enjoyed the kitchen and floor plan of the home!
My only comment would be for the water heater to be turned up, the water in the shower could‚Äôve been warmer. We will definitely stay here again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay during Thanksgiving was great. We felt at home. Everything was cleaned. The bedrooms were really spacious.
We were warned by Mary that because this was the basement, we would hear people from upstairs. We were fine with it. We did have an issue, with a different family checking in upstairs, on our last night there. It sounded like the kids were gonna fall through the ceiling and land in our laps from jumping üòÇ No big deal though. We just knocked on the front door and politely asked them to keep it down. The family was really nice and apologized.
We would definitely stay there again. üòä"

Cozy little get away!
I loved it!
Cyndi Sweet!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's house is delightful. We stayed in the two-bedroom basement unit and it was very helpful for our visit to nearby Oregon State in Corvallis. Depending on traffic, it is a 20-30 minute drive but easy to navigate. Mary's place was clean and well appointed. There are just two things to be aware of, which are that it is below another unit and noise from upstairs is very audible, and the ceilings are very low. I am only 6' 1"" but I hit my head a few times not being used to the low ceilings and door jams. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice apartment. Well maintained, clean and quiet."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Really nice place as are all of Mary‚Äôs units. Great host and great communication. The only downside is that it is a basement unit and there is a fair bit of noise transmitted downstairs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great cozy place to stay! Everything was super simple and went smoothly.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The outside of the house was very pretty and the driveway was right next to where we stayed which made unloading the car much easier. The inside is very bright and clean and every amenity was awesome. The beds are very comfy. we had a great stay and I'd stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute decor, clean, air conditioning works very well, Mary communicates well."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Mary's place was in a central location for our needs. It was clean and comfortable. Mary was very accomodating.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow. This is probably the cleanest AirBNB I‚Äôve stayed in. Great and easy to access location. We stopped in Albany purely because of where it was on our road trip route but it turned out to be an adorable little town that reminded me a whole lot of the little Nebraska town I grew up in. The downtown was great and we had breakfast at Margin Coffee Roasters, which was incredible. Can‚Äôt say I had high expectations for Albany, but I know Ill be back in the future and have a great place to stay! We did have some issues with noise but in fairness, I didn‚Äôt notify the hosts until the next day and I don‚Äôt think that the other guests were doing anything usual, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm a very light sleeper. That said, the response from Mary was very helpful and I greatly appreciate her attitude. Thank you for a delightful stay! I hope we can stay longer next time :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love the comfort, cleanliness and hospitality Mary always gives my family! She understands hosting to a T and goes well out of her way to be kind and accommodating."
2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Appears nice, just like photos. And could‚Äôve been a great place, except for the VERY strong pet odor. The host said no pets had stayed there recently, but that didn‚Äôt change the fact that it smelled like cat & the odor wasn‚Äôt easy to get used to. One bed was good, the other too soft/uncomfortable. There are just enough dishes to get by for one meal, so if you are staying for more than one night you‚Äôll be washing dishes between meals."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot to call home for the week I was in town visiting family.
Having a full kitchen so well equipped was a great bonus!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful surroundings and welcoming. Everything needed was provided. Would stay again

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and relaxing Hope to stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay at this house. I really liked the layout. I was a little cold during the night and couldn‚Äôt turn up the heater but other than that it was a great stay.
2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"Pots and pans are greasy, kitchen towels are raged and stained. Grey bathroom rugs were dirty.
House was always cold, never really warmed up.
Basement unit not well insulated and can hear all noise from upstairs. The pool table noise and the party atmosphere is not conducive for the basement renters at ALL. Quiet hours do not mean quiet hours. I had to call the police twice to get the noise settled down.
Not enought blankets for the beds.
Kitchen stove is really dirty and the pans are awkward to use.
So many decorations on all tables not able to use the space well.
I would never rent from this host again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We live in the area and rented this unit for an anniversary ""staycation."" This space was exactly as pictured, but felt even more spacious in person. The ceilings are a little low (my husband had to watch his head in the bedroom doorways), but the entire unit is light and airy and extremely tastefully decorated. Did not feel small or tight to us! Beds were very comfortable and all instructions were clear and easy to follow. Delicious coffee was provided and this unit is close to downtown amenities. Excellent stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Clean and comfortable. Easy access to Corvallis.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, and conveniently located."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a little chilly and I left my winter jacket on inside but it seemed warmer in the morning.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice stay, close enough to everything but very little traffic noise. Mary was helpful and prompt with her responses and assistance! The only drawbacks were loud upstairs neighbors and I couldn‚Äôt control the heat. Otherwise a very nice weekend stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little place. I really enjoyed my stay, loved that there was a full kitchen and stuff that I could use to cook. My friend and I both truly enjoyed out trip. would 100% rent from them again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thank you so much for the Awesome place. Perfect place to stay.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very cute and tastefully decorated. It was a basement apartment, that I didn‚Äôt realize it would be. Because of it being in the basement, we did hear all the movements from the people upstairs. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars was because of the heating. The thermostat is controlled by the people upstairs or remotely. Mary did tell me however, that it is a new heating/cooling unit and she realized that there were a few kinks to work out. All in all, our stay was wonderful, and I would recommend to my friends."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary's place was excellent! Immaculately clean, a ton of spice and lots of thoughtful amenities. Mary was in good communication and ensured we had everything we needed. A great value for a Ducks game!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Immaculate apartment in a great location, with lots of amenities provided (paper towels, spices, shampoo, body wash, and even laundry pods!). Mary communicated frequently to ensure that we had everything we needed."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I have stayed at many Airbnbs and several in Albany. Mary in my opinion has the best and cleanest in Albany. If she has an available unit for your stay you should take it!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary‚Äôs place is so clean and comfortable! We loved the location and Mary was so kind and communicated throughout the stay. Perfect little spot for a weekend getaway.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a comfortable stay. kitchen had everything I needed. TV had more than I wanted. Wifi was fast Bedrooms were large. I enjoyed chatting with Mary

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely top notch communication! We loved the apartment. It was very comfortable, clean, and a pleasure to visit."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you again Mary for opening your beautiful home to us. Our first and only for now AirBnB experience. Audra and I are new lovers who met up in Albany and stayed in the home for two wonderful nights together. We both commented on how we could live as nice at home and now someday we probably will buy a historical home in Albany and settle down there and grow old together. It had a very homely feel that was incredibly comfortable for us. It's likely you'll be seeing my name again as we will probably make renting this property a regular thing for us as we continue to grow this incredible love we've found with one another.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our needs :) loved the rooms next to each other perfect for my little kids
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for everything. The place has everything. My only recommendation is to get darker curtains for the living room and a curtain for the door. I am big in privacy and security. Aside from that, everything was perfect."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were delighted with the flat. Walking distance to old town Albany in a very quiet and charming neighborhood. We found Mary to be an excellent communicator. The unit was very clean and comfortable. The king size beds were very comfortable. Enough dishes and other stuff for most kitchen projects.
All in all, we strongly recommend this airbnb offering."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy check in great parking and a very good stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay. quiet street, close to a multimodal travel hub"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at this amazing little gem in Albany. It was perfectly located not too far from OSU to drop our daughter off at school with great coffee shops, restaurants and one of the best farmer's markets within walking distance of the house. We loved the Ginza Japanese Restaurant nearby and they had incredible sushi. We really enjoyed that we could walk downtown and get around Albany and shopping so easily. Communication with the host was timely and incredible. We would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Albany or Corvallis."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary and her husband Lonny amazing thoughtful hosts. They go out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable. Everything was clean and the decor is so well thought out and executed. It‚Äôs such a cute place.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a hidden gem in Downtown Albany! It's the perfect distance from everything within town, and also not too far from Corvallis. The place is cozy, clean, and in such a great location. The kitchen was equipped with everything you could think of, even the bathroom!
There's a washer and dryer in the unit which I found very useful. The place was very clean and neat and is definitely such a cute spot. Mary and her partners were amazing at communicating throughout the whole stay. They checked in with me the next day to see if everything was going well, and if I had any questions, they would respond right away.
Everything was pleasant! If you get see the chance to stay here, you should take it! It's a cute little place and the ladies are amazing as well."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this home, extremely clean , had everything and more that I needed. Felt at home and a nice location. Was very quite and relaxing . Definitely will be back , thank you again for the nice comfortable stay Mary :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and the hosts were very communicative! We only stayed for the night but it was a perfect pit stop on our trip!
The door was a bit tricky to find because we came in the middle of the night, but there was a note in the directions that we missed!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Was nice walking through the neighborhood to downtown, so many beautiful old homes. The place was cute and super clean. Would differently stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is cozy and lovely! The beds were so comfortable and warm. The decor is charming. There is plenty of parking and it is near to everything you‚Äôd want to do in downtown Albany. My daughter and I spent a lot of time at the park, the museums, and the carousel. It is well worth the money! We will stay again for sure."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, super clean, decoration is awesome and the rooms great. It has Everything you need during your stay. A little noisy and cold when the floor above is occupied. Mary is super great host"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really great accommodation. Easy check-in, check-out, timely info- these folks run a well-oiled machine. However - if you are a tall person not used to navigating short doorways, this place is NOT for you. You will hurt yourself. Maybe check out another of their properties, as they do a nice job."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very nice place, we enjoyed our time here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice room, clean, basement, cool"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Cozy, clean, and well-decorated. Plus Mary was great to work with!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy (and cool in the summer) space. Well stocked and decorated. Really comfortable beds and a great little kitchen. Can be a little loud if you have boisterous upstairs neighbors. Hosts are very attentive and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and clean!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return if we find ourselves in Albany again. Great downtown location‚Ä¶very stylish and comfortable home with all the conveniences of home! Thank you Mary!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mary's place is very nice - everything is top notch and beautifully appointed.
Something very minor to be aware of is the lower height of the doorways into the bedrooms. Communication with Mary was very good from the first to the checkout instructions. We would stay again if we are in the area"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary‚Äôs place was lovely and new. Very clean and well put together. She was great at communicating. Would definitely stay again when in Albany.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot! The basement unit was very clean, had good space (2 good-sized bedrooms, kitchen, living area, full bathroom) well equipped, and nicely decorated. Door frames are lower than standard - so watch your head! The new A/C keeps if very cool in this unit. Easy walk to historic area in Albany including good restaurants, coffee shops, antique shops, and fun clothing stores."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Affordable and well-appointed. Five stars definitely for the host Mary and her efforts. A few drawbacks/suggestions for future guests:
- if you are a tall person, note the doorways/soffits are very short
- if you are sensitive to climate, the controls are governed by upstairs unit
- if you are sensitive to noise, you may hear the guests upstairs
otherwise, Mary has thought of everything and I would recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful, cozy space. We loved it."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a lately renovated basement apartment. Everything is new and clean.
The communication with Mary was great too."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean space in a nice part of town. Close to everything!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice clean place. Just like the pictures. Great communication
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a (brand new & renovated) basement appartement, very nice decorated with two comfy king beds. Basically all is available, with a nice kitchen en bathroom. The house itself is about 100 years old and looks amazing. As it‚Äôs a basement appartement the ceilings are rather low so be carefull :).
I give 3 stars for 2 main reasons; first of all because the upper house and the level of noise. We were very lucky that there were just two older guests staying upstairs instead of e.g. 6 people, but even then, it‚Äôs very noisy and you can hear basically everything. Just to keep in mind. Second, suddenly the air conditioning downstairs started to blow strongly, and it seems thats connected/controlled by the upper house. This is something that really should be divided in one way or another. Further, and just a note, and not sure if that was mentioned in the info, they ask for a parking fee for the big driveway, or else, ask you to park 15 feet away (which is free). It‚Äôs not about the money itself, but why ask for a fee and don‚Äôt offer that as a service as there is plenty of space, both on the driveway and on the street.
If the upper house is empty, I would go again, if not, I would hesitate."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Mary‚Äôs! Absolutely everything we needed; cozy and clean; wonderful location; and super easy to check in and out!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mary's place is a charming little basement apartment. It is relatively cool for the warm summer weather, and is easy to access! Modern amenities and old-fashioned hospitality made this stay a wonderful experience! We would happily return to this rental!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed one night here and would recommend it to other travelers! Mary is a great host and the amenities were all great! Since it is a very nicely remodeled basement (with windows etc) it even is a little bit colder on hot days. (In a good way!) Just a heads up that there are people above you, they were quiet and everything went fine but we could hear them walking around etc."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very beautiful Airbnb. We loved staying here and appreciated finding a place for our pet to stay, too."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic Apartment
Exactly as pictured. The apartment is detached from the home. The entrance and windows face out on a pasture. You are given total privacy. Designated parking spot. Lots of thoughtful touches and great facilities: Keurig cups, oatmeal, breakfast bars, spice rack, very comfortable bed, grill, outdoor table with chairs on porch, excellent washer and dryer, great shower. I stayed for a month until I found an apartment but literally wanted to use this Airbnb as my apartment. Great example of efficiently using space.
Location is so convenient if you are visiting OSU. Great for parents coming to visit a student. Can have your son/daughter over for a home cooked meal and do their laundry!

Best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed at."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would recommend!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather‚Äôs place is a breathtaking little spot, far away enough from the busy city life. It was clean, cozy and we will be returning there in the future. 10/10 hostess!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can‚Äôt imagine a better experience. Perfect in every way!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was absolutely perfect! I loved this guesthouse. I stayed for a few days to visit my student at OSU. Heather was perfectly communicative and was very helpful when I thought I'd booked three nights but had only booked two (oops). Her flexibility was much appreciated.
The coffee game was high with a frother! Two percent was perfect for the frother.
The place was plenty roomy for my daughter and I and it was very clean.
Your view looks across farmland and provided a nice relief from the craziness of downtown..
The washer and dryer came in handy for muddy knees.
The place is conveniently located less than 10 minutes from Corvallis and faces away from the main house, so it is private and peaceful. She'll have the string lights on for your arrival, making it very festive.
The kitchen is very well-supplied with instant pot, pots, slow cooker, mixer. Plenty of servingware."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This cozy apartment was a home away from home. It's far enough outside of the city to be surrounded by green fields, but close enough that everything's within a short drive.
It is perfectly equipped and had everything my heart desired: a generously furnished kitchen (with sharp knives, a mixer, blender, crockpot and, best of all, a generous spice rack), a comfy bed and a comfy couch. It also offers a good workplace with an ergonomic chair and reliable, fast WiFi.
Heather was quick to respond to any questions we had and helped us wherever she could.
I will definitely be staying here again if and when I return to Corvallis."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I were very comfortable at Heather‚Äôs place. She has equipped the kitchen with enough spices and cutlery to satisfy a competent cook. Sadly, we did not stay long enough to make a meal. The surrounds are very quiet, you won‚Äôt be disturbed by road noise or loud music. The neighbor‚Äôs cows may gaze at you inquisitively, but that‚Äôs about it. We slept well here."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Riverside Guesthouse is a great cozy place for a getaway. As the description says, it's small but cozy for 2 adults. Might be too small for 4 adults but we had our 2 daughters and it was perfect.
Don't let the size fool you though, it has all the amenities you could need for your stay. It is centrally located to so much in the Willamette Valley. Would definitely recommend it. Heather was also quick to answer any question we had but we felt quite comfortable at our place."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for a trip to Corvallis! Quiet very helpful hosts! A+!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this guesthouse. Stayed for a few days to visit my student at OSU and it was perfect. All the extra little touches in the kitchen and bath were wonderful and just added to the enjoyable stay. It was super clean, facing away from the main house towards a field with a wonderful porch and table with chairs to enjoy my morning coffee. I can't wait to have a reason to stay again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a real gem of a stay. Heather's family has created an extremely comfortable and well appointed guest house, just outside Corvallis (easy access to I5 and Albany) From the full-kitchen, comfortable furnishings, perfect Internet connection, and communication, I can't think of anything important I'd change. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a great weekend here! The guesthouse is conveniently located not even 10 minutes down the road from Corvallis. the entrance faces away from the main house and onto the farm behind the property, which makes it super private and peaceful. The inside was spotlessly clean, and had almost everything you could need - fully stocked kitchen with some extra snacks, toiletries and other items which were much appreciated. The latte/cappuccino maker is awesome too. I would definitely stay here again for all the amenities and the close proximity to Corvallis! Great place."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this is a great place to stay and has everything you need! super cozy and in a great place to drive to nearby towns
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a very brief stay here on NYE. It was super clean and the space is very functional for its size.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brand new and modern style guest house, all the appliances are sparkling cleaning and functioning very well. 5 mins driving to Corvallis city and you could find many restaurants there. The sofa bed is really comfortable BTW."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at this guesthouse. It was so cozy, cute, super clean and isolated. You‚Äôll get a cute view away from the Main Street and it felt like we were just to ourselves. Amazing & comfy guesthouse, we would definitely stay here again instead of getting a hotel."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We wish we would have found this place when our first two kids attended OSU. Super clean in a peaceful setting. Heather had everything set up for us when we got there. We travel a lot and love it when the owner takes pride in their place by adding little touches. We will definitely stay again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic place to stay! I spent a month here and loved it. The hosts are a super nice young couple with two adorable kids.
The rental is in their backyard, close to their house, but you never hear a thing from them! The whole setup is very private, including your own separate parking space. A motion detector turns on lights for you as you head down the path from your car to the cottage.
Perfect for safety conscious solo travelers, nice and secure. Safe privacy.
This is between Albany and Corvallis, but closer to Corvallis. Less than ten minutes to downtown, less than 15 to campus. Easy access to go to games or other OSU events.
The kitchen is very well supplied. I loved the frother on the Keurig, had never used one of those, made lattes most days, and they provide a huge spice rack loaded with flavors. The kitchen is def complete.
Bed is comfortable and, again, nice and quiet.
The shower/bathroom is very nice, as well. They did a great job with the remodel.
And oh yeah, the front porch! Loved it. Great place to sit and chill in your private space. Yes, this is a nice setup.
Would absolutely stay here again, probably will!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Heather is an excellent host. She went above and beyond by putting out some toys and providing a pack n play for my son. Her place is very clean and the kitchen is fully stocked. The appliances and furniture are great quality. I definitely recommend this place.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guesthouse was absolutely perfect. Clean, organized, thoughtfully designed, and had everything you could need for a short or long term stay. Heather was very accommodating and communicative when we asked to extend our stay 1 more night. She had someone else coming the afternoon the new day we wanted to check out and it was easy to coordinate everything so it worked out for all of us. Also, the guesthouse was sooooo cute and spacious! They made good use of the space and it was very enjoyable staying here. I hope we can stay here and visit the area again soon."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at this beautiful place! Quiet, serene views and perfect for our time passing through Corvallis. My wife and I stayed with our two nieces and even though it was cozy with four of us it worked out great for one night.

Heather was very communicative and everything was clean and well put together. Highly recommend. And would absolutely stay here again!"

We were actually able to see her in person when we arrived, as we pulled up at the same time. Very friendly and so accomodating! Such a great host.
As for the apartment itself, it was absolutely wonderful. Everything was so beautiful and pristine and it was laid out nicely. The host really has thought of everything you would ever need during your stay! I think it was one of the most well-appointed and stocked places that we have ever stayed in. I can't think of a single thing that could be done better!
We were beyond comfortable in this space, which was such a welcome relief after a long travel day. It cannot be recommended enough! Should we come back through the area, we would love to stay for more than one night."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heather‚Äôs place is definitely a great and relaxing place. She really provided a lot of extra touches that makes you feel special. Thanks.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Air BnBs I've ever stayed in, attention to detail and upscale fixings make Heather's place one to return to, highly recommend. No complaints could be made about her home."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Heather is amazing. The experience was so good, I‚Äôm not sure where to start.
I stayed at the guesthouse with my girlfriend for about a month. I had never stayed at an Airbnb that long so I was a bit nervous, but all that disappeared once we met her and stepped foot in the place. It was stylish, clean (like whoa), and the most of all well thought out. Privacy? Check. Kitchen with a range? Check. Washer & dryer? Check. I mean it was like living in a fully furnished tiny home with all the amenities we could think of. Heather asked us even before we arrived, if there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôd like set up. She followed up several times making sure our stay was comfortable, always letting us know ahead of time when things might become noisy (yard work etc). It never became that loud, but we appreciated the excellent communication.
The bonus for us was the view. The front porch faces a very large open field, and we‚Äôd frequently see neighboring cows hang out, grazing on the grass. They were super friendly and curious. Having lived most of my life in the cities, the countryside was so refreshing that I often sat there with a cup of tea just looking out. And even though the guesthouse is located close to the nature, it is only 10 minutes away from a vibrant college town with local restaurants, shopping, etc.
If you‚Äôre interested in experiencing peace and quiet while having access to cities, this is THE place. We can‚Äôt recommended it enough!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very clean and well appointed space for a small group. Helpful information and quick communication. Feeling of own space even though close to main house. Great location outside of Corvallis. Tremendous value for the quality of stay. Highly recommend!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather‚Äôs place is a very cute little house. It‚Äôs pretty small, so I wouldn‚Äôt try to bring a lot of people. I went with just myself and one other person. As far as the house itself, it is very cute and has all the things you could possibly need for your stay. Including coffee and some snacks! The details are very thoughtful and heather is a great host. She makes sure you have everything you need and is quick to respond! Check in is made very simple without any host contact which makes it very Covid safe. If you want a cute little quiet spot with the ability to drive and explore the towns a little bit, this is the place for you! I highly recommend it."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little guest house. We had a fantastic time and would definitely book the space again!
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space! Heather was very accommodating. The space was very clean and organized.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Seriously the best BnB we‚Äôve ever stayed in! Everything was immaculate. The extra touches for Christmas were so cute and thoughtful. Make sure you stay here if you‚Äôre ever in the Corvallis area.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This house was perfect for us! And Heather was the perfect host! My wife and I stayed here for two weeks so that we could quarantine before visiting my mother (who is immunocompromised) for Christmas. Heather contacted us before our stay to make sure the place was stocked with everything we'd need, even asking us what kinds of K-cups and shower toiletries we prefer. She bought a spice rack so that we would have spices to cook with. When we arrived, we were surprised and deeply touched by the holiday decorations they put up for us, including a Christmas tree on the porch, lights, a wreath, and two stockings with our names on them. This definitely put us in the Christmas spirit! We felt so welcome here. Everything inside also reflected Heather's personal touch, from holiday mugs to popcorn and snacks for us. The decor is modern yet warm. All of the appliances are up-to-date and worked great. The wifi was strong enough for my wife and I to have simultaneous Zoom work meetings. We enjoyed watching Netflix on the large TV. We could not have asked for a better place to stay these two weeks and we consider ourselves so lucky to have found the Stay at the Riverside Guesthouse. We are very grateful for their generosity and hospitality! Very highly recommended!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean space. Heather was very responsive and attentive to any needs. We look forward to staying here again in the future.

The house is just beautiful. It felt like a home away from home. We spent hours in the morning, sitting on the beautiful porch, drinking coffee and watching the ducks.

When we arrived there were fresh flowers, fresh towels, a delicious supply of coffee and tea and tokens to ride the carousel! Joyce was such a gracious host working with us prior to our stay as our guest numbers shifted up then down. She was always quick to reply to communications and provided great information for our arrival. We had a lovely stay enjoying the covered porch, the ducks floating in the canal and walking around the historic district and witnessing springs beautiful arrival. The kitchen was well stalked with what we needed to make beautiful meals to share together. We also enjoyed a cozy fire and great conversation in the living room. Beds were all very comfortable and each rooms was well appointed. There was also ample parking. We will definitely stay with Joyce again when we return to Albany."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have been using Airbnb as a guest for several years, all over the world, and I have never experienced such generous hospitality as we felt this past week at Joyce's gorgeous home. Sadly, the reason for our trip was the heartbreaking funeral of a dear family member. So Joyce, knowing this, went grocery shopping for us, so that when we arrived the kitchen was stocked with granola, fruit, chocolates, snacks, and coffee, etc. It was such a touching gesture, we were all very grateful. The house is so lovely, the living room is so cozy with the wood burning stove and comfy sofas. The kitchen is exceptionally well stocked. The bedrooms are beautiful, and the beds so comfy. On the morning of the funeral, we woke up to snow, so stepping out onto that fabulous front porch to see the small canal out front of the house, under snow covered trees, with the little ducks happily swimming... well, it just seemed like something out of a fairy tale. We are super grateful for Joyce's kindness."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joyce was incredibly accommodating and responsive during a family medical emergency. The house, and Joyce, was incredibly hospitable to us in our time of need."

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This a a charming house in a beautiful neighborhood. It was perfect for our family and some friends while we were in town for my sons wedding. The house was well stocked with nice soaps and shampoo. The beds were all super comfy and there was enough room for the wedding party to come for breakfast.
We loved having coffee on the front porch with the ducks across the street. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book this house!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"I don't know where to start! The Hewitt House is simply amazing. A couple members of our party were raised in craftsman house's so it brought back some great memories for them. The small canal in the front with ducks was charming. The location was superb, 4-5 blocks, to everything you would want to do in Historic Downtown Albany. There is plenty of parking at the house, so leave the cars at home and walk. Although, if it's a challenge for you to walk, parking was never an issue downtown. We were fortunate to come on the weekend of the Antique & Car Show, plus there were a plethora of garage sales! If you enjoy wine, I suggest you book a wine tasting at the Willamette Valley Winery. Simply fascinating & divine! Joyce and her team work hard to provide not only a beautiful place to stay but a clean & comfortable one as well. Bravo Joyce, Bravo!"

We enjoyed our weekend with friends and would return to this house the next time we are in the area. Thank you for making our stay so comfortable."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5‚≠êÔ∏è
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"An old home in a quiet, old neighbourhood. When you climb the eight steps to the front door, you are subjected to a pile of the neighbor's junk immediately to your left. Ugh.
Fortunately, while sitting on the rocking chairs or the swing chair on the front porch, the junk pile is not visible.
We slept well in the room with a king size bed. Each bedroom has it's own air conditioner. It's a quiet area at night. Close enough to downtown to easily walk there.
The interior of the main living space is dark, walls are painted in dark blue with dark wood trim and wood floors. However, there are two large windows which add light.
The squeaky wood floors throughout the house are either quaint or annoying. And the mish-mash of eating utensils in the kitchen, all of poor quality, need to be upgraded.
If you have not read the section in the listing described as ""hosted by Joyce"" be sure to do so. It is there you will find that there is a person living in the home. Sera lives downstairs, described as an ""attached apartment"". We met her twice in our five night stay, she was very friendly. In fact, she was helpful in resolving a nuisance light on the exterior of the house, next to the bedroom window, which comes on at dusk and off at dawn. A very bright light which made sleep difficult. Sera and Joyce were unable to turn off the light. But Sera did adjust the setting to turn on with motion sensor.
The home is listed as ""waterfront"". There is a small, concrete canal in front of the house, about eight feet wide and a foot deep. I don't call that waterfront."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was amazing. The house is comfortable and so conveniently located to anything needed - Costco, Fred Meyers, gas stations, restaurants, drug store‚Ä¶
My 90+ year old parents were with us and they loved it. Main floor bedroom and bath were perfect for them. Joyce was such a gracious host, easy to communicate with and answered all of our questions."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"First of all the house was lovely. The online photos accurately depicted the all of the rooms. The backyard was a beautiful surprise and the porch rocking chairs and swing made for a relaxing end to the day after the excitement of WCH22 in Eugene.
All of the rooms were nicely appointed with towels in baskets ready for use. The kitchen had all necessary appliances and accessories that made food prep a breeze.
Sera and Joyce were always timely in response to any inquiries.
Although we didn't get to tour Albany, we did take time to take a spin on the beautiful carousel and visit Midway Farm.
Thank you Joyce and Sera for making our first trip to Oregon comfortable and memorable."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house with a lovely porch! Everything was very clean and communication was very easy. A great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful, historic home set in a unique and quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed watching the ducks and ducklings in the small stream out front from the comforts of the porch swing. The home was comfortable, spacious, and very clean. The hosts have organized it well and we found everything we needed for our stay. We attended the World's Track and Field competition in Eugene and all felt the short drive was well worth it to stay in such a welcoming environment."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was perfect for our stay! A few friends and I were visiting from out of state to compete in an Ironman which was held in Salem. While it was 30 min outside of Salem, it was worth the drive.
The home was clean and neat. Each room was decorated nicely and the beds had ample pillows and nice sheets. ((in many air bb the quality of sheets and towels are lacking)). Additionally each room had a basket of towels which were high quality.
The kitchen was stocked with all the dishes and cups we needed. The breakfast nook was a great spot to have our morning oatmeal pre race.
The front porch was the perfect spot to have our morning coffee/tea or just relax in the evening. The stream across the street was soothing and was perfect to add to the serenity. We met a few neighbors who were so friendly!
Overall our stay was perfect and I'd highly recommend the home. Joyce was a pleasure to work with as well, very communicative!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely old home on a beautiful street, small canal and ducks in front. Great for children and the perfect spot to venture out to central town or walk around the historic area. We loved lighting the fireplace!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay in this charming older home in the historic part of downtown. All was great except there is no air conditioning on the upper floor. It was an unusually warm weekend so it was rather uncomfortable for those of us staying on the top floor. Other than that it was as advertised and we enjoyed it. Quiet neighborhood, good location, great beds (very comfortable!), comfortable home ‚Ä¶ we would definitely stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We feel so lucky to have landed this home for our family gathering! It was a perfect distance from Corvallis for graduation and really felt like we were gathering at our own families home to celebrate.

I had forgotten to bring mine and was elated to find a charger on the bedside nightstand. Lori is super friendly, thoughtful and very responsive. The place was cool upon my arrival (she had turned on the air conditioner) and much appreciated after a long hot day of driving.
Lori is pretty much the perfect hostess and her carriage house is hands down the best Airbnb I've stayed at. I highly recommend her place and would definitely stay again. It's truly a home away from home.

Lori has this place set up just like going to your friends home. There was nothing we needed that she didn‚Äôt have set up.

Loved having separation between bedroom upstairs and kitchen / living room downstairs. Truly enjoyed Lori's restaurant recommendations. Devoured yummy vermicelli noodles and turmeric chai at Ba's Vietnamese Comfort Food. Met my cousin's at cozy Oregon Home Foods and ate delicious tacos. Also appreciated instant yogurt and snack options for breakfast in the morning. Great selection of tea bags and Keurig coffees. Wished that I could have stayed longer to enjoy this peaceful respite."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I adore this guest house and the family who owns it and lives next door. It is a great, peaceful, and slow paced neighborhood in walking distance to the old downtown and river.
If you are sensitive to noise, like me, you may want a noise machine overnight because the train horns can be heard from a couple miles away.
I chose Lori‚Äôs place by chance, and then discovered after arrival that her family has known my in laws in town for 60 years. I was able to reintroduce them and it was a hoot! Discovered in the process that they are fellow people of faith. ;)
One the the appliances had a minor glitch, but Lori already had instructions and back-up appliances on hand. She was immediately responsive and offered to go to great lengths to repair the main appliance. We kept in touch and it was repaired at a convenient time.
I would love to stay here again! Thank you Lori and family!"

We stay here every time we are there - which is 2x a year over the last 5 years.
When you arrive, there are a few snacks, water and coffee so you don‚Äôt have to go to the store right away if you don‚Äôt have time.
The kitchen has everything needed to cook and bake.
The full size washer and dryer are great when you need to do laundry- pods and dryer sheets are there for your use.

I traveled alone and stayed four nights. The Carriage House is in a lovely neighborhood and I felt very safe there. I would gladly stay again and highly recommend it to others."

This is our 7th stay and We‚Äôll be back!"

The carriage house is nice and light with windows throughout, and linen privacy sheers which I really liked, as well as blackout curtains upstairs to accommodate various sleep preferences. Upstairs is a small bath with shower, washer and dryer, and large light room with queen bed. Air mattresses accommodate additional guests if needed. Downstairs is a cozy living room with furnace, small table, breakfast bar, and nicely-supplied kitchen. There's a small private backyard/patio which I hope to enjoy in better weather.

The location is excellent (just a few blocks from downtown Albany, and yet very quiet), the unit itself spacious, comfortable, super-clean, well-lit and well-appointed, the host friendly and responsive, and too many special touches to even list. A real find; we'll definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have used airbnb and vrbo many, many times, but The Carriage House tops them all‚Ä¶everything that a guest could possibly need was provided. A convenient, quiet location ‚Ä¶ it was our HomeSweetHome while visiting our grandkids. Thank you, Lori, for providing this grandparent haven. We will return!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay at the Martha Foster Carriage House. It was cozy, comfy, and a perfect location for our purposes. We especially appreciated all the small but essential items that were provided, so often it's the little things that make all the difference. We will definitely consider staying here again on our next visit to Albany, OR."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon, and we were blown away by this cozy guest house. Sparkling clean, great location, and plenty of space so it feels like a home away from home. We loved all the added touches like the coffee bar with to go cups. Lori is a wonderful host and has thought of everything you could need. It has been our favorite Airbnb experience, and we definitely hope to stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our son moved out to Albany 5 years ago. We make a least 2 trips a year out here and once we discovered Lori's guest house (the first year) we have never stayed anywhere else. Her place is so cozy and homey. She has thought of everything from a fully functional kitchen to extra goodies (before you have a chance to hit the grocery store). The outdoor private patio is one of the best things about the place. Lori always everything perfect for your stay. We'll be back!

My husband and I had the privilege to stay at the carriage house for a few months and are so thankful we found this gem! It was very clean and well stocked with kitchen and bathroom supplies. The outdoor space was also perfect for morning coffee or an evening drink. Lori even added an umbrella for added shade which was very much so appreciated. Of note, Lori‚Äôs space also has two air conditioning units which worked very well during this hot summer. Would 10/10 recommend staying at this Airbnb. It was also in a beautiful hisotiec neighborhood with lots of fun areas to walk around. Thank you again Lori and Rick!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lori's place is a GEM, one of a kind! This was my favorite AirBnB ever, and we had been to many airBnBs around the USA and the world!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't come here, you won't like it! Leave it all for me! haha Just kidding, this place is fantastic. The neighborhood was an unexpected gem. This old carriage house was completely comfortable, had unique amenities that made our stay the best vacation we have had in a while, such as the private backyard, the spacious bedroom, and a full kitchen that allowed us to pretend we lived there for a few nights. I will definitely be back some day. If you are looking for a beautiful walkable neighborhood and a comfortable unique small home to vacation in, this is the place."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place is absolutely wonderful! It's conveniently located and so homey. It's beautiful inside and out. I highly recommend staying there if you get the opportunity!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best value I‚Äôve found for B&B‚Äôs. The owner is exceptional. I‚Äôm never left wanting or needing anything. I try to return more than once a year but she‚Äôs always booked solid.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home to rest .
Pretty clean and accommodating.
Loved how centrally it was.
Will definitely stay again .
Definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely find. Melanie was extremely communicative and provided all of the necessary instructions. Clean up/check out was easy (she asks that used towels go in the bathtub, that the trash is taken out/liners replaced, dishwasher is started). The kitchen had everything we needed and more; bathroom also was well-stocked. Home was super cute and very clean. Items were labeled and easy to find. Shared laundry (via a locked door) with the other unit; those tenants were quiet but also very nice when I left them a note with a ‚Äúwill we disturb you if we run a load of laundry later tonight‚Äù message‚Ä¶much appreciated their kind response. All in all: easy to find, clean, very cute, comfortable, safe and clean neighborhood. Note that the house does front what seemed like it may be a busy neighborhood road but it was quiet and I didn‚Äôt notice traffic at all! I would recommend this home and this host without reservation. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great stay really well equipped place will definitely stay again
Great experience all around"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The price was off the hook for what you get over there. Will certainly look for it again when I return.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Melanie‚Äôs places is beautiful and really clean. The only thing to pay attention is the train is really noisy at night time and you can easily wake up due to that a few times, but this is not something related to the house. Finally if you are looking to use the laundry the internal home direction says that the laundry room is not shared. So they give you some options for you to a few blocks away."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great location and very comfortable
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and very comfortable! Totally enjoyed the stay.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the stay. Place was wonderful and I would recommend staying again. I did have some issues sleeping as I am a light sleeper with the local trains coming and going but nothing against the location for that, more an FYI.
Got to meet the ajoining neighbors the first night after they set off the smoke alarms cooking. Made me feel like I was back home with the wife, lol. The last night we met with another set of neighbors as we were both doing laundry in the ajoined space. Was a good experience"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here. Thank you so much for your help while we were there

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in Albany. Super cute little house was everything we needed. There was a great park just a few blocks away that our kids loved.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My favorite place to stay so far. I stayed for a month and felt like I was at home. It‚Äôs clean, cozy and the gas fireplace warmed up the house so quickly. Super comfy bed and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the ""Hometown Fave"" for 3 weeks. We arrived during an unprecedented snow storm. Melanie, the host, sent messages that went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable.
The updated cottage was clean and well stocked. There was an impressive level of amenities. The kitchen was not only modern and well equipped but also filled with essentials that made cooking and dining in a pleasure.
We felt comfortable a soon as we walked in. It truly felt like our home away from home. We hope to be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, cute an clean place. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to spend some quality time watching movies on the with my mom who i dint see enough. Its easy to get to, centrally located to all the family i want to visit. It was quaint, clean and very homie. I felt comfortable from the moment i walked in the door. Truley great vibes. I will most definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location is quite convenient to commute to Corvallis. Albany and Corvallis have quite a bit to offer. I had very good eating and shopping experiences in both towns.
Oregon is cold for me, but the main heating unit is heating well. And there's a few small space heaters, & plenty of throws around the house.
All the bedding are warm and comfortable.
I had good nights' sleep.
Kitchen has enough pots, pans & utensils (also a small rice cooker) to do a simple full meal. I was able to cook my son his favorite pork ribs.
I think there was a mistake on the instruction inside the house on the laundry room. Melanie was VERY quick to respond. But I totally forgot to tell her what was on the instruction in the folder. Everything worked out in the end :)
I really like the local for the quiet and very home like feel. It certainly was a very good comfortable relaxing feeling whenever I get back to the house after a day's out.
I would be back when I'm going to Albany again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the hometown Fave. Larger kitchen than we expected (helpful for Thanksgiving prep) bedrooms were cozy, and Melanie was super responsive. Everything was really well stocked and easy to find. It a nice quiet friendly neighborhood great for daytime walks. Only note is that at night you could sometimes hear the freight train whistles. I found it nostalgic as my grandmother lived near tracks."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Would definitely stay there again if I‚Äôm ever in the area
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have now stayed in both apartments offered by Melanie in this house and I will come back again and again. The house is spotless, there are lovely touches everywhere, and the thoughtful amenities in the kitchen and bathroom made me feel so welcome."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Melanie And Cindy were very helpful. Anything we needed they were there to answer questions. The house is very clean and very up to date. The house is stocked with Anything you need. It's a great location and easy to get around. Thanks again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Melanie was a great host and she accommodated all our requests!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Hometown Fave was furnished in our taste so fun to check out the great d√©cor . The bathroom had shelving so that we could put our toiletries there - convenient. The host provided a blow dryer plus shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Many handy side tables and chairs so that we never felt there wasn't a place to stash everything.
Very comfortable and relaxing for our Sisters' trip to Oregon."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recently remodeled, Melanie's place iswell-appointed, quiet, and a great space to hang out in. The kitchen and living room left me feeling right at home, and downtown Albany is a short walk and even shorter drive away. I look forward to staying again next time I am in Albany."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home at Melanie‚Äôs place. Everything we needed was there. The suite is absolutely beautiful. She always responded to us and was very helpful. We would definitely stay again if in the area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in a quiet neighborhood. We needed to be in Corvallis and Salem and this was the perfect place in the perfect location.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Roomy kitchen has lots of counter space. Excellent value. If you like to have a place all to yourself, be aware that it's a duplex so the unit next door shares a wall with the kitchen to this unit. The folks next door were quiet so it was no problem. Overall a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and not too many rules about check out which was appreciated.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great quiet place to relax!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Inside is beautiful and very clean. Has extra thoughtful amenities like multiple coffee making options, plenty of bath soaps and shampoos. Beds were fluffy and comfortable. Important to note that the unit shares walls/ceiling with a second AirB&B rental in same house, so you're hearing other guests' noise and conversations, and may have them smoking right outside the kitchen."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very comfortable, great kitchen and living room. perfect for a short stay."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Melanie was a responsive host. I did encounter some confusion about the washer and dryer. The sign on the door to the laundry room said emergency exit only. So I was confused when that door was needed to get to the laundry room. It‚Äôs a shared facility and can be inconvenient if you need to wash on a specific day because (when I stayed there) you‚Äôre only allowed to use it on certain days during the week. I ran into an issue where the spare bedroom window lock was broken and I was unable to get it locked. So I stayed awake all night because my kid was staying in that room and I didn‚Äôt feel safe. The host said she would have it repaired the following day and it may have been but I didn‚Äôt feel safe staying there and left and cancelled the reservation. Everything stater in the listing was accurate.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. I would stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my first experience at an airbnb and it was unbelievably great. Felt like home away from home. I won't ever stay at a hotel again if I don't have to. Melanie's place is wonderful. I miss it and hope to go back.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great stay and had everything that we needed. Thanks

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melanie‚Äôs home was perfect for our time in Oregon. Melanie gave great instructions and made sure I had all the info I needed prior to check in!
The house was cozy and ‚ÄúBertha‚Äù the heater warmed everything up quickly in the evenings. The bed was super comfy and everything worked just as expected‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a little market just down the street and we enjoyed the Mexican food at Rigoberto‚Äôs which we easily walked to.
We will definitely check to see if Melanie‚Äôs home is available next time we head to Albany. üòä"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great parking, clean house, lovely kitchen amenities.
One note for future guests is to bring a pair of earplugs since the train runs through here pretty late at night - the guest staying in the back bedroom didn't hear them but the room in the front by the street could."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good accommodations, easy to find, good, quiet location. Easy access to everything in town. Comfortable beds, nice furniture and decor."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,This was a cute setup. Check in was difficult as I did not get the code to check in by 3pm. We were not able to get settled until 730pm. As the house was cleaned and ready. Other than that it was nice. I would suggest to message the host prior to getting to make sure to get the lock code situation figured out.

The only complaint per se is that you can hear the tenants in the upstairs unit above. Other than that this home was perfect for our trip and we definitely recommend staying here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for us to visit our daughter who graduated from OSU. Clean, organized and lots of info placed around house so you don‚Äôt need to question things."

Cleanliness, amenities were just what we needed for a week stay. Extra bedding, plenty of dishes, a dishwasher.

The kitchen is huge and has that open concept with the living room, allowing for a connection with everyone. The bathroom, with the extra touches was wonderful. There also is a charming office if you needed to do any work while there. It is within walking distance to downtown where there are coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants plus the marvelous Carousel that Albany is becoming famous for. Communication with Melanie was easy and fast. She was warm, funny, and able to answer any question I had. Enjoy your stay there."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow this place was amazing! Such a cute little home in a great area, perfect for going on walks. Melanie was a fantastic host and communicated with us throughout the stay. The place is very well stocked and has everything you need. One of the best airbnb experiences I‚Äôve had, will definitely be back if I am in Albany again"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a cute cottage with a very cozy bed and enormous kitchen. I really enjoyed watching Netflix with the heater ‚ÄúBertha‚Äù warming the entire place. Thank you for the stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great value and super clean space. It‚Äôs obvious that the owners have put a lot of care in to making sure guests have everything they need. It can get a little cold in the bedrooms when you aren‚Äôt around to fire up the heater every so often, and there was a bit of traffic (and train?) noise on a Friday night, but everything else worked out so well that those little things really didn‚Äôt bother us. Would absolutely stay again."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space - there‚Äôs even an office space, which we found very useful.
Easy entry and check-in for late night travelers. Melanie really puts a lot of thought into things travelers might need.
Great value."

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute unit. Comfy and decorated nicely with everything you could need. Parking situation is a bit difficult with some garbage issues they have with permanent tenants in another unit. During my parents stay in the unit the local police department came to the unit and asked them about the mess and broke down RV in the parking lot. I think disclosing this information to potential Airbnb-ers would be helpful, or removing the listing until the resolve the the tenants issues. Other than the mess it is a great little spot."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect boutique cottage, close to OSU! The house is well stocked and there are thoughtful touches all around. On site parking was great as well. Whether staying in or exploring the Corvallis and Albany areas, this is the place to stay."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This cozy cottage was so cute and fun! It has everything you need, including a little study with a desk! The kitchen is very well stocked and Melanie even provides beach towels. The A/C was great and especially worked will during some 105 degree weather!!! It's a great location too- close to the Carousel and also a fun park down the road. We will definitely be coming back!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Vintage was a cute, very clean little home. Melanie had lots of extra touches to make it feel homey. Very responsive to our messages and brought an air conditioner when the weather turned hot. It was a nice place to stay while visiting family in the area."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Nicest Airbnb I've stayedin yet. Next time I visit Albany I hope that it is available
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The vintage was a beautiful & clean. It was very comforting. Our stay was perfect! The location is in a great spot of Albany and it was an easy find! Definitely worth the price. Melanie added such great accommodations we felt very happy and comfortable!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing little place! Close to everything you could need and for a great price. The neighbor situation can be slightly frustrating but like mentioned by others, its certainly reflected in the price. Melanieputs lots of of little touches in her place and the decor is great. Definitely would come by again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extra clean!! Very beautiful and so many thoughtful touches. Such a great host response is quick I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better stay.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable, updated cottage with kid friendly touches and comfortable beds."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was sparkling clean and stocked with plenty of towels and extra linens for the cold. There is no shortage of blankets! The beds were so comfortable and there are plenty of pillows. The heater ""Berta"" is in the heart of the living room. Her ability to warm the home should not be underestimated- she will keep the house and the other rooms warm against the cold. The water heater is enough for multiple short showers, but not advised for baths. We loved that there were plenty of amenities in the kitchen, like the keurig and baking pans which we used for breakfast. The wifi is good enough to support a gamer, a student, and a researcher using it at the same time, given nobody is downloading a massive game. Overall, my family and I enjoyed a wonderful day to rest, do online work, and relax here in between driving."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and great place to stay!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place is awesome!!!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend this Vintage cottage. It is in a quiet neighborhood and is very clean and spacious. It was beyond our expectations and a very homey atmosphere.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a truly exceptional place to stay! Melanie is a wonderful communicator and a lovely host. She has thought of everything one might need - and more. We especially appreciated the holiday decor - very special! Thanks so much - we look forward to our next stay.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and comfy place in the historic area of Albany. Melanie provides lots of wonderful touches to make you feel right at home. The location is very convenient. You do share a back wall and are also underneath the other tenants, and you will notice them, but I feel that is reflected in the price. Not really much of an issue. We would stay there again."
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Love the host she was wonderful. Love the kitchen.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you ever need to stay in this area, check out Melanie's place. Her space is very comfortable, all you need is to bring good attitude and food. The kitchen is fully equipped, there is extra bedding, the entire place is sparking clean."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice place, host was very responsive. The place was extremely clean and comfortable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Being from Canada i was a little worried about getting around but the location of Melindas place was very close to everything you need with a little convenience store just steps away, Albany is a cute little town and I had an amazing time there. She provided all the amenities that you would need and also had a little private backyard which was nice to sit and enjoy a coffee in the morning. I was able to park in the driveway all week it is a tight space but would fit a small car easily. I would most definitely go back to Melindas cottage in a heartbeat. Thank you for your hospitality Melinda!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great little house. one of the best airbnbs I've stayed in and well worth the money. would definitely book again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my fourth stay in five months at Talbert House, and this time my husband joined me. We were very comfortable, and he felt right at home as much as I did. It was rainy and cold the entire week, but we were warm and cozy in the cottage.
We cooked more than I had done on past trips, as we had driven and had room to bring more than when I had flown. We found Melinda's kitchen had everything we needed, along with extras - Melinda even left a gift for us!
Melinda is a perfect host. She communicates warmly and promptly, but gives us our space as well. Truly a wonderful rental."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our relatives visiting for Christmas stayed here and it was a beautiful welcoming space, enjoyed by all."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Because of a family emergency, I needed to come several days early for an already scheduled trip. Melinda responded quickly to my message and accommodated my additional dates. The cottage was a refuge after exhausting and stressful days. Also, Melinda had had the heating unit serviced since my last trip and it worked well. I used the office for a number of video meetings, and the internet was great. The well-equipped kitchen was great. Also, the lighting is terrific, with can lights in the living room, kitchen and bathrooms and lamps throughout the house. I used the washer/dryer for the first time, and it worked well (Melinda even provides detergent).
Throughout my stay, Melinda responded to any questions promptly, and checked in to see how I was doing from time to time. I can't recommend her cottage enough."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Melinda‚Äôs place was immaculate and I really felt at home. It was tastefully decorated and had all the amenities you could possibly need. I was very grateful to have a washer and dryer for my week‚Äôs stay. The living room was very cozy and warm and so nice to curl up with a good movie at night. The location was easy to find, and my big SUV fit perfectly in the assigned parking spot. The highlight was the tokens Melinda left for me to take my niece on the Merry Go‚ÄôRound for special memories at Thanksgiving. I would definitely recommend and will be back! Thanks again for your generous hospitality!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my second week-long stay at Talbert House. In addition to what I wrote before, I'll mention that the bed is very comfortable and the bathrooms are remodeled nicely (as is the entire cottage). Melinda provides shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the two showers, as well as plenty of paper products. The kitchen appliances all work well. Everything is very clean. I learned that there is a wall heater in the main bathroom that warms the area. The main heating/cooling unit in the living room tries hard to heat the house, but the weather was cold during this stay (below freezing outside), and it had some trouble keeping up. But I was fine wrapping up in the plentiful throws and blankets.
Melinda is an excellent host, and communicates quickly and warmly. She provides all sorts of extra touches that make the cottage seem like a home away from home, and I very much enjoyed my stay. I look forward to my next stay in November."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Melinda‚Äôs Place is a nice little home away from home. The home is warm and inviting. It is a short 5 min walk to restaurants and shops. The house was well stocked with anything that you would need for a enjoyable stay. It served my husband I well as we visited Albany to visit family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can't say enough good things about Talbert House. Melinda has remodeled this 1922 cottage with all the modern conveniences. It is spotlessly clean. The furniture is comfortable and attractive. The kitchen is well equipped, including three kinds of coffee makers (and provided coffee and teas). She could be a designer, with all the little touches throughout the house that were beautiful and functional. The TV worked well, with streaming capabilities.
She asks that shoes not be worn in the bedroom, so I'll bring slippers next time. The neighborhood is a few blocks further east from downtown than the airbnb map shows, but I felt safe. I found it easy to park on the street in front of the house, although there is a narrow driveway. A heater/air-conditioner mounted on the wall of the living room provided adequate heat, and Melinda provided many throws and extra blankets if needed. She also has books and games available.
This was a perfect haven. I already have two more trips booked!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Melinda's gem of a cabin is absolutely the best! I've loved my stay! When I needed help with the TV, she took care of it immediately. Spotless. Private. Quiet. Adorable! She has an amazing knack for decorating! I just love it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely a clean well kept place
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay and the house had everything we needed. The office was perfect and the fast internet was a plus for remote work that we needed to do
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The location in Albany was great! Easy access to all hwys in and out of Albany. Corner market less than 100yards away and historic downtown Albany an easy walking distance. The house itself was very comfortable and packed full of interesting nostalgic and memorabilia items. Really fun looking through the 1948 ,Albany high school yearbook. DEFINITELY BETTER than any other hotel we could have found. Hi ared to leave."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was such a comfortable, cozy home!! I was sad to go when our month was over. Couldn't be more perfect. The office was set up perfectly for daily remote work. We loved walking to town daily or the river walk. Was a bit unsure of neighborhood initially. After day 1 we felt very safe 24/7. Will recommend 100% for visiting friends and family! A very welcoming home with every thing you need.
Many thanks for sharing your home Melinda!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Comfortable and welcoming.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Second time at this place. all clean and neat. It is small, truly only for 2 people but very plesant"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Melinda renovated her historic cottage in a very beautiful way. It looks like she kept the original floors, glass doorknobs, push button light switches, plaster walls, and then added up to date furnishings along with a modern kitchen. Her home is neat, clean and comfortable with cozy throws, pillows, travel information, cookbooks, everything you may need for a visit to Albany. The private office would be great for someone working remotely. Thank you for a wonderful stay - we will definitely request to stay here again when we come back to visit family in Oregon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very cute home in a wonderful location. It was quiet, easy to park, and was incredibly conveniently located to quickly get around the area. There are some really nice restaurants just a few blocks away and there are a lot of really cute artistic touches that really make the home a joy to stay in. Our stay was very comfortable and I'd definitely recommend it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I've stayed several times at Melinda's properties and the homes are always immaculate, well appointed, and comfortable. The Talbert house is one of my favorites. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Perfect one-bedroom house with dedicated office space. Close access to the freeway, shopping, and restaurants. Quiet neighborhood. House had a well-stocked kitchen. The bathtub is pretty narrow, but the laundry room has a decent-sized shower that is more spacious. Overall, this is a great place that accommodated my needs for work as well as study and complete school work."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,So cute üòç

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A small but very comfortable place, centrally located. Clean and well-maintained"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Melinda is a wonderful host and my stay at the Talbert House was one of the most enjoyable and comfortable Airbnb experiences yet. I stayed almost two months here and had everything I needed and felt incredibly safe. Melinda was always quick to reply with any issues (though there were few). I would walk downtown often and visit a charming German bakery for coffee and a snack. Just a lovely stay all around.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Wonderful stay. Wonderful host. One of the best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve had so far. I‚Äôve stayed at Melinda‚Äôs place almost two months and have zero complaints. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book this rental.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The Talbert house has everything I needed for a long term stay. Melinda is a wonderful host and very responsive. The location is amazing and very close to anything one might need. One of the nicest and most comfortable Airbnb experiences I have had and can‚Äôt wait to stay again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,One of the nicest Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in. Attentive host. Hope to return.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Melinda was great to work with, and the house is cute, clean, and conveniently located."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cottage is nicely renovated and set up, it was clean, everything worked. The well equiped kitchen with its gas stove deserves to be mentioned separetely and Melinda has a sense for details about which one rejoices upon arrival."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful stay in Albany! Very cute home with all the amenities :) I especially enjoyed the brand new kitchen and huge backyard. Restaurants are walkable and there are two breweries within 3-5 minute walk. Despite being next to a large road, I was never bothered by any noise. Some nights were a little cold, but there are many blankets for backup. Overall a really great stay. Looking forward to future stays here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Melinda‚Äôs house was wonderful! The home is very welcoming, comfortable and nicely decorated. The kitchen is beautiful and fully stocked; you can cook or bake as much as you desire. Also, a lovely bottle of Oregon vino was set out for us to enjoy (thank you, Melinda!)
We also took advantage of the large, private backyard and enjoyed our morning coffee on the patio each day.
The house is located in the historic district of town and is within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, which is very convenient. The only (mild) downside is the street in front of the house. It‚Äôs a busy street and can be a little loud at times. Overall, it was an exceptional stay. We would definitely come back!"
,,,"Pinching Pennie‚Äôs to save a dollar. The thermostat is intentionally set in a different location, the rental was ice cold inside while it was ice cold outside. Cute place but not being able to control the thermostat is bizarre."
