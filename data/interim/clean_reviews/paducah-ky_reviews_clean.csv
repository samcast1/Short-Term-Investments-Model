2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"VERY comfortable and spacious. The windows are amazing and the place is welcoming and not fussy in the slightest. We had kids with us and it was perfect. Ample space to spread out and very comfortable bedding and blankets. Best place we have stayed on our annual trip to Paducah.
Thank you!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful location clean very easy instructions to get in wonderful stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was great and I’ll look to stay there again when in the area. Not sure how it sleeps 5, but maybe I misread the description. Bed was comfy. Getting in was easy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Throughly enjoyed our stay! Our only suggestion would be to replace the black pull out bed /sofa. It is lumpy and very uncomfortable. We were only staying with two people so my sister in law switched to the leather pull out bed/ sofa and that was comfortable. Would have been a problem if we had needed to use both pull out beds. Other than that the place was Very , very clean; well stocked with everything from a first aide kit to garbage bags; wonderful decor; walking distance for many places to eat and safe neighborhood. Host was quick to respond to any question we had!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location for downtown Paducah. Easy walk to river, quilt museum, restaurants. The loft was easy bigger than we expected and super comfortable."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very underrated, the host is absolutely responsive, and she definitely lives up to cleanliness, the loft was fully stocked with LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED. It’s such a large space, my mind could actually relax, to journal, feel at peace, people watch outside the windows, and feel like I’m actually getting away from the real world, but if I wanted to walk out the door everything from eating to needing to shop is in walking distance. There is something very different about this air bnb. The loft had good energy, for two nights I truly felt like I was in a different state, breathing different air, mmmhmmmm also so modern, and so dang peaceful. Okay to wrap this up.. I will DEFINITELY be booking again. This is one of by far the best Airbnbs I stayed in. 5 stars💞"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For my son’s 13th birthday we rented The Loft. The pictures do this place no justice. It was VERY spacious and has beautiful esthetics. It was a very clean and put together space. We enjoyed our stay. The price is great, location as well. Right in the heart of downtown Paducah. Bars and restaurants are on the strip. Family friendly though. They provide plenty of sleepwear such as blankets, pillows and ect so no need to bring your own. We will definitely rent this space again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"GREAT location for being able to walk to convention center events / pubs/ dinner etc {umbrellas by door came in handy for us !) . Spacious enough for group to stay in loft and hang out as well.
Private entrance - easy to find .
Responsive owner ( our code didn't work on door and in less than 1-2 mins - issues solved !!! ).
Safe area
-- just don't forget three flights of stairs to get in :)

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is perfect for a visit to downtown Paducah. It’s an easy walk to the local restaurants and nightlife. It was spotlessly clean and very chic. Will definitely stay again. Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures do not do this space justice. It is incredibly large —as in epically large. Located right on Broadway street, with convenient parking behind the building, it may be one of my favorite places yet. We walked everywhere, as The Loft is located in the downtown business district. Although we only stayed one night, we could tell the kitchen was furnished with everything we would need for a longer stay. All other needs were overly stocked as well. The bed and bedding were incredibly comfortable and the incredible great room was so relaxing to just hang out in. We will definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We will definitely be back soon! We had such a great weekend here. The host was very responsive and friendly. Great location and walking distance to a lot of restaurants and bars
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay in The Loft. As long as you can handle the stairs, this Airbnb is wonderful!!!
The loft bedroom is fantastic! All the amenities you can think of were provided.
Great location.
Very clean.
The living room is enormous, as is the smart TV!
Can't say enough about this awesome place!!!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, beautiful loft, very comfortable with all the downtown fun just steps away. Highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, located in the heart of town, close to bars, restaurants, and the Carson Center. The Loft is spacious, clean, and we were able to park right by the door."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We will definitely be staying here again... You cannot beat the location or the space. Worth it.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were so pleased with our find of this place! We had never been to Paducah before so we didn’t know what to expect. Our only downfall was we stayed on a Sunday night and the town was pretty well shut down. We loved finding Dry Ground Brewing Company though and would definitely recommend it. An unexpected plus, the town has a Labor Day parade! It passed right below us and was so fun to watch! We loved visiting the mural and then finishing up at Purple Toad Winery. The loft was clean and beautiful and check in was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is more beautiful than the photos. So spacious. The bed was super comfortable and even the pullout for my 7 year old was so comfy. Truly so much space, but also so cozy. The location is right downtown which is super convenient for shops and restaurants. We were in town to eat at Freight House Restaurant and could easily walk there. And the host was so responsive with check in and parking instructions. There are quite a few stairs, so you’d need to be prepared for that. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, bar across the road was loud but nothing a fan wouldn’t take care of. We will be back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Four Rivers was very clean and comfortable. I felt safe and secure. It was much more than I needed but it had everything and the hosts were very responsive. I would highly recomment their place if you ever want to visit the downtown area of Paducah. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"First time in Paducah. There weren’t any nice hotels available at comparable pricing and we were thrilled for this option at the Loft. Great downtown location with easy parking and walkable neighborhoods. The space was great — plenty big enough for kids to run around, felt like a little oasis. Everything was clean and prepped, easy sleeping situation. Would book again 10/10"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The loft was incredibly spacious, well cleaned, and nicely kept up. Really appreciated not having to do any pre-check out cleaning/tidying tasks."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very spacious, spotless and modern loft - with the warmth and charm of an upscale farmhouse offering a view from a wall of windows one flight up from an arty and eclectic downtown street. Kindnesses like granola bars, coffee and filtered water. We loved it and wish we’d booked longer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is exactly as described! 1 thing that stood out to me was how clean it smelled before even entering. We didn’t get to spend as much time in the Airbnb as we’d like but we’ll be back and would absolutely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huge space with a great location.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft was amazing !!! It is huge , the windows were our favorite part . The buildings around it were just beautiful. The bed was very comfy . Snacks & coffee were provided, which is always a nice surprise. Also just a few blocks to walk to the river & great eating places & nice shops. The host responded ASAP when I had questions. Just book it........I plan on going back next year to stay again when I visit Hancock's to buy more fabric !!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first airbnb, but I can almost guarantee that it’ll stay my favorite. Well worth it"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location is perfect- safe - plenty of room. Great view!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible space! We enjoyed gazing out the floor to ceiling windows. Extremely clean and all the amenities one could need. If you’re a light sleeper and staying over the weekend, bring your earplugs as the folks at the bar across the street can get rowdy. Even so, we loved our stay!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, close to many things to do in downtown. Easy to walk to and from. Very clean!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was everything in the description, and they were so easy to work with. Kirchoff’s bakery, Paducah Beer Werks, a plethora of great restaurants, and the rail and quilt museums were all within a short walking distance.
The majority of downtown rolls up the sidewalks around 9~10pm during the week, so it was good and quiet for a weeknight. The downtown and the loft especially felt very safe."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exceeded my expectations! Would definitely book again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is at least 3 times larger than it appears in the photos. Spacious, clean and very well equipped. Super convenient to downtown restaurants, shops and bars.
Lots of steps, nightclub across the street was loud on weekend, but the piano bar next door is awesome."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Kitchen was perfect. Location was primo! The upper loft bedroom was so comfortable and beautiful. They were right about the stairs. Lots of them.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious loft in a prime downtown Paducah location. It has a private entrance and plenty of free parking. The host is kind, responsive, and had ZERO checkout chores, which was amazing! The master bedroom suite upstairs was a peaceful spot with a super-comfortable king bed, a couch, huge closet and big bathroom. Plus, an added bonus was the half-bath on the main level. We hope to stay again soon!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A gem in downtown .
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This loft is truly beautiful! It was great for our group of 6 women ranging from age 30 to 73 years old to celebrate our best friend’s 40th birthday at Max’s and play card games back at the loft. The loft was so cozy and was honestly so much bigger and BETTER than I would have even expected. The only reason I didn’t give a 5 star is unfortunately we were not sent a code to get into the door. I reached out to the owner by message twice including my cell phone number. We never heard back even after checking out. Fortunately, I walked into the business next door to ask if they had any idea who owned the loft. They said their business did and they didn’t know why I didn’t receive the code, but that they could help me. Had we gotten there a little later after they closed I’m not sure how we would have gotten in… Again, we thoroughly enjoyed this stay and I’d definitely stay again!!! There is a bar across the street that is VERY loud until close to 2am, but they have sound machines!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great apartment close to restaurants and shops. Great view from the living room and upstairs. Nice kitchen, loved the kcup selection. Hands down one of the cleanest rentals we’ve stayed at."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest AirBnBs I have ever stayed at. Far bigger than I needed for just myself, but I wouldn't hesitate to book it again"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There was a bit of confusion with the early check-in but the host resolved the issue quickly and promptly. My bf and I had an in town getaway for the night and The Loft was perfect and very spacious. Thank you for providing excellent service and ensuring our stay was comfortable. We felt right at home as everything we needed was provided. I loved the Motts Apple Cider! Lol We will be booking again.

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Only suggestion is replace the mattress on the hideaway bed in living room near the steps.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place and great communication from the owner
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spacious and inviting! Love it
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Came into town to visit family for the holidays. We loved this loft apartment. Loft bed was comfortable, tons of space, great downtown location, and host gave clear instructions on check in & check out.
For others, there’s a bar across the street and they were pretty loud at nights. We slept fine, just something to be aware of. Additionally, we didn’t sleep on the pullout couches, but my sisters said they were uncomfortable. It was better for them to sleep just on the couch itself.
Overall we’ll be staying here again and highly recommend this apartment"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful loft! It’s even better in person - and so spacious! Right in the middle of the arts district, I could walk to everything if I wanted. Check-in and check-out were the easiest I’ve experienced and the convenient, hassle-free parking was a huge bonus. Very very quiet at night except for the soft church bells which were sweet to fall asleep to. A lovely way to visit Paducah."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Wish we could have stayed longer than one night! Overall it is a place in the middle of downtown that makes you feel you could live there. Would recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean,and modern living space downtown close to eateries & shopping. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this so much. It was beautifully decorated and easily accessible. The house owners were wonderful to communicate with. We stayed with our 3 month old and made sure to park in the front. It was dark when we arrived and lots of people were partying. We could not hear the noises from the loft, which was very nice. Highly recommend this to anyone"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, very clean and updated. Provided everything I could possibly need."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just book it!
We loved it! Huge windows, clean, cozy bed! The host thought of everything from soaps and k cups to sound machine and fire escape ladders!! (Thankfully didn’t need those). Hope this place is available every time I come to Paducah! As other reviews said- there are several steps- but they aren’t hard to climb (shallow and wide). We walked to all the food places, shops and tourist spots downtown! Wonderful anniversary weekend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Quick communication. We Loved it!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place very very spacious place to stay with a beautiful lofted bedroom & bathroom! There is also a half bath on lower level! Beautiful windows to look out over downtown & just walking distance from the Gold Rush Cafe!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location that is within walking distance of everything you need downtown! We loved being able to walk to dinner and then go enjoy the beautiful river views. The best part is how much room the loft provides! We usually stay in the 1857 hotel and it will be hard to go back having all this room!
We parked and never moved until we left to go home. The owners were very accommodating with great communication. We will definitely be back!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!! Great price!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place to stay! Very clean and roomy. We loved the board/card games available and played almost all of them. I’m not one to leave so much as a dirty glass in the sink but I appreciated how easy checkout was, as they didn’t require clean up (linens gathered, dishes washed, trash taken out, etc). I’ve always hated that we get charged a cleaning fee yet most require you to clean before leaving. This was one of my favorite places I’ve stayed and we are looking forward to coming back in the future."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The loft was immaculate with an amazing view of Paducah’s downtown nightlife!!! All of the amenities they provided made for extremely comfortable stay without having to bring my whole house with me. We would definitely recommend this loft for anyone wanting to partake in the nightlife and/or the fun shops that are up & down Broadway. My husband and I will be making a return trip without the kids in the near future.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Four Rivers Loft is well located so that a car could be entirely unnecessary. We enjoyed walking everywhere in the historic district.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Paducah!! Pictures do not do this place justice!! The owners have thought of so many little details. The kitchen and bathroom were well-appointed. Everything was spotless and so clean in the entire place! There was some noise in the evening from the bar across the road, but once it closed for the night it was so quiet. The location is wonderful—you can walk down to the cute shops and to the river walk. There are flights of stairs leading up to the apartment as well as stairs to the bedroom, so keep that in mind if stairs are an issue. Parking is free and there are plenty of spots in the well-lit back lot. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again!"

Skip the hotel, this has everything you need and is a much better value."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Hands down... this is the absolutely BEST place I've ever rented. I honestly don't believe any other place will be able to contend with this loft!
im a traveling medical professional and I rented this place for a month so i became very familiar with the area and unit.
I'll start with the good:
cleanest place ever. everythings was immaculate!
snacks were provided, Keurig/coffee pot combo pods provided, sugar, filters... etc
everything you need is there and more. I can't even name all the accommodations that is on hand here but I didn't have to buy anything but food!
This place is huge and honestly, I was in awe over this unit and accommodations.
The bed was so comfortable! the huge bedroom was perfect!
The host: Literally responds within minutes. ANY problem that arises this host will solve it before you can complain... in fact with a view like this place you can't complain!
Places to eat nearby literally two blocks more or less and shopping isn't very far away! *antique shop was wonderful*
Now on to the bad:
Having to find a place as great as this!
thank you @Four Rivers!! You made my stay here alot easier and comfortable than I imagined!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an awesome place!!! We came in for a night with our 3 daughters to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary(Saturday) with a nice meal and some relax time. Owner was very easy to communicate with. Instructions were very clear! Great, Great, Great, Location. Can’t say enough good things! Very worth checking this place for your next stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful find! Truly a gem. Absolutely spotless, well-appointed and comfortable. We found this loft at the last minute, and could not have been happier with our stay. We only wish we were staying longer. We were really in awe when we walked though the property for the first time. We will absolutely look to stay at Loft@415 again when we travel here again. We have no reservations recommending a stay."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I love how this unit is in the center of downtown Paducah. Communication was concise, and the listing was accurate. We did find a random unused roll of toilet paper under the bed, and some used paper towels on an end table where it looks like they were wiping down furniture in between guest, I am sure this was an oversight. You can’t beat the location."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely light in the morning from the massive windows! It’s way bigger than the pics make it look- like huge. It’s a fun spot and comfortable upstairs bed! This isn’t a cozy space, but if you want more of an industrial vibe, this is a good apartment!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is PRISTINE, spotless and very comfortable. Great king bed upstairs and wonderful amenities. Would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was great! My husband and I really enjoyed the place. It was close to everything we wanted to do. We walked to the downtown bars at night and to coffee the next morning. The place was very clean and spacious. They provided snacks and coffee. The view of Broadway is great.
The only thing to note is the actual loft is a bit hard to find. We drove around the blocks for about 15 minutes looking to the “Loft at 415” logo on the glass door. I did message the host and they were quick to respond with what the listing says- to look for the “loft at 415” logo…. So we continued to do that. Honestly, we only found the place after zooming into pictures on the listing and using clues of the other buildings to see where this was exactly. The logo is black and it blended in with the door.
So, just note that it’s right beside “Turning Point” which has a sign hanging from their door.
The rest of the check in process was super easy. That was our only thing that could be improved upon.
We would stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came to Paducah for a night to celebrate a friends birthday. This AirBNB went above and beyond our expectations! This is the coolest place. It’s HUGE first of all. Second, we got a great price! It was clean, very private, the towels were big and fluffy, there was a stock of all the KCups one would need, the bed was super comfy, and it smelled like fresh laundry when we walked in. We ate dinner at Over/Under which is literally 1 block away so no driving! We had a great time and our friend that we surprised was so happy with the place we chose to stay. The best part? They don’t leave a full page of instructions on what to do before you leave - you just LEAVE! Thank you for sharing this place with us and we will definitely recommend The Loft @ 415!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot of a quick weekend getaway with restaurants and other entertainment venues within walking distance.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My sis and I had a wonderful stay in downtown in this lovely space. Fun city street views in the arts district. We look forward to staying longer next time to enjoy more of downtown. Our host was easy to work with and check-in/out was contactless and private. Appreciated the stocked coffee.
Might want to bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper due to the loud sound when the heat/air turns on."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I think others may have said it already. The pics don't tell the whole story. This place is huge and well equipped. A great place to hang out. There is one full bath in the bedroom and one-half bath on the main floor. There is also a walk-in closet off the master with plenty of hangers and storage space. The space is new and clean. There are two sleeper sofas and bedding for on the main floor. The ceiling in the main area is 20'plus high with large windows. You can walk to everything in the downtown. We will look for this place again when we plan a return visit.

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is great! It is furnished with everything you could possibly need. You can walk all over downtown. We loved people watching out the huge windows. Our teenagers can't wait to come back and stay here! We love downtown Paducah and we love this place as well! Just an FYI there are 3 flights of stairs to climb and an additional flight for the bedroom loft. We didn't mind it but something to think about if you don't like stairs.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was clean and comfortable! The attention to detail made everything feel cozy and homelike. The floor to ceiling windows provide an incredible view of the town. If we ever pass through again, we’ll be sure to come back to Four Rivers!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"If there was a way to give a higher rating i would! Just book it. You won’t regret it. The place is stunning. Walking ability to EVERYTHING. The floor to ceiling windows with vaulted ceilings make this place feel so luxurious. I booked a night for the next 3 months because it is such a good area and stay. The kitchen is huge for cooking and plenty of space for entertaining. Every extra detail was paid attention to. Snacks, toiletries, soft blankets, extra pillows, etc. i live in the area and loved this for a home away from home."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment has obviously just been renovated, everything is brand new and is totally AWESOME in all regards.
Large and very spacious space. Attention to every detail has been added.
The bed in the upper loft is very comfortable.
The only thing worth noting is the amount of stairs to get to apartment and then again to the bedroom.
If stairs are not an issue, then this is offering is definitely worth the exercise.
Loved it !!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. it was a staycation so we were already familiar the the area. I can honestly say that the pictures do not give this place justice. there is so much room. the windows overlooking Broadway sold it all.
I will warn future renters that are 3 flights of stairs that lead up to the space. then another 2 more flights to get to the bedroom. other than that, perfect stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so pleased about everything at the cozy cabin. Tiffany is a perfect host and answered all our questions! The cabin was squeaky clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable! Tiffinay thought of everything you would need to make your stay comfortable, from throws, while sitting at the fire pit, to snacks, and the coffee bar had everything you needed. The main attraction, the mini cows were a delight, especially as Tiffinay bottle-fed their new addition! We would definitely choose the Cozy Cabin again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Tiffany’s was perfect for our family! Tiffany’s place is beautiful, clean, and she thought of everything! We enjoyed coffee every morning while talking to Daisy and Dozer! Tiffany also let my 4 yo feed Glimmer the new calf, which was a beautiful memory!!
10/10 would stay here again.
Thanks Tiffany!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiffany and Jeff’s place is amazing. One of my favorite Airbnbs ever. The house is pristine, immaculately kept, very well decorated, and has so many nice touches and amenities. Tiffany and Jeff are absolutely lovely and so hospitable. The surrounding property is spectacular and the location is wonderful. You’re close to the highway, but out in the quiet country, and only a short, pleasant drive to downtown Paducah. Just can’t say enough good things. If you’re in town for work, vacation, or just passing through town, I can’t recommend it more highly."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and peaceful. Very friend hosts. We came for rest and relaxation and that's exactly what we got!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiffany and Jeff were very helpful with any questions that we had. They are fantastic hosts. It was awesome feeding Dozer and Daisy and their new addition Glimmer (we got to bottle feed her! 💜). The amenities in the air bnb were perfect and it was very comfortable. All the places we ate around the area and the adventures we went on were spectacular! If you have time to drive an hour away you have to check out Bell Smith springs and Garden of the Gods. We can’t wait to come back! 🥰
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful little cabin in Reidland! My bridesmaids and I had a wonderful stay here the night before my wedding.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location is great - we came to Paducah to visit family from out of state, and this was the perfect spot. Exactly as described and absolutely clean. Very peaceful surroundings and quiet. Tiffany was super responsive and actually invited us to bottle fed their new calf. That was right place at the right time, but she totally wanted us to have that experience. Very cool. If you stay here you won’t regret it. Say hi to Daisy and Dozer for us!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Super responsive hosts. Everything was beautifully decorated and spotless. Would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I only stayed one night as we were traveling through the area and just needed a place to stop over for the night. We found the location to be in a very nice, quiet community within a few minutes of the interstate highway. There were several yummy snacks provided which we appreciated. Tiffany was very quick to respond when we asked about some local restaurants close enough to take out and eat at home. It was nice having a KING size bed which made for a good nights sleep. We will most definitely attempt to stay here again when traveling thru the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful and peaceful home. couldn't have asked better for the pickiest travelers. the decor felt like a winter wonderland and location wonderfully private. the thoughtful touches, coffee bar, and snacks were a sweet bonus"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. It was quiet and homely. The host recommended eating at 1880 patties. It was amazing. I see why you need a reservation. The bed was really comfortable and the host also left snacks, coffee and water for us which I’ve never had at any place I’ve rented I thought that was very thoughtful and appreciated it. I would definitely rent from the host again. Thank you again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were on a weekend getaway and this space was perfect, could have stayed even longer! It’s within a few miles of great restaurants and things to do which is what I was looking for when booking. The pictures and descriptions were exact and check in/check out was easy breezy! When we arrived, the host was thoughtful and had left us banana bread in the fridge. Tea, coffee, snacks, and bedroom chocolates made us feel like we were staying in a nice hotel! This space was super clean and clutter free. Daisy and Dozer were outside of the bedroom window when we woke up in the mornings, I just wish the weekend we visited wasn’t raining so we could’ve given them snacks and pets."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay 3 nights.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a top notch place. Possibly the best air bnb I’ve ever visited. The hosts have thought of all the small things that can make a big difference for the traveler. Complimentary snacks, water and coffee bar. The kitchen has EVERYTHING you need to enjoy a shorter stay. Very functional use of the space. We were so pleased with our choice. And don’t forget to bond with the hairy friends out back! Our kids loved feeding the mini cows. A unique addition to make those extra memories on a trip. 10 out of 10!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute with lots of amenities. Very peaceful. Much needed relaxation on a long trip.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at Tiffany’s for a little Christmas retreat. It was perfect. Probably the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we hoped for! The fire pit was a highlight, we spent several nights there. The set up is superb! The place was very cozy and friendly. We appreciated the snack and coffee bar, not to mention the s’mores kit basket along with blankets to use at the fire pit!

This place is perfect for 2 people wanting to getaway and unwind. The mini cows Daisy and Dozer were refreshing as well. 5 stars and beyond!

If you are a light sleeper, consider bringing ear plugs or use a sound machine on your phone. There can be some light highway traffic in the distance at times. I’m assuming more so in the winter while the leaves are off the trees, but that was a minor issue.

Overall, the home is in a very nice peaceful neighborhood. With a grocery store only a few minutes away. Our host Tiffany was very accommodating and friendly. We will be back for sure!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiffany’s place was incredibly homey and warm. It really was a home away from home. Tiffany and Jeff were great hosts who gave us privacy, but also were great at telling us more about the cows. The mini cows are truly the stars of the experience. I loved waking up and giving them treats every morning. The attention to the small details really made our stay top notch.
The location is amazing as there is so mcuh opportunity near by get outdoors and see different kinds of wildlife. There’s also great food nearby such as Reds Donuts."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, clean, and relaxing space for a getaway or weekend in Paducah!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place - very comfortable. It had everything we needed, and made the Pre-Thanksgiving holiday trip much easier. We will definitely stay here each time we visit family in Paducah."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our quiet weekend away. We never left the premises all weekend. The quaint, quiet countryside was exactly what we were looking for. We spent our weekend around the fire 🔥 it and on the front porch listening to music. And Bambino’s pizza is a great pizza for delivery!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter chose to stay her over having a birthday party and she was not disappointed. She says this is the best place she has ever stayed.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a last minute booking for us while staying in Kentucky and 270homes was the perfect fit! It was conveniently located, we were only a few minutes from stores and restaurants. The house was amazing!! It was so nice and clean, it was inviting and super comfy for our family! The backyard was awesome! We had so much fun sitting out back, grilling burgers and hotdogs, and roasting marshmallows over the fire! This is a perfect rental if you’re looking for a nice, quiet, private place to stay that’s minutes away from anything you would need! It gave my husband and I time to regroup together as well as reconnect and spend quality time with our kids! And I almost forgot to mention the fishing pond! It was awesome! So pleased with this rental and will absolutely be back!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We are repeat guests here and absolutely love it! The shower is amazing, and the kitchen is so great to cook in. The host is wonderful! We will for sure be back."

Would 100% book again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED this rental. I travel constantly for work and this place was amazing, the bathroom was the best I've had in a rental yet. Even though I came for work, the house made me feel right at home and relaxed. Comfy beds and a perfect kitchen to cook in. The host was incredible and I couldn't have asked for more from her. They accommodated me more than excpected of an airbnb. Loved."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I think anyone with three children knows it’s hard to find a place to stay on the road that accommodates a family well. This was just what we needed after a day of driving. Plenty of space for kids to run around. It was clean and comfortable. Would stay again for sure. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, peaceful, great location, great communication with host. Very nice place for a getaway."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. It was a very nice home with lots of extra features. We loved having the pond to go fishing. We loved the firepit and being able to have a fire and the treats that were provided were an amazing surprise. Also when we arrived there was a small gift waiting for our 5 yr old that was celebrating his 6th birthday. He was so excited and couldn't believe it when he seen it on the kitchen counter. When we are back in this area we will definitely be staying again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was wonderful and had everything we needed! Well-stocked kitchen, beautiful master bath, comfortable family room and bedrooms, and great outdoor space! We had dogs with us and the backyard and surrounding property was great. It was a short drive to downtown and great restaurants, but felt like a private oasis.
We were also moving to a new state, so if anyone else is driving a truck while pulling a car on a trailer, the driveway has plenty of space!
Overall, we would 100% stay here again if we were coming through Paducah, and it was one of my favorite airbnbs I’ve stayed in!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This location was booked by my employer. I enjoyed my stay in Paducah! I did enjoy the pond and spacious yard. The house was super nice and clean!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place good fishing and very clean perfect for a get away
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a very lovely spot, just the right distance from town for my prolonged work tour in Paducah. The house was perfect for my needs, and a pleasure to return to after work. The house had all the basics I required for the day-to-day.
Two nice bedrooms, two baths, and an open den/kitchen/dining worked great for me. So very much nicer than a hotel! The appliances are new and worked great.
The neighborhood was perfect for an early run or an evening walk. The pond is visible from the kitchen window and front porch, a great spot for morning coffee. There were frequent visits from deer, turkeys, and other wildlife.
Amanda and Shawn were outstanding! Any questions or needs I had were promptly addressed.
I will definitely look to stay here again should my travels take me back to Paducah."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this house. It had nice finishes, was clean, in a great location and we loved the fishing pond. Paducah is cute and a great jumping off point to explore parts of KY, TN and IL. We never would have traveled to this area if not for COVID and really appreciated the chance to explore new states without dealing with a lot of people.
The kitchen wasn't quite as well stocked as some Airbnb homes when it came to knives and pots but there were also really great things like the disposable containers we packed lunches in (unfortunately, we found one in our car when we unpacked so blame us for not having a complete set)."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is easy to access and sits on a sizeable wooded lot. A clean, bright, modern interior made a wonderful setting for our family stay with an open living space/kitchen leading to the back patio where a grill and firepit were at our disposal (they even had s'mores ingredients!). The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and basic ingredients. Everything was spotless! The bedrooms are neat with beautifully redone bathrooms. Laundry was available, though we didn't use it during our stay. A car port made loading and unloading easy. The only negative was the power lines in front of the house, but once you're settled in you don't even notice them. Would definitely recommend for a cozy, stylish stay."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed as a family of 4 and had plenty of comfortable space. Having two full bathrooms (both with very nice fixtures - loved the rainfall shower) was perfect for our visit. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking, and the internet was also good. The books about Paducah were a fun local touch. Communication from the hosts was very prompt and we found the house easily, even with our late arrival. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect get away. Quiet and inviting. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to unplug.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice property, great communication, everything needed & more was there for us. Nice personal touch & thoughtfulness."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time relaxing over a long weekend here. The house Cookes with some great touches — modern appliances, smoker, fire pit, Edison string lights outside. Also close to land between the lakes."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super cute space, in the cutest area. My nephews loved nothing more than to throw fish food and watch the fish put on a show. Loved every minute spent there!!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent stay!! House was sparkling clean, the hosts were SO RESPONSIVE, and the location was perfect - near lush woods, close to lots of hiking, restaurants, and other local amenities. Would easily stay here again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place really is Paducah’s best! It’s on a quiet street, just a few minutes from stores and restaurants, and was a perfect spot for my wife and me to get away from all this COVID nonsense for a few days. The house is extremely stylish and has been updated throughout. It’s also got a really nice back patio area with hanging lights and a fire pit. We loved feeding the fish in the pond as well! If our travels ever take us back to the Paducah area we’ll absolutely stay here again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amanda is a host that goes above and beyond. Do not hesitate to book this property. It is super clean and the house is stocked with everything you could want. We used it as home base for all of the state parks and recreational areas. There are so many great hiking trails all around the area.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We needed a little get away but wanted to maintain social distancing in these covid times. This place is the perfect spot to do so! We had contactless check in and were in a wonderful space to enjoy some quiet and nature. The home is very clean and has cute decor. The kitchen appliances are newer. The yard space is nice and feeding the fish did not disappoint! The hosts were kind and responded quickly when we had a few questions. I would highly recommend this home and we would gladly stay here again.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic house in semi-secluded area - this was an amazing home away from home! For a couple travelling, there was plenty of room with two bedrooms (we didn't even venture into the second bedroom) and two bathrooms. The amenities were fantastic, the host was very thoughtful and communicated very well! The highlight had to be feeding the fish in the pond - super fun! Plus grilling in the backyard was also a delight! The kitchen was also pretty well stocked and we actually cooked in the house about 4 of the 7 nights we stayed here. We wouldn't hesitate to come back to the area and stay in this airbnb."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home and location, woupd stay again :)"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while in town for a wedding. The location was perfect for ease of travel and the setting was beautiful and quiet.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay highly recommended!
2020-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing property with a secluded feel just minutes from town. Great open space, very clean and relaxing. We loved all the little extras that many AIRBNB'S don't supply such as, shower supplies, flashlights, detergent, cleaning supplies. Also several games and puzzles for the family to enjoy. Our family spent a lot of time by the firepit in the back, the yard is well maintained and very few bugs. We look forward to staying again next time we need a place near Paducah."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful home. Had a special personalized card waiting for us. Would definitely stay again!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, relaxing home, very clean, and had everything you could think of. The hosts were great and extremely helpful."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have picked a better place to stay in Paducah! The home was beautiful and a great location! We came to visit my son who goes to Murray but wanted a place that feel like home rather than a hotel. It was such a memorable weekend with fishing, s’mores, and being able to enjoy home cooked meals together. The hosts were more than accommodating with all the recommendations on things to do and even had snacks perfect for the college kid when we arrived. I most definitely plan to stay again!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, it was very tidy and lovely place, equipped with everything you may need during your stay. The house will give you privacy you seek for, in somewhat secluded location. However, its really easy to get around the area, and there are restaurants and shops within 10-15 mins drive. Amanda was a great host, the communication was quick and easy."
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, clean"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very lovely home.. prime location and hospitality..

2019-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and stylish for a new renovation. Appreciated the addition of holiday decor for the Christmas season for holiday travelers.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay at this home. We arrived late at night and it was all lit up and sparkling clean. The hosts even had a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and a fruit basket waiting for us. The beds were comfortable and we stayed 8 nights without any issues. We have family in the Paducah area and would love to stay again! It’s a very nice home in a quiet location. I would highly recommend!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful little home, bathrooms are amazing and the kitchen makes me jealous of what I have at home. The host were very responsive when I needed assistance. I will stay here again."

You will be pleasantly surprised with your stay. We even had the cutest group of deer move across the lawn. We can’t wait to visit again soon.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The 270home was fantastic in every way thinkable. Nice quiet neighborhood, sparkling clean, spacious with a great master bath and a great kitchen. One extra special thing is feeding the fish in the pond, they really put on a show for us. Amanda and Shawn were so kind they remembered it was our Anniversary getaway and left a special treat for us to enjoy. Those type of things make for a great stay. We have booked a long stay in November. ❤️"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect house! Super clean, perfect sprawling layout for our 2 year old and beautiful outdoor space. The hosts are kind, clear communicators and made our stay feel very welcomed and easy. We loved our stay!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous time! Everything spotless and obviously recently renovated as it was like staying in a brand new house. All the finishes were top notch, beds slept great, SO nice to have access to Netflix etc. in the evening. We'd been at the quilt show all day so it was nice to put our feet up and catch the new season of the Great British Baking Show! And duh - there were already SNACKS!! We're already planning to stay here when we return to Paducah next year. I really can't say enough about how great this house is. We didn't fish but I fed them the last day we were there (fish snacks provided too) and MAN there are some mammoth catfish in that pond along with a few turtles. NOTE: it is not handicapped 'accessible' per se (and they DO say that at the site) but my brother who uses a cane really had no issues coming and going - just look at the pictures closely and see if you think it will work for you. BTW I'm currently training for the St. Jude Half Marathon in Memphis in December. Even though it's on a two lane highway with some hills, it was still really easy and SAFE for me to get 4 miles in a couple of days at 7 a.m."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional cleanliness, great location with some wildlife that can be seen passing through. The little pond is a nice touch that may or may not be loaded with perch and small bass. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to stay."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for a quiet get away!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for your hospitality! It was a beautiful place!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"clean living space, brand new appliances. i had bob segar playing from the fridge if that says anything. nice quiet pond out back stocked with the biggest catfish i ever caught. very highly recommended."
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house, beautifully remodeled, in a quiet area, with lots of wildlife. We had a great stay there and hope to come again soon."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay over night when drivning from Chicago to Nashville. Really enjoyed relaxing on the porch watching fireflys.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a pleasant weekend getaway! We were in town for a wedding and the house was minimal yet modern, the perfect place to come back to at the end of the day. Wonderful hospitality with plenty of amenities."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This space was amazing! Everything is very updated. Amanda was extremely accommodating, and quick to respond to messages. The little touches that added were very thoughtful. My son loved feeding the fish down at the pond. We did some catch and release fishing down there also! I would definitely reccomend this home to anyone wanting a country setting with nice updated amenities!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We used Peducah as a base for hikes up in Shawnee when coming up from Texas. The home was recently remodeled and exactly as the photos show. Quite beautiful and very comfortable. The home is set back on a small hill and the next door pond houses a charming symphony of frogs. Nature even offered a free alarm clock: a cardinal who took it upon himself to defend his territory by repeatedly hopping up to peck the back door. He must have done that a few hundred times over the weekend. Funny fellow.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We totally enjoyed our stay at Shawn’s property. The place is beautifully renovated and fully equipped with everything we needed and more! The linens and towels smelled fresh (one of the first things I check upon arriving, always!), all bedrooms had TVs with Netflix, and WiFi, the lawn was well manicured and they even left plenty of fish food for the kids to feed the fish in the pond. Thank you Shawn for sharing your beautiful property with us. Definitely looking forward to staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about this spot was phenomenal! We won’t stay anywhere else if we return to Paducah!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sharon is a true “Super Host” from the very beginning of looking at this place the communication was great. The apt is so very comfortable in a great location of downtown Paducah..While is Paducah we had a very bad storm and Sharon kept in touch to make sure we knew where the storm shelter was if needed. Great customer service. Parking is convenient on the street or in the lot right across the street. I’d highly recommend Sharon as a host and this convenient apt if coming to Paducah.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic find for our weekend trip! The space itself was so beautiful and comfortable. And it was in easy walking distance of a lot of local shops and restaurants. We loved being able to just take a stroll to see what was around and to spend some time sitting by the river without having to travel very far. It was also easily drivable to any stores for groceries or other things we wanted to pick up. Definitely marking this as a place to return to stay when thinking of places we've enjoyed! The host is extremely friendly and communicative. Check-in was super easy with her directions and she gave a lot of great recommendations on things to do and see during our stay!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Go ahead and book this place! It is fantastic and within walking distance to everything. Sharon was wonderful and had some great recommendations. We can’t wait to come back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place...great area...great time.
thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous apartment. Immaculate and well stocked. Great location for attending Quilt Week.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a relaxing getaway. Great place. Host was very communicative. Tons to do within walking distance. Perfect little escape right by the river.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Right in middle of everything. Restaurants; bars museum within 1/2 block. Could be only building with elevator access to second floor unit in historic/riverfront area, which was great for me (70 years old). I have stayed in a lot of Airb/b and this had the most comfortable furniture/bedding of all. Parking a breeze, free, seemingly safe and only feet away from elevator. Don’t miss the quilt museum, this is not “your grandmother’s quilt”, absolutely amazing artistic work. If you want a quick lite breakfast, try the quiche or egg muffin sandwich at Kirchhoff Bakery, maybe 100-150 feet from unit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We visited Paducah for the eclipse and were glad to find this charming and comfortable apartment in a perfect location right downtown. But the best feature was the host, Sharon, who went the extra mile to make sure we had a wonderful stay. Recommended!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon is one of the best hosts we’ve ever dealt with. Leading up to our trip she provided a ton of information on what to do and things happening around town. We were visiting for the 2024 eclipse and she even had eclipse glasses waiting for us! Sharon was also very proactive in providing information on arriving and entering the space, which was even better than the photos would suggest. I would definitely stay at this location again the next time we’re in Paducah!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a weekend getaway with lots to do within a short walking distance. Free parking right across the street. Absolutely a great location. More significantly, Sharon clearly goes above and beyond to provide not only a spotless and well-appointed place to stay, but she also excels at that personal/thoughtful touch. Everything we could have wanted was already there. And my wife, an admitted ""Karen"", said it was the absolutely cleanest place she'd ever had the pleasure of staying! Highly recommend it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This condo was very spacious and very clean! Easy access to restaurants and other great places! Sharon was very responsive and very helpful about our stay! Definitely will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying at Sharon’s place in Paducah and there was a guitar there which was great because we left so spontainiously that I didn’t pack one in the car.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay in Paducah
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can’t say enough about how great it was to work with Sharon! She was so prompt about returning any messages and proactive most of the time!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon's Foxbrier place is exactly how she describes it - historically elegant. We enjoyed walking to dinner (Doe's, Freight House), breakfast (Gold Rush Cafe), and to local shops on the square. We visited on a very cold February weekend which made the gas fireplace a much loved accessory. :-) Sharon had snacks and pods for the coffee maker which made us feel so welcomed. The condo. is peaceful, could sleep for days in the bedroom. Thank you so much for offering your place. We can't wait to return."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, perfect location and Sharon’s attention to every detail was superb."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem in downtown Paducah On a weekend that was cold and rainy we felt warm, cozy, and right at home while we sheltered inside next to the fireplace watching riverboats go up and down the river and people up and down broadway. Inside it was quiet, comfortable and peaceful. When we ventured out, the condo was within a block or two of all the things to do in downtown Paducah; restaurants, cocktail bars, boutiques, ice cream parlors, art studios, and the event center, all within walking distance of the condo. You won’t get any closer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying in Sharon’s Airbnb. It was so incredibly clean and nicely decorated. It was in such a nice location….

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Sharon's place for our wedding weekend! We got married just down stairs in Barrel & Bond, so it was the perfect location.

We can't wait to come back and reminisce about the best weekend ever! Thanks again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for grown-ups! Clean and well-stocked with tasteful decor. Best unit in this building.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing apartment Sharon has in downtown Paducah. My wife and I stayed for a long weekend Fri-Mon and only had to get in the car and drive one time for something we wanted to do. So many restaurants, bars and things to do within a 5-10 minute walk. Nice view of the river outside and this was the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. If we visit Paducah again this will be the first place I will look and hope it’s available."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! The space was beautiful and had all the amenities you could all for. We were able to walk to several restaurants, the river fun shopping spots. I highly recommend this space and will definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Paducah!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sharon was such an amazing host and so very thoughtful! My friend and I drove 4 hours for a girls weekend and at check-in we found every amenity you could think of all the way down to provided snacks and coffee! The place is spacious and very eclectic. If you’re a history lover or just someone that admires beautifully restored buildings this stay is a must for you. We woke every morning to the fresh smell of waffle cones from the ice cream shop below us and everything imaginable is within walking distance. The Bully Gorilla Bar is a great place to get drinks and burgers and the Gold Rush Cafe was an amazing breakfast stop. The ambiance and the wonderful hospitality of our host made this a restful and fabulous weekend. I am already planning my next visit!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sharon's place was amazing! The location was perfect. Sharon had thought of everything to give her place a comfortable and homey feel. I would definitely recommend this location to others.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Fox Briar Inn was beyond amazing. I can't say enough great things about the place. It was a perfect home away from home. Sharon is an amazing host, with lots of great recommendations on things to do and places to eat during my stay. I was never disappointed in anything she recommended. The place was stocked with everything you could possibly need including snacks to eat and water in the fridge. Sharon went out of her way to make sure I had everything I could possibly need during my stay. I would recommend this gem to anyone wanting a fantastic downtown experience."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m hesitant to say much as this place is a gem and I selfishly want yo make sure It’s not booked and we can come again.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon's apartment in the Fox Briar in downtown Paducah is a wonderful and cozy little one bedroom with great views of the river from the living room windows - of which there where many adding light and allowing the beauty of the downtown to shine in at every hour of the day. The furnishings are all top notch and great care is obviously taken in the form of cute little touches such as an array of pamphlets for the guests to read to get more aquatinted to the area, water bottles in the fridge (always appreciated in the hot summer), a bowl of assorted snacks, a Keurig with a small selection of teas and coffee, and many other little touches that truly show the guests the heart, beauty, and essense of the town. She spared no expense on the furniture as well, as very comfortable couch facing the 60"" TV in the living room is equipped with mechanical reclining. I could say much more, but space here is limited, so I'll just leave you with this. I love the space. And you, undoubtedly will too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying in this historic bldg, it is very nice, safe and convenient to down town area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon’s place at the Foxbriar is right in the heart of historic Paducah. We rented comfort bikes ($20 from Hooper’s just a half block away) to enjoy the bike trail that runs along the river, but it’s an easy walk from Sharon’s apartment to the American Quilt Museum (which beautifully showcases quilting as an elevated art form), restaurants, ice cream shops, antique and gift stores, and the river flood walls that feature beautifully detailed murals depicting significant local history. All this, plus free parking was so convenient right across the street! We had a wonderful stay, with my parents in an Airbnb just down the hall in the same building (thank you, Sharon, for helping point me in the right direction to find that apartment!). Sharon’s apartment is luxurious, clean, spacious, and comfortable, and the natural light from the windows that face Broadway and the river view are awesome. This relaxing getaway nest in historic Paducah will be a definite repeat for us!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect weekend. We have stayed with Sharon previously.....and will again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sharon was a fabulous host and the residence was perfect!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon’s place was impressive and comfortable. The apartment was meticulously clean; the kitchen well-stocked with cooking implements; and an assortment of snacks available on the counter. The apartment is conveniently located for those who are in Paducah as tourists. Restaurants, shops, and the river wall are all within comfortable walking distance.
Note one: Finding a convenient parking spot at dinner time can be an absolute nightmare. Parking is either on the street or a public lot across from the apartment. We arrived on a Friday evening and circled the block for 30 minutes before finding an empty spot.
Note two: For people sleeping in the front room, the crowds on both Friday and Saturday nights were going strong until midnight (at least), when I gave up trying to read and went to bed.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay. We are low-maintenance travelers, so our interactions with Sharon were minimal. When we did have a question, Sharon answered promptly."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and location in the heart of downtown Paducah. We look forward to visiting again.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOCATION - no other will get you closer to the BEST part of downtown Paducah AND the only parking lot on Broadway. Loved the pix pointing us directly to the off-street entrance. For us, the ELEVATOR was a game-changer as my husband's knees are disintegrating. Owner kindly allowed us to check-in early - 100% excellent experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was absolutely perfect! I am so glad we chose this condo for a girls getaway. The location couldn’t have been better for walking to restaurants, shopping and visiting the National Quilt Museum. We parked our cars in the lot across the street and didn’t use them all weekend. The condo itself is extremely clean, well appointed with extras, such as blankets, games, snacks, kitchen necessities and toiletries! The building itself was quiet and well maintained. I would definitely come back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay right on the river. Beautiful decor and very comfy! Made us feel right at home. Good communication and easy to find. Wonderful weekend getaway and loved all the new shops and restaurants that had opened! -Rices
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! Sharon was amazing. We even had non alcoholic champagne to celebrate our anniversary, and a personalized card from our host.
We were slightly confused about where the entrance was to our place. It probably didn’t help that we arrived in the dark, and were depending on our navigation system. It took us straight to Maiden Alley, but we we couldn’t decide if that was right(being in an alley and all). Anyway, we finally figured it out and were more than satisfied.
Everything was within walking distance. We ate at Max’s and Doe’s Eat Place. Also, we did venture out and pick up some amazing donuts from Red’s.
Downtown Paducah is full of historical richness, and the the facelift of the 100 block of Broadway makes going there to explore even better."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable, well-appointed condo in a fantastic location. Sharon is an outstanding host, and couldn’t have been more helpful. The condo was quiet and felt very private. There was ample parking in the public lot across the street, and we felt it was very safe. As Sharon told us in her messages, we parked the cars when we got there and never used them again til checkout. Great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, an ice cream parlor, and an award-winning bakery are all within an easy walk. We hope to return and explore more of Paducah!"

You can see the river from the front windows which is an added bonus. Dean was very communicative and it was a breeze getting into the unit. We will definitely stay in this beautiful property again. 🍺"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, spotlessly clean, everything in great shape. if you plan on cooking bring utensils and cookware as there is not much to be found in the kitchen. a Keurig coffee maker was provided with a few K-cups, so plan accordingly, but several restaurants and a coffee shop are within a 5 minute walk! Dean was very responsive to my questions, would stay again! Good value, for sure!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay in downtown Paducah! Couldn’t ask for a better room and I would highly recommend to anyone. Everything was very clean and any questions we had were *very quickly* answered by Dean.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were the first stays in Dean’s new space and it was perfect!, Dean is great to work with and very prompt with any questions i had about the stay!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s is a beautiful space. It felt like being in an elegant artistic environment with a homey feeling. The kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed. The bedroom with attached bathroom was super comfortable. I always like the placement of tables bedside. The location was lovely for a river sunrise and easy walk downtown. The drive downtown direct and convenient. Communication with Sarah was outstanding!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Four ladies from Wisconsin came for “Quilt Week” in Paducah KY. This house was the closest to the convention center and other pop-up stores. It is exactly as it looks in the pictures, etc. Very tastefully decorated, yet very comfy and cozy. Sat on the porch enjoying our wine watching all the people leave the quilt show. We ate out most of the time, so did not use the huge kitchen. There are so many wonderful sites there. So even visiting Paducah, it is THE place to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place is adorable, clean, convenient to lots of activities. Just be warned - 2 bed, 2 bath but 2nd bedroom is in front of home and 2nd bathroom is in back of house so if vacationing with another couple - one of them will be wandering through the house at night - other than that - fantastic kitchen, comfortable all the way around."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent little house! Everything was beautiful and spotless when we arrived and Sarah provided plenty of recommendations for restaurants and activities in the area. We lucked out spotting a brochure she left for Land Between the Lakes National recreation area and got to drive through the Bison and Elk Sanctuary on our second day - we got some great shots as we passed a Bison herd literally a foot outside our car!
The whole stay was comfortable even though we had a few rainy days. The house was equipped with literally anything we could have needed for our little getaway. Would absolutely stay here again if we'll be in the area!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location. Loved the backyard, make sure you have mosquito spray if it’s summertime. They have some candles but we still needed spray.
Kitchen was well equipped, we cooked a couple of big meals. Lots of counter space which is nice. Several seating options for gathering around and playing games.
We came in for a concert but fell in love w the town and the vibe. The riverfront area is nice. Superman museum isn’t far and worth the drive. We hope to visit again. We would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location worked out well. No problems at all. Would stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at this lovely home. It was super clean, decorated beautifully, the entrance was welcoming and the nice yard has a fire pit.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming home was equipped with countless amenities and free off-street parking, and an excellent location to everything downtown. Our host, Sarah, beautifully decorated the house for Christmas, and was warm and inviting. We felt very comfortable there as if we were at home. The house was much larger than anticipated and was a welcome surprise. The kitchen was big enough to dance in and was fully stocked with everything you need to cook a meal or two, which we did since we were there for Thanksgiving. I like the fact that the Keurig coffee pot had a filter for coffee grounds since we brought our own ground/bean coffee (we are coffee snobs) My husband was thrilled the toilet paper was of good quality, and not like scratch paper - lol! There is a Kroger 2 miles away and right next door beautiful liquor store - Roof Brothers Wine & Liquors on Park. I have never seen so many wine and Kentucky bourbon selections anywhere. I highly recommend visiting the Quilt Museum and the Country Store in the downtown area. I don't quilt and never will but I was blown away at the work of art done by the quilters, I have great admiration for their skill. I can't think of one thing that would have made the stay any more enjoyable!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house, well decorated, and had everything one could need. Great value. Sarah was super friendly, communicative, helpful, and accommodating."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s house is excellent! It’s like a home away from home with everything you could need —a beautiful house —sparkling clean with super comfortable furniture. Straight to have two bedrooms and two bathrooms my girlfriend and I had an awesome stay here!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great. It was pictured and described perfectly, but it was even better. It was our first time in Paducah and Sarah's communication with all her great tips on restaurants and activities was very helpful. Few blocks off main square, which we liked. Definitely recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication. Perfect place to stay. Walking distance to the down town area. Had everything we needed. Will stay here again if in the area.

Did not take advantage of the fire pit but sat on the back porch which was enjoyable.
Would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was very clean. It was spacious, comfortable, and so cutely decorated. It was on the edge of a neighborhood so it was semi-industrial but it was so cute. There was a front porch and a back porch, both nicely shaded. The backyard is spacious and private. It’s an easy walk to the downtown shops, restaurants and riverfront. The coffee shop right around the corner was a gem, and they also serve coffee cocktails and wine.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We relocated to Paducah from Seattle and stayed at this Airbnb while our personal belongings were being shipped across country. This home is truly a home away from home. We ended up staying 13 mights and we were very comfortable with the entire home. We had everything we needed and the location was great for walks by the river and into downtown for a good meal. We had a few little things that came up and the host was so responsive that they were but a slight blip in the stay. I highly recommend this property for your next stay in Paducah!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house went beyond my expectations. The pictures don't do justice to the lovely spaciousness and comfort of this home. The interior decoration is sophisticated without forfeiting comfort. The backyard is enclosed and ample. The location is perfect, close to the riverfront and historic downtown as well a loop that connects you to all the major access routes. Some traffic noises, but the neighborhood is quiet, the space is private, and there's a coffee shop right around the corner. It was just such a wonderful home to spend my vacation back in my hometown. The price was more than affordable and communication and check-in was easy breezy."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was nice and clean for our short stay. We had a issue with the living room TV not working, which was no fault of their own. The severe weather caused an issue with the outlet. The host was very responsive and apologized for the inconvenience. It really wasn't an issue but we wanted to make her aware of it before the next guest. The back yard was large and fenced in which was perfect for our dog! Overall this was a great place to stay! Also her neighbor was a very friendly guy!"

Kevin also gave recommendations of nearby eateries and places to shop.
I would definitely stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience using AirBnB for lodging and was a little hesitant at first. Kevin, owner/host, stayed in contact from the time of the reservation all the way through the stay, which was greatly appreciated. Kevin provided information about the local area, suggested restaurants and grocery stores. His home provided necessities such washcloths/towels, soaps/shampoos, etc.; there was even a washer and dryer, if needed.
The home is exactly as advertised. It was great seeing these old historic homes being renovated with a modern touch, but still have the historic charm. Keep up the great work Kevin and thanks for providing an alternative to the chain hotels.
I look forward to my next visit to Paducah and reservations at Kevin's Shotgun House."

The house had great space, was well decorated with a comfortable bed, well appointed rooms and a good balance of color. The kitchen had everything we needed. The yard was nice, private and provided parking. The house was in a good location. As I look at my pictures, I feel like packing my bags for another visit to Paducah!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The shotgun house is very roomy (bigger than it looks!), with lots of comfortable spaces to read and relax. The kitchen and eating area are open, with a lovely view of the side yard through an enormous picture window. My husband and I get up at different times, so we appreciated having the bedroom far away from the kitchen, giving both of us privacy. The patio was a nice place to start my day. Great value for the space. The 10- to 12-minute walk to downtown worked well for us. We didn't want to drive much."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a haven. What a wonderfully restored property - its pictures do not do it justice. Once inside, you’ll know you chose a great property."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here for the eclipse. The house had so much character, and had everything included to make it feel like home away from home. The overall area was quiet, private, and very peaceful. The kitchen window with the small dinner table was such a beautiful highlight of the house. We basically sat there the whole time we spent indoors. The fire pit and private yard was another special highlight. we spent our last night having a bonfire and ordering takeout. Couldnt have asked for a better weekend getaway to witness the eclipse."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My second and longer stay (2024) at Kevin’s was as consistent and pleasurable as the first (2023). A world excursionist (see his wall photos), Kevin is tuned into travelers’ needs: safe Quiet place, comfortable bed, secure parking, strong Wi-Fi, varied streaming, ample basic-food, cleaning and laundry staples, working appliances: i.e., no skimping! Plus: various critters chirping, hopping, scampering or posing through the backyard (including an adventurous river otter!). 10-min drive from this very Quiet area to downtown and in either E/W direction for daily shopping. Kevin clearly likes hosting travelers and visitors to his town: A personable upholding Host with the most!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My son stayed here for six weeks. Don't let the industrial neighborhood scare you away. My son felt safe and the neighborhood was very quiet and close to lots of things!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose to celebrate my 41st burthday here and i had an amazing time creatkng memories and exploring the area. My time spent at Kevin's gem of a home was restful & restorative. The home is easy to find and the Paducah/Metropolis area was very easy to navigate. From the moment I entered the home it was apparent Kevin cares for this place and his guest immensely. Each room is carefully curated with interesting, warm, and thoughtful decor. I enjoyed each room & space, including the bricked patio in the backyard. He makes sure that his guest have exactly what's needed to enjoy their stay. There was even finger nail polish remover and cotton balls in the bathroom. Details like this matter 🙌🏽😩💛 This was my 1st air bnb experience and it definitely won't be the last thanks to host like Kevin. Thanks again for being a lovely host."

This is our second time staying here, and Kevin was just as awesome as he was the first time staying here! We’ll definitely be back for our next trip to Paducah."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Art-filled, beautifully decorated , fully furnished home with tree-/chirping-birds- filled backyard that surrenders you to Peace. Safe, walkable quiet neighborhood. Stocked, equipped kitchen, just bring your personals and relax. Very clean; comfy bed, close to everyday shopping, gas stations. A break from DT scene. Great host who anticipates what weary travelers need and desire."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning place to stay in a great little town. So much more to see than we expected.
The house itself is stunning. Much bigger than we anticipated. Wish we’d have been able to stay another day, just to relax in the garden etc.

You have everything you need for a great stay. Kevin is super responsive and all in all an awesme human.
The bed is soft, if you like that.
The Wi-Fi held for zoom calls.
We truly found a home here for a few days."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house within walking distance of downtown Paducah. Communication with Kevin was smooth too. The place is huge too!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, helpful host and close to activities are just a few of the reasons to book this house. It is comfortable enough that we just wanted to curl up with a book and not leave. The kitchen is well equipped and activities in downtown Paducah are very close by. You will enjoy your stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness, what a beautiful home! It has everything you need for a weekend or an extended stay. There were snacks on the counter and even a vase of fresh flowers! Kevin is an exceptional host. I can’t wait to stay again soon."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner & I stayed here on our little hiking getaway. We ventured north into Shawnee National Forest territory for the hikes, but it was beyond wonderful to come back to a hot shower and dining options. One of my common complaints with airbnb’s is that you have to remember to bring EVERYTHING: salt, coffee, coffee filters, sugar for aforementioned coffee, cooking oil, etc…, and it makes it so so easy to pack up an entire kitchen shelf for a 4 day trip. This place was so kindly stocked with the necessities, the basics, and just about everything you’d maybe forget. There’s a stocked spice cabinet, some snacks left out, cold water bottles, a carton of eggs, a can of tomato paste (in case of emergencies), and so much more. It was only about 5-10 mins away from anything we wanted to do downtown. So grateful to this host & I hope this space continues to be enjoyed by all the guests passing through."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was a great host and has a hidden gem of a place. Easy to find, very clean, and a very fair price. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to the Paducah area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was an incredibly warm and hospitable host! There was a note from him when we arrived at the home that told us to make ourselves at home, leaving a few kitchen staples for us in case we needed them! He also had an extensive list of restaurants and local attractions on a desk in the front room, making it easy to figure out what we wanted to do while we were in Paducah. The home is cozy, clean and quiet- the perfect place to come back to after a long day of exploring the area. we had an amazing stay and would rent from Kevin again in a heartbeat! :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. I was shocked opening up the doors to such beautiful rooms. Not like other airbnbs that are clearly Ikea and target only (no offense). Each room has such character. Kevin provides instructions for everything in the house, around town, comfy bed, snacks, toiletries, everything was sooo perfect! Will always want to stay here when in Paducah visiting family ❤️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's place was fabulous! I wish we could have stayed longer. The house was so beautiful and welcoming. It was spotless! The bed was very comfortable. We checked in late, so Kevin made sure he left some lights on for us. He responded quickly to all of my texts. He leaves a couple of baskets with snacks, which was a nice touch. You will be very happy if you stay here! We will definitely be back! Can'twait to spend more time in Paducah!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay. Kevin was kind and responsive. The house has lovely high ceilings and beautiful natural light. Lovely private backyard.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed Kevin's place. We especially enjoyed reading on the back patio under the trees. I loved having breakfast and coffee by the window in the kitchen. We slept very well on the bed and I appreciated the desk. The floors were beautiful and we especially enjoyed the many decorative touches. Congratulations to Kevin and his wife for beautiful renovation of a historic house that might otherwise have been torn down with only grass in its place.
We also enjoyed the National Quilt Museum, downtown Paducah, the murals on the river floodwall, and the river walk. I enjoyed an evening walk through the neighborhood noting the many improvements that have been made. We could easily have spent several more days there."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place to stay! Very peaceful and warm cozy feeling. I would live there if I could! Kevin was an easy helpful host. Would most definitely recommend to future guests.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a peaceful getaway this is it! It is a well maintained and clean property. You don’t need to bring anything but food and clothes.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Air BNB was absolutely darling! I loved my stay here and would absolutely stay again.

The historic building is gorgeously restored and decorated so thoughtfully."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's place was a great find! The pictures in the listing didn't do it justice. Everything was beautiful, and the fresh flowers were a nice touch. We loved having breakfast at the table with the sun shining on us. The house was clean, even the sheets smelled good! There were so many added touches that we don't see in other airbnbs. Kevin was very responsive and gave us pointers on where to go to shop and eat. The neighborhood was not as pristine as others in town, but we always felt safe, and it was quiet. It was close to downtown and the floodwall murals by the river.
We look forward to a return trip and stay there again. I'm so glad we chose to stay there instead of the other choices we were considering."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very reasonable rates, convenient location"

Kevin does a great job with the “extras!” We appreciated the lovely fresh flowers on the tables and the basket of snacks was nice when we arrived hungry! The kitchen had everything you need! Bed was very comfortable and the throw blankets came in handy during a few chilly evenings. Back yard is fenced and private. Daffodils were in bloom which was refreshing for a Minnesotan in February!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve never been to Paducah before but Kevin’s place will give me a good reason to come back. His hospitality and how quickly he responded to me really stood out. A great guy with a great place !!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worth every penny, great host, private house, although downtown the location feels remote due to lack of neighbors and a relatively quiet street, location is within 15-20 minutes of anything you need, house is historic but renovated to give a cozy homey feel. Kitchen has all the conveniences you could possibly need, including plenty of snacks. This is always my #1 choice when I frequently come to town for business."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was just as listed. I don’t think they have forgotten anything with this AirBNB. Plenty of linens, towels, extra blankets in baskets for snuggling in for the night, basket on counter full of goodies. It honestly had everything and then some."

Kevin thought of everything plus some to make our stay Comfortable. I adore this old home and the price was amazing. I will stay here every time I visit my family. This house made me feel right at home."

What I will miss the most is sitting at the little table having my breakfast as I watch nature and the sun bursting through the big window in the morning. I really felt like I was ""at home"", and if that place was for sale, I would buy it in a heartbeat!
The Decor, cleanliness and everything Kevin makes accessible(supplies) to the guests is amazing. This home was a retreat and gift to myself and I would definitely want to stay there again. Thank you, Kevin, for your EXCELLENCE and for your hospitality! Warmly- Nancy"

This house is spotless and set up to make your trip a pleasant one!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was so beautiful! Sky high ceilings and so beautifully decorated! I loved the framed newspaper clippings of the history of the house. Kevin had everything in mind when prepping this house for guests. So many blankets and tons of last minute groceries one would forget. the location was in a quiet neighborhood with quick access to all the important places and so many delivery options for food. I have to give so many compliments to Kevin for accommodating us on short notice. Our plans for Memphis got cancelled due to power outages and kevin was right there to pick up the slack.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well, we have been staying in Airbnb’s for over two months, and I thought the best was found several days ago… An amazing place in West Fork, MO or maybe Arkansas.. we have stayed in so many places they blend together after a while, but this space in Paducah, Kentucky is so special, old, updated, and different, and has so much character and history and charm! Probably not everyone’s cup of tea, but if you enjoy renovated, smartly decorated, historical homes, check this out! It is clean, complete with washer and dryer… kitchen with spices, refrigerator with water, milk, juice and even beer (not beer fans, but it is was there to enjoy) Responsive host!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel like I can’t say enough good things about Kevin’s house, it was beautiful, homey, artsy, well stocked, and absolutely perfect. The house itself was very clean and well taken care of, and Kevin was very quick with responses. This was also probably the most well stocked Airbnb we had been to, lots of extras of things in case you forgot to bring something. I loved all of the art on the walls too and the decorating truly felt like you were at home and cozy. You’re also pretty close to downtown and plenty of great pubs and restaurants. We went to the Freight House and loved it! If you’re thinking about booking this house, just do it, you won’t regret it!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house! We loved staying here it was super comfortable and very close to downtown. Can’t wait to stay here again! One of my very favorite Airbnb’s ever :)

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can honestly say this is one of my favorite Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. It was so cute, nicely decorated, comfortable, and Kevin was an amazing host.

And then some. Every part of the house is beautifully decorated and so incredibly comforting. Kevin is also a wonderful, communicative host and was always ready to be sure that our stay was to our liking. It absolutely was! Would 100% recommend, as it was easily one of, if not the best, Airbnb I’ve ever booked."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfect! We thoroughly enjoyed the whole stay. We used the grill and everything was already there. The fridge is well stocked.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay here. It was just as described, clean, and comfy. It’s the perfect location. You are in the midst of downtown and 5 minutes away from any commercial stores you may want to visit. Everything we wanted to do was a walk away. We ate at several local restaurants, and just walked around enjoying the atmosphere surrounding downtown.
I would definitely stay here again. We felt right at home, and nothing was lacking. We were very satisfied with our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our one night stay. Ella’s place is a perfect location to explore downtown Paducah. You can park your car and walk to the river, restaurants, breweries, and shops. We will definitely be back."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh my goodness, this is just THE coolest space to stay in! Set in a historical building, two blocks from the river, this space features high vaulted ceilings and interior brick walls - the photos don't do it justice. Neighbors are super quiet, and you're right smack in the middle of a district with phenomenal restaurants all around. Bed was great, as was shower; bathroom is HUGE; AC/Heat is super fast and responsive; everything was just meticulously laid out and VERY clean. The first thing my wife said, when we initially walked in, was ""you did good!"" with a big smile (I made the reservations). All in all, a fabulous stay in a seriously cool lofted space; and we can't wait to make our next reservations there and stay again - as Paducah is a fascinating town with a rich history (we overnighted this time, on our way to St. Louis; but now we want to return and spend a weekend there exploring the museums). THANK YOU Ella & Allyson!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was beautiful, this place epitomizes the art district feel of the arts district it is located in. The decor here truly made it feel like home. First thing I said to my wife was I could live here!"

We would 100% recommend and stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is in a great location. I was there for work for a few days. Lots to do in the area. Wish I had brought my scooter with me to check out all the cool things around. I loved the murals along the river way. The airbnb itself was just as described and pictured. The building is really neat. Had a little trouble finding the key box. Didn't realize it was behind me when looking at the door on the floor.
I left and came back and took a second look but noticed it the second time. There are many little extras provided in the airbnb should you choose to use them. Unfortunately, I fell ill and had to leave a day early so I didn't get to check out a lot of the area but I definitely plan to return and bring the hubby with me next time. The bed was a little stiff for me but I survived and it wouldn't keep me from staying there again! The host was quick to respond when I message her also. Thanks Ella! :)"

Some of best food we have had the pleasure of eating in Midwest. Very quiet. Super safe area, only one homeless person we noticed in area. Wife and I are 70, and really appreciated elevator to second floor unit, doubt there are many other such accommodations in immediate area. Unit was fantastic, no complaints.

Easy communication when we had questions. Walking around the area felt very safe. Close by were the walls of Murals, the river, the quilt museum, plenty of restaurants and bars. Wish we had more than 1 night to spend there, but we got a lot in. The 2pm check-in is great, because we could unload and then have plenty of daylight to walk around, etc. Parking was free and very convenient. BTW - the best breakfast in the world was Gold Rush, 2 short blocks away."

Plenty of free parking around the area, kitchen well equipped, bed comfy and area really quiet even though it’s on the main drag. The area felt really safe. Would stay again if I’m the area."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In town for my class reunion and was the same weekend as BBQ on the River so the location couldn't have been better. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Actually ran into Ella at a local boutique, she was super friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. The location was also relatively quiet except for morning trash pick up at the nearby restaurant but that happens at home sometimes too! haha Definitely not complaint worthy. We would definitely consider staying with Ella again in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As usual, my husband and I had a great time in Paducah! This apartment was perfect for a couple. It was clean, stylish and well-stocked. All the places we like to visit were with in easy walking distance. I was a little worried that there was not a dedicated parking spot for the rental but we had no problem finding parking the public lot across the street. You might want to keep that in mind when you plan your arrival time, though. When the bars get busy, that lot fills up. Make sure to follow Ella's instructions for checking in. We were sent an automated message as well, but Ella's instructions were the ones that worked best for us! It is a great place and I highly recommend it!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ella’s is perfect to enjoy a night out and come back to a beautifully decorated comfortable place for the night. We will definitely go again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place in a great location. Very clean and well appointed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The ability to walk to restaurants and being close to the river (and a train!) was super convenient. Free parking and easy check-in are also great. Loved all the foxes and shampoo was great. Suuuper clean and bed was very comfortable. Only not great thing (which is shown in the photos) is only half the window has shutters. The sun sets on that side of the building, so trying to get to bed early after and before a long day of driving is tough. There's also a street lamp right outside the windows, so it's surprisingly bright all night. And 5:30 am Monday morning is when the trash truck backs in to the businesses right under the bedside window."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, reasonably priced. All around a good booking."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing one-night stay at Ella’s place. First thing I noticed was how fresh and clean the home smelled. Everything was super clean.

She even had toiletries such as shampoo, soap, lotion, and laundry detergent available, just in case someone forgot to pack it. I would absolutely love to stay there again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Everything was clean and of high quality. The bed was extremely comfortable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay to visit the historic downtown of Paducah! We were right in the middle of everything—restaurants, ice cream shops, antique and gift stores, the American Quilt Museum (really, an amazing art museum!), a walk along the flood walls with beautifully painted murals of significant local history, a nice bike trail along the river (we rented comfort bikes a half block away at Hooper’s for $20!). The furnishings and accommodations were perfect, clean and comfortable. Ella made everything easy! We’ll certainly be back to stay."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location was perfect for visiting downtown Paducah. We used public parking lot across from the loft. Unloading in the ally was a little tricky but we managed it. We walked over to the levy and Ohio River a couple of blocks away. We loved eating at The Freight House. Pricey but worth it. We enjoyed the little galleries in that area. The loft was very clean. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was large and clean. AC worked great. We would return.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an absolute GREAT find, and the downtown area was so cool!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and nice accommodation. Only complaint is the lack of window shades. It’s to bright in the morning and I was unable to sleep during the day because it was to bright. If that can be fixed I will love to stay there again.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft was ideal! I love staying in eclectic, unique spots and this loft was AMAZING! I even picked a book off the shelf and read myself to sleep. I absolutely will be staying with her again. Thoughtfully appointed space. Felt even better than a boutique hotel I recently stayed in during a visit to Chicago!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A bit pricey and just a little hard to figure out how to enter (not their fault, everything in Paducah has weird access via alley ways) but the comfort is worth the price and location of all the things downtown Paducah. Home is clean, the bed is super soft, and the people covering the booking are super thoughtful and kind. No crazy requests to clean and then charge you a hefty cleaning fee on top. Just leave things tidy and set the temp right. There's even a stackable washer and dryer if one would need that during a stay. Will definitely return !!! You'll love it, too. The unit has everything you need from toiletries, linen, and kitchen ware. I loved it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location, right where you need to be for any downtown activity. Perfectly described and the perfect size place for two."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was such a great location. I’m from Paducah originally and I’m well versed in the area and we couldn’t have found a better location for the weekend. We had such a great time walking around all the local shops and eating at the restaurants downtown. The place had everything we needed and would definitely book again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ella’s space was a dream. Right downtown, safe building, comfortable bed, lush towels and beautifully decorated! We can’t wait to return!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really liked this place. It was stylish, very clean with a great historic small town feel. The only thing I would note is the king bed is not as comfy if you're over 200lbs (per my husband's feedback). With that being said, totally worth it and hope to come back again in our next road trip."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome space right in the middle of downtown, short walk to anywhere."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location near the river and downtown. Quiet and comfortable.

Will be recommending Ella and this space for any friends/colleagues that are interested in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ella and Allyson are amazing hosts. I believe Ella is the owner of the properties and Allyson is the property manager. Anyway, they were amazing to work with. I had a couple of silly issues. They jumped all over it and it turned out to be just user error. If I'm ever in the area you better believe I'm going to stay in one of their places!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were glad to find this gym when we went through Paducah. We made a very last-minute reservation and Ella was quick to communicate, friendly, and her place was spotless. We had a very long, difficult trip and I was so relieved to have a place that was clean, comfy, and felt safe. The location can’t get any better. It was a few steps away from lots of cool shops and a couple of low key cocktail lounges. Loved it!🖤"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ella’s place was very clean and comfortable. It was surprisingly very quiet even on a Friday night. We felt like we could relax and be at home, which was much-needed. Once we figured out how to enter the building and the studio, it was easy to access every time. The ambiance of the building is so nice. The apartment is in a wonderful location: close to the river, within walking distance to the shops and restaurants. I love how the host doesn’t use strong soaps and fragrances on the towels, linens or in the rooms. The bathroom toiletries are very well-stocked. The kitchen has basic supplies. We had a lovely time and would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Ella’s place was awesome I will definitely be staying with her every chance I get. She provides an excellent service and always responds immediately. Great place to stay.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ella’s place was very clean, cozy and cute. We had everything we needed to cook breakfast both mornings. We were able to walk to lunch, dinner, coffee, and antique shops. It was a great place for our end-of-the-year restful getaway before the new year starts."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ella's place was perfect for our two night stay in Paducah. The unit is spacious and has a charming industrial feel with tall ceilings and exposed brick / ductwork. Decor is on point; we particularly enjoyed the Kentucky craft cocktail wall pieces. Access was a breeze and the building itself is very cool. Plenty of restaurants / bars within walking distance.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Enjoyed our stay in Fox Briar Loft. Saw 2 steam boats come in with passengers right outside our door. Nice shops and restaurants nearby. Easy to get around. The loft was beautifully decorated has lots of essentials. Would stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a BEAUTIFULLY decorated loft! The location was perfect and within walking distance of so many wonderful things to see and do. Fabulous location to walk to the river and enjoy the passing barges. Very safe location. The loft experience was really fun. The host paid attention to all details and made the experience perfect! Loved our stay in Puducah.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable loft! Exactly where we needed it to be, walking distance was great when you wanted to explore downtown and the local restaurants. Only a 12 minute drive to all popular and major places, which was a plus for us. It was exactly what we were looking for to visit family and very clean. We were a bit confused getting there at dark and where the closest place to park was but had we been there during daylight like originally planned then I think it would have been way easier! Would definitely stay here again! Downtown Kentucky is gorgeous!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot! Comfy and cozy!perfect location

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't miss out on staying in this beautiful and historic loft! This place was perfect for our weekend getaway to Paducah and is in the cutest historic downtown area. Amazing style, cleanliness, and privacy. You have everything you need and more! Ella was great to communicate with and our whole experience was easeful from check-in to check-out. She also provides tips on local attractions and fun cocktails to try during your stay. We loved being able to walk everywhere from the riverfront, to delicious restaurants, to the cutest shops! The loft is conveniently located above a creamery which enticed us to some late-night ice cream runs. If you're heading to Paducah, book this place before it's gone!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ella’s place is great. Perfectly located downtown with great views and access to shops.
Ella’s place is better than advertised and she is a prompt communicator."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best air bnbs I have ever stayed at. We needed a place in a pinch due to bad weather for camping and stumbled on this air bnb. Not only was the place beautiful, comfortable, and so clean, but the surrounding area was spectacular. We so enjoyed our time there!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ella's condo at the Foxbriar is an ideal place to stay in Paducah. Check-in was easy and directions for entry and parking were very specific. The studio is massive with a big kitchen and gigantic bathroom. Very comfy bed and couches and the room gets loads of natural light. The best part is the location, of course. You're literally just steps away from Kirchoff's, Etcetera Cafe, Max's Kitchen, The Johnson Bar, and everything else downtown has to enjoy. The ONLY downside is that noise echoes in Maiden Alley, which might be a con for light sleepers. I would absolutely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So much to walk to and super cute ☺️

Bakery and Coffee shop just around the corner for Breakfast and A HUGE delicious T-Bone with a glass of wine before bed all without even having to move the car after arriving! We will definitely stay again! Oh AND Ella’s place had a comfy bed and lots of hot water in the shower! You won't be sorry if you pick this place! ❤️"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay. We requested to book at the last minute and Ella and Allyson were super helpful and responsive in finalising the reservation. The apartment is beautiful - lovely high ceilings, comfy bed and spotlessly clean. Everything we could have wished for! We had a nice dinner nearby at Doe's and ate breakfast by the river which was lovely. Parking out front was secure and everyone we spoke to in town showed us true southern hospitality. So glad we came across this place. Thank you so much!"

Its such a cute place and we loved the decorations, it definitely made us feel right at home, the location couldn’t have been more perfect either, it’s in walking distance to all of the shops and restaurants downtown Paducah has to offer!"
,,,"I didn’t even get an apology.
Booked this air bnb at 10:15p. They have it listed as keyless entry and automatic bookings.
I was about 2.5 hours away at the time of booking. The check in window is 11p-1a.
House manual said each guest gets an individual code to enter.
Message at 11:30 “Hi! I’m about an hour away - what’s my code?”
No response.
Message at 12:30 “okay well? I guess I’ll go to a hotel?”
No response. No apology. But accepted my refund request.
I expect a lot more from super hosts."
,,,"Horrible host who wasn’t helpful about check in time. I waited 30 minutes outside door trying codes over and over again, then contacting host, who didn’t respond until 15 minutes to no avail. She insisted the codes work, by sending me texts that said, follow the instructions, app says door is open, both doors are unlocked, let me know, then sent her phone number. As I talked to her she still convinced me the codes work, so she had me try 2 more times before she gave me the over ride codes. She sounded rough on the phone when talking to her. The snack basket wasn’t restocked and there was no extra toilet paper in the apartment. This is the worst AirBnB I’ve stayed. If she was trying to make a point to prevent us from staying there again, Mission Accomplished ! This place should not be advertised."
