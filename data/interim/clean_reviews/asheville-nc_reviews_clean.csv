2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Luxury living in the mountains. The views are spectacular from anywhere in the house. Especially the view from the picture window behind the bathtub.. wow! Really nice welcome basket waiting for us upon request. Very comfortable and clean.
Would stay again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything that’s already been said about the Summit House is spot on. The views were spectacular, the house was spotless and beautiful, and the amenities were top notch. Bed was super comfortable, too! The best part were the little details. The welcome note and bottle of wine on arrival, extra towels labeled for the dogs, and the detailed instructions and responses from Matthew and the team. Would recommend over and over."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely LOVE this space! The location is breathtaking, the interior design is clean, light, and gorgeous, and Matthew and team were an absolute delight. Highly recommend booking this space :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is truly an incredible place to stay. Matthew was very professional and responsive. Him and his team were available when we needed them and even shared some restaurant recommendation to improve our stay. Would highly recommend the summit house to anyone.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at the Summit House, and once again it was one for the books. My mother and I spent a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend here and it could not have been any more perfect. The stunning views cannot be put into words. The accommodations are stellar and I wish I could have stayed longer. Matthew and team are top tier hosts who will make you feel welcome and are genuinely very helpful with any questions you may have. If you stay here, you very well may become a repeat guest!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Summit House was even more beautiful than the pictures. We could not have had a better experience at this location. It was the perfect trip in every way.
In addition to being an incredible home, the support for this property is top notch. Matthew and Ashley went out of their way to ensure we had anything we could possibly want. I cannot recommend this property enough, you will love it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great time at Matthew's cabin! Definitely the nicest cabin I've ever stayed at. The wall of windows and the view was breathtaking. The bed was comfortable, the shower was luxurious, the furniture, kitchen, layout, and general usability and comfort of the entire experience was very good. Would recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The views from this house really do take your breath away! We learned that weddings take place at this property and now I know why! My husband and I had the chance to enjoy our babymoon at this stunning property and we were not disappointed. One of our highlights was the private dinner by Chef Ashley. Also It’s not very often you find Airbnbs of this caliber that allow pets, so we were thrilled we could bring our goldendoodle along with us. The hosts were top notch & gave recommendations for trails in the surrounding area too. Not a far stray from Asheville, this property is worth every penny. Don’t hesitate to book!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home to come and relax. Super comfortable and simply has everything you need. The views are amazing!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is nestled on a beautiful mountain side with no neighbors in direct sight giving you a peaceful retreat vibe! From the moment you step through the doors and from every room you have breathtaking views. My husband and I felt right at home and were easily able to relax and unplug! Asheville is right up the road (25 min) if you want to spend a day exploring the food + breweries.
Matthew and his team were pleasant, super responsive, and proactive in offering recommendations in the surrounding areas.
I highly recommend booking the summit house on your next mountain getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the place, amazing views and such a relaxing setup for us and our dogs to chill after long hikes. Super responsive and helpful hosts. Such a great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,love the place. we had a great time. fantastic view. very responsive management
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house and the views are so so stunning, we were amazed as soon as we stepped in. Matthew was extremely responsive and very accommodating. I would highly recommend this place, and can’t wait to come back someday!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As amazing were the landscape views, I must speak on the customer support team first. By far the .ost pleaseant and fast replies and their attentiveness to your concerns/questions/requests was so thorough and made every depth of my needs full filed. Outstanding isn't enough to represent their customer service, they go above and beyond—(Ashley is a superstar BTW!)—to make sure you everything is up-to-par or beyond. We had the best experience, I highly recommend this stay, the beds were clean, kitchen was tidy, and bathrooms were spotless.
The team did me so many favors on the extra services i requested and not once was i disappointed. 11☆/10☆ + out of this world service, and the views are breathtaking. Hesitating to book will be your only regret if you do.
The Sunrise here will melt together your significant other's soul with yours, it was surreal, like biblical art to say the least. We both agreed it was by far the most romantic viewscape we'd seen.
Thank you for everything!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked this airbnb as a last minute get away and was blown away! The photos were already amazing but it was even more incredible in person. The home itself was beautiful, modern, spotless, and had everything you could possibly need. The sunset and sunrise were magical and I highly recommend waking up early enough to catch it. The house was easy to access and the gated community made it feel extra safe. The location was wonderful and less than a 30 min drive to downtown Asheville.
Matthew and his team were extremely responsive and quick to answer and questions I had! I would definitely book this airbnb again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,as great as the photos are. they don’t do justice to the breath-taking beauty of this house and location. paradise times 1000. and matthew and his team are amazing - the respond in 2 minutes to any questions. absolutely will be back. !!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at this beautiful little mountain retreat. The views were amazing and the home was a cozy retreat. Every room in the home was clean and welcoming and thoughtful, from the well-stocked kitchen to the custom shower (seriously, the best!). The host was very responsive before and during our stay, offering local recommendations and making sure we had everything we needed. We can’t wait to come back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came here for the wife's birthday. the pictures do the place no justice. Matthew and everyone was easy to deal with and quick to respond if I had any questions.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a ""destination"" Airbnb in my mind, what am I trying to say... there are many places to explore yet my wife and I have done that on past visits to this area. This home.... its construction, interior design finishes and overall esthetics are suburb. I served Marriott Hotels for 35 years and worked closely with all their Brands including Ritz-Carlton, this home exceeds any lodging expectations for me and I would believe most everyone! I cannot give any better praise to Matthew and his team Ashley & Bruna. We do hope to return to The Summit. Best regards, John & Patty Marotto"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and views. Definitely recommend this AirBnB.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful and beautiful cabin with everything you need to enjoy a relaxing vacation. Our hosts were very responsive and communicative. A bit of information that others might find helpful: we were able to accomplish the drive up with a front wheel drive compact suv. We arrived in the evening, so having a flashlight in hand was helpful to unload. The cabin is high up on mt Pisgah and there aren’t any streetlights so it is a bit dark, but the wonderful thing about this is there is very limited light pollution so you have a beautiful view of the stars on a clear night! The windows are big and beautiful. There aren’t any shades and the bedroom does face east, so I would anticipate being able to see the sunrise every morning. It can be very bright, so as long as you prepare with an eye mask or covering, you’ll be able to sleep in more comfortably. The place is equipped with a propane fireplace which is remote controlled so you can instantly click on the cozy vibes with the push of a button."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Like everyone else, we thought the space and views were even more spectacular than in the photos. Lots of thoughtful design, furnishing, and little touches that made it feel like home. Matthew and the team communicated everything very clearly and were super responsive. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful. Watching the sunrise over the mountains and the gorgeous view make this home an extraordinary place. It is stocked with everything you need and more. Matthew is the perfect host and communicates with you every step of the way. I did not want to leave, and I will be back! The location is fantastic. Close to Asheville and hundreds of trails in the Pisgah National Forest. Thank you for such a fantastic stay!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just like the other reviews, we were absolutely blown away by this place. The photos don’t do it justice. We’ve never been to a more beautiful and perfect home. It made our trip to Asheville. It is so peaceful and equipped with absolutely anything you could need. All the little touches were very much appreciated. I’ve already recommended it to my coworkers. Thank you again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,we were speechless. it is even more beautiful than the photos. we spent our anniversary here and we most definitely will spend more here. it’s very easy to find and is very private which we absolutely loved! 10/10 !!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time visiting the Summit House and it was just as magical as we remembered! The views, the location, the quiet - it was the perfect getaway to relax and unwind. The house is absolutely beautiful and Matthew, Ashley and Bruna were so communicative and kind throughout our stay. The location is so great - you feel very secluded but are a quick 30 min door-to-door do downtown Asheville. We can't recommend this place enough, and plan to return as often as we can!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a peaceful place, private and can’t describe what an amazing views, can’t wait to go back.
Communication was incredible and super helpful."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular views, wonderful deck, fully equipped kitchen, private, quiet, peaceful.
We will look to go back next year! LOVED the house and Hosts are very responsive!
Perfection!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an amazing place! Had a few people ask where this was so hooray for bragging rights. Fireplace was a little tricky to get working but with some patience we were able to fire it up.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing, would recommend over and over again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,A really special place. Hosts were great communicators. Breathtaking views to wake up to and extremely spacious and modern! A truly fantastic location with an easy drive into downtown Asheville and so close to Blue Ridge Highway.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Modern place with great views and living space. Very communicative host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I spent our one year anniversary here. Great place, amazing views, very clean. Morning coffee on the balcony is a must. The drive up the mountain was easy. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Easy 25-30min drive to Asheville."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Million dollar views! Phenomenal comfortable home with a great open concept layout. Beautiful balcony and everything you need n more to cook great meals and unplug!
Hosts are responsive and friendly!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house was amazing! The views were great and everything was nice and clean when we arrived. The house provides a great balance between a quiet retreat and relatively close proximity to downtown Asheville. There were nearby hiking trails that we enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this home to family and friends. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Incredible stay. I highly recommend Summit House. Matthew and his team were very hospitable and reachable during our entire stay. 5 stars all around. Thanks again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Honestly one of the most stunning and peaceful places we’ve stayed! We’ve been visiting Asheville for years and stayed at dozens of airbnbs and this one has taken first place in our hearts. Couldn’t recommend any more. The views are unbeatable.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING PLACE TO STAY !!! ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!!! A REAL LIFE PARADISE :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning view! It was exactly what I was looking for!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view! This spot is very private, literally at the top of a mountain with the next neighbor not in eye or ear shot. So you if are looking for a spot that is right in the downtown Ashville mix, this is the not the place for you (the drive is about 30 mins away from downtown). If you are looking for a quite, private, peaceful getaway with an incredible view and modern space and amenities, this is your spot!
The hosts were proactive in their communication, offered clear directions, and local suggestions, and were responsive.
The space was modern, loaded with all things you need in the kitchen (we cooked) and do laundry (i actually want to get the washer and dryer they have, they were great!).
Following the directions the hosts provided, it was easy to find and easy to get into the property.
A bottle of wine was welcoming us when we walked in, which is always a nice touch and appreciated :)
Overall, we would highly recommend this spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t even put into words how incredible our stay was here. You open the front door & are immediately surrounded by the beauty of the majestic mountains. We were in absolute awe & overwhelmed with gratitude throughout the entire duration of our stay. The floor to ceiling windows provide you with stunning views no matter where you are in the house. Waking up early afforded us breathtaking sunrises on the deck with coffee followed by yoga overlooking the mountains while basking in the sunshine. We spent hours reading on the most comfortable couch we have ever sat on that makes you feel like you’re truly on cloud 9. Everything in this home is pristine. Bedroom, bathroom, shower, kitchen, living area, outdoor deck, it’s all immaculate- a dose of luxury living at its best. The hosts were excellent as well. We absolutely loved our stay & are already planning a time to come back. Hands down the best airbnb for any mountain lover. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house and the view was stunning. Great place to disconnect.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I came up for the weekend to relax in the mountains as my Birthday gift. I feel like I was gone for a week because we unwinded immediately in the peace of the views and the grace of the home. The bathtub was amazing to watch the sunrise from. Having a morning coffee on the side porch in the cool mountain morning air was reviving. Hanging out in the living room watching the sky all day felt like heaven. We were a little worried about not having WIFI but it was no problem at all my AT&T service was fine there and his Verizon service was ok most of the way. The guidelines & directions they give you are all you need. I can't say enough good things about this place. It blew us away and melted weeks of work stress away. I loved staying here and I plan on returning again in the future because it was so special. Thank you Matthew and Ashley for your responsive communication and accommodating ease and grace around everything. We appreciate you all!
-Nicole & Dan"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The location was breathtaking and Matthew was very responsive. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views were incredible. The house is very open and inviting. We felt for the money there were things that lacked. The bed and pillows weren’t very comfortable, same goes for the living room furniture. The outdoor area is so incredible which is why this next thing was a bummer. I say all this knowing it’s the smoky mountains and there’s a lot of moisture, but it’s a missed opportunity to be able to enjoy the outside without having to pay for an upgrade. For the money you spend I guess you’d expect to have access to the more desirable outdoor covered deck but you don’t. So the deck we had access to the cushions were constantly soaked and there’s no cover on that level. But the lower level, which is apart of an upgraded listing, has a covered porch that’s only accessible through the other two bedrooms. Not tryin to be snobby just one man’s opinion. Stairs to the better porch or a cover over the main deck would’ve gone a long way. House was stellar aside from these details."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic house and location. Loved it and hope to come back soon!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place is fantastic. Great view and luxurious interior. We had a fantastic time and will be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous home just outside of downtown Asheville. The views are spectacular and the home is incredibly peaceful. We ended up extending our stay to enjoy the house and surroundings a little longer. Matthew and his team were great hosts. Super responsive and quick to answer any questions. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, just stop looking and book this place. It. is. amazing."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! A must stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Words cannot do justice to the Summit House! The views are outstanding and the house itself is lovely!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing!!! Stay!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! Wonderful host and beautiful home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Words are not enough for the beauty of this house and it’s breathtaking views 💕🪷💕
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the Summit House, both of which were for our anniversary. Each time the host was accommodating and communicative. The house is such a peaceful, luxurious, and unique setup. The communication and instructions were thorough and timely. The house is well equipped for everything you’d need in a care-free stay. Cannot recommend it enough."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful place! Quiet, peaceful and the views are remarkable. The home had everything we needed for our stay. The location was right in the middle of all the hiking and exploring we wanted to do. Every night we sat on the deck and watched the sun set. It was complete bliss. We had a few questions during our stay and the team was very responsive.
The pictures on the listing just don’t do it justice. This is a very special place; when we’re in the area again this is the place we’ll stay. Because I can’t imagine anywhere else will be as comfortable, convenient and beautiful!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A must stay spot for anyone looking for a relaxing vacation with one of a kind views in an amazing location! The home is very well thought out and takes full advantage of the views in every room. I can’t think of anything that would of improved the experience, 10/10 recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous setting! The views were everything. If you want to disconnect and relax this is the place.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find!! The house is very private with a stunning view and is in close proximity to all that Asheville has to offer! Kitchen provided all the pots, pans, and measuring utensils that we needed… there was even a slow cooker. They also had the nicest TP, tissues and paper towels of any Airbnb I have stayed at (not the sand paper variety, thank goodness! lol). I would stay here again :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home - both my husband and I said multiple times we could see ourselves living here. The place was immaculate and the view was outstanding. We woke up early to watch the sunrise and it was spectacular!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at this beautiful home! The views were breathtaking and the host was very responsive and pleasant. The only downside was that it snowed a few inches on the first day of our stay, and unfortunately, the road leading to the house is not plowed unless there is at least five inches of snow accumulation. This was particularly problematic, as the road was steep and winding, making it unsafe to travel on with even a little bit of snow so we had to cancel our plans for the day. Luckily the sun came out the next day, and the snow quickly melted. To future winter visitors, it is worth noting that the possibility of being snowed-in on the mountain should be taken into consideration. However, the rest of our weekend was lovely and we were able to enjoy the stunning surroundings and some great brunch spots in downtown Asheville. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend the Summit House to others!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re even looking at these reviews, book this place now!!!! Matthew’s place was just amazing. Spotless, beautifully decorated, everything you could ever need in the kitchen, and extra amenities. The view was phenomenal. Such a peaceful stay to unwind and we will absolutely be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you very much! Everything was perfect . What an awesome house and view! The windows, the tub , the lights , everything’s so adorable ! Thanks for the wine as well . Wishing you the best , Ángelo y Daniela ."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place to unwind and enjoy the views. The house was better than we could have imagined and Matthew was available at all times when needed. Strongly recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place & the views are amazing!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at the Summit House! Mornings in the bedroom are bright and you’ll be greeted by clouds and mountains in extraordinary fashion! The extras at the house were on point and baths from the tub were breathtaking! Thanks for hosting us!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views are absolutely unbeatable. The house was spotless, open, modern, and had everything you could need — including bowls and towels for dogs! Matthew was a great communicator. We will definitely be staying again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oh my goodness...what can I say that hasn't already been said in other reviews? The view, the kitchen, the balcony, the shower...all so amazing. The drive up/down the mountain to get here is a little intense but I found it fun. We spent a lot of time on the balcony at night looking up at the stars. Large windows & beautiful view also means LOTS of sun...so if you're a late sleeper, bring an eye mask :) We are early risers so we enjoyed it. The kitchen was a dream to cook in -- for nerds like me, there was a large gas range, beautiful and high quality Bosch appliances, and a SOMA water filter pitcher. I was in heaven. Speaking of heaven, the shower...oh my goodness. Set your temperature and decide how many angles you want to be hit with water! There's a very nice mud room with washer & dryer (& dog towels!), a dressing room with closets & full length mirror, both of which are not pictured on the listening so were a pleasant surprise! The bar has been set high with this property and I plan on staying again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far our favorite place we’ve stayed at. It was clean, comfortable and the view is incredible. The drive up the mountain was worth the view! The host was welcoming and place was well stocked. What more could you ask for?"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,An amazing house with unbelievable views. And great proximity to Asheville. I didn’t want my vacation to end it was so lovely. Will definitely be back.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for the best views look no further! This is the most unique,
clean & dog friendly place we have ever stayed! We celebrated my husband’s 30th birthday and Ashley was so kind to set up balloons, chocolate, and champagne! Highly recommend staying here you won’t want to leave."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Summit House. The house itself was amazing. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you needed outside of the food. While we didn’t use it, the grill came equipped with charcoal and lighter fluid/lighter. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was luxurious. The view was once in a lifetime! We were lucky enough to see deer and bunny’s on the drive up the mountain. The one thing I’ll mention to be prepared for is that the drive up is intense for those not used to mountain rodes. It included some sharp turns on steep inclines, but that’s to be expected going to a mountain location. It was definitely doable! Overall, it was a house and trip we’ll remember for years to come."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Be prepared to be in awe your entire stay. Both the exterior and interior were well designed to accentuate the natural beauty of the view. The host was extremely communicative, prompt and helpful. He offered recommendations and ensured that we were settled into our stay. The experience was exceptional from booking to checking out and the location of this space can’t be beat. The winding roads led to the most beautiful experience in Asheville yet. My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer. We will be back. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Whatever you can glean from these reviews, the photo gallery provided, the description written about the amenities offered - your expectations will be exceeded!
It was an expensive stay for this underpaid school teacher but I’d do it again in a heartbeat because this stay is worth it to me! Views are everything to me as well as a quality, clean, lack of clutter - but fully stocked with what you need or would want, ease of entering was simple and there was an exceptional, supreme, heavenly level of peace that I found by just being here in this home.
Matthew and Bruna are engaged hosts. Not just renting a place. They are responsive, kind and generous. My one night there on my own, was to wake up on my birthday to see a sunrise in the mountains- it was one I’ll always remember- needed no TV, no WiFi, no phones, no entertainments at all because the view and home was enough and more. Exceeded my expectations and I knew it would be good before I arrived but just couldn’t imagine how impressive, awe inspiring and peaceful until seeing all with my own eyes. Grateful they’ve shared such an amazing respite from the world with others to enjoy as well!
Oh and the drive up is good! I was worried about my older, extreme high mileage car and the pull going up the steep, tight switchbacks! But in that last 1/4 mile I put my car in low (not the lowest) and it just climbed right up. The road is good. Never left the place again until checkout time. Grateful. And hope to be able to return again sooner rather than later. ❤️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views! Spotless. Peaceful. Just what we needed!! Highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The views are incredible.. the pictures don’t do it justice (and the pictures are amazing so… it’s that great). The place was very clean, tidy, the kitchen had all of the tools we needed for cooking, instructions were clear, the bed extremely comfy… even the shower was great. This was an escape that both my husband and I needed, and the tranquil beauty around us was just what the doctor ordered. Thank you Matthew for hosting us, we hope to come back again soon!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for peace, quiet, fresh air, and views that you will never forget please check this place out!! Not only was the setting breathtaking, but the home was absolutely stunning. The host communicated all directions for the stay perfectly, was accommodating, and even had a welcome note and bottle of wine waiting for us! The kitchen had everything you need for cooking (which says a lot for us as my boyfriend fancies himself a chef and we stayed in and cooked a lot!), there were laundry supplies, grilling supplies, even toiletries and shower supplies! It was so accommodating that we gave up some hiking days to just relax “at home”. We will definitely be back!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"WOW! Beautiful is an understatement! We didn’t want to leave. My boyfriend, pup, and I stayed for two nights. The house was spotless, perfectly decorated, and still incredibly cozy all at once. The views are something out of a fairytale, my pup wouldn’t leave the balcony any time we were there! Very peaceful, just the get away we were looking for. Close to some great hiking on blue ridge parkway! Will absolutely be back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home in a fantastic location. The property lived up to the hundreds of positive reviews. Perfectly appointed and well maintained. We can’t wait to visit again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew’s home was absolutely beautiful! My boyfriend and I went for two nights and we were stunned with the views when we arrived. Everything was spotless and the host was great with communication! Still in awe of the beautiful views we had.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can’t find a better place. Amazing views, modern, secluded and comfortable!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a group of 6, three couples, stay at the Summit House. As promised the views were spectacular!!! We experienced some problems with the water and it was taken care of immediately by Matthew and his team ...on a Sunday even! The manner in which Matthew handled our problem was professional, prompt and courteous. The communication was fantastic, the property was very clean and well appointed. I would highly recommend this property or any property that Matthew is hosting. We will be returning!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,The Summit House is great and the views are amazing! The house was very clean. The sunrise is spectacular! Matt is a wonderful host and always responds quickly to questions or concerns.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home with breathtaking views! Secluded yet convenient to Asheville. Home is stocked with everything you need or may have forgotten. For me, it was bug spray. 😊"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn’t have been happier with our stay here. The views are more than spectacular, everything was modern and clean, and the furniture was super comfortable. All just a 20 min drive to downtown Asheville. It was the perfect place to disconnect, relax, and recharge for a week."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Worth every penny. The view is immaculate, the appliances are updated, everything you could ask for. I can’t reiterate how amazing the view is — best I’ve seen in a North Carolina Air BnB and I’ve been here several times."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love sour stay!! So beautiful and clean and relaxing! We never left the whole time. Just enjoyed the views and relaxed.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Most amazing Airbnb I have ever stayed!! The views are absolutely beautiful! The entire home is so welcoming and cozy. The furniture and bed are so comfy and I loved the local art. Matthew was a great communicator and super nice. I only wish I could have stayed longer! I will be back.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Would have given this place a sixth star if we had the option! I booked this for my wife and I’s honeymoon and we couldn’t have been happier with it. The no-wifi really helped us unplug and made it an amazing experience overall.
We specifically loved the view and the open layout kitchen/living room area.
Matthew is the best communicator and answered all of our questions with a quick response time!
We will definitely be back; should have booked it for longer!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful relaxing weekend at The Summit House. The views during sunrise were speculator. The was home interior very clean and inviting.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is stunning! This is such a beautiful home, with an even more beautiful view. You will not want to leave. This place is perfect, and I love that it was dog friendly. Highly recommend a stay here!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and so relaxing.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time relaxing in the mountains! Great view. Very functional kitchen - enjoyed cooking meals in there. I also love that they have lotion, soap, Q-tips, hair dryer available. Definitely helped to pack light."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most beautiful stay I have experienced. I have never been more at ease and relaxed with the quiet and seclusion of this home. Would recommend this to anyone and will be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Summit House was such an amazing weekend getaway! Breathtaking views and such a perfect escape. Matthew was super responsive and made the experience so seamless! Would absolutely come visit again and hope to in the near future!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was stunning! It was the perfect get-away for our small family. It’s always a bonus when a place this perfect allows pups. It was clean, spacious, and even more beautiful than the pictures. We were able to easily communicate with Matthew and he made us feel right at home.
Sunrise each day felt like we were on top of the world. We hope to come back and rent the whole place out one day!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,An absolutely stunning home. We loved every second of our stay in the mountains.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was fantastic! You will not regret booking this beautiful house. It’s a place we will come back to when visiting this area
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying here! Such a nice spot, with beautiful views, even on cloudy days. Stink bugs and ladybugs were seen frequently, mostly in the master bathroom, but when you’re in the mountains it’s to be expected and it could have been way worse. We loved every minute we spent here, and we were sad to leave. There are some steep hills, but using a lower gear and it was a breeze and a very fun drive!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well worth the money. The views are spectacular . The home is amazing and it was just one winding road up so it was actually super easy to find.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely stunning! These are Instagram influencer-caliber mountain views from chic floor-to-ceiling windows. We came to hike, but ended up staying at the house just relaxing over the mountains. The property could not be better positioned for watching the gorgeous sunrises. The house is immaculately clean with all modern conveniences. The hosts are excellent with communication."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect a wonderful perfect stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a stunning property. Location, view, amenities - it far surpasses my expectations. That sunrise and sunset has no peer. Such a relaxing place to unplug, unwind, and restore. We will definitely be back. Great for our family of three but equally as good for a solo meditation retreat."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful home and environment. The Mountain View is surreal. Can’t wait to be back!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The dreamiest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! My husband and I had a cozy long weekend enjoying Biltmore wine, the most amazing views and each other’s company. We can’t wait to come back. :)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home! A view to die for.... a perfect getaway for you and your significant other to escape to !! or even you!!! Highly recommend and it's worth the price
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was BEYOND! The view itself is worth every penny, then add on the house and it’s the complete package. We can’t wait to come back! Matthew is the most accommodating host and the whole process was a breeze."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent home with beautiful view. We loved everything about it. The thought Matthew puts into the home and to your stay is amazing. Truly felt like a getaway.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay with gorgeous Mountain Views.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't express enough how wonderful the experience was from the beginning to the end.
I didn't expect the view at night.
I recommend turning off all the lights on a clear night & look at the stars from the couch.
We could actually see Orion & had a panoramic view of the stars.
My husband & I can't remember a time we was that relaxed!
This house to us is perfectly constructed to showcase the view.
You will not be disappointed!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Summit House is a beautiful stay for a relaxing vacation with incredible views. Super clean modern lifestyle home with best in class hospitality from Matthew and Barbara.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The views are incredible. The whole space is gorgeous and so comfortable. It was perfect for a quiet and peaceful getaway. We will be back!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest cabin we’ve ever stayed in. The floor to ceiling windows and floating porch make it a dream. The kitchen was lovely and the bed was SO comfy. There is a tub with a million dollar view and a walk in shower that is luxury.
I want to go back!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Summit House is unreal! We will be back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Summit House was absolutely incredible and perfect for our weekend getaway to Asheville! It’s close enough to town that going out to eat is convenient but it’s secluded enough that you feel like you have the mountain to yourself. The views were absolutely stunning. We can’t wait to come back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! With each passing day it got better and like other reviews, I wish I had booked it for longer! I’ve never seen such beautiful views and such great ambience of a home."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing place! Better than expected. The pictures don't do it justice. Barbara is a wonderful host who goes above and beyond.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There is nothing I can say that have not been said already in the previous reviews. They are all true! You won’t regret coming here. It’s definitely a special place to experience. Amazing host as well! We will be coming back in the future!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was incredible! The view and location can’t be beat. Absolutely fantastic.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most amazing stay! We’ve stayed in many AirB&Bs. None have been as comfortable, had this type of priceless view from all angles and been as thought out as this. Barbara has every utensil or product you could possibly think to need or want. We will be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, where do I begin. This home is absolutely stunning. The amenities, cleanliness, hospitality from Barbara, and of course the view were the best of any Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in. We were able to bring our dog and with so many good windows to look out and a beautiful closed-in porch we had a hard time convincing him it was time to leave this paradise. Seriously, this place was a 10/10 and I don’t have a single negative thing to say. Book it, you won’t regret it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, convenient location, well appointed."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is probably the most memorable place I’ve ever stayed. I could easily live at this place. My only regret is that I did not book it for a month.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning property with magical views and a lovely flowing layout. Can't wait to go back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this house and the views!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Summit House was by far the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had! The mountain views were even more beautiful in person and it was the perfect getaway in a relaxing, gorgeous environment. Every single detail was thought of from the kitchenware to the toiletries. Barbara is a fantastic host who ensures her guests have the most enjoyable experience possible - she is lovely and I would love to stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I can NOT even begin to describe how amazing this cabin was! From the cleanliness, organization to the amazing views❤️ We can not wait to be back!! I also have to mention what an AMAZING host Barbara was and is!!! She responds back quickly and beyond accommodating!! Thank you thank you!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautifully decorated, breathtaking home was everything we could have wanted and more. The sunrises are magnificently magical. The home has an amazing kitchen and everything about it feels luxurious from the bedsheets to the toiletries in the shower.
Barbara is the sweetest host and super responsive.
We will definitely be back!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t recommend the Summit House enough. We traveled here for our 2nd anniversary because we were drawn by the secluded atmosphere and gorgeous views. The house is definitely the most luxurious and romantic stay we’ve ever had. Thanks Barbara!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the inclement weather, we had a wonderful time enjoying this gorgeous house. I have never been to a more well appointed place. You will want for absolutely nothing. The house is amazing and the view is incredible. We hope to enjoy The Summit again very soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Make sure you have a car with a good engine to get up the mountain.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One word- WOW! Better than the pictures! We never wanted to leave the property! It was the best Airbnb experience we have had so far! Far enough away from The rest of the world for the peace and tranquility but close enough to do all that the Asheville area has to offer. A must stay if it is available!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what we needed to get away. 5 star accommodations
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place was absolutely beautiful! The views were amazing! My fiancé and I really enjoyed our weekend getaway here and hope to come back again in the future!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views are even better in real life, if that’s even imaginable. Make sure to grab some snacks and drinks prior to arriving as it can be a bit much driving up and down everyday. We didn’t mind it so much, though. Everything was lovely!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t ask for a better Airbnb experience. Barbara was great with communicating with us before and during our stay. The house is gorgeous, immaculate, and the location cannot be beat. Thank you, Barbara!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara is the definition of a super-host. Every detail of our stay was an absolute delight and Barbara truly thought of everything!! The views from the home are breathtaking and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would 10/10 recommend this experience — thank you Barbara!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara and the Summit House are exceptional! You will not be disappointed! We had an amazing time just enjoying the view!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and relaxing stay!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely Home and Beautiful Views

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply stunning. This is probably the most beautiful home I have ever been in. Can't wait to come back
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views in a very relaxing setting. Great house with an extremely well-equipped kitchen and all the amenities.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this home to anyone wanting to get some rest and relaxation. It just puts your mind at ease. It’s also very close to fun things to do. I will definitely be back. It was perfect !!!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such an incredible location! The house is clean and orderly like a spa vacation.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures are worth a thousand words.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing! Highly recommend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is breathtaking. Everything about this place is amazing. The views are epic and I love how the house has everything you need. Hands down one of the best Airbnb’s. The roads to get here aren’t bad at all. We also got to meet Barbara’s husband , he’s a comedian and really nice. There’s absolutely nothing I would change about this trip.
Thank you Barbara for having us and for allowing us to see god’s s creation from another viewpoint."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so happy we found The Summit House for our honeymoon! The views are spectacular. To wake up every morning to a beautiful sunrise was more than romantic. Barbara’s attention to detail was amazing from the sheets, to all the towels, soaps, items in the kitchen, that are usually not provided, made our stay even extra special. It was truly hard to leave! We will be back someday 💜"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing weekend stay at the Summit House. It's just like the photos, offering serenity at every turn. The space was very clean, modern, safe and inviting. The house sits high on a mountain, so the views are a sight to behold and you have plenty of privacy to enjoy it. The best parts: watching the sunrise on a clear morning was a show in of itself. And on clear nights, you can even stargaze.
I didn't get to visit as much of Asheville as I had hoped but took advantage of hiking part of the Appalachian Trail - made for the perfect day trip.
Barbara was a great host - she had everything from coffee and tea to bath soaps and toiletries if needed. The only odd part of my time at Summit House was spotting ladybugs inside the home, camping out by the windows mainly. The bugs didn't bother me too much but could be off-putting to someone else. Other than that, I loved my short stay. It's a great place to unwind and escape from the world. I hope to return."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home with unbeatable views! The house was stylish and cozy. Barbara was an excellent host, and I would love to return here one day!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a secluded getaway. It exceeded expectations in views, cleanliness, and comfort."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is as beautiful as the pictures project and the view is simply spectacular.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book it! Don’t think twice! From the views to the hospitality, it’s unmatched! The house is beyond clean and has everything you’ll need. We cannot wait to go back!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious, and clean house with great view. Highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, awesome home, relaxing and private location! Everything you could ask for on a vacation!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's always a good time when we stay here. Great views, love the house."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was somehow better than the gorgeous photos advertised. We typically cook at least one of the nights while traveling and this home allowed us the comforts of a high end kitchen that is rare at most Airbnb's. The plateware, silverware, pots/pans, etc were all well maintained and plentiful.
The morning views and quiet were everything we could have asked for as a short getaway from the kids. Hopefully we will be back to Asheville and can stay here again.
Barbara was a great host, very responsive, and properly answered any questions I had."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place does not disappoint! We had an amazing stay at The Summit House. Plenty of amenities to be comfortable away from home. If there is a downside to such amazing views, it’s that you will likely wake up at sunrise, whether you want to or not. But the views are incredible!
Barbara was a great host and super responsive to any questions we had. Would love to come back!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was gorgeous and had amazing views!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay exceeded all of our expectations. One word: VIEW! Incredible.
We stayed during Christmas, when we pulled up to the house the outside had been decorated with Christmas lights and wreaths. Inside a stunning Christmas tree! We had a white Christmas on the mountain, best Christmas we’ve had in years! The house was clean and had extra amenities. Barbara was so kind and we enjoyed meeting her husband on one of our walks. Perfect mountain getaway and end to a very difficult year. Thank you!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were worried we couldn’t have our wedding during quarantine until we came across this place. Beautiful views and amazing home. The pictures do not even come close to doing it justice. We got married on the side deck with the mountains in the background and our family on zoom since they couldn’t come.
We couldn’t have asked for more. This home is stunning and the host was sooooo easy to work with. We will be back if this place is available!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible view, and the absolute perfect quarantine-getaway. Highly recommend!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home far exceeded our expectations; the views are absolutely breathtaking! We loved everything about our weekend getaway and did not want to leave!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara was an amazing host! The house was so stylish and and clean. It was perfect for a cozy mountain getaway. Barbara really has thought of ALL the things you may need for your stay! We were well taken care of during our stay and would definitely return to this home in the future!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with amazing views of the mountains. Perfect for a weekend getaway!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,INCREDIBLE experience. This place is absolutely stunning - both the view and the interior. Highly recommended.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with breathtaking views of the sunrise over the mountains!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views. Communicative and kind host. Would highly recommend.
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The home and view were beautiful, but the Japanese beetle infestation ruined our trip. The bugs were literally everywhere. A few times we would find them crawling on us as we tried to sit and watch tv on the couch or in the bed. They were on the walls, ceilings, and furniture. We actually spent time trying to clean them up ourselves but more just came in. It was an unsettling experience with a gorgeous view. We were told the beetles are only there for a few weeks and we were unlucky that we happened to book during that time."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! The home was stunning, so clean and comfortable. The sunrise is truly breathe taking and the views are amazing. Will recommend this place to everyone I know and will definitely be coming back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's Mountain House is the most amazing and incredible Airbnb you will ever stay at! We were completely blown away by the views, the home, the amenities, and Asheville! Barbara's home was neat, clean and well organized. It had every kitchen utensil we needed. Barbara was extremely responsive to our needs and we are so lucky that this Airbnb worked out for our trip to celebrate our would-have-been wedding date, buying our first home, and my fiance's birthday! I would highly recommend you stay in this home. It is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the place to go for some amazing views. Rollover in bed and wake up to epic mountainous views. Host is great and the house is spectacular.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was 13/10! Great views!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the sweetest and quietest mountain getaway! Loved every minute there!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the house and the view! The house is so comfortable and relaxing that we mostly just stayed in and enjoyed the view.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely AMAZING place!
To wake up with that view from the bed is just breathtaking. Barbara is a great host and the house is all and more that you can see in the pictures! Extremely recommended for a peaceful and luxurious gateway."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. We had our honeymoon at the summit house. It literally has all you could need and it was super clean and so modern. Barbara was also very sweet and accommodating. If you love to sleep in and are light sensitive bring a mask-there are no shades. Also no WiFi—but neither were big issues for us just something to be aware of. Thank you so much Barbara, we will be back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is difficult to add any new superlatives to the existent reviews. It was our first time in Asheville and first time at the Summit House. The views are indescribable amazing, light changes by the minute and you can easily spend a week just sitting on the deck and looking at the mountains and the clouds. The house is outstanding, kept impeccably clean and with all necessary little things in the kitchen and bathroom which will make you feel at home instantly. We had the privileged of meeting Barbara and she is absolutely as sweet in person as she is in her nearly instant messages. All in all, probably the top of our Airbnb experiences ...ever! Only drawback: you might want to never leave the place :)"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this house. The pictures were really spectacular on the website - but one never knows if they are an accurate representation of the actual house. In this case, the house was even more beautiful than the pictures indicate. The views are truly gorgeous - morning, daytime, sundown, evening - all beautiful. The patio is a lovely place to hang-out all times of day. The house is spacious and beautiful. I enjoyed cooking in the kitchen. The location is very private but also easy access to Candler (10 minutes) and Asheville (25 minutes)."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sutton House will exceed your expectations - luxury accommodations, extraordinary attention to detail and one amazing view! You will NOT want to leave. It even makes a rainy day enjoyable & relaxing.
Barbara is excellent at answering any of your questions and being available during your visit.
She has thought of everything including bubble bath, Qtips, etc. it’s the little surprising touches that you’d equate to staying at a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons that puts Barbara’s place over the top!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is incredible and probably the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at. Can’t wait to go back.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"See all the other great reviews??? I don’t think there is much more I can add. This place is amazing. After a few disappointing Airbnb rentals this one far exceeded our expectations. As for the drive up the mountain, it is paved and very manageable. We will return."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AWESOME!!!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and views with all the modern touches you need. Highly recommend.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. The pictures almost don’t do it justice. The sunrise in the morning, the serene landscape and the amenities make this such an amazing stay. It’s about 25 minutes from Asheville so perfect if you want to stay out of the hustle. Also about 25 minutes from the Bkue Ridge parkway and some of the best hikes of the Smokey’s. The kitchen comes fully stocked with all the chefs necessities and trust me, you’ll want to cook. My only complaint, it’s booked solid for the next 3 months. Can’t wait to come back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara was a wonderful host, she was very prompt in replying back with multiple questions we had. The place was sparkling clean with even better views. My husband & I are very excited to go back to the Summit house again. Highly Recomended!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view at this place is absolutely stunning! Just sitting out on the balcony (fully enclosed) with the pup and wife with coffee in the morning and a beer at night was amazing. The bathroom is unbelievably amazing and there are so many windows letting in a lot of natural light. The road was definitely steep getting up to the house, but worth it. Only complaint: needs WiFi! Our service was so-so, so the fact that there wasn’t any WiFi at this price was somewhat disappointing. Otherwise, we loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning views and SUPER helpful host! Gorgeous glass throughout the home, and stylishly decorated."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful. We can’t wait to come back. We did not made it into town for meals often because it was so nice cooking and enjoying the view! The house had everything we needed and was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. Everything about the home is upscale.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and views were extraordinary! The pictures are amazing, but the home and view exceed expectations. You can see the whole valley and feel like you are perched in the sky. The house is gorgeously designed and in great shape. The only thing I'd say about the house is that the location is a bit of a double edged sword. It's private with amazing views but it is also a bit isolated. Getting to Asheville takes about 30 minutes which can be a bit much if you just want to pop in for a meal. It's possible, but requires a bit more time and prep. It's manageable, but something to know ahead of time.
Barbara is a wonderful host! She was really responsive, communicated with us really well and made our check in and stay really excellent. She was a fantastic resource and we loved meeting her."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wizard’s Hollow is truly a magical experience. One of the coolest places I’ve stayed. You can’t beat the view!! Spectacular sunsets. One thing to note is that the drive up to the house is steep and narrow, so keep that in mind. Wasn’t an issue for us, but certain cars might struggle a bit. Check in instructions were very detailed and helpful, we had no trouble finding our way. Such cool and unique design choices throughout the house - my personal favorite being the spiral staircase which lights up at night. Floating candles were a fun touch as well. If you love Harry Potter and mountain views, you have to stay here! We plan to book another treehouse in the future as well!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we arrived at our airbnb called Wizards Hollow, I could tell that Matthew loved it and so did I. Matthew didn't know where he was being surprised for his 30th birthday vacation until we arrived. The place far exceeded my expectations of just clean. We felt at home. The place was just as described and clean with a beautiful view. It was quiet and peaceful. Mike and Caroline were helpful and responsive throughout the entirety of the process of asking questions before booking and during our stay. I highly recommend surprising your loved one with a trip here! It was an unforgettable experience. There is lots to do in the area of Asheville. Book your trip now!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a Harry Potter fanatic’s dream! My daughter was in heaven. Every little detail was thought of! The views are amazing and it’s really close to so much but you feel like you are in a very private escape. I highly recommend!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caroline and Mike are outstanding hosts! The directions, check-in and general information provided were clearly written, informative and detailed.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves as wife and daughter geeked out over all the Harry Potter themed stuff.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wizard's Hollow was just as magical as we hoped. My daughter is reading the HP series so we surprised her with one night's stay and she was awestruck. We loved exploring the house and all the details. So thorough and fun! Wish we could've stayed longer. Mike and Caroline were communicative and friendly. Looking forward to booking with Earth and Sky Dwellings again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is absolutely beautiful and the pictures don’t do it justice !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well thought out, comfortable and whimsical little houses. We enjoyed nights in both Alchemy and Wizards Hollow, and both were lovely. Guest needs were well prepared for, instructions were few and simple, and sites were extremely quiet despite other guests and ongoing construction close by. Very enjoyable to have peace and quiet but only be a 10 minute drive to downtown."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely awesome property. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you’ll spend a lot of time enjoying all of the impressive details put into this house. We had a blast in the house and it was very easy to get downtown when we wanted. Our daughter (the reason we booked the house) absolutely loved the time we spend there. We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were both so excited to see the Woodfin we are such huge Harry Potter fans. This mini vacation was given to me and my boyfriend for our 2023 Christmas gift and we did not receive any info till Christmas day where we are going. We both loved everything inside & outside the cabin and the treats were awesome too. We even bought both coffee cups for my mom & Dad for a Thank you gift for such a wonderful Christmas present that will never be forgotten. Now we are excited to come back and stay in a different tree house such as the Sanctuary or Farmhouse. Thank you for such a wonderful stay and your generosity was outstanding.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing, magical, cozy and fun! I would definitely return!
Caroline and Mike were very helpful and quick to respond when I asked about hiking areas and restaurants.
All I can say is thank you for letting your imagination run wild and creating something for so many people to enjoy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Wizards Hollow was truly magical. From the moment we drove onto the property we felt like we were transformed into the world of Harry Potter. The treehouse was perfect with so much attention to detail. My kids loved roasting marshmallows over the ""caldron"" fire pit outside and playing with the harry potter themed games and activity books. The wrap around porch offers 360 views of gorgeous mountain skyline. The beds were comfortable and we loved the soft harry potter themed blankets too! Caroline and Mike were very friendly and easy to communicate with. The treehouse is very close to downtown Asheville where we enjoyed the pinball museum and eating at delicious local restaurants. The neighboring houses in what my kids called ""the magic village"" were also uniquely themed fun tiny houses which my kids had a blast looking at and planning which one we will stay at next. We will definitely be back and can't recommend this property enough! Experience of a lifetime!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great spot! My wife has a leap day birthday and she loves Harry Potter. She absolutely loved the spot and had the best birthday get away! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent a wonderful weekend at Carolyn and Mike's treehouse. A charming house with an incredible view, thought out to the smallest detail, won our hearts. We definitely recommend spending time in the Asheville area and staying in a treehouse. A much more interesting and memorable pastime than in a regular hotel. If you can afford it, treat yourself to an adventure."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The owners were close by and very kind in letting us know to leave the water dripping so our pipes wouldn’t freeze. Loved the views and am interested in some of the others now that ive seen this one!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a dream come true for us as Harry Potter fans. Amazing views and the little details throughout the bnb make it extra special. We definitely plan to book future stays at the other treehouses!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience for my family. I brought too much stuff because in the past I have needed something that was listed as having only to find out we didn't have it to use. Caroline and Mike provided plenty of appliances and dinnerware for us to use. The atmosphere was more than we expected. Truly an exceptional stay for us.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place. It was just whT my wife was looking for
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical! Waking up in little house on stilts up on a mountain is a hard experience to beat. We'd recommend anyone go to any of this host's accommodations.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place is BEAUTIFUL! the views are amazing, and the place itself is too. it looks exactly like the pictures, maybe even better in person. very clean, i loved all the details in the decorations, and Caroline and Mike are very nice and responsive, we even got to say hi to Mike! thank you so much, my friends and i enjoyed our stay a lot, and we look forward to staying with Caroline and Mike again soon."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was magical. My childhood was brought back to life and the magic of Harry Potter came rushing back. I wish we would have booked a longer stay. It was so cozy. We are planning another stay in another treehouse. Can’t wait to come back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was absolutely magical! The attention to detail was astounding and you can’t beat the view. We wanted to stay forever!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We mourned leaving this spot and already planning our trip back. It looks exactly like the photos, and felt surreal staying at. We were so close to all of downtown Asheville, but also far enough away we felt at peace in nature. All the little hidden touches at the location to make it feel “wizardly” were met with gasps of excitement. We spent most of our time curled up, with butter beers watching the movies…. WHICH.. we left the recipe for in the guest book (ingles store version lol).
If you’re considering booking- do it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time here! It was exactly as described, better even. The views were incredible and it was so cozy. I would recommend this stay to anyone."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the decor.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the Wizards Hollow immensely. It was so much fun looking at all the Harry Potter decor. There were books for us to read and games to play and even the Harry Potter movies to watch. They provided snacks. But the best part of the stay was the view of the mountains. I highly recommend for all Harry Potter fans.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,So many fun details to discover in this place! Wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The whole place was amazing! I love what you are doing with your whole property! We will definitely be coming back to check out the Dragons Knoll dwelling. Wizards Hollow was beautiful, the details were impeccable. I loved all of the little Harry Potter details! The staircase!!! So much work was put into that! 10/10 would stay again and will be recommending friend to Earth and Sky Dwellings 💕"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"So, we arent really HP/mystical fans, but the place is still great. We went for a quick getaway to wind down in the woods and this rarely-available spot was avail for the only date we needed! Owner communications prior to arrival was fab. Great experience overall [waves magic wand] One thing to mention: if you plan on staying for more than a day or two, there is no stove, so plan provisions accordingly."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was cute and perfect for my Slytherin's 16th birthday! All the little details were so cute! We'll probably be back with nieces and nephew!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay and beautiful place! Would definitely return!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wizard’s Hollow does not disappoint the fanatic Potterhead! Every detail in the design and decoration of the house was carefully thought out to capture the magic of Harry Potter. It took me years to find an available time that worked for me to book my stay here and it was well worth the wait. It’s nicely situated on the side of a mountain with beautiful views and peaceful natural surroundings. Sierra Nevada, The Biltmore and downtown Asheville are all easily accessible from this location within a 20 minute drive. The hosts are incredibly friendly, easy to reach with questions and quick to respond. It was an all around great experience! Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth every penny! The little details in this place were perfect and I would love to tour all the rest of the spaces being built. Had to settle from spying from afar. I would definitely return

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay at Caroline and Mike’s uniquely beautiful home. We did get lost one evening heading back to the house. This was totally our fault. I called Caroline and she immediately answered her phone and helped us find our way back home.♥️ Such a beautiful setting and if you are a Harry Potter fan, don’t even think twice. Just book it and enjoy your stay!🤗"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this treehouse as an anniversary getaway and it exceeded expectations! The view from the wrap around porch was STUNNING. It was so cozy inside and had everything we could have wanted! As HP fans, we were blown away with all of the detailed decor!! We cannot wait to come back to this treehouse and maybe even check out some of the other ones, too!"

You can't beat the gorgeous view! I really appreciate the amenities that were provided and would recommend this stay to anyone, especially Harry Potter fans!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a special trip for my wife. We typically dont spend as much as this costs but then you get the experience she enjoyed so much either. Caroline and Mike were awesome hosts. They responded to us almost immediately. There were great instructions on getting to the property and excellent suggestions about things that made the experience better. The home itself was so thoughtfully and completely done. There were so many details about the theme that set my wife in awe. The views were also very beautiful.
I would recommend this to anyone. There are also other homes with different themes and they are also building more and more. We will be back in a couple years to see it all again. A longer stay too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place and will be back! I can’t wait to explore more, and see all the new construction finished. Beautiful scenery."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view from the deck was absolutely breathe taking!!!! It was better than we could've imagined. The harry potter decor for Wizards Hallow was subtle and perfect. Not over the top cheesy but felt like we were in the Harry Potter world. The drive up to the treehouse was a little scary the first time but after a few times it was fine. We LOVED it and will be coming back in the future to stay in the other houses they offer.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Upon arrival our 11 (boy) and 13 (girl)year-olds gasped, screamed, and thanked us over and over again. They explored every nook and cranny, reveling in all of the over the top touches, from a Wizards Hollow scavenger hunt to the video cache. In addition to being magical, it is a beautiful place worth the stay for those who are not Wizards and Witches fans. I wish there was a longer reservation available for the dates we were in town!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved this treehouse.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an awesome stay. We all enjoyed ourselves and didn’t want to leave. Caroline and Mike are great hosts and really enjoy sharing their properties with people. The time effort and detail that went into Wizards Hollow was amazing. You discover something new about the place the longer you stay. We will be back to stay at their other properties.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Caroline and Mike were wonderful hosts! Their place was beautiful and very carefully put together! We enjoyed all of the hidden gems and even the smallest of details. A great place if you are looking to get away. They have everything you need, just pack your clothes and enjoy the getaway!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing time! We surprised our girls and they were amazed at this treehouse! The attention to detail for my 15 yr old potter head had her grinning from ear to ear. The wrap around deck and fantastic views were fantastic. The house has everything you need!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here at Wizard's Hollow! The cabin is beautifully decorated, clean and welcoming. Communication from the hosts was excellent - very clear, friendly, and helpful. The site is beautiful. The view is amazing. We loved the firepit. On-site caretaker was very responsive and friendly when we needed a little help during out stay. Very fun! We would love to come back."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Wizard's Hollow! The view is stunning. Everything was as described, and Caroline and Mike were excellent hosts. The beds were comfy, so we got a good night's sleep.
We are major Harry Potter fans, and we enjoyed all the details. There is actually an invisibility cloak that you can use - look for it in a box in the bookshelf. ;-)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect getaway!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I hate to be cliche and use the word magical here, but wow it really is a magical place! Wizard's Hollow looks exactly as it does in the pictures, but feels even more amazing when you're there. There's all kinds of hidden secrets and surprises inside. We really loved the attention to detail. You could tell it was made with love. We were blown away at the architecture alone. There's so much space here too! And the view? Wow. I wish we had more time here, but I will always feel lucky that we got to visit this beautiful place. Hoping to come back in the future."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay at Wizard's Hollow! We'd been waiting a long time to go, as the place books up super quickly, but everything lived up to our expectations! The place is super cute and the decor is so detailed--plus the views are incredible!! We had one tiny issue with the TV and Caroline and Mike responded within five minutes and the handyman was over to fix it within ten minutes! He recommended Blue Mountain pizza, which was soooo good, and which is just a short drive down the hill. Of course we wanted to do a Harry Potter marathon, and they do have the Harry Potter DVDs at Wizard's Hollow, plus access to HBOMax where the films are currently streaming. No HP books, though, so if you're planning to read, make sure to bring your copies! :)
All in all, a great trip, and we'll definitely stay here or at one of their other properties again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,So cozy and magical! Our girls had a blast!

2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Spot on with the theme and perfect for Harry Potter fans! Directions to the property were very helpful and it was easy to find, even at night. The cabin was clean and our hosts were responsive. Quick note if you are staying longer than a night or two--storage is limited to a small dresser in the stairwell and there is no storage in the bathroom and limited counter space. We had a hard time keeping our stuff organized. There are beautiful windows all around which is wonderful for the views and natural light, but there are only 2 with shades---so we were up with the sunrise."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Waiting for the next time I can book this amazing mini replica of Hogwarts. This is every Harry Potter fan’s dream and the view of the mountains in Asheville from the treehouse is added perfection. Can’t emphasize how well the owners have incorporated all things Harry Potter. From the lampshades, rugs, staircase, sliding bookcase door and more. This place is a little slice of magic!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another amazing stay to check off my bucket list! Wizard’s Hollow is a beautiful retreat with some astonishing views. As luck would have it, got a great view of the changing leaves while able to work remotely from a little slice of heaven. Caroline was gracious enough to accommodate my virtual meetings with check-in/check-out!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had high expectations and they exceeded them! This is a wonderful experience!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family has stayed at three other treehouses in different areas and this has been our favorite. The hosts were also quick to answer any questions on the app.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely WORTH IT!! The attention to detail was top notch and every little thing made you feel transformed into the wizarding world. Not to mention the view that is spectacular. Caroline and Mike were greats hosts, very responsive, and made things super easy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a fun stay! We love Harry Potter and our 7 year old daughter loved it as much as we though she would. She loved all the Harry Potter details and spent every free minute playing and pretending. The description does not do the view justice. You should check this out right around sunset. And as the light goes away, everything lit up is also magical. All the decor details were perfect and we enjoyed all the Harry Potter decor from the house blankets, games, and potion set upstairs. Finally, the bed was super comfy. Everything was well appointed."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The hosts were very informative and all things were accurately depicted. We thought it was a very fun and magical place and really enjoyed our stay.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wizards Hollow is everything I was hoping it would be. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and magical experience -- we celebrated our one year anniversary together, and sat and watched the most incredible sunset I've ever seen while sitting on the porch with a perfect view :)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, beautiful view!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay at Wizard's Hollow treehouse was magical! The view of the Asheville/Weaverville mountains was spectacular! The treehouse was decorated beautifully in Harry Potter typed theme with a surprise around every corner. We played Harry Potter games while we watched the movie series and enjoyed the mountain view from the cozy living room. I would definitely recommend and stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most amazing Airbnb we have ever visited!!! I just want to live here!! We were blown away with every single detail! Everything is so magical and we loved it so much! We will definitely be back in the future!!! We want to stay at the alchemy next!! I really appreciated all the recommendations they sent before our trip! They definitely helped us plan our weekend! The treehouse is perfect, the area is so peaceful and full of adventure, and Caroline and Mile are outstanding hosts! Highly recommend staying here! Even if you have to book way out due to availability, I promise you, it is worth every second of waiting! You’ll have the most magical time here! Oh, and make sure to watch the sunset on the back porch, it’s a perfect view!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about our stay at Wizards Hollow. The house was immaculate, the hosts were very accommodating and there was so much detail, we kept noticing new stuff throughout our stay! The area is quiet and quaint with absolutely stunning views. We are excited to try out a different treehouse in the near future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Highly recommend! Charming, lots of cute Harry Potter details, and great views!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Treehouses of Serenity and Wizards Hollow did not disappoint! Caroline and Mike have thought of every detail! They are such welcoming hosts, the treehouse was fantastic and that view! We hope to visit again soon!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Treehouses of Serenity and equally as good. The kids loved all of the Harry Potter details from the decor to the board games. As always, the views were incredible! Pictures do not do it justice. I’m sure we’ll be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Wizards Hollow treehouse was fantastic, and Mike and Caroline were as well! Our GPS had troubles finding the place originally, and it took us the wrong way. Once we were able to get our car turned around, Mike met us and led us to the treehouse. Mike was so personable and you could tell he loves the treehouses they've built. We had such an amazing time, and my wife and kids loved all the little H.P. details. We can't wait to come back, and would love to stay at Alchemy next time. After we left, Caroline called us to let us know our son left some of his items in the loft. She quickly mailed them back to us. Cannot recommend Wizards Hollow and Treehouses of Serenity enough!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another MAGICAL stay at the Treehouses of Serenity. This beautiful and comfortable treehouse truly made my heart so happy. As someone who learned how to read, reading Harry Potter with my mom as a child, to graduating high school the year the last movie came out, and now celebrating my 29th birthday in this HP themed treehouse, it’s safe to say I was experiencing all the feels. The attention to detail is other worldly. I only wish we could have stayed longer (or forever)!!! Well worth the money!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location of the treehouse was great. It had all the necessities' that you will need during your stay. It was definitely a Harry Potter treehouse, the decor was perfect. My granddaughters loved spending the night there. We will definitely go back and try out another treehouse. Thank you for the experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My adult daughter and I are huge Harry Potter fans and we had a great time. there are all kinds of fun little details in this treehouse. Caroline and Mike are a minute away and they brought down some tools for the grill within minutes of me texting. The treehouse village is very quiet and beautiful. I wish I could have stayed just one more night!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a super fun place to visit, especially for a Harry Potter fan. All the details really made it fun to explore each part of the house. We enjoyed sitting on the deck or at the large windows enjoying the scenery. The hosts were great and made sure we had everything we needed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won’t be disappointed!! Pictures can’t do the views justice. Nor can they can capture all the adorable Harry Potter touches throughout the house. We had a blast and we are thankful to Caroline and Mike for letting us stay!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such an amazing experience!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a place that causes your kids to proclaim you're the coolest parents in the world, book a night here!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was truly a magical experience - we so appreciated the beautiful decor, lovely snacks, HP-themed details, gorgeous views, and a very cozy space to watch one of the movies. We hope to stay again as soon as we can. Thank you so much!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the absolute best time at Wizard’s Hollow! This was our second stay with Caroline and Mike and it was equally enjoyable as our last. The house had everything we needed, communication was seamless, and the views can’t be beat! Our HP obsessed daughter wanted to stay forever. We can’t wait to return next year!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a cute place! We really enjoyed the whole grounds- seeing the other treehouses- a really fun concept.
The location is nice- about a 10 minute drive into downtown - nice and quiet but not too far away. There is a grocery store right at the bottom of the hill (about a mile) if you need to make a quick snack/drink run.
We got a kick out of the Harry Potter themed decor, as well as the castle-y vibe of the exterior. And the back deck is the perfect place to enjoy the sunset over the mountains. Definitely want to go back and/or try out some of the other treehouses! Thanks Caroline and Mike!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a dream! It’s everything you could imagine and more. The view from anywhere in the house is breathtaking. We’d love to come back! Spending mornings and nights on the wraparound porch watching the sunrise and set, was gorgeous.
Ps using a hot plate was easier than I thought it would be :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ten stars on communication, service, house design and view! Second time staying in Treehouses of Serenity, and it’s such a cool place. Such a cool concept and place! Will be back for sure!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wizards Hollow was wonderful!! We loved our time there!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most magical time at Wizard Hollow. As a family of Potter fans, we really enjoyed the attention to detail in every corner. Our 9 year old said it was “the best vacation ever!”"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice getaway place to stay and relax. Treehouse was cleaned and bed was comfortable. Very quiet place to relax and enjoy your time. If you do plan on staying here. If you have a car with low ground clearance. Don't take it! Drive something else. The road is gravel. This could cause some issues when the gravel is newly put down. Not compacted yet.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great treehouse! Owners are very communicative. Did not disappoint.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A *must see/stay* for Potter fans! We had a fantastic girls weekend here. The views are amazing, super close to all the fun Asheville has to offer. Money well-spent, this experience was magical. Highly recommend & now we wanna check out all the other tiny houses!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our first stop on our fantastic tour of treehouses of serenity. Caroline and Mike are delightful to speak with and the stay is magical!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely unique! It was a great space and perfect for any Harry Potter fan. Just a couple of things to note - and I may not have paid enough attention to the pictures to realize this. First, the bedrooms are kind of connected to each other. You have to go through one to get to the stairs to the loft bedroom. Also, there isn’t an oven (there is a hot plate) so keep that in mind when thinking about meals."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Listen if you are on the fence about it ..just hop on over you will not regret it I promise you.. if you or your loved one is a Harry Potter fan this will be everything to them and more …I took my girl her to surprise her for her birthday and it blew us both away..from the ease of check in to the small details within the treehouse …we will definitely come here again ..Mike and Caroline were excellent hosts and I couldn’t be happier with the process and communicating with them 100/100 on all levels
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is magical. I loved every moment of it. My daughter’s happiness was everything. I highly recommend it.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay so very much! The theme has been carried into every detail. Communication was clear, the home was perfectly clean, and everything was wonderful in every way! We can't wait to come again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are a Harry Potter fanatic you should stay here! Everything is great! The details are awesome ! My son is very happy and still ecstatic about the stay!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,So magical!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect. Everything was super clean and it was decorated perfect for a ""potterhead"" The view was breathtaking. Exactly how we pictured it to be."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was absolutely gorgeous. I can not say enough about how much we loved this treehouse. The house was immaculate and perfectly done with so many incredible Harry Potter details.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing magical place to stay! Their attention to detail is fantastic! So many little things like the wands, the owls, potions, trunks, etc. The stairs and secret bookshelf door were my favorites. Bonus that is only 10 minutes from Asheville, NC with tons of things to do and places to eat. Caroline and Mike also did a good job navigating us there and providing a lot of information on things to do in the area. We will be looking to stay in another treehouse for next year!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay! So many adorable little details. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will absolutely love it here! It’s such a magical place. When you first arrive grab the talking sorting hat off the bookshelf and sort yourselves! Such fun! They have all the Harry Potter movies there for you to watch! Pop some (provided) popcorn and relax with amazing Mountain View’s while you watch your favorite HP movie. We didn’t know this until we arrived but there is a pizza place that will deliver. We stopped at a store super near by and brought things to make dinner. The hosts provide a hot plate to heat food, a microwave, dishes, utensils, seasonings, hot sauce, and cooking oils. They also have a coffee maker and tea kettle. The treehouses are located in a gated community which really adds a nice feeling of safety. They beds and linens are all super comfy. My one and only suggestion would be to bring your own pillow if you have neck issues. If you don’t, then you will be just fine! They also provide towels and even makeup removers, cotton balls, and a first aid kit should you need it!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great adventure. Magical. Exceeded my expectations. Recommendation for everyone.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a fun and unique place to stay. You’ll enjoy exploring the house and relaxing in a beautiful setting.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing as promised. We loved all of the Harry Potter details, our favorite was the stairs, trust me. Between the surpises and extras, like the snacks, put our stay over the top. We can't wait to see what the new tree houses they are building and would love to go back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a magical stay! We were SO impressed with Wizards Hollow and wanted to stay longer! The attention to detail in this space is incredible, and there’s something so cool about watching Harry Potter in your own Hogwarts! The whole Treehouses of Serenity complex is very cool and we enjoyed walking around and looking at the other treehouses. We will be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Caroline and Mike were the absolute best hosts. From making sure that Wizards Hollow Treehouse was clean and inviting to communicating with us about contacting them if there was a need that came up. I would highly recommend giving the Treehouses of Serenity a try. It is absolutely amazing! From the originality of the houses to the breathtaking views. This is truly a must do!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time we’ve stayed and the Wizards Hollow is amazing but Mike and Caroline are even more amazing as hosts! You have to add the treehouses to your must visit list!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The treehouse was amazing and made our trip! We will be coming back again!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really awesome location that’s made for making memories. Also super convenient to most things to do in Asheville

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Wizards Hollow is a great place to stay for any Harry Potter fan! The attention to detail and the mountain views were great!! Nearby Ashville offers plenty of great, unique places to eat or grab a beer. The hosts Caroline and Mike were awesome and very friendly! Highly recommended!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We made a special trip to spend a few nights at the Wizard’s Hollow, because we came for the Hobbit house last year and felt like we needed to return to stay in more of the houses! We had a great time and my ten year olds really relished the imaginative play with the wands and potion books, and we watched the movies on the DVD at the house each night.
The drive on the property feels a bit dodgy if you’ve only got a fairly low-set rear-wheel drive car like me, but take it slow and easy and you’ll make it around the tricky bends just fine. If I came in winter, though, I’d probably bring my Subaru instead!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Step into peace and quiet.
The perfect location, perfect place to get away from busy life. Caroline and Mike mountain is the place you need! Plus add a little bit of magic and you have perfect getaway"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Fun and worth the experience!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I genuinely looooooved this treehouse! It was such a sight to see as a harry potter lover & the sight itself was absolutely beautiful. I was definitely bamboozled by the drive up and was glad we had a truck because there were some really steep hills to climb up the mountain but it was well work the view. Overall, I loved this little getaway and it was perfect for my wife and I for our anniversary. We will definitely be trying to come back! It was well worth the price! Thank you guys for sharing this treasure of yours with us😊"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Wizards Hollow! We loved all the details in the treehouse. You truly felt like you were right in the story. We even watched one of the Harry Potter movies! The treehouse had everything you would need and is conveniently located to grocery/ gas and dining spots. We would love to return again soon!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a Harry Potter themed tree house, this is where you want to stay!! The owner responded properly, the Mountain View was wonderful and the house was clean. We really enjoyed ourselves and will be returning in the future!!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Basically a brand new place, we had to take out all the new stuff in the oven before we used it and probably the first to (try) to use the Sauna. Great place and had a great time. Upstairs appliances need some work to be ready for guests"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very clean and comfortable.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I took a last minute solo trip to see Biltmore House and Asheville. It was meant to be because this FABULOUS Airbnb was available for the exact same dates I wanted to be away. Great location - close to Biltmore, downtown, Trader Joes....And such a quiet retreat. I felt very safe and it was a perfect place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. A plus was the super comfy bed!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for us to stay for our short time in Asheville! It was walking distance (we are big walkers) to TONS of restaurants and shops in West Asheville— which is such a cool & funky part of town! We even walked to the Arts District about 1.5 miles away. The space was so clean, cute and stocked with everything you could need! We felt very taken care of. Also, the neighborhood was so quiet and quaint. It was a great way to get the local Asheville experience while exploring all that the city has to offer."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed at Donald’s and it was very peaceful and relaxing. I wish we would’ve had longer to be able to check out trails nearby too. The neighborhood and surrounding area is beautiful. It was raining so we didn’t get to hang out on the deck and enjoy the view but it looked like an inviting space in the yard. The directions and instructions given were easy to follow. He even recommended some great places to eat dinner the evening we checked in. We would definitely stay here again.

We appreciated their recommendation of Sunny Point Cafe from brekkie, it was amazing! We purchased their honey they harvest from their bees as well! It was a great overnight stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donald was very helpful and responded to my message about checking in promptly! We absolutely loved the space, and the unique little touches that made it feel so cozy. They gather their own honey on the property, and encourage you to check out their setup and to try some! We thought this was super unique and had never really seen that up close like that before. The keypad entry made us feel especially safe and gave us peace of mind. We loved their sweet pup and garden! Thanks guys!!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time I booked my sister and her young children for an overnight stay at Donald’s cottage. On their way to visit me on the coast, they accidentally left behind the baby’s special stuffy. When they stayed on their return visit, Donald had perched the little lion on a dresser to welcome them. My sister appreciated helpful notes about water temperature in the shower. She also bought a jar of honey, produced by bees kept right there on the property. A very special host indeed."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is romantic and perfect for a weekend getaway! Restaurants right up the street and amazing shopping just a few miles away! Everything was exactly as expected and then some!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked the cottage for my sister and her two young children for a good night’s rest as they traveled to visit me on the coast. The proximity to the interstate was so convenient. The space was comfortable and provided everything the family needed for their one-night stay.
My 8-year-old niece was disappointed to learn we couldn’t give the cottage 6 stars “because 5 isn’t quite enough.” I have already reserved the cottage for their return trip home."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was everything described and more! It was the cleanest place I have ever seen! Modern, adorable, comfortable. I wanted to move in!!! The communication with the owner by text was great. Donald answered all of my questions. He even turned the heat up for me per my request because is was a chilly day. The neighborhood was cute, peaceful, and walkable. I walked to the West Asheville strip and walked around the neighborhood.
The bed and bedding was sooo comfortable. They even had some little snacks. I love those extra lttle touches. I loved having a kithenette and having a space that was all mine instead of inside someone's home. I could tell they put a lot of work into this 1940s garage, making it into something so lovely and keeping it in tip top immaculate shape. The big windows with lots of light were great, as well as the yard. I hung out and ate my lunch outside while the robot mower mowed the yard. He was so cute. If I could add anthing to this amazing space ... I would like a screen door because I love to let all the fresh air in, a bar stool in case someone wants to sit at the kitchen counter to eat, and a step stool under the kitchen sink for those of us who can't reach the dishes in the cabinet above the sink. I would also have loved to have spent some time with the owners to get to know them and learn more about the area since I am planning a move there, hence my visit and stay. But I understand some Air B n B hosts are into that more than others.
Very grateful for the night I had at their sweet studio cottage space!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donald’s cottage was perfect!! Such a cute place to stay and a great use of space. We absolutely loved our time here!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place and at the last minute! We had been searching for a great air bnb option or a hotel room for a couple weeks with no luck. Then this little gem of a place popped up and it couldn't have been in a better location. Coffee shops/restaurants/breweries within walking distance. A short Uber ride to downtown. Thanks so much Donald and Leslie! Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I really enjoyed our stay at the cottage! The hosts have truly thought of everything: soft, fluffy towels, extra toiletries, coffee and snacks, fast Wi-Fi, and more. You also can't beat the location; about 3 minutes off the highway, surrounded by yummy restaurants and breweries, and about 10 minutes from places like downtown and Biltmore. I loved being in a relatively quiet neighborhood as opposed to the hustle and bustle of other places I've stayed closer to downtown.
I also appreciate it how communicative the hosts were, including letting me know that we could check in early and recommending a yummy pizza spot when we got into town. I will definitely visit the cottage again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a clean and comfortable little cottage stay. Tucked away perfectly, but still so close to all of the action! Donald was so quick to respond and so helpful. We highly recommend this cozy stay, we will be back if ever in the area again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a very nice stay. The cottage is small but very comfortable and was perfect for our two night stay. Quiet neighborhood and the location was close to all we wanted to see and do in Asheville.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything as described and better. The cottage was within walking distance to many different restaurants and shops. Quiet area.
Communication with host was quick and easy. Host was very responsive. It seemed any time we needed something basic that you would find in your own home, after a quick search, it was there. For instance, I needed a pen and paper, and it was there. Also, a rewards card for Ingles, the local grocery store. Little touches like that were very helpful. Definitely would stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Really liked this place- beautiful little cottage. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the space. Super cute & just what I needed.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing last minute get away! Small cottage with all the necessities. Great location that's central to everything Asheville has to offer. Added bonus is the bee hives located in the garden. I made sure to grab a jar of honey before leaving.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Close to everything the area has to offer. Very clean, very quiet & very comfortable lodging, private too, for a great price.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a week of searching for the perfect AVL getaway, this place lived up to its name! I booked it Last Minute, and I’m so happy I did! Bonuses were parking on (but off) street, a quiet neighborhood (no city noise!), coffee (made in a REAL maker, no K-cups!), huge TV, Adirondacks for lounging, ALL the amenities (I even used the iron), and a cushy bed perfect for relaxing. If you need a Last Minute getaway, book this now!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Needed a last minute get away and am SO pleased to have found Donald’s spot. My mom and I enjoyed ourselves so much and went for a walk in the gorgeous neighborhood. Def a smaller spot but for two people was very spacious. The place is so well done! I’m an Airbnb host of 7 listings myself so to find a place that blew my mind with its thoughtful touches is rare. We loved it and will be back if in town!

The setting was very relaxing and the guest house was exactly what we needed! Quiet, clean, comfortable and cute! Met some nice neighbors on our walk up the street to a great restaurant for dinner and discovered 2 breweries on the same corners-made for a easy night out. Great proximity to Biltmore too!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donald was a wonderful host. Easy to communicate with and very friendly! The cottage was as cute as it was comfortable. There were so many thoughtful touches it really made our stay! The location is perfect. Quiet enough that you can get a good nights rest but close enough to downtown, plenty of breweries and great restaurants! Should we return to Asheville we would definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at Donald’s place. Very close to downtown and three great coffee/ breakfast spots nearby (early girl, homeground, and tiger bay). The place was clean and had everything we needed. It was nice to have our own driveway too. We didn’t get to meet Donald but he made everything very helpful with the books and recommendations for our stay. Thank you we will definitely be back!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donald's cottage is great. It is peaceful and has such a nice feeling inside, really good energy. I had everything I needed and was most comfortable! It is clean, the bed is good, and the small space is very well arranged and efficient, without feeling at all crowded. I loved being able to open the windows and have the ceiling fan on, rather than using the a/c. The location is fabulous!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,So clean. So easy. Great location. Comfy bed. Would totally stay again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay if you’re looking to be close to everything and also out of traffic. We never heard any cars go by, it was so peaceful, but any time we wanted to do anything it was a 5-10 minute drive at most. Very clean, and I was impressed by how thoughtful everything was. From snacks, to bathroom amenities, this place was perfectly stocked with everything I forgot to pack. The parking was great for my SUV because I am terrible at parallel parking and I was so happy to find that I didn’t have to. Overall 10/10 fantastic stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is super cozy and clean with all the amenities for a great stay and night’s rest! Great location in West Asheville close to many great eateries! Donald is a really nice host who communicated service and offered excellent hospitality! We plan to book again each month we have work in the area. Thank you, Donald!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donald’s cottage is the perfect getaway destination in a blooming city. Easy to find, private- with a beautiful yard surrounding it, and yet close enough for any activities you wish to enjoy. We booked this literally “last minute” and it didn’t disappoint. The cottage was clean, well designed, and just the right amount of space for an adventuring couple. Communication was perfect, booked with ease and given plenty of time to stay and enjoy the place. Can’t thank Donald enough for his generosity in creating this cottage."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All around great! Tidy, cozy, convenient and in a super location."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location here is great if you are planning to explore West Asheville. It was close to The Whale and Cellarest which should be stops on anyone's trip. The house was very clean and the overall experience was great.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the Last Minute Cottage! It was a beautiful space, neatly decorated on the inside, with a clean kitchenette, bathroom, and very comfortable bed and couch spaces. Everything about our stay here was positive.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extraordinary. 360 views, a great king bed, the sliding garage door, the plentiful outdoor space, and the moments where the horses, goats, and donkeys are just a few meters away. Top 1% of all of the places stayed in my travels. Thank you, Catherine!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! Where to start!? This place was an absolute dream. We brought out 7 month old and had her set up in the bathroom because it was so spacious and due to her schedule we didn’t need to use the blinds so we woke up to mountain sunrises every morning and just stunning views. Seeing horses, goats, & donkeys come near your place (there is a fence to keep them from coming too close) and just getting to enjoy that in the morning and evening. To getting to walk around and explore her massive piece of land with pigs, chickens, donkeys, horses, and goats. Then a stunning river where you could fish or kayak in. I mean it’s honestly all out of a fairy tale. Reminded me a lot of Ireland or England. We are already looking at coming back! Catherine took us on a little tour of her place and we got to meet the donkeys up close and that was so much fun. I had no idea how sweet donkeys were. Really just had the best stay and experience. Bed & pillows were incredibly comfortable. All around amazing!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed our time at Catherine's property! The farm setting is so serene, with the river running through the property, and plenty of farm animals around. We had some horses and goats come up to the fence and visit with us for a few minutes!
The accomodations are very comfortable, and again, being set up on the hill and watching sunrise and sunset was just perfect. We can't wait to return soon!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a very unique and beautiful place to stay. The modern “cabin “ is perched atop a high hill with amazing panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and overlooking the Pigeon River.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was incredible. Catherine was friendly, available and showed us hospitality at its best. From the farm tour to restaurant recommendations, to the sprawling landscape, everything was great. Highly recommended doing the farm tour with Catherine and listen to any of her restaurant recommendations. The view is unbelievable and the cabin was perfect. Perfect slice of peace and a weekend full of memories."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - Catherine’s place was the most scenic, memorable AirBnB’s we’ve been too! Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the Smokies and Asheville. Everything was spotless, and the stay was wonderful. Catherine is an excellent host and was incredibly kind. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Catherine and Rick’s cabin ! The views are breathtaking! The hospitality couldn’t have been better . The farm has so much character with all the animals , the river, the mountains, and camping spots along the river.
Our favorite things about the cabin were the gas fire place, the gas fire pit ,the roll up door, the large deck with wrap around couch ,the comfy bedding, and large bathroom .
One night we sat outside and watched a movie on our laptop by the 🔥 pit. We also sat out there each morning and had our coffee.
On our last morning, we rolled up the door and laid in bed and just marveled at the view .
I have stayed at many Airbnb’s. This was by far my favorite! I will definitely be back.
Take the tour. You get to enact with the miniature donkeys!
There is so much to do within a 10 to 30 min. drive.
We visited Asheville , drove the Blue Ridge Pkwy to Waterrock knob trail. We explored Waynesville. It’s a cool town w/shops , restaurants and breweries."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay on the farm! Perfectly little retreat for our little family. The views were breathtaking!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can tell Catherine and Rick have put their heart and soul in to the farm and the cabin is no exception. Impeccably clean accommodation that is beautifully decorated and the opportunity to visit the animals is unforgettable. Perfect for nature lovers and those seeking a unique getaway. The farm is so picturesque and the river setting is stunning. It’s also a great location to sight see in the area. We went to see the elks at Cataloochee and it was an amazing experience. We would return to this beautiful cabin for sure!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing 'glamping' experience!! We really enjoyed the privacy and beautiful surrounding farmland. We had easy communication with Catherine and definitely plan to return!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love love loved our stay! The property is gorgeous and centrally located between hiking and things to do in Asheville.

If you're thinking about visiting, stop thinking and book it ! It's SO worth it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Husband and I enjoyed a unique yet homey stay at Catherine’s place. She was so welcoming and friendly which was the cherry on top to such an amazing trip. The cabin was in a great location where I didn’t take too long to get to any of the activities we wanted to do while around the smoky mountains. We would come back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing location & a truly magnificent weekend away. Serene and peaceful. Everything we needed & Catherine was just terrific!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Incredible beyond description. Thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay. Will be back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely gorgeous surroundings. The airbnb itself is wonderful as well, but the host was even better. Very accommodating and I’d definitely recommend the farm tour. Me, my wife, and my dog all had an amazing stay"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Words simply can’t express how peaceful and stunning this place is! From the awesome views surrounding your cabin to the beloved hospitality from the host! Definitely on my favorite list!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection, as always."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Unbelievably beautiful spot. This property has it all. We loved everything about it and there was so much to love. To start, the river is stunning and there are also multiple streams that run throughout the property and flow right into the river. We loved walking the exploring property with our dog. Of course, we had to stop and say hi to the goats, donkeys, pigs, horses and farm dogs. The pigs always gave us a big laugh. Catherine was also so fun and easy to talk to. They have put so much hard work into this place and thought of every detail. The cabin looks brand new and is spotless. We loved waking up with the big windows and sitting out under the stars at night. Do not hesitate to stay here. You will love it. It was by far our best airbnb stay. Thanks for the special memories."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Catherine’s place is absolutely beautiful and couldn’t recommend more.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Catherine was stunning and serene. Along with enjoying the cottage, my partner and I also took a tour of the farm. It felt like home because of how well-kept the space was."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would recommend this booking to anyone!! We had a great time, the host was extremely accommodating/communicative, and we adored the area. Could not have picked a better place to stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"17 degrees north exceeded all of our expectations!! We wanted a mountain getaway near Asheville for our joint 30th birthday celebration with our pup! When we saw the photos of the cabin we knew it was one in a million! Just wait till you get there and get to experience all the beauty the river, rolling hills and mountains has to offer. Catherine was a proactive host and communicated everything clearly! She gave us dog friendly recommendations and made sure to make us feel right at home! We are definitely coming back and would highly recommend coming to see these breathtaking views!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and host. Peaceful and relaxing with great views and walking/hiking. The stars and sound of the river under a full moon is exactly the get away we were hoping for.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Phenomenal getaway, I would love to return"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at this place. It’s got everything we wanted including fishing, beautiful views, and uniqueness."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,17* N cabin was a fabulous experience from easy check in and check out to a spacious cabin and incredible views. Catherine and Rick give you full access of the property to include river access for fishing or a peaceful walk. They are both friendly and engaging. My only complaint is that we did not stay long enough.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5 stars! Can’t wait to revisit!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First air bnb we’ve stayed at and I can only hope all others are so kind. Property is absolutely breathtaking and lots to explore. Catherine was extremely sweet and easy to communicate with. Hope to visit again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great property, great hosts! We really enjoyed a peaceful trip to this working farm. Our cabin was situated on top of a hill on a 100 acre farm overlooking a river. Doesn’t get much better than this. They have really thought of everything to ensure you have a fantastic stay with Adirondack chairs all over the property for you to enjoy. As great as the property is the hosts set it over the top. Catherine was super responsive, proactive with great restaurant recommendations and took the time to share the details of their working farm. Additionally, we were able to take home some of the pork raised on this excellent property. We will be back in the spring!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at 17 Degrees North so very much. From the moment we arrived, we fell in love with this property. The views are insanely beautiful. Catherine was very responsive to any questions we had. The cabin was spotless and was very well stocked. This is the perfect place for a cozy couples getaway. I highly recommend taking the farm tour and trying some of the mangalitsa! There is so much to see on this property. The only downside is having to pack up to return home. We are already looking at dates for our next visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay at Catherine’s cabin. Beautiful views and very cozy.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect end to our honeymoon!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here. It was so great to be able to bring our dog and walk all around the farm. Catherine gave us a list of everything available at the Airbnb and what she recommended to bring, which made packing very easy. The place was very clean and the views were beautiful. We hope to come back again sometime!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible experience!! Our hosts made us feel right at home! The farm was gorgeous and fun to explore. The cabin was incredibly clean and nice. The views of the mountains and the Pigeon River are phenomenal. I highly recommend staying here!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is WOW!! We loved our stay! If you’re looking for privacy for just you and your spouse, this is the place to be! Words can not describe how amazing this place is. We also got the privilege of getting a tour of the property. Catherine was great and we enjoyed knowing the history about the animals and her property. The town of Waynesville is small but perfect if you’re looking for craft beer, great atmospheres and great food. We are already looking to book our place for next year. This is hands down the BEST Airbnb we have ever stayed at! Thank you again Catherine…we will see you soon!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You’re reading these reviews and probably wondering if it’s possibly as good as people say. Well it’s not. It’s better. Words can’t describe how beautiful, peaceful, and completely perfect the place is. We spent 3 days there for a mini honeymoon and I couldn’t recommend it more. Already looking at dates to go back. Catherine is the best and we couldn’t be more grateful for her creating such a wonderful space.
The bed is SO comfortable. The views are insane. It was super clean and tidy. Book this place right now!
We had a blast checking out the cute shops and restaurants in Waynesville. (Boojum Brewery is a must)
Since it gets dark so early now, we brought a projector and a king size flat sheet and had the best little movie night. Would totally recommend - we couldn’t think of anything we’d change.
Catherine, if you decide to put a hot tub in we are moving in. 😂"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This trip exceeded our expectations in every way! The cabin was beautiful with all the modern amenities, the views were spectacular and the hosts were so kind and responsive. Catherine and Rick were the most gracious and kind hosts. We thoroughly enjoyed our meeting them and being able to experience their beautiful property.
Pictures do not do the view and property justice! The cabin is located at the top peak of their property overlooking their farm and a beautiful running river that you can access easily. The cabin was the perfect place to enjoy our anniversary with our dog. The property is very dog friendly and its easy to say that our pup had the time of his life running around the property, meeting the animals and swimming in the river. The farm is located just off of the interstate so getting there was very easy it was only a short drive into town.
If you are looking for a relaxing weekend in the mountains, this is the place. 10 out of 10 would recommend, we will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos do not do this property justice. It is absolutely stunning! Catherine is a wonderful hostess. She welcomes you to the property with a personal greeting. The river is beautiful and we had horses, goats, and donkeys right outside our door. We spent several hours sitting around the fire pit enjoying the views in the evening. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely staying here for our anniversary! Catherine was wonderful and the farm was more than we expected it to be. Cozy, efficient cabin, great outdoor spaces, our dog loved being outside, and we had the most breathtaking views. We hope to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely fantastic! We had a set back in our schedule and weren’t able to get in until almost midnight- Catherine ensured that the lights were left on for us and the door was open to make the process easy. It’s a bit tricky navigating how to get to the cabin, especially at night, but the directions were clear!
When we woke up the first morning we were absolutely in awe of the view- breathtaking! We spent the day in Asheville the following in smoky mountain national park, both were easily drivable from the cabin, 30 mins and 1.5 hours respectively. Our last night we were able to enjoy a nice fire in the fire pit and look at the stars like you would never see in Baltimore 😂
We so wished we had planned a longer trip to soak in more time at this space, we will 100% be back again to enjoy all Catherine and her farm has to offer! You truly have to see it to believe how wonderful this place is!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I have traveled widely and used AirBNB often. We have never stayed at a prettier, more peaceful place. The host was amazing, as was the location. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here right after our wedding in Asheville. This is the perfect post-wedding mini-moon / honey-moon spot. The bed is VERY comfortable and the surroundings are peaceful and beautiful. We slept easily for almost 12 hours the first night post-wedding. It is easy to unplug and be present. It's also very close to Waynesville, Maggie Valley, Pisgah, Asheville, and Smoky Mountain National Park - about 15-45 minutes to each of these locations. It feels both central and remote."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I didn’t want to leave. This simple but wonderful stay is just what your soul needs. The views are amazing, the space is well thought out and comfortable. The farm is so beautiful. You really need to experience it for yourself. I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our best air bnb experience ever!! Everything worked great, there was enough supplies and the cleanliness was perfect. It felt like we slept in a tree house but an upscale treehouse. The property is magical and we hope to go every year! And our puppy loved the space even more! I can’t even describe Catherine’s hospitality and warm welcome. She felt like family! Thank you again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay at Catherine's 17 Degrees North Mountain Cabin! Located at the top of the hill, it was incredible to wake up the first morning and see the view! Had a great time hanging outside on the deck and around the fireplace. Super cool how the horses/goats/donkeys graze essentially just feet from your window. Was nice to walk by the river and see the pigs as well. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed and more!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Catherine’s. We came here for our post elopement stay and it was perfect. The view is unreal and you really feel so at ease on this property. We will be recommending this to anyone who will listen!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible. Restful, the views were amazing. Such a lovely oasis. This little house perched on top of the hill was just what we needed to relax and get away. Host was so kind and welcoming. We would love to come back! What an inviting, lovely place!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Words cannot describe how perfect this location is. We had a great time walking the grounds, we even had a bald eagle fly right over the deck. There is a mated pair that resides at Lake Junalooska right down the road, we had no idea they were local to the area! We also saw an otter playing in the river and enjoyed Catherine’s farms animals as well. We cannot wait to try our sausage! Few places have lasting effects such as this one, magical."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing getaway! One of a kind! The pictures hardly do it justice!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're still daydreaming about our stay at Catherine's beautiful property. It was the perfect weekend getaway for our one year anniversary. Our favorite part was the view from the cabin while lying in bed. Breathtaking! And we loved waking up to the horses and other farm life nearby and being able to take long walks around the farm and enjoy the nature that surrounded us. It was truly a trip to remember. We're already trying to convince family and friends to visit and experience what we did. :) Thank you, Catherine!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Not many places will have such a positive effect on your soul, the 17 degrees north put me back
On track to what is most important & the view will set you free!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough about this hidden gem. It’s a slice of Heaven on earth. My favorite spot in the mountains by far!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful place this is! Pictures don’t do it justice. Amazing host. Clean. Easy to get to. And the views are unreal. Watched a lighting storm with the garage door open and it was truly magical. Catherine from the short conversation we had seemed like a truly awesome person. Blessed to have even experienced this with my wife and two dogs, on a much needed vacation. Supporting small businesses like this is what it’s all about. Will be back sooner than later!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous property and cabin setting with spectacular views. Host is very organized, thoughtful, friendly and responsive. Would love to return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a breathtaking view! We felt comfortable here right away. Catherine and Rick are amazing welcoming hosts.
The farm looks like something right out of a fairytale. The bed was incredibly comfortable and had supima cotton sheets!! They were incredible. We’ve never slept so well at an Airbnb. The cabin had everything we needed. You can tell how much love and hard work has been put into this beautiful mountain escape."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the absolute best AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in. Totally floored at how perfect it was! Catherine & Rick were amazing hosts, super friendly. Land is stunning and plenty of peace and quiet! We definitely want to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cathrine and Rick were amazing hosts! They communicated thoroughly throughout our stay whenever we needed anything. My boyfriend and I came to celebrate our anniversary, we were at a loss for words due to the amazing scenery (mountain top views, horses, mangalista pigs, beautiful sunsets, etc). We came from the city and needed a quiet, peaceful, private getaway; this cabin checked all those boxes and beyond more! We can’t wait to plan our next trip back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s a lovely peaceful place, perfect for relaxing and reconnecting with nature. Catherine was lovely and I would love to come back again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Catherine’s place is amazing and she’s a wonderful host. I can’t recommend enough.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a perfect escape. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay of a lifetime. The views are incredible, it was the perfect honeymoon spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we absolutely loved our stay there!! Catherine was so welcoming and made us feel right at home on their farm!! the house was amazing, breathtaking view and super clean, well equipped too!! we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It's hard to communicate how insane this place is. It really made my wife and I want to retire and buy a farm. The room itself is well designed, clean, and in the perfect setting. The hospitality that Catherine shows on the entrance to her Airbnb is generous and not overwhelming. We might just come back every year. I'm not kidding. It's that good."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A must return! Can’t say enough good things. This place was adorable and the view was breathtaking. The bed is amazingly comfortable, it’s a well decorated space with high quality pieces. The outdoor furniture was perfect for reading and enjoying the view and the built in deck hammocks were so fun! We were able to get some good sun in the lounge chairs and you can lay and listen to the river down below. Catherine was an amazing host. So glad to have met her. My daughter and I immensely enjoyed the farm tour. Seeing the horses and goats grazing outside the house in the evening was enjoyable. Definitely recommend rubber rafts (which we didn’t have) for the river, but what we were able to to enjoy was great! Book it! You won’t be disappointed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a great place to relax and take in the beauty that surrounds this place! We would love to come back. Thank you Catherine and Rick!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Catherine’s home. It was stunning, perfect, thoughtful and comfortable. I highly recommend this gem to the air bnb community. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Completely enjoyed our visit at 17’ North! Beautiful and peaceful. Just what we where looking for. Would love to visit it again.
Thank you Catherine for all of your recommendations. We enjoyed our stay so much."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was an absolute dream. Catherine was very friendly and informative upon arrival and was very responsive to my messages prior to our stay.
The cabin was comfortable and had breathtaking views. I highly recommend this location for low key, peaceful getaway . We'll definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was everything I needed and more to take a mental health break from work! I’d been eyeing it on here for a while and I finally found a few days in July that were open.
Words can’t describe how you feel when you reach the top of the hill where the cabin is. It’s sooooo beyond beautiful and peaceful.
The fog in the morning is so cool to watch roll in and out. And at twilight, lightning bugs come out to play! It was magical!
Our big dog had the time of her life running around, in the river and exploring the farm with us. And got to meet Stetson the farm dog too, who is very sweet.
The cabin is super clean and exactly as described. Grocery store and restaurants in Waynesville 10 mins away. If you have a dog with you, go to the Smokey Mountain Dog Bakery in Waynesville…such a great shop and friendly people.
We bought some Mangsalita pork from Catherine as well and cant wait to try!
PS- the horses and goats come by the cabin around 8pm and they loved carrots and apples!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We love this amazing vacation get away! You will not regret it! We will be back many times. The perfect find
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! The cabin was perfect and the farm was very peaceful, we enjoyed walking around the farm and seeing the animals, hanging out by the river, and taking in the great views. Catherine is an amazing host and this was by far the best Air BnB we have stayed at, highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm was was everything we had hoped it would be and more. You are literally in the clouds. The place was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We loved the pigs and all the other animals, and had Rick drop us 3.5 miles up the river one day for a float down with our tubes. The rapids can get a little tricky at spots and deff needs a solid river tube as you will hit some rocks along the way. We are already planning to come back for a visit in the future. Maybe even for a camp along the river instead."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb is really special. The views are amazing and it was so fun to walk around the farm. We loved the indoor/outdoor living. We were able to visit downtown Waynesville and Asheville, and also to do some hiking off of the Blue Ridge Highway during our stay, but it was always nice to come back and relax at Catherine’s place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an anniversary getaway that was better than expected. Catherine is an amazing host and her property is absolutely beautiful, peaceful and pristine. My husband and I relaxed and enjoyed every moment of our stay. We definitely want to return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This has been mine and my husband’s favorite Airbnb experience. Catherine is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She met us at the gate and led us up to the Airbnb on the property. It was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in and was well stocked with everything we possibly could have needed. The views are incredible and walking around the farm to see all of the animals was so fun. We ordered the spicy sausage from Catherine who brought it right to our door. It was absolutely delicious. It felt good staying in an Airbnb that supports a small farm and local business. We absolutely want to come back. I cannot recommend this Airbnb or a camping trip to the farm more highly.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a GEM! Read all the details of the listing, every bit of info you need is there. Catherine was wonderful from beginning to end, and we loved all of her animals! Everything with the space is so well thought out and the views are perfection. The fireflies at night were spectacular, and we even live in WNC and see them often. We only stayed a night, but it was everything we wanted. CLEAN, comfy bed, perfect easy fire pit…everything was great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! This place is a little slice of heaven and Catherine is so welcoming and warm! The cabin is truly breathtaking, and I think it’s impossible to capture how amazing the views are at any time of day. It was the perfect retreat for my husband and I on our anniversary and we will absolutely be back!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! We LOVED our stay and it had everything you could need. We would love to stay here again during our next stay in North Carolina.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was 100% better than we excepted. Being less than 30 minutes from downtown Asheville and so close to hiking all around it was a perfect location. Extremely clean and comfortable!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Catherine's mountain escape is absolutely stunning. The views from the room are beautiful, especially when the fog rolls in in the morning then clears later in the day. The land has pigs, horses, donkeys, goats, and the sweetest farm dog. We strolled along the river and visited the animals during our stay which was so much fun. The space itself is very clean and beautifully designed. The bathroom is large and comes with lots of towels. The bed is so soft and makes me hate my bed at home haha. There is no TV or microwave, but there are lots of pots, pans, eating utensils- basically everything you need to heat up or cook food. The toaster oven came in handy to heat food up quickly. Catherine was so attentive and communicated back almost immediately after I asked a question. The location is about 10 minutes from a grocery store and 30 minutes from Asheville."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A little slice of heaven!
Everything matched the description and photos perfectly. The views were majestic! Walking around the property is so peaceful and refreshing. Catherine is an excellent host. We would not hesitate to book this cabin again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the absolute BEST weekend! This Airbnb did not disappoint. Such a cool experience! We have already recommended it to our friends and family.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, clean and private for couples. Unique farm stay overlooking a creek that can be heard from the front deck or gas fire pit as you watch the sun set or sun rise with your loved one. You can enjoy the views though the large glass windows as well. We preferred to grill or get takeout from one of the close groceries or restaurants. That way we could enjoy the sunset from the very high deck with built in hammock."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most wonderful stay at Catherine and Rick’s place! The pictures don’t do this place justice. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway with breathtaking views, then staying here is an absolute must! We loved exploring the farm, taking a swim in the river, and sitting on the patio admiring the mountains with our newborn son. The kitchen and grill had all the amenities to allow us to cook for several days, allowing us to maximize our time at the property. We also bought some Mangalitsa that we can’t wait to try! Our souls feel refreshed after experiencing this place. Special thanks to the hosts, Catherine and Rick, for sharing this treasure with the world. Do yourself a favor and book it :) We can’t wait to visit again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catherine’s place was above and beyond what we could have imagine! She does not go cheap on things like sheets, pillows, bath towels, they were such high quality! There was nothing we loved more than waking up to the amazing view we had from our beds every morning. We loved this place so much and can’t wait for a future visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful relaxing time
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catherine was an outstanding host, one of the best that we have had through our many years with AirBnB. The lodging and surrounding environment was so peaceful and a great escape from the busy city life. It was fun to walk around the property and see the animals and enjoy the river. Highly recommended to anyone that is looking for a place to relax and unwind. Our dog had the best time as well!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a dream come true! We stayed for three nights with our two dogs and we had a wonderful experience. The location was perfect because it wasn’t too far away from anything but felt secluded enough. Pictures do not do this place justice. The rolling hills, River, and farm animals make this place idyllic for any get away from real life. Horses, goats, and donkeys came up close to the fence near the cabin which was one of our favorite parts! Just felt like heaven!
The owner listed out items that were in the cabin and a list of potential items you should bring. Pay attention to that list. We met both of the owners and they were both so nice and appreciative of renting their space and helping out their farm.
We would highly recommend this place to anyone! One of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed and spent time in!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best airbnb we've ever been to. Between waking up with the view, to reading books on the built in hammock, to walking down to the river-this was the most gorgeous and peaceful place we've ever stayed. If you're reading this review then do yourself a favor and book Catherine's place! We can't wait to go back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t say enough good things about our stay. The cabin is just like the pictures. The view is stunning! Catherine is so friendly and kind. She takes a lot of pride in their farm and their rentals, which is clear by how well taken care of the property is. We usually don’t go to the same Airbnb twice just because we like to try different areas and spots, but I can definitely see is returning here. It was beautiful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Catherine and Rick's farm cabin was unforgettable. The views are spectacular, with beautiful mountains, rolling hills, animal pastures, and streams. We had a lovely time sitting by the fire, stargazing on the lawn chairs, cooking on the grill, and going on a farm tour (which included feeding the donkeys!).
This cabin is especially great for animal lovers. There are donkeys, horses, goats, and the unique Hungarian mangalitsa pigs roaming the farm, with some even spending time very near the cabin.
Catherine and Rick were wonderful hosts who made us feel right at home; they were attentive and friendly and taught us a lot about how they run the farm.
The drive up to the cabin is steep but worth it for such majestic views. If you're an early riser, you can see the breathtaking fog amongst the mountains.
We had a wonderful stay and would recommend the cabin to anyone. Camping is also available on the property. You won't regret your stay . We didn't want to leave!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and fantastic place to relax and unwind. A truly unique, thoughtful and inspiring retreat. Catherine and Rick were perfect hosts who’ve poured hard work and life dreams into creating and sharing this “River Runs Trough It” homestead. It was a wonderful experience! Thank you for sharing your story and property with us!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the nicest place we’ve stayed at on AirBnb. The surrounding views are idyllic. We had some chaotic weather while we were visiting and weren’t able to spend as much time outside, but it didn’t matter because it was so comfortable, we could relax indoors and stare out the large windows. The features and furniture are quite luxurious, from the bedding to the fireplace, to the outdoor furniture. The grounds are gorgeous and the animals are lovely, and we’ll taken care of. 10/10 would return."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancé and I couldn’t stop raving about this place! Catherine was so responsive and inviting even before we arrived. The cabin and the view were indescribable! Catherine and her husband Rick, take such amazing care of their farm, it doesn’t even look real. This was hands down our favorite getaway, and we can’t wait to go back again! We highly recommended booking this place, you will be jaw dropped! Thank you so much Catherine and Rick!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am not even sure where to begin! For our anniversary each year, my husband and I choose a getaway and I have to say this place exceeded ALL of our expectations and is the best place we have stayed so far!! Catherine and Rick were beyond helpful and friendly and made our stay so enjoyable. The place was so beautiful, clean and so incredibly peaceful! We are already planning our next stay with them and absolutely cannot wait! Thank you Catherine and Rick for sharing your home with us!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow this place was absolutely beautiful!! It’s great in pictures, but even better in person! The cabin was wonderfully decorated and was so comfortable! The location was great, close to Asheville and downtown Waynesville. Not far from grocery stores, restaurants, and amazing hikes within an hour drive through the mountains. There’s a ton to see on the property as well. Catherine was absolutely wonderful and very helpful! We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I must say, this place absolutely exceeded my expectations. Not only was Catherine (and her husband) incredibly kind, she made us feel right at home on their entire property. The views are some of the best in North Carolina and we felt like we had our own private cabin in the middle of the mountains. If I could give 6 stars I would haha!
Thank you again for everything!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn’t get home fast enough to complete my review!! This place is absolutely BREATHTAKING!! If the days you want are available, just book now! Although the pictures in the listing are captivating, the pictures don’t really capture the beauty of this place! I think my favorite part was the serenity, extremely quiet and peaceful. I traveled here as a single, woman and I felt very safe my entire stay, I even had the garage door up at night while I settled in for the evening! The bed and sheets are absolute luxury, better than any hotel! Catherine’s communication is prompt and thoughtful! Although pets are welcome here, if you aren’t a “pet-person”, I guarantee you will never know this is a pet-friendly rental— it is absolutely spotless and no odd smells! I felt right at home! This is my first time traveling to an airbnb where I was planning my next visit before I checked out✨"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Catherine’s great! 17N was absolutely beautiful!!! 10/10 would recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had such a peaceful weekend! The most beautiful views! It was incredibly clean, and had everything we needed stocked so it made things easy. I can’t wait to go back again! The aesthetic was superb, well decorated. The linens/towels were abundant and great quality. A plus is the bed/pillows were very comfortable as well. Catherine is very quick to respond/super friendly and that was very helpful. Oh also we especially loved the location as it seemed off in the middle of nowhere with its views, but it actually was only a short drive to the grocery store and that was beyond convenient. It’s honestly the best place we’ve vacationed at in the NC mountains, it’s truly phenomenal. Worth every penny. We will definitely be back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re lucky enough to find this, book it. The view is amazing! Attention to detail, great host."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was simply magical. It was the perfect getaway for the weekend. My husband and I woke up to beautiful views and private sunrises. Catherine was so kind and generous, super responsive. I would stay again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catherine is a fantastic host, and her place is absolutely breathtaking! The photos don’t even do it justice. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting to be off the grid but still have all the comforts of home as well. An unforgettable experience!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful farm with Mountain View’s. It is so peaceful and perfect! The tiny house is so nice and we loved it. The animals are so cool ..so much fun to watch!
We will be back!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"i absolutely loved this spot. me and my girlfriend have made a hobby to secluded a little air B&Bs that are worth their price point and everything about this airbnb hit it perfectly. for us it’s easily top 8 of the hundreds we’ve been too. It is such a perfect romantic getaway spot. with great views and awesome trails to walk. and don’t forget to bring your pups because my dog absolutely loved the area it’s fenced it very well so both your furry kids and the local wildlife are safe. the kitchen is a little hard to work with but you’ll manage as i was able to make some good breakfast, lunch, and dinner with what’s in the kitchen area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time at the farm! We had some unexpected snow causing some frozen pipes, but Catherine and her husband were so hospitable and generous, helping us with everything we needed to make it the most relaxing and enjoyable weekend!! If you’re looking for a getaway that’s close to things, but also so secluded and cozy, this is it! We will be back :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. The view is incredible and the farm is very peaceful. We would love to book again in the near future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful spot. Very private location, honestly an incredible getaway. First day we walked around the farm, fished right on the farm and explored Waynesville. Second day we drove to Great Smokey Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains. The view just from the cabin was worth it."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing!! I feel blessed to have found this location. The whole experience from the day of booking till the day we left was 10/10!! I would recommend this to everyone that is looking to truly have some peace and tranquility. The views are stunning day and night!
Relaxing on the hammock at night looking at all the stars was definitely something we enjoyed! Even napping on the chairs outside during the day was very enjoyable because of waking up to those awesome views.
We enjoyed seeing our neighbors (the farm animals!) from a distance. The mangalitsa pigs is something you have to see in person! Always learning something new, never knew pigs like that existed!
Everything was clean, comfortable and perfect! We didn’t walk around the farm and explore but next time we will for sure!!
Location is perfect. Decent drive to go on hiking trails or going to explore Asheville.
Catherine is GREAT!!!! She went out of her way to talk to us the day we left. She made it that much more special!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host, Catherine, was amazing . She was very responsive and met with us on arrival and explained everything provided a map ( the property is massive) and provided her personal number so that you could contact her with any needs. The hospitality alone made it worth it
The actual listing is amazing . This is the perfect getaway to escape your adult responsibilities and just relax. Absolutely somewhere I would go again.
P.S they have curly haired pigs that look like sheep…. lol !"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"There are no words to describe how beautiful, peaceful, & serene Catherine’s place, 17°N, is. The cabin was super clean and had everything we needed. The view from the cabin is just breathtaking—mountains, the Pigeon River, and all of the farm animals grazing. Catherine was super helpful and quick in responding to my many questions. She even hand drew us a map of the property. It was great having full access to explore the property and fish the river. Love that the place is pet friendly and we could bring our pup! She loved exploring the grounds. The farm is in such a great location, secluded and quiet, yet close to the interstate, gas stations, stores, and restaurants. We even brought some Mangalitsa sausage home with us. Catherine made this process super easy. Great place, would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Catherine met us at the gate when we arrived. She is extremely kind and her property is beautiful. We were very grateful to be able to stay in such a peaceful location. It was fun to meet all the animals on the property as well.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a little slice of heaven! You will not regret your stay here, the nature and view make it impossible to not relax and be completely happy. Unheard of views, animals everywhere to see while still pet friendly for your own fur babies, wonderful vacation, wonderful host !!! Nothing negative to say, we will be back every year!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot! Beautiful and very clean. Kind service and hospitality
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Catherine’s cabin. It was clean, and the bed and linens were really comfortable! The farm and grounds were absolutely beautiful.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super pretty place to say. Beautiful views!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay! The place was very clean and very accurate regarding the listing. The view was beautiful, Catherine was very helpful, and overall we’d love to come back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Waking up to coffee with amazing views and camp fires, close to a town with good dining, bistros and quaint shops nearby is what we hoped our mother, daughter trip would be about. This place was all that! The horses just outside our cabin in the morning added to the beautiful view. The cabin in the sky is beautifully decorated and impeccable. The bed and bedding is better than what you find in luxury hotels and the place has everything you need. The only thing we didn't anticipate was the steep, gravel road leading up to cabin. Going up was a bit nerve wracking for my 84 yr old mom but after a few trips up and down, she was fine and then it was...Wow... what a view! You will love the host too, Catherine was personable and accommodating to us during our stay. We highly recommend this place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot and very clean!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pictures don’t do it justice. The home is beautiful and are perfect for a nice little getaway.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have been more thrilled with our stay. The views left us speechless, we loved having farm animals as our only neighbors, and the cabin was clean, spacious, and has great proximity to restaurants, breweries, and hiking spots. Catherine is a wonderful host and really thought of everything to make our experience enjoyable and relaxing. We have already recommended this place to so many of our friends and family and can't wait to book here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"FANTASTIC! Beautiful views, excellent host, and impeccable cleanliness. Great location for sightseeing (Biltmore, Cataloochee Valley, Waynesville, etc.), but you may choose to spend most of your time at this lovely location. We are looking forward to returning soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was absolutely amazing. Perfectly clean and had everything you needed for a cozy get away. Catherine encouraged us to explore the farm which was awesome. There are nice chairs around the property and the views are incredible. Would absolutely recommend and hopefully return !!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is phenomenal! It was exactly what we needed. We wanted a view, seclusion and a place that we could just enjoy each other for our 5th anniversary. The view was unmatched. Catherine was so upbeat and pleasant when we arrived and did a full walk through explaining anything we may have had questions with. We walked the farm and went down to the creek/River and enjoyed all of it. There really are no words — go and see for yourself! We will be returning ♥️"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Could not recommend more. Great host!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Everyone enjoyed the games. For the more complicated devices there were video tutorials that we easy to access and allowed us to enjoy everything. Beds were very comfortable, and being up in the woods was very relaxing. We have even discussed going back with another group."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome house l, games were amazing."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful home, very spacious, with lots of great indoor and outdoor spaces to relax and spend time with family. Very spacious bedrooms with plenty of rooms and bathrooms, comfortable beds and nice linens. Kitchen is extremely well supplied, with plenty of cooking ware, dishes, and great appliances….one of the best supplied kitchens in all of the Airbnbs we have rented. So many beautiful outdoor decks. And the area/neighborhood is beautiful, quiet and serene. Hosts were easy to communicate with and always responsive. Would highly recommend this home!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great house and amenities. Would definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time! The house is very comfortable and offers so much to do that it’s an experience in itself. I would definitely recommend this property!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were beyond impressed. The house was everything we imagined based on the pictures, but once we arrived it was so much more. The attention to detail made for an above and beyond experience. The house is so thoughtfully decorated and equipped, they have thought of everything you could need. What a magical stay tucked away in the mountains. We hope to go back in the future and enjoy it again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a magical place! It’s exactly as pictured and the hosts thought of every little detail. Location was perfect for a quiet weekend getaway and we so appreciated we could share the experience with our dogs. The impeccable design and decor of this A-Frame are one of a kind and make you feel right at home. You can tell how much love and effort were put into creating this escape to nature. The home creates the perfect ambience for reading a good book, playing guitar on the back deck, a soak in the hot tub and waking up to the sounds of birds! Absolute dream home and location! Thank you for sharing this little slice of heaven amongst the mountains!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My cousins and I stayed at the Aframe for three nights and had a fantastic time! We would explore Asheville during the day and relax in the evening. I enjoyed all the corners I could hide away and read a book and the shared space where we could play games and hang out. I can't wait to visit again in the future
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most magical stay. The a frame looked exactly as pictured. It was beautiful decorated, peaceful, and everything we needed. Definitely coming back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wow. This is what an Airbnb is supposed to be - experiencing the love and care of someone’s beautiful home! What a relaxing and private place with all the amenities you could need! Plenty of great trails in the area and Black Mountain/Asheville are a short drive. Loved it!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Little Mountain A Frame is absolutely incredible. My wife and I have stayed at airbnbs all over the world and this is the best one yet. We brought our 5 month old twins and dog (as advertised, not kid friendly but easy for the infants). The a frame itself is incredible. Every detail is well thought out from the record player to the decor which made this place special. The back porch provides immediately relaxation along with the reading nook. We also drove into Old Fort for a beer and food at Hillman Brewery (10/10). We had some rough weather during our trip and Shealy checked in on us multiple times to make sure we were okay and if we needed anything.
Overall Shealy’s place is perfect and she is an amazing host. Book without hesitation. We would love to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean cabin! Will definitely be back!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to relax, will definitely be back!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shealy’s cabin was perfect for a private getaway. The space was very clean, comfortable, and impeccably decorated. It’s at the end of a private road and feels very secluded. It was peaceful every night we sat outside to look at the starts or enjoy the hot tub. The cabin is a quick drive from Black Mountain and Old Fort where you can find local breweries and antique shops. We had such a relaxing time and will definitely be back for our next vacation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most beautiful homes I have ever seen! Shealy was so amazing, sweet, and very understanding! If we have the chance we would love to stay again. The home was absolutely perfection!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Me and my family had an awesome time! Such a beautiful getaway and Shealy was incredibly helpful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was absolute perfection. It was peaceful and private. Everything is decorated to the nines and the vibes are incredible. All of shealy’s instructions were simple and clear and she was SO kind and quick to respond. It’s an easy and pretty drive into Asheville and Old Fort is cute. We absolutely will return!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was just what we needed to recharge — private, quiet, and peaceful. The accommodations had everything we wanted and more. From the moment we walked in, it felt incredibly calming and comfortable. The cabin featured many perfect spots to curl up with a book or to take a nap, both inside and outdoors. We didn’t want to leave!
Would highly recommended this cabin and look forward to returning in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend!! We came to old fort for our honeymoon, and didn’t want to leave! It was the perfect trip"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second visit to the little mountain A frame and it was just as enjoyable as the first! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a retreat to the mountains/in the woods
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We could not have been happier with our stay! The house is beautifully decorated and offered some tranquility from our normal hustle and bustle lifestyle. Shealy was incredibly responsive and provided us with a ton of awesome recommendations both right in Old Fort and in Asheville. We checked out Hillmans Brewery in Old Fort based on her recommendation and give that place 5 stars…great atmosphere, food, and drinks. Overall the little mountain A Frame is a fantastic place to stay if you’re looking for something around Asheville."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Might be the best air bnb we’ve ever stayed in! Shealy’s place is a cozy oasis we haven’t stopped talking about. So beautifully designed and created for rest and reconnection. We can’t wait to come back. Shealy was also so helpful and communicative. 15/10 experience all around!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the most magical air Bnb experience we have ever had! Everything in Shealy’s place is perfectly curated- you can tell how much love and work was put into this place. We especially loved the book collection, the deck, and all of the cozy spots to read and relax throughout the space. We had tentative plans to spend in Asheville one day, but ended up just staying back because we wanted to soak up all we could of this cozy little A frame. We hope to come back again whenever we can. Book this if you get the chance- you won’t regret it!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little Mountain A-Frame will go down in history as our favorite Airbnb experience! What a dream. It was absolutely wonderful. A highlight for us was enjoying the back deck hot tub as a cold front blew in. The home is pristine and SO cozy. We loved every minute. Thank you for sharing your special space with us, Shealy! We will most certainly be back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I so enjoyed our stay at the Little Mountain Cabin! This A-frame was magical between the decor, hot tub, hammock, and fire pit. We were about 5 minutes from town (where we had the best cinnamon buns at Gogo’s) and 35 minutes from Asheville with other great restaurants and breweries. There were many hiking options relatively nearby as well. This location was the perfect oasis!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a dream!! Shealy’s place is cultivated for the perfect cozy weekend. Beautiful, private, and clean. We have already planned to head back this fall!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay here! Everything was incredible. Would highly recommend this cabin!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is magical and one of our favorite Airbnbs of all time! From the gorgeous design to the peaceful surroundings, everything was perfect. I'm already eyeing the calendar to see when we can stay again, haha! :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really gorgeous stay. The photos are beautiful but honestly they don’t do it justice. If you’re looking for a clean (spotless, really), beautiful place with amenities and privacy, book this one! Great, helpful hosts as well."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I spent a few wonderful nights at Shealy's A frame and it was just perfect! The house is very private and I enjoyed spending time on the deck with the dogs. Note that aging pups may not make it up the spiral staircase, but we enjoyed the downstairs bedroom with blackout shades perfect for sleeping in. There were many cozy blankets for cold nights and the showers were amazing. I will certainly be back for more mountain R&R, and to explore the Blue Ridge Parkway when weather allows it to reopen!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a perfect getaway location for my little family! Shealy was an amazing host! As soon as we walked through the front doors we felt peaceful and it really had us connect to each other! Will definitely be booking again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 out of 5 stars. I brought my husband here as a surprise getaway without the kids. I wanted us to get a feel for ""tiny"" cabin living in the NC mountains, but this place actually felt very spacious and nothing about it felt cramped or left us wanting. Besides enjoying getting away from work for a couple nights, we loved the privacy, the full kitchen, the hot tub, the warm blankets, the proximity to the downtown area of Black Mountain with their bookstore and ice cream shop, the cute decor and architectural design, the easy check-in and check-out, the friendly instructions from Shealy, the soft lighting, the roomy showers, the view, the option to have a campfire outside, the option to bring our dogs if needed... We were very pleased with our relaxing stay and want a place like this of our own, tucked away in the mountains! Thank you Shealy for sharing your cabin with us! We were so impressed and would be happy to return with family or friends."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay here. The most beautiful, picturesque place! Very clean and homey. Close to all the best hiking, food, and coffee shops! Great little local shops nearby too."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Little Mountain for our anniversary trip. What a gem! Absolutely perfect for a couples getaway. Would highly recommend, we will be staying here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very cozy and exactly what we were looking for.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rang in the new year at the Little Mountain A-frame - it’s an absolute gem - our very favorite Airbnb to date!
Shealy is the best host - and the beautiful cabin was stocked with everything we could have ever wanted! No detail spared.✨
We loved evenings around the fire pit, and the views are spectacular!
We can’t wait to visit again!❤️"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our favorite airbnb stay ever! Not only was the home pristine and beautiful with a gorgeous setting, Shealy thought of everything. Anything you could imagine needing, it was there for you. The home is absolutely darling, and the perfect setting for a quiet getaway. We even brought our goldendoodle and she was right at home. Perfect perfect perfect!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had the best weekend away! The cabin was beautiful and so peaceful!
Definitely will be back as soon as we are in the area again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I absolutely loved the A-frame! There is not one single thing I’d change or add to the property. It is secluded but without a 30 minute winding drive up the mountain. The layout was so well thought out and I truly felt at home. I cooked each night and they have thought of everything you could need. It was perfectly stocked with amazing touches without feeling cluttered. The house was decorated for Christmas and the lights and tree were such a nice extra touch. Comfortable beds, pillows, couch and chairs. Loved the furniture and plants. The vibe was perfect. I used the fire pit and the hot tub and both were excellent to have and easy to operate. I’d love to come back in the Spring. And again in the Fall. Old Fort was also such a cute little area. Highly recommend the dog friendly Hillman brewery and the cinnamon rolls at Gogo’s. The property was so clean and well maintained. Loved my stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Little Mountain A-frame is in a pristine location--being near Asheville without having to deal with snarling traffic makes this location so relaxing. Well, that, plus all that thoughtful amenities provided by Shealy!
Clean, private, solidly-built, and a hot tub on a private balcony--Kudos! We will definitely return here again and again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, Shealy is just a pleasure to converse with! She has thought of everything when it comes to spending time in their gorgeous A-Frame. The location was exactly what we were looking for – secluded but not too far from busier cities like Black Mountain & Asheville. Shealy thoughtfully decorated for the holidays & it made the place feel so magical. You can tell they put a ton work & love into this place. My husband is a contractor & usually when we go places he is critiquing, but it was even wildly impressed with finish work and details. This home is so warm & full of good energy & beautiful crystals. The kitchen is completely stocked w/everything you would need. The break from TV screens was so ideal but they do have a record player along with a JBL speaker. The beds and pillows were clouds and even the towels were XL. Pictures do not do this place justice, BOOK IMMEDIATELY while you have a chance.
PS- If you go to Black Mountain on your trip I cannot recommend Bush Farmhouse enough"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shealy was so responsive and helpful! The airbnb was so beautiful and had everything we needed. It was such a nice get away. I look forward to visiting again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing thanksgiving at the Little mountain A-frame! The cabin is beautiful and so we’ll decorated. There were so many nice little touches. The kitchen and bathrooms had everything you would need. We enjoyed the fire pit and the hot tub. The area was very quiet and felt safe and private at the same time. 30ish minutes into Asheville was perfect for dinners out and just under an hour to the parkway. Our pup had a great stay as well. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t thank Shealy enough for her hospitality. The A Frame is a cozy, comfortable retreat for a getaway to the woods, and it’s exactly as pictured. We loved all of the little extra surprises and personal touches, including snacks and holiday decorations. The decor is a testament to her keen eye for decorating and meticulous attention to detail. Super thoughtful and lovely!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place - we loved it
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shealy’s A-Frame Cabin is like a little bite of paradise. It is easy to get to, beautiful surroundings the entire way. Easy and clear check in with keypad…and then you walk in to this incredibly designed down to every single detail space. It’s brand new, super clean and organized. She has thought of literally everything down to leaving you coffee and KIND bars and extra pillows/blankets to ensure you have the most comfortable stay. We ended up making dinner there both nights we stayed because we wanted to soak up as much of our time there as possible. The spa like showers with the push out windows were such a treat to use. The soaking hot tub on the private deck was also amazing. We listened to records and played board games together and were so thankful to be there.
Downtown Old Fort is a cute little town as well. We grabbed some coffee, went to both breweries, found some really great shops and hit up a local potter on our drive back to the cabin!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at the little A frame was everything and more then we expected. All things were thought of to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Coffee included! We wanted to retreat away from the hustle and busyness of our City, and that's exactly what we got! The view off the back deck was enjoyed most of all. The hot tub was a wonderful addition to be able to stay warm while being in the woods. Beds were comfortable and decor was impressive and adored."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful, cozy, secluded place to stay! It was close enough to everything (highway: 20-25 minutes to Black Mountain, or an entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, and about 30-40 minutes to Asheville). Take the back roads, which is far more scenic, and it adds only 5-10 minutes to your adventures. The warm A-Frame was the last house at the end of the road with no one around you. The pleasant, clean, modern inside was a restful place to get away from it all and enjoy being out in nature. Definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Little Mountain A Frame is one of our favorite spots we’ve ever visited. The space is even better than the photos! Our little getaway was too short. We will definitely be coming again! The hot tub on the deck was icing on the cake so-to-speak. It was perfect!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not sure I have the words to truly describe the magic of Little Mountain A-Frame ✨ from the incredible piece of land it sits on, to the impeccable design and thoughtful details around every corner, this stay was an absolute dream!
Shealy has a way with making this place truly feel like home while you’re there. It’s was coziest cabin experience I could have ever hoped for. I started following Shealy’s journey of building and designing the A on social media and knew I had to see it in person. It blew all expectations I had out of the water!!
One of my favorite parts was that it’s dog friendly with a completely gated back deck to enjoy time outside with the pups- from morning coffee in the trees, to a dip in the hot tub at any point in the day.
My weekend getaway to Little Mountain A Frame was absolute perfection! Can’t wait to go back! ✨ ⛰️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"OMG!!! It’s thrilling magical experience our family recently had at A-frame cozy little mountain 🖤
I obsessed with the collection of Books she have available at her house for the guest to explore the meaningful life inside and outside of her tree house, she also have a collection of game board, camping set, everything she prepared to put with love and creative on the tree house will make your have a wonderful trip at the mountains.
The environment of all the trees surround on front and back of the house, all of the art works, decoration and little note when you arrive to the house will make you feel extremely warm welcome 🤗
Thank you for hosting us at your tremendous cozy A-frame house"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Shealy’s special place for our honeymoon after getting married this month. It was everything we expected plus more. Her attention to detail in her home is incredible. We loved every moment of it. I can’t even begin to describe the outside. Surrounded by nature in the mountain was so peaceful. We enjoyed their new cedar hot tub they put in. It was our favorite part of the whole home. We spent hours in there just drinking some wine after a day spent hiking. Just basking in the warmth and the nature around us. It became our little piece of heaven on earth. Shealy, thank you so much for letting us stay in your incredible home. You were so very accommodating to us both. You’re so sweet. We are definitely coming back every year for our anniversary. We truly didn’t want to leave. We will be back though!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a truly unique and special stay! The attention to detail and design at Little Mountain A-Frame is next level, with so many special touches and details that go well above and beyond any Airbnb I've ever stayed in. I loved walking around the house, taking in all the cozy corners and unique details, but the back deck was our absolute favorite. It's so peaceful and a great place to disconnect, enjoy/ listen to nature. My husband and I went to dinner in Old Fort (which was lovely!) and rushed back to enjoy as much time on the deck as possible.
Shealy + Eddie, thank you for sharing your beautiful a-frame! Your a-frame goes well beyond a five-star stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was so excited about our stay from looking at all the videos and pictures, somehow, they didn't even do the place justice. It was amazing. From the build to the decor, everything was intentional for relaxation. We had a perfect weekend at the A-frame and will definitely be coming back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a dreamy stay! Everything was as described and pictured. Truly felt like you were transported through time to a little mountain cabin/treehouse. Our golden retriever Macy loved the stairs and cuddling on the back deck, which made us so happy bc she had so much fun as well! Overall we had such a relaxing stay and hope to be back in the near future.
Great local recommendations were provided as well as some in Asheville! We loved being in the mountains but thought it was a good proximity to the city.
Shealy was very informative and helpful throughout our stay. Loved her design and attention to detail!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a dream come true! I almost don't want to leave a good review because I want to keep it as my little secret, but it's too good not to share. Everything about this home is literally perfect. The house itself is brand new and has everything you could possibly need for a relaxing vacation. The ambiance and vibe are amazing, and you'll feel like you're on vacation the minute you arrive. The attention to detail is incredible, and the owners have thought of everything. All you need to do is show up and relax! I will absolutely be coming back to this place for years to come.
They also were extremely sweet and allowed my dog to join. I think the pup loved it more then me! She played in the yard and hung out next to me while I read a book and drank a coffee overlooking the mountains!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This deserves a 10 start review. My husband and I decided to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary in the mountains- to recharge and check out all the beautiful scenery Western NC has to offer! The cabin itself is warm and welcoming- it was a dream to stay there! You feel welcomed + comfortable as soon as you walk in. Clean + tidy., comfortable bed. Details even in the lower bathroom for us ladies that forget our makeup wash! They have a perfect private location. We enjoyed watching the sun set on the front balcony and listening to the sounds of nature. Turning on the record player. Beautiful hiking trails surrounding and beyond. I feel like there is endless options for foods in both directions, Asheville + Marion. 10 out of 10 recommend, we will be back! Can’t thank our hosts enough for a little anniversary trip without the kids 🖤"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the weekend get away you’re picturing. Tucked away, relaxing, and as the kids say, “a total vibe”. I felt transported to a different life where everything is laid back, slowed down, and close to nature.
The guidebook was amazing and we were upset we didn’t have time to try more places.
As someone who winds down with a nice hot shower, I did not want to leave the amazing hot water and eucalyptus scent.
I was blown away at the design, the feeling and the energy this place gives. Book it now !! We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place right in the middle of everything!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this Airbnb! It was the perfect location, was very well equipped for four people and convenient to parking. There is even a cute little coffee shop below it! Would definitely rent here again."

Andrew and Ashlie's place is well stocked, clean, and cozy! I would absolutely stay here again :)"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and wonderful space. Only negative is this unit is just off of street level so the street noise is something to be aware of. Didn’t bother us much because we are used to it in bigger cities. All in all it is a great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a prefect location. Easy parking with the two garages across the street. Everything within walking distance. Super quiet inside the building. I would stay here again!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Seriously can't find a better location...everything was less than a 5 minute walk away. The loft was perfect and had everything you could possibly need. Highly recommend the Ashville Pinball Museum - it's right around the corner and an unexpected find - all kinds of fun after a great meat at Zambra!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Andrew and Ashlie’s place. Centrally located so you can walk everywhere.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Ashlie's place was exactly as described! a perfect place for 2 couples on a weekend get away. the 2 full bathrooms were great and the apartment was beautifully decorated. location was perfect for walking around town and parking was very easy just across the street.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking to be on the go and in the heart of the city this is the place for you. The apartment is immaculate and you are close to everything. It was interesting that neither room had walls that went to the ceiling but there is a white noice machine on the wall which is a nice touch. All in all I would 100% stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're planning a weekend trip to Asheville this is the space for you. Located in the heart of downtown Asheville.

Thank you Andrew and Ashley you made our first time in Asheville wonderful!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome property, perfect location and excellent hosts! Andrew and Ashlie were great. Definitely recommend for a visit to Asheville."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Walking distance to everything our little hearts desired. Nearby chargers easy to access for the EV. Can’t say enough about how lovely our stay was. Super comfortable beds and noise machine, all the cooking implements we needed. A great home base for exploring the city. We found secret bars, thrift shops, a dessert cocktail bar and fun metaphysical shops. PS the shampoo and body wash and hand washes all smelled great. 100% would recommend."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the loft, especially the bathtub and the patio! Location for walking around Asheville—shopping, coffee, restaurants, breweries, etc.—cannot be beat (a bit of lively urban noise is the expected trade off). Also very clean and comfortable.
Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The loft is an ideal spot for a family with young kids visiting Asheville. From the coffeeshop just steps away to the various amenities for littles, we extremely enjoyed how intentional and welcoming the whole space was.
They are ideally located right in Downtown, within walking distance of everything you may need."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very cool loft!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest apartment in downtown Asheville. I would say this is perfect for a family! It is a loft so know that the bedrooms are “open” so if it two couples and privacy is a priority, this might not be the best spot. We were a group of friends traveling and it was perfect. The sound machine was a great feature and the space was huge and perfectly located. Thanks so much!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great downtown loft in Asheville. Everything is walkable from here. The place is nice, clean, and in the heart of all the action. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at this lovely loft. Parking across the street in a garage at 20 dollars/day. Coffee shop right next door! Would definitely come back again

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great base camp for a trip to Asheville. Right in the heart of Asheville but strangely enough felt very private and secluded. Easy to find and check into the place. Absolutely awesome home too: high end everything. Enjoyed the patio overlooking the city and early morning joggers below while I had my coffee and questioned my decisions from the night before. Andrew and Ashlie were great and I’d definitely look to book this place for future visits.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Right in the heart of Asheville! Walked to so many places. I would stay here again!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location was fabulous and the space was just as described
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, excellent location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to town to hang out with family and stayed here! Best rental I have every stayed. Spotless clean top to bottom, simple decoration and everything you need! We loved the balcony for people watching at night. Lots of games to play. Walking distance to any kind of food or drinks you could need. Parking is $20/day in the garage across the street. We appreciated the amount of bathroom supplies and linens. They even offered a water dispenser on the counter that we loved, the water was so tasty!! It has a great setup other than the lowered walls that we used the sound machine to cover up any noises there may have been. Overall, a wonderful place right in the middle of everything with easy access and very safe! We would come back to stay here when in Asheville again. Thank you!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in the heart of the action!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place, amenities were amazing. Great selection of toys for small children - this was a plus. We had a great stay, and the location is within walking distance of many attractions. 5 stars!"

Beautiful design.

Thank you A & A."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chic, ultra clean and comfortable"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here! Would definitely stay here again! Andrew and Ashlie were super responsive regarding any questions.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The only thing is the door code did not work. But I sent Andrew a message and he responded within seconds of a new door code to get in
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean and well appointed. Parking across the street was so convenient. The coffee shop next door and deli around the corner were both great. The beds were very comfortable, and the master bathroom was huge. We loved the open air balcony for morning coffee and evening wine. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we were looking for and what we expected!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Like many, this is our second stay at the loft and we can't wait to return again. It's what all reviewers say and more. Super clean, you cannot beat the location, it's well furnished/decorated, and an ideal place for families or two couples. The hosts are super responsive! One of our favorite Air BnB's!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous experience! The apartment was clean, comfortable and conveniently located. You could walk in any direction to a variety of shops and restaurants. The coffee shop next door was an added bonus and if you don't try the burgers at the bar on the corner you'll be missing out. The white noise machine worked great but to be honest we didn't really need it. The parking garage across the street was really hard to navigate with a mid size SUV. The garage one block over was much more accommodating for larger vehicles and cost the same. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and awesome location. Had a great time. This place was well worth the price!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For sure the best AirBnB experience we've ever had - beautiful, beautiful space in exactly the right location. Thanks so much to our hosts for working with us on an early check in so we could make the show at Rabbit Rabbit with time to spare!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was one of the best bnbs I’ve stayed at! They had everything we needed and more. The high chair and baby toys were so helpful for our 10 month old. The coffee shop next door is amazing too!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to this loft and we loved it as much this time as the first time. Very comfortable, centrally located, easy parking. We did not use the white sound feature as we thought it delightful without. The hosts are quick to respond and always helpful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Easy to walk to shops, and restaurants. The cleanliness and comfort of the place was outstanding. The parking garage was right across the street. Parking cost $20 per day which we weren’t aware."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew & Ashlie's condo was super! Great location, comfortable beds, and very clean. They were very quick to respond to our questions and the collection of maps and brochures in the condo was extremely helpful. If we return, we will definitely look into returning to this condo!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying here. That should explain enough. We feel right at home. We love the walkability and location in Asheville. Ashley and Andrew are super helpful host and provide more than enough resources. We had a couple rainy days while visiting this time. The kids were able to stay occupied in their home with all the games and activities they share with their guests. Thank you and can’t wait until the next time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really beautiful loft right in the heart of Asheville. Very private while being within walking distance of all the good stuff. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this loft was perfect for a long weekend with my long time pals. we had ample space for everyone and we felt at home. i would love to stay again.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t want to be a broken record on this review. Would like to try and provide some additional insights.
* extremely clean - practically meticulous
* a great layout for the loft
* the living / dining area is a little smaller than the photos
* the brick patio / balcony is a little bigger than the photos
* 2-4 adults is a perfect fit; or 2 adults with 2-4 kids
* they have some nice extras for little - little kids
* terrific location - everything we walked to was a 3 to 5 to ten minute walk
* owners are super / Uber responsive and patient- trust me. I ask A LOT of questions
* parking - bad news you pay; good news about 30 - 90 feet from the front door
* location - Rankin Social Club - great burgers, Bahmi, cocktails, about a 45 second stroll. High Five coffee - just okay - but the Lox sandwich on an everything bagel - rock star! A 30 second walk.
* Sage coffee - yes! Great breakfast sandwiches and coffee - 3 minute walk
* so many shops within a 1, 3, 5, 10 minute walk…."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent room/location. Had to contact host when our code didn't work, but other than that was great."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location!! You are in the center of restaurants and shopping. Coffee shop right outside entrance. Beautiful condo with exposed brick; outdoor patio and furnished with everything you need. And; if you’re worried about privacy with the bedrooms being open above, don’t give it a second thought! They have a wonderful integrated white noise system. We didn’t want to leave. Amazing place!! They also texted us that the condo was available if we wanted to check in early. Thanks so much Andrew and Ashlie."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family really enjoyed our stay! Everything was very walkable, the neighborhood felt safe, and the loft was incredible. We loved how well-stocked the kitchen and bathroom were. The smaller bedroom was perfect for our 6yo - she had her own space that was just her size, and my husband and I had a private guest suite. The beds were comfy with quality linens, and everything was clean. Overall, everything just felt very high-end. Unfortunately, it was too cold to enjoy the balcony, but it would have been amazing with warmer weather. There was definitely a lot of street noise, so beware if you're a light sleeper. :) Overall, the place was amazing and we would highly recommend staying here if visiting Asheville and you want something centrally-located and walkable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We fell in love with this loft! Beautiful accommodations and the location is perfect! We will be back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will be back!!! We had a great time hanging out in this spacious, beautiful space!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew and Ashlie were excellent hosts! They were responsive and understanding when we requested to check in early due to frozen pipes in our home. Their loft is extremely well located for enjoying downtown Asheville. It was clean and well equipped. We will definitely look to stay with them again when we visit family in Asheville.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was absolutely perfect! Huge perk was the parking deck right across the street even though the car wasn’t needed until we checked out! I didn’t know how I would feel about the open ceiling concept but the built in sound machines helped to cover our snoring friends. Plus plus plus. My favorite part about the place is being able to drink my coffee (that I got from the coffee shop next door!) on our private balcony. 10/10 would recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,the location and space were amazing! hosts were very responsive and accommodating as well. would definitely stay here again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was beautiful, clean, and is in a killer location. We walked everywhere! Andrew and Ashlie were great hosts and you’ll have everything you need if you stay here. Pro tip since this stay is in town: we always travel with disposable earplugs, so I’d recommend it if you’re a light sleeper. There is a white noise machine though if you need it. We had an awesome time and would definitely stay there again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You could not ask for a better location if you want to spend the majority of your time walking around in town. The accommodations were fantastic and Ashlie was super prompt to respond to the messages I sent during our stay. Unfortunately, our visit took place when the weather had a 20 degree drop, so we weren’t able to lounge on the balcony, which was a bummer - but that outdoor space would be sooooo amazing in warmer weather!! The integrated white noise was phenomenal and I will definitely miss it, for sure!! 10/10 stay and would feel very fortunate to enjoy another stay at this loft."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew & Ashlie's condo was the perfect place for us to stay for a girls' weekend in Asheville! The location was so central and convenient to all the shops and restaurants. The beds were comfy and the main area was great to sit and chat. I will note that there was sometimes noise from outside on the weekend, but the built-in white noise meant that it didn't keep us awake. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic few days in Asheville. Ashlie and Andrew’s place is in a super convenient location within walking distance to great restaurants and many activities. The space is well appointed with many amenities, comfortably furnished and CLEAN! We would enjoy staying here again while in Asheville."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for the wonderful accommodations! Location was perfect, the unit was described perfectly and Andrew and Ashlie were quick to respond to the couple of quick questions that we had."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming loft in a convenient location. In spite of being in the center of everything, it was surprisingly quiet. I especially enjoyed relaxing on the balcony and the soaking tub."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well appointed, clean, convenient and in a good location. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew & Ashlie’s loft was perfect for a girls weekend getaway. The loft was thoughtfully decorated and was equipped with everything you might need. The location was great- close to shops and restaurants. Loft was clean, access was easy and hosts were responsive to our questions. This is a loft and the bedrooms had walls but they did not go all the way up so there was not complete privacy as you could hear conversations etc- this was not an issue for us but might be for families or couples traveling together. A white noise machine is provided and was helpful in blocking out background noise.
Super cute would totally recommend and look forward to visiting again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, perfect location and the owners were super communicative and helpful. I can't say enough positive things about our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have asked for a better spot for our trip! All of the breweries were within walking distance and we were centrally located downtown. The coffee shop next door is a must! Parking right across the street. The place is even better than the pictures

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this property! It was perfectly located in downtown Asheville. The apartment was beautiful and in a historic building. Even though it is a loft, we couldn’t hear our friends in the other room at all with the sound machines. We had a wonderful stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This loft was such a great spot for our family’s trip to Asheville. It’s an amazing location, right in the middle of downtown. We barely used our car! After our kids bedtime we loved the patio overlooking the street. There are so many thoughtful touches including a pack n play, kids toys and games, sound machines, and very stocked bathrooms and kitchen. We will definitely keep one on our list next time we visit!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I wrote a great review but sent it to the owners. In short, what it said is you'd be CRAZY not to rent this condo if you have a small group that needs a centralized point from which they can easily coordinate come and go schedules and keep everybody engaged in their Asheville experience."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time staying here. It is in a great spot within walking distance to so many restaurants and breweries. The condo was very comfortable and had nice decorations. I will definitely stay here again if I am back in Asheville.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and condo! We were able to walk everywhere, the condo had everything we needed and by far the easiest parking accommodations I’ve had since visiting Asheville (across the street!). Definitely would recommend to others and stay here again!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this Airbnb! The loft has such a cool & unique layout - very spacious and wonderfully decorated! It is so convenient to everything in downtown Ashville that we never used our car for the 3 days we stayed there! The white noise system was perfect for sleeping. The open, covered balcony was fun to sit with a cup of coffee or evening cocktails while overlooking the street below. Truly a one of a kind, wonderful Airbnb!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location can’t be beat! Cool loft made for a great weekend getaway.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, What a lovely stay! The entire loft was beautiful and immaculately clean and tidy. Everything you’d need to make a few meals in, if you’re not feeling like eating out. The location could not be more perfect for wandering around downtown. Restaurants and shopping literally right outside your door. Parking was directly across from the loft and there is a coffee shop right next door. It was well worth the money!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location in downtown Asheville is unbeatable. The coffee shop downstairs makes truly delicious high quality coffees and teas. Everyone in Asheville is very friendly. The loft is very pretty and clean. The living space is bright and airy. We like the spaciousness and the high end finishes in the bathrooms. The white noise machine is helpful and you get a really good night sleep because there are no windows in the bedrooms. We hope to return soon.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and location within Asheville!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There's nothing I could say here that hasn't already been said many times over. The loft is beautifully designed, perfectly located, and there really couldn't be any better way to experience Asheville. Definitely my single best Airbnb experience!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Superior experience, great location! The loft is as depicted, truly fantastic. Spacious, with exceptional quality. Very private. There is some outside noise, especially on weekends. We didn’t use the white sound machine because we didn’t mind the noise. And truly, if you choose to stay downtown ANY place will have noise. Parking was easy and close by."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fabulous location and loft.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and very easy to access the loft. Everything was as advertised, clean and an awesome space."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well furnished & comfortable place. Great location and walkable to everything you want to do in Asheville. It is a loft so you obviously need to keep in mind the layout/design implications in mind before tou book. The layout & pictures are true to the unit. Parking was across the street and free when we were there so no hassle at all.
Would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Close to everything!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a perfect location for our long weekend in Asheville! We walked to several excellent restaurants and loved some of shopping options nearby. The loft was impeccably clean and very comfortable. Check-in and parking were simple and convenient. Ashley was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Would gladly stay again and highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location in the central downtown area! We walked a lot around downtown and took day trips to Chimney Rock State Park, the Biltmore and a No Taste Like Home foraging trip. Parking was free at the garage across the street while we were there except when there was a concert on Saturday evening nearby. Coffee place right next door. The loft was extremely clean and comfortable and also a fun and interesting! The only downside to this place is the open ceiling allows sound and light to travel easily inside. It was plenty dark inside for sleeping and the built in white noise machine was definitely nice for sleeping. However, because of that open ceiling everyone had to be lights out and quiet at the same time. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone, unless traveling with housemates that are loud and like to go to bed at different times."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great accommodations and great hosts! Super clean with all the amenities needed to enjoy a stay in Asheville. Chic building and unit, fun to sit outside on the balcony and watch some of the downtown action. Close to many great restaurants and shopping."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate Loft! Awesome setting with great privacy! Entry first floor but main living area second story above street with an open patio overlooking Lexington with People Watch and beverages during down pours. The loft exceeded expectations! High end linens and accessories. Quality bedding and awesome sleep. Parking across street easily accessible. We walked everywhere from Brew district to amazing around corner Restaurants ,Lobster Trap, Salsas, Packs and Wicked Weed was Wicked!!!! Marriott Sky Bar beautiful sunsets walking distance two minute walk .
Easy access to Blue Ridge .... a must Mt Mitchell Overlook! Happy 35 th we will book again . Great communication with SuperHost ."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the loft. Felt like home from the first minute. So convenient to everything. And, Andrew & Ashly were very responsive to questions ab out Asheville. Use them a a resource for where to go and what to do. You will not be disappointed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Loft was great! We traveled with another couple and the place was very spacious. Since it is a loft, it was very open, but the built in sound machine overnight blocked any noises between rooms and made for peaceful sleeping. The location was perfect as we could walk anywhere we needed within a few blocks. The bed was comfortable and the upgraded bathrooms with complimentary Shampoo/ Conditioner and body wash was very nice! We would definitely stay again!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super stylish loft in an amazing location right in the middle of downtown. You are in the middle of everything. The sound machine was a nice touch since all of the ceilings are open with the exception of the bathrooms. We really enjoyed our stay!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Ashlie's home is on a nice side street but in the center of downtown. We loved staying here and the convenience of walking everywhere. Their home is so beautiful and easy to access. Parking is directly across the road, shopping, resturants, etc.
We loved it! I will be planning a trip back soon hopefully!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I had more to say about this place and Asheville, but we went during Covid and did not get to experience it the way we would’ve liked. The place is great – very clean, perfect location and the hosts were very responsive and helpful when it came to recommendations. Would return."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at this gorgeous loft! The hosts are very accommodating and have made contactless check-in super easy. You could not ask for a better location in Asheville. We parked the car and never needed to use it again, as you're in the heart of downtown. We did most of our cooking at home this visit and were very pleased that the kitchen is well-appointed with actual cooking in mind, rather than the somewhat minimal utensils etc. that we sometimes find. Looking forward to our next visit!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, we thoroughly enjoyed the loft experience and will definitely return!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! Super cute, trendy, and modern. Great location in the middle of the downtown. Walking distance to all the great restaurants, shops, and breweries. Also only a short drive to Bent Creek area with trails for hiking and mountain biking. The air bnb was exceptionally clean and has a cute patio overlooking downtown. I would highly recommend this to others, and I will definitely stay here again when I visit Asheville next!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great location, stylish condo & all the necessities of home! We had a great time on our family vacation and encourage all who are considering staying at Andrew & Ashlie’s place to go so...you won’t regret it!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sparkling clean place, well decorated. The best location for touring Asheville and not having to drive. Easy access to the unit and my wife said having ""High Five"" coffee right next door was a plus. Enjoy the view from the balcony and watching down on the city. You will not be disappointed."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place justice. Welcoming and well-designed, Andrew and Ashlie's place is incredibly spacious for a downtown dwelling. Street noise wasn't an issue, and the balcony was an added bonus. It was immaculate, and the beds were super comfy. Highly recommended!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific place! Even better location and even better unit that I imagined. It is a very spacious place for a downtown location. The balcony is very cool. Great kitchen. Awesome master bath. Comfortable beds. Everything you might need is there. Andrew and Ashlie are very gracious and responsive hosts. We would visit again.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic apartment! Very clean, bright and has plenty of storage space. Beds and linens are very comfortable and the apartment is super spacious. Kitchen is well stocked for preparing meals and bathrooms are stocked with plenty of toiletries. Really enjoyed the balcony and the location can’t be beat, with easy ground floor access. Check in and check out were a breeze. Great hosts with lots of local tips and info. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at this beautiful loft twice now, and continue to think it is the best in all ways! Perfect location downtown, so walkable to everything. Somehow it is still very quiet and peaceful! The place has been perfectly clean both times and Andrew and Ashlie are very quick to respond with any needs that come up. Bonus, the High Five coffee right outside is the BEST. We will definitely be back!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Great location. We’ll be back.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Could not be a better location for exploring Asheville. Centrally located, yet a quiet condo building, with a nice, sheltered outside space. Close to everything, impeccably appointed and decorated, with great kitchen amenities -- we cooked-in and ordered-in a lot, during these COVID times. Sparkling clean and sanitized. Easy garage parking across the street, and generally easy unloading/loading at front of building.
Ashlie and Andrew were great communicators. Especially appreciated Andrew's insight that on-street parking after 6PM was free, which we took advantage of.
The open loft floor plan, where the walls do not go to the ceiling -- as forthrightly highlighted in the Air BNB description -- did not present any issues for us, but are worth considering for a larger group.
We would definitely stay with Ashlie and Andrew again. Having used Air BNB a lot, we consider them model hosts."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Andrew and Ashlie,
Thank you so much for the most amazing stay! It couldn’t have been a better or more comfortable stay and trip! We absolutely love your place and wish we were there longer!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly clean, amazing location, super easy check-in and out. Great bathrooms and kitchen. Cards Against Humanity (and other games to play) earns instant points. Open ceilings over both bedrooms, noise carries a little bit, just be aware extracuricular activities will be limited if sharing the space with others. Amazingly great place in a spectacular location, walking to everything! Fast internet, good hot water pressure, great smelling body wash. Wins all around."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Great location can walk to all shops and restaurants, so much to chose from. The lofts is just beautiful great space, large, beautifully decorated and so clean. Wonder touches, well appointed kitchen and great balcony. It was perfect. There is not one bad thing about it."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED the loft!! Was so comfortable and we ended up spending a lot of time indoors in between meals and breweries. Played cards and enjoyed the quiet time. Can't wait to stay again ! Thanks so much for everything.

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such amazing hosts and location! We walked to everything...only got in our car once to go for a beautiful hike at Rattlesnake Lodge.
This spot was perfect to stay and enjoy the downtown vibe of Asheville. Place was spotless and so well stocked with personal touches. Really appreciated the bagels, fresh coffee, creamer, etc.
We loved the unique loft layout. Extremely comfy for two couples. Easy access in and out of building and added bonus having a parking garage directly across the street. We will definitely recommend and return. Thanks for everything!!"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is impeccably decorated and was extremely comfortable for our family of 4. The loft was spotless and extremely comfortable. Location is central to great restaurants and shops, allowing you to walk most places within the city. It's a short drive to the arts district and Biltmore Village, and we drove 40 minutes west to the Cataloochee ski area one day. It's a perfect place to stay for a relaxed getaway to Asheville."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft has it all-location, amenities, and style. You really are close to everything-the Biltmore is even just a short drive. Despite not having parking provided, parking is not an issue (right across the street and reasonable). The space is great for teens and families needing space. The built in sound machines were life savers from hubby's snoring. : ) We would definitely stay there again."
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"We highly recommend this wonderful, spacious loft. It is so clean and beautifully decorated. The furniture is very comfortable. So convenient to all of downtown Asheville and parking. It made our trip glorious! Thanks for a fabulous rental!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to spend a long weekend in Asheville! The hosts were quick to respond and had some great suggestions for restaurants within walking distance. Extremely comfortable loft with everything you could need in the kitchen. Even though it was a cold weekend in December I still had to spend time on the covered patio as it has such a nice view. The check-in was very easy and the building was secure. A parking deck across the street was an added convenience. The surrounding neighborhood was fun and funky and we had a great time exploring the local art galleries, restaurants, breweries, and shops with locally-made crafts. We didn't need our car once while visiting! I highly recommend this lovely space if you want to get a taste of downtown Asheville."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you it exceeded our expectations. Will definitely be back. Your personal touches made it more enjoyable!

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Besides being so centrally and perfectly located in beautiful Asheville, the quality of the decor and furnishings far exceeded our expectations. The Hosts attention to detail is outstanding...coffee, bagels, free-range eggs, water station, discount card, etc. There’s even a white noise volume control in the master bedroom. Lastly...the covered balcony is spectacular and we spent lots of time people watching from there. Water pressure, bedding, pillows, are all outstanding. I know it’s cliché but I “highly recommend” and if they ever sell it...I want it. 👍🏻"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was absolutely the perfect private spot for our anniversary get away. The hot tub and fire pit was ahhmazing! Close to downtown & everything was as described & better. Such a cute place! We look forward to coming back.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had the most amazing time here with my husband. The view, the hot tub and the most cozy little chic cabin/treehouse nestled in the mountains. We were so pleased with the entire experience. Thank you so much!!"

The Stillhouse treehouse will always have a special place in our hearts! Thank you Audra and Summer for everything!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,our stay in this treehouse was amazing! the views were stunning and slightly different everyday with the different weather. there was just enough room for me my husband our 2 kids and our dog.. very comfortable. there were lots of sleep options and towels provided which was very appreciated! we tried to find the on-site waterfall on our own and failed and then read the detailed instructions and we're able to find it.. it was pretty and a moderate hike that we were able to still do in flip flops and crocs. the animals were fun to feed.. the kids really enjoyed that. my husband and I really loved the grate on the fire pit..we cooked most of our meals on that despite the very well equipped kitchen. the hot tub gave us some trouble the first night but the hosts were very responsive and were able to walk us through it. the hosts also provided info on surrounding activities which was nice. we really enjoyed our stay!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was wonderful. We loved the beautiful views on the deck, especially while in the jacuzzi. A short drive to Asheville and still feels remote and serene. My gf loved feeding the goats, pigs, mini horse and the donkey. We already want to come back"

We loved hiking up to the waterfall on the property, soaking in the hot tub, and visiting the farm animals at the end of the road. Plenty of hikes in the area as well. We definitely would love to return in the summer to see what else Marion has to offer!"

The cabin was adorable and romantic, and very secluded. We loved it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time celebrating my husband‘s birthday at High Haven. The cabin is the perfect place to relax and unwind. We especially love the hot tub and the view. You feel like you can really connect with nature and it’s very secluded. Make sure to walk to the pavilion and take the white trailhead to the waterfall. From the cabin to the waterfalls is about a 1.1 mile walk. We were a little nervous getting up to the cabin because the gravel driveway is a little steep. But my 2WD Hyundai Kona did it just fine! We were very impressed by how clean the cabin was. We hope to be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved going to the treehouse! Can’t wait to go again! 10/10 recommend.

We can’t wait to come back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely come back the place is so peaceful not a sound of the outside world, perfect for couples!!!"

Definitely will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Audra and Summer were very responsive. There was a small issue with AirBnB directly, no fault of Audra and Summer, but they were quick to get it fixed and very responsive answering additional questions! The gate on the porch was a game changer for dogs- they even left treats and a dog bowl! All around amazing hosts and an amazing rental! You will not be disappointed :)"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This listing was absolutely perfect for me, my fiancé, and our dog-ter. We arrived with a two wheel drive small SUV (Corolla Cross) and had absolutely no issues navigating the path to the cabin. Upon our arrival, the host had a cute custom welcome sign that was a nice touch. The rope bridge was super awesome and a dream come true for my inner child. Extremely cozy interior that is perfect for curling up and reading a good book. There is under bed storage drawers for belongings. The deck is large with exceptional views. The hot tub worked flawlessly. Underneath the deck, there is a hammock and ring toss hook game.
The fire-pit area was perfect for us with two chairs and a grill that can be swung over pit for cooking. The ability to purchase firewood from host was very convenient. From the cabin, there are some really cool hiking trails that are perfect for allowing the pet to burn off some energy and explore. This place is a perfect getaway for a couple!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay. It's a perfect weekend getaway in the mountains. We loved feeding the farm animals, walking to the waterfall, and making s'mores. It's not far from Asheville and other cities in between if you're looking for restaurant options. HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an incredible find up in the mountains. You forget the rest of the world exists. The view from your bed first thing when you wake up, makes you not want to close your eyes and go back to sleep! Dog friendly was the selling point for us and our dog loved the property and the hikes.
“Peggy Jean” said goodbye to us as we checked out and left the property. We will absolutely be back and will send friends and family to this amazing spot!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin. It was so cute and private. I wish it wasn’t rainy and foggy all weekend so we could see the view better, but it was still pretty with the fog. The hot tub was great. It was just enough space for the two of us! I ended up getting proposed there over the weekend, so we will definitely be returning for anniversaries!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We cannot say enough good things about our stay here- we loved the trails connected to the airbnb, the gorgeous view, hot tub and space! We loved seeing the animals on the property.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oh my god you need to stay here! Audra and summer have mastered their craft of hosting. They did a wonderful job turning high haven into a beautiful honey moon spot for my husband and I! 100% recommend! Would love to stay again soon.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t of loved this place more! Exactly what we needed for little getaway. Cozy and beautiful views with the amenities you need to do so. Hosts were very tentative and nice! We will definitely be back with our pups!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend staying at High Haven. The treehouse was beautiful and the views where breathtaking. Gorgeous property to hike and explore and loved the friendly donkey, mini horses, and goats. The host went above and beyond to make sure my fiancé had the best birthday ever.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place perfect for couples or friends to spend time in the woods. Make sure you have 4x4 car if you plan to park close to the house. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay and so did our pups they had area to roam around. Cute detail they left us supplies to make smores. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time here and are so glad that Audra and Summer shared their peace of heaven with us! This stay was a breath of fresh air in every sense. The serene surroundings and immaculate accommodations made for a perfect getaway. From the private magnificent views during the day to watching shooting stars and seeing the Milky Way at night, the High Haven Treehouse did not disappoint! Loved visiting with the rescue animals and seeing their fun personalities! We had a small hiccup with the hot tub functioning the first night, due to no fault of their own. When we notified them, they quickly responded and came to the treehouse to solve the issue (and on a Sunday night)! The recommendations for local spots kept us entertained in Marion and Old Fort. Highly recommended for those seeking a peaceful retreat! We are already planning our next visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,SUCH an amazing stay for a quaint and quiet getaway!! We will be back next year for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful! I definitely recommend staying here. It was a perfect and private cabin for our honeymoon! They view is beautiful. We highly recommend getting in the hot tub at sunrise and sunset! We really want to come back when we can!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"As I mentioned in the guest book, you can tell a lot of time, money and thought went into the High Haven cabin. From the detail of the cabin to the little touches that make it feel like home. What a view it has also. Especially not even having to get out of bed to see the view. One of the best places we have stayed at for my husband and I. Will 100% be back again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved every minute of the stay. Time went by way too fast. The views were absolutely stunning. Starting the morning with coffee and views and ending the day with a nice fire, and unbeatable views in the hut tub. Private, lots of beautiful trails that do not require you to drive anywhere oh and the cutest entertaining goats and donkey! It was amazing! Definitely will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Super communicative hosts who were readily available for questions and proactively sent information that might be needed.
Beautiful space that is accurate to the photos
Thoughtful touches upon arrival
GORGEOUS views
Clean, private, well provisioned cabin.
Fabulous stargazing at night
Cool fire pit space
Clean hot tub was a great bonus!
Not far from Asheville, Black Mountain, and lots of things to do and see.
To know:
As described, the drive up the mountain on the gravel path can be done by a 2WD vehicle. The first ascent was nerve wracking but the hosts gave us the tip to go a bit faster and just keep going and it was fine. We made it all the way to the cabin, rather than the 2WD pull off and went up and down the mountain several times with no issue. But if you’re not used to that kind of driving, it can be scary at first.
Overall an amazing trip and we would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a magical place to stay! From the GREAT views to the relaxing fire at the end of the day, I can’t say enough great things! We will for sure be back!"

My wife and I enjoyed sitting on the patio overlooking the mountains, watching the sunset and sunrise while drinking our coffee. The hot tub at night overlooking the stars was very relaxing and a great way to unwind. There are lots of great restaurants in driving distance and beautiful waterfalls. We highly recommend you come visit High Haven in Marion NC. You will not be disappointed. 5+ STARS! P.S. don’t forget to check out the farm animals on your way in and out of the cabin!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was truly what we needed to relax the stresses of wedding planning away. Our honeymoon here was magical.
There is a waterful to walk to from the cabin, you wake up to mountain views, a hot tub steps away, and a fire pit to use at night. The animals at the entrance were so cute and friendly, that we could not resist stopping (almost) each time we drove by to give them treats in the little cupboard by them. There are plenty of things to do around, we visited little Switzerland a short drive away. The inn had awesome food and VIEWS, felt like you were in Europe. We also stopped at the Altpass Apple Orchard very close and had homemade apple pie. We also visited Mt. Mitchell and Black Mountain. We recommend Eddies Pizza & Pasta (homemade bread an marina are great) in Marion, Black Mountain Bistro in Black Mountain, and the Inn at Little Switzerland for awesome food. 10/10 will return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved that this cabin felt secluded, private and surrounded by nature with amazing Mountain View’s. Close enough of a drive for us to explore Asheville and hiking. Super clean, cute and we would definitely recommend staying hear for a peaceful getaway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had the best time staying at Audra & Summer's. Everything looked just like the photos. It was stunningly beautiful! So many little touches that took the experience above and beyond - things you didn't even think you would want or need that made the experience even more special. I can't recommend this place enough. Absolutely wonderful and beautiful. My dogs loved it as well! Audra and Summer were very helpful and communicative as well. I hope I can come back someday.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at this cute little cabin for a quick weekend getaway! The views were incredible and the place was very clean. We had no trouble getting up to the cabin in our 4WD RAV4. The two cabins are close by, but you cannot hear or see your neighbors, which was really nice! The bed was extremely comfortable. Loved staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! If you’re hesitant to book, don’t be! We drive a large ford transit camper van which isn’t 4wd and I was worried about getting up to the cabin but we were able to just fine. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, spending time on the deck with the gorgeous views and even hiking to the on property waterfall! Oh, and visiting with the most friendly goats, donkey and mini horse on our way out! We didn’t want to leave. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"10/10 would stay here again. The hosts have built a small but very well designed spot on the side of a mountain that's perfect for a couple's getaway. Amazing cleared out view of nearby mountains from your private hottub or firepit. Clean and tidy room. Hot water, fridge, and stove as well as all the basics of a kitchen that you'd expect. The hosts provided some great personal touches including treats and a towel for our dog. The hill up to the house is pretty steep but it seems to drain well and was handled easily by our AWD highlander. Hope to be back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay. peaceful
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very nice, quiet, clean accommodation with a very nice view,
For us it was an unforgettable trip, highly recommended
🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🤩"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great weekend get-away with a great view and super privet! Close to local towns, great hiking trails, and Asheville. Will definitely be back?"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cabin with beautiful views and awesome amenities. Great for a weekend getaway or a longer stay! 10/10 I would definitely recommend
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The cabin was beautiful and the bed/bedding was super comfortable. The location is very peaceful and relaxing. It was the perfect place to get away from it all for a few days and the hosts were great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing stay! Audra and Summer were great hosts. The pictures don’t do the place justice, you really just need to see it go yourself. I saw some comments saying they had some issues getting to the cabin in a 2WD car. I have a 2WD car and had no issues. It was also great petting the farm animals on the way in and out everyday. Very peaceful, couldn’t have asked for s better way for my girlfriend and I to spend our 3 year anniversary!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The treehouse is just like the photos - super clean with a nice view and very private. The unit is well appointed, the furniture is really comfy, the hot tub is great and the smores for the firepit are a really nice touch! The hosts are very helpful and communicative. The only downside is the drive up - I checked the reviews and saw conflicting opinions about whether or not 4WD is necessary. After checking in with the host, we opted to give it a shot in our 2WD car - ended up getting stuck on the last climb, just before the 2WD pull off, and had to get towed up by the hosts. I think it's more about what kind of tires you have, and mine didn't cut it. Something to consider!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paradise. This quaint tree house was the perfect getaway. We enjoyed watching the stars in the hot tub, making smores by a campfire, hiking, and relaxing. The house is beautifully furnished and impeccably clean. We loved feeding the animals by the gate and relaxing in nature. I highly recommend enjoying this beautiful retreat to everyone wanting to unwind and recharge."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"High Haven Treehouse was every bit like the photos and description in the listing!
We came here to celebrate our 30th birthdays and our have our last trip as a family of 3 before Baby #2 comes.
The drive up is super doable in a 2-wheel-drive car all the way up to the provided 2wd pull-off point. For us, we were also fine getting beyond that to the treehouse parking.
The treehouse was squeaky clean and stood out because they allow dogs - but not a single allergic reaction was had by those of us in our family allergic to dogs! Not a hair or crumb or streak in sight: perfectly clean.
Beautiful decor, treehouse construction was gorgeous, and welcome goodies were an awesome touch. Clear instructions too!
There was ample space for a pack-n-play to be set up if your little one is too small for the the trundle bed provided. Toddler approved!
We all loved the sweet animals, swinging bridge, hammock, fire, hot tub, and hike to the little waterfall! Book this treehouse!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is exactly like the pictures and makes for an ideal weekend getaway! It’s so beautiful and cozy and comfortable and private. Just the best stay with the best view! We’ll be back :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect small getaway in the mountains! It was clean, quiet, relaxing, and overall very fun"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at this treehouse. It is truly just like the pictures, loved waking up every morning to the mountains. Everything was very clean, loved the hot tub and hammock. We were in need of a place to just unwind and relax and this was the perfect place. So very quit. Treehouse has everything you need, they do a great job of including so many amenities in this Tiny House. Clear instructions included. Truly a great stay for the two of us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,this was the most AMAZING getaway for my birthday. everything was absolutely perfect from hot tub stargazing to the comfiest bed ever to the most beautiful views ever!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancé and I do experiences instead of presents for our birthdays so this year for my 27th we chose this beautiful little getaway with our 100 pound puppy and we all had an absolute wonderful, peaceful, and all around great time while here! Hope to be back for another birthday experience!🥳"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a rental cabin owner in Gatlinburg, We were so impressed by the high quality construction and every detail has been thought out to make your stay flawless!!!
Should have more than a 5 star rating."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunningly beautiful place! Secluded but the town is still easily accessible, this adorable tiny cabin is absolutely perfect for a couple. We loved every minute of it and will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful getaway! We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was an amazing property.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway for the night! The farm animals greeting you as you drive up, the hot tub overlooking the mountains, the firepit with the twinkle lights- everything made for a great experience for a little romantic getaway for my boyfriends birthday. I've already shared the link to multiple friends and family members!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house and property are beautiful. However, I highly recommend having a 4 wheel drive vehicle if you are interested in booking. Note that the 2 wheel drive pull off is only after a lot of steep gravel driving. Although our 2wd SUV has relatively new all terrain tires and we've taken it many similar places, it did not handle the incline/gravel combination prior to the pull off very well. Unfortunately, we did not feel comfortable trying to make the drive up a second time and cancelled our second night. However, Audra and Summer were very understanding and graciously refunded us for the second night. The house and property are beautiful and I highly recommend it if you have a vehicle capable of the ascent. The view from the porch is hard to beat on a starry night."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! This is a very special Airbnb. It is so unique, with the swinging rope bridge, the beautiful deck overlooking the mountains, a waterfall nearby, and cute animals! I am so thankful that the treehouse is dog friendly, because my dog had a blast! I loved how the home was located in a convenient area close to many restaurants and nature experiences. I would love to go back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic views from a great place. Secluded and quiet, perfect for those looking to unplug for a bit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first trip away from home as a young family. My wife and I had a wonderful time relaxing in this beautiful treehouse cabin with absolutely breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge mountains. We didn’t hike to the nearby waterfall, but we did feed the goats and donkey and our 3-month old son got a kick out of it. Coffee and a hot tub on the deck is the cherry on top. And the hosts were super responsive with the few questions we had. Highly recommend and we will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is perfect for a romantic and relaxing getaway! The cabin is equipped with exactly what you need to just relax and enjoy the space. The hot tub is excellent, the bed is comfortable, and the view is gorgeous. Everything was spotless. We ate at several local places, and our favorite was Louise’s breakfast a short drive away in Black Mtn. The farm animal greeting upon returning to the cabin was a great bonus."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at High Haven Cabin. The views were spectacular, the cabin was immaculate, and the hot tub was a welcome respite. Feeding the goats and Peggy Jean was a highlight!
We appreciated the local recommendations and enjoyed hikes to Still Creek Falls, Tom’s Creek Falls, Crabtree Falls, the Marion Greenway, and Linville Falls. GoGo’s Cinnamon Rolls is a must stop - delicious!
We liked the privacy of being out in nature a bit, but still close enough to drive to Asheville and the Biltmore Estate.
We highly recommend High Haven Cabin to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Audra and Summer go above and beyond to ensure your stay is excellent. They have a beautiful property and have done an absolutely fantastic job of making everything accessible and friendly to the guests and their fur children.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, private little spot but still close to all amenities"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location and tree house are awesome, they've made a great job making this the perfect place for a quick getaway from the cleanliness, to the thoughtful details throughout the house (yay for s'mores pack) to the cutest animal farms that greet you at the entrance (Peggy Jean, the donkey is the sweetest) and I can't say enough good things about how responsive and helpful the hosts were."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an excellent, private little romantic getaway! This was our favorite Airbnb we've ever stayed in. The views were incredible, the Treehouse itself was adorable, the smell of fresh wood was so nice. We loved sleeping in the comfy bed just steps away from French doors that opened to a private patio with a hot tub! Unfortunately our hot tub didn't work but Audra and Summer were apologetic and responsive about it. Be aware, getting there in 2 wheel drive was hairy and parking impossible. There's a 2 wheel drive pull-off that was helpful, but getting up the hill in wet conditions was low and slow. Recommend 4wd for sure! Overall, a lovely getaway perfect for our honeymoon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, quiet, clean, peaceful. The goats, donkey, and mini horse were our favorite! Always there to greet us when driving back or leaving :) would go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What an incredible trip. This property is absolutely stunning and was the perfect most peaceful getaway for 2. I wish I could give it 10 stars! 🤩
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about this place! It is absolutely gorgeous and when we arrived it was spotlessly clean! The hosts provided everything we could need plus more. They really thought of every detail and even provided a welcome basket for our pups with some treats! Their food and hike recommendations were spot on and we had such a good time exploring the area. The goats, pony, and donkey at the entrance made my day!! They are so sweet!! We will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Meeting the animals and being able to feed them was so much fun. The treehouse was exactly as described and provided a beautiful view of the mountains. What a nice view to wake up to everyday. The host answered all questions immediately and left local recommendations of places to eat and visit. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5-Star.. Beautiful
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, beautiful and peaceful! Will definitely be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice views, private and cozy place. We loved everything about it. Host was responsive and accommodating."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin. The views were great. We enjoyed the fire pit area, deck and hot tub. The goats and donkey/pony were fun to feed for my kids.
We went into Asheville before we checked in, and then drove towards the cabin on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The views were incredible, and we did a hike at Craggy Gardens. We also recommend the waterfall hikes at Toms Falls and Roaring Fork...both easy enough for little kids.
We had a great weekend and can't wait to visit in the future. **Bonus tip for 2WD going up the hill...if you aren't used to it, go faster than you think you need too and it's way easier to get to the top then going slower (2nd try tip lol)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best experience ever!! The place was so peaceful and quiet and the cabin was extremely gorgeous everything was clean and well designed. Thank you for the beautiful place 💕💕we can’t wait to come back here again!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location to celebrate 35th wedding anniversary. Outstanding view especially to wake up too. Private clean well thought out for a place it’s size. Hammock, fire pit, deck just great."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!!! We loved staying here and will definitely try to come back next year!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay for a quiet getaway! Place was lovely and hosts were very helpful! 10/10 recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful views to wake up to. This was that perfect place to stay for a peaceful weekend in the mountains. The treehouse had everything that we needed. Highlights of our stay included walking to the waterfall on the property and simply relaxing on the porch, looking out over the mountains. Truly dog friendly. We will definitely plan to return."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was just what I needed! Beautiful location and super serene. Hosts were very responsive and gave local recs! I will definitely be back (especially for the donkey!!). Loved that the host had s’mores kits ready for you at check in.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The treehouse cabin was wonderful. The privacy and views were top notch. Loved the hot tub overlooking the mountains. The fire pit was lots of fun. We will definitely go back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have traveled all over the world, in many airbnbs..this place is by far our favorite. The view from the balcony was breathtaking, it was even better than the pictures! The place was clean and had all that we needed to make our stay comfy and convenient. We highly recommend staying here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved spending a night at this cabin, the view was breathtaking and the amenities were sufficient for a short stay. It rained all through my stay so I could hike to the waterfalls but it was amazing soaking myself in the hot tub."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Prefect get away!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location for a romantic weekend. Iconic views with a great cozy cabin and comfy hot tub to tie it together. Perfect place for a couple or single person to zone out and turn off from the world. Some of the best stargazing you can get on Eastern side of the states as well. We will definitely visit High Haven Cabin again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning. The treehouse is absolutely stunning and Audra and Summer are incredible hosts—super responsive and accommodating and the description and photos of this paradise do the location justice but nothing can beat staying here and experiencing everything first-hand. As someone who works with architects and construction design, it is clear a lot of thought has gone into this gorgeous and creative haven. Truly such a unique experience and one that will leave you feeling well rested, close to nature and wholly rejuvenated."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was definitely the best place to stay at for a night peaceful getaway! Absolutely gorgeous in every way! My girlfriend and I will most definitely be coming back!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Audra and Summer’s cabin was somehow even more beautiful than the pictures!! Everything about our stay was perfect and they were very helpful and proactive with communication. We will absolutely be returning, hopefully very soon!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing weekend in the cabin. If you are looking for a cooking kitchen, re-think your plans. The small two burner stove is nice but there is no oven and even less counter space, but you can grill on the firepit and the freezer/fridge is a half size so far larger than an average mini-fridge. We got up to the cabin in our 2 wheel drive Ford Escape with no issues but make sure you don't ride in the middle if you are not comfortable driving on steep gravel drives. The walk to the pavilion is short and also gravel but the trail head is there and is amazing! its a short walk to the waterfall and it does not dissappoint! At the foot of the mountain every afternoon we were greeted by all of the goats and donkey and got to feed them coming and going - awesome. The view from the cabin is unparalleled and worth every penny. Bed is super comfortable and I'm a bad sleeper. Marion is a short drive and has plenty of breweries and don't miss Pepperonis pizza on the way back!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! Cannot recommend this place enough!!! Such beautiful, peaceful surroundings. Treehouse had everything we needed, was clean and so comfortable!!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the cleanliness, simplicity, and especially the hot tub on the deck overlooking the Mountain Views. The cabin was neat and the bed was comfortable. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,extremely clean and a perfect getaway from busy urban living New and fresh log cabin and a fun swinging bridge!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a wonderful stay here — it’s hard to fully put this place into a few sentences of a review. From the farm animals vocally greeting us on arrival to the coziness of relaxing under the stars and waking up to the morning sunrise, this place was beautiful. Private, quiet, and very comfortable. Somehow the location and views were even more serene and stunning than the pictures, which made our stay all the more special. Was a pleasure to be one of the first guests here and hope to be back in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect get a way for a long weekend. Will definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to be in a serene location with tons of charm.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow wow wow. The slide was so fun! Dedication to a theme the more I looked the more detail I saw. The view was spectacular and the property was very lovely. Would recommend to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down the best house we’ve stayed at !! My mom and son loved the entry so much. The looks of surprise when they opened the door was worth every penny. Beautiful home and scenery, great hosts— would highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! Beautiful view, lovely decor, and excellent service. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is absolutely the coolest air bnb we’ve stayed in! It’s as advertised. The best view! It’s so quiet and private but very close to shops as well. 10/10 recommend if you love HP or not!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was blown away by this place! It wasn’t just a room to sleep & bathe, it was an “experience”. The fun factor of Alchemy gets a very high rating. Even before arriving I was telling all the shop owners in the Biltmore Village where I was staying & I’ll continue to brag about my stay to anyone who will listen! 😃"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unique and wizard inspired Airbnb was the perfect little getaway for me and my friends. Hidden in the Appalachian Mountains this quiet and secluded tent/underground stay included incredible views, comfort and fun all in one cosy and comfortable little house. We could not get over the wizarding details from the incredible wallpaper to the hanging lights and decorative string lights. It is close enough to the nightlife and beauty that all of Asheville has to offer. Whether you are looking for a beautiful space to quietly relax and be a kid again or enjoy a little bit of everything Asheville has to offer, this Airbnb truly has it all. Absolutely would stay again and recommend this to anyone looking for something special"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous home! There was no unexpected surprises and the scenery was beautiful. Such a fun space to be in and I can't wait to come back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,very cool property surrounded by gorgeous views!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super unforgettable stay and extremely kind host. We had a wonderful time! Our kids had fun sliding over and over while Mom and Dad enjoyed the beautiful view and sounds of laughter. Amazing and magical details!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They did a great job with this place! Beautiful! We felt right at home!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures accurately describe the home. The drive to the location should be done during day light hours especially if you are not used to driving in the mountains.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had the best little get away! Will definitely be coming back in the future. It was such a great and unique experience!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect weekend getaway for my wife and I. Its close to a lot of good restaurants and groceries if you need them. And the place itself is magical, small but not cramped and a beautiful view"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazed at the wonderful experience created with great amenities and attention to detail. Completely swept away to another place. This was unlike any normal air bnb. Will definitely recommend and return again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, magical, fun place to be! 5/5 would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, great views, very cozy place to stay. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a must see! Especially if you are a Harry Potter fan! The decor fits the theme and it has everything you would need available. The location is great and a mile from a grocery store. Once there though, you won't want to leave! We enjoyed the slide as well! I posted a video and had almost 50 comments asking about it! Truly a unique experience! They are expanding and building more tree houses with different themes! Cannot wait to come with a group and see them!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! Beautiful views and would highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an absolute Magical place! Mike and Caroline have put so much thought and detail into there Earth and Sky Dwellings. If you are a Harry Potter fanatic, you don’t want to miss this amazing adventure! Thank you for creating this magical place and sharing it with all of Us!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!! If you enjoy Harry Potter this is the place for you! The attention to detail and all the little extra touches made our stay even better!
The surroundings are beautiful. Highly recommend a visit!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Alchemy was magical!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location. Felt like we stepped into the Weasley’s tent at the Quidditch World Cup. Everything was detailed and immersive. It was perfect for 2 Harry Potter fans, we absolutely loved every minute of it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had an amazing time and experience
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely magical experience at this Harry Potter-themed Airbnb! The cozy tent-inspired decor took us straight to the Quidditch World Cup. The bedroom, a wizard's haven, accommodated us like true Hogwarts champions. The pull-out futon was as comfy as a Hippogriff's nest (really it was quite comfortable, we planned on switching every other night, but didn’t need to). A stay filled with enchantment, perfect for four wizards seeking a spellbinding getaway!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magical and so cozy! The perfect place for our winter getaway. The care and details put into Alchemy did not go unnoticed and made the experience exceptional.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 1 year old daughter and I had an amazing time over our long weekend. I would say a must if you are a Harry Potter fan. So many awesome touches, the hosts definitely thought of everything. Everything was as described and the view was great. We would 100% recommend and stay again. Thanks for having us!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"There aren’t enough words for how much we loved this place! My son and I were living our best Harry Potter lives! We spent a lot of time investigating the black family tree on the tapestry wallpaper. We filmed several videos using the invisibility cloak. It was easy to cook a full New Year’s Day dinner in the kitchenette with the provided electric burners and supplies. Every square inch was themed perfectly, even the cookware was sparkly! we were only there for one night and it was very cold so we didn’t use the Glamping tent or fire pit, but just poking our heads inside it is beautiful. The bed and futon were both extremely comfortable and I enjoyed sitting by the electric fireplace while my son perched halfway up the slide to watch the movies! A word of caution, some of the road and driveway is gravel and very steep so if traveling during winter months plan to have a 4 wheel drive vehicle or get travel insurance, just in case. We hope we can go back soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is on a private, quiet road in a subdivision. The instructions were very clear, but I recommend arriving during daylight due to the tight turns and construction. We arrived during the afternoon and had no issue finding the place later when we returned in the dark after leaving for dinner in Asheville, which is only 10 minutes away.
The place and location are beautiful and peaceful. I definitely recommend for a relaxing getaway. The decor is great, and a fan of Harry Potter will love the inspiration of the decor. I am admittedly not up on the series, but as a casual fan I still appreciated all of the references I noticed from the HP series. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a huge fan and loved explaining it all to me ;)
The view, originality, and cleanliness of the home all made for a pleasant stay, and the owners are very attentive to detail and are easily in touch if you need them. A great experience over all!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was the perfect little getaway! We love Harry Potter so we loved it! And the view is amazing!!! 10/10
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being a huge Harry Potter fan, this was as if my childhood dreams came true! Loved every bit of it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying at the Alchemy was a magical experience. the views are breathtaking and the place delivers on your expectations from the pictures. they even have HBO Max setup with a guest account so you can binge HP while staying IN HP. it was relaxing and a great surprise for my wife. recommend it for any witch or wizard at heart.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"First, the feeling of safety upon arrival. The property is fantastic. Second, the sense of fun and excitement you have when you first pull up to the rental. Every moment was filled with anticipation and Caroline and Mike do not let you down with Alchemy. It was the best time away to celebrate 10 years of marriage. The entrance brought us right into our youth. The details were thrilling to discover. The entire place was clean and comfortable. We decided to stay in and cook our meals and they even provide a means to do that so we didn’t have to miss out on a moment of their fantastic place. The owners were always quick to respond which I highly respect. We highly recommend this place if you are needing a true magical adventure!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was as magical as described. The views are incredible, and the bathroom was bigger than I was expecting. Lots of helpful amenities such as face wipes and hair dryer."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! We saw a meteor shower the last night we were there, and enjoyed the view on the gorgeous back porch. Quaint and very well decorated with lots of attention to detail. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying at Alchemy. It was quite chilly in Asheville while we were visiting and we enjoyed the cozy comfort of our 'tent'. The slide was so much fun and all of the details were much appreciated- including a fabulous christmas tree! We will definitely be staying with you again and cannot wait to see the new additions!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was magical!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Reviews speak for themselves. This place was insane. I’m mad at myself for missing my alarm (phone froze) and I woke up 2 hours later than expected. This made us check in later than we wanted and couldn’t really soak in the place. It’s stunning. Expensive, but the experience is worth it. Caroline and Mike are absolute visionaries and I can see why they are so successful. Amazing!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely amazing bucket list experience. Can't wait to stay here or one of the other fantastic properties in the future!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A magical place to spend a weekend - especially for Harry Potter fans! So many fun little details with unbeatable views!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caroline and Mike were great hosts. They were very fast when it came to responding to my questions. The view was very beautiful and peaceful. This is a great Airbnb, especially if one is fascinated with Harry Potter. As for the location of the Airbnb, I felt like I was in the middle of a hallmark movie. The town was cute and had a variety of different things to do. I will definitely stay here again, as well as recommend it as a place to stay for both friends and family!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing place to stay for the night. Caroline and Mike provided easy directions to find the place. The views were incredible, the slide was a hit, and the whole vibe was loved by the kids (and brought out the kids in the parents). Plenty of space, warm and cozy, snacks and cooking essentials provided, and games in the glamping tent were fun. Would definitely recommend this place for any Harry Potter lover!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was just as magical as expected, we felt totally immersed in the world of Harry Potter! All the details added to the experience and thrilled the kids. The view was spectacular, with every time of day bringing a new display of beauty and color! The slide was the icing on the cake, kids and adults loved it!! Amazing memories were made!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is more than you can imagine. The view is amazing. My Harry Potter Nerd self could not contain myself. I will say, I’m glad we went when we did. They are building two buildings, one on either side of this one and I think it’ll take away from the peacefulness and seclusion of this one. We had some problems with the temperature, too hot too cold back and forth all night. I’m sure if we reached out to the hosts they would have been responsive and helped us figure it out. Overall, it was a great experience. All the details are so well done."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Fun place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful Harry Potter themed airbnb. Very clean and wonderful inside! we really enjoyed the little fire pit and extra tent to play games! It was a very fun and enjoyable stay! 10/10 would recommend to any Potterhead!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is amazing! You will not be disappointed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’m convinced this is the most magical place in Asheville, if not in the US. It got better each second - better when the sun went down, better in the morning when we woke to the fog settled over the town below. The location is stunning. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The coolest thing we have ever done!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place! This is not a place just to lay your head, this is an experience. Very thoughtfully decorated and made me feel like I was in another world. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I was living for this!! I couldn’t stop smiling and sliding down the slide even as an adult! The view was incredible and all the little touches made it so magical!! Wish I could have stayed longer!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My childhood dreams coming true! This stay blew our expectations out of the water. The attention to detail is impressive. You’ll have everything you need and more, plus a beautiful view to enjoy by the fire. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot for a weekend getaway! My sister saw this place on a reel and so I surprised her by taking her. A truly magical and comfy place to relax and hang out with my sister. The design and decoration is incredibly well thought out--so many extra tiny details that add to the fun. And the slide! We went down it so many times, just for fun. Faster than most of the playground slides I slid down growing up. We had a little difficulty finding it, but we were driving in the dark so that didn't help. Directions were helpful, but I could've used a little more help in finding our house after turning onto the treehouse-named road (the provided directions give the actual road name, I'm being vague to protect their privacy). But overall it was an amazing spot and we will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique experience! We loved the themed stay, out 5 yo couldn’t get enough of the slide and cool Harry Potter stuff. Hosts were extremely responsive and very helpful! Would stay again"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. The views are truly breathtaking. A little challenging to find, especially if you arrive after dark, but once you get there, it’s worth it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caroline and mike were great hosts, super responsive and in a timely manner! Now the house, everything was spectacular from the Mountain View’s and peaceful mornings to the incredibly detailed and creative home. We felt as if we had our own wizarding journey staying at Alchemy, not mention seeing a few of their other locations around us. We’ll most definitely be back! Lots of things to do, we took a tour of downtown Asheville and learned all about the history of the city. The River arts district was beautiful and one of my favorite spots!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was incredible and the view even more so. Such a neat stay and definitely made our trip to Asheville amazing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The view is understated. Holy cow!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was magical! The scenery is breathtaking, and Caroline and Mike provide plenty of activities to do during your stay. We will definitely be back again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"To be honest, this place was AMAZING!! I can say enough! Thank you for putting such effort even in the little details that brought a movie my husband loved to life! We are definitely excited for all to come and will be coming back for sure!! The surrounding area was gorgeous and the fun of the slide as great too! We just loved all the creativity and kept being amazed at it all!! Definitely hands on one of the coolest places we stayed! Can’t wait to come back and try out their other places! You will love your stay for sure! Wa s truly beautiful and a great surprise for my husbands birthday! ;0)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was truly a magical experience! Thank you for providing such a wonderful place and with such beautiful views!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time, so many memories with our kids. My daughter got the theme as soon as we saw the tent, high ceilings made it feel much larger then I expected."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Alchemy tent in the Earth and Sky dwellings community was absolutely magical! So much privacy, decorations were so well thought out, and the views were to die for. We even saw some bear cubs! Highly recommend Caroline and Mike’s stay to anyone!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was truly one of a kind! The views, ambiance, and experience make it a must do if you need a place to stay in Asheville and are a fan of Harry Potter. We had the best time and can’t wait to come back to see the other houses Earth and Sky offer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful experience. It was even better than the pictures. We will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third time staying here. Every place we stay at we think it’s the best so far! They have really created a magical place here and the views are just the icing on the cake. There is so much attention to detail in these magical homes they create, can’t wait to return for the next experience! 6 out of 5 stars.."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect. Exactly as described. View was amazing.
Convenient stores for basics just down the mountain. 20 minutes from downtown Asheville.
Can’t wait to go back. The area is like a while village of other places we wanted to stay as well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! 10/10 recommend!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely magical! Every detail was fantastic!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! It was pricey but so worth it, we just wish we could’ve stayed longer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are a Harry Potter Fan... This is an absolute MUST! Caroline and Mike have created something so unique and special that makes you feel like you have stepped into the movie! What an incredible surprise for my daughters who are huge HP fans! It was exactly like the pictures. They created a magical world with the view, the slide into the ""tent"" , cozy beds, clean bathroom and thoughtful snacks to greet you when you arrive! They have literally thought of everything! And the magical second tent where you can decompress from the world and sit out there and watch the sunrise and sunset was a wonderful surprise and added bonus! We absolutely loved it and can't wait to visit and try their Hobbit House! Thank you for providing something so unique for your guests! It was one for the memory books!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline and Mike had a vision and made it happen. the area and collection of existing/in progress houses is breathtaking and peaceful. homey cute space that had so many small intricate Harry Potter details that my partner and I really appreciated. a real sorting hat, robes and glasses was so amazing. beautiful bathroom and a really comfy bed! we hope to visit again and see the new additions to the neighborhood once they are finished."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the uniqueness of the airbnb. My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan and enjoyed all the decorations. The slide was a lot of fun!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, detailed oriented to Harry Potter and wonderful view, price is pretty steep though, especially with all the fees tacked on. I’d stay again if it wasn’t so expensive."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What can I say? I didn’t tell my husband ahead of time about this special experience and he didn’t disappoint me with his confused reaction when we pulled up to the tent. That view is the absolute best. It has a theme that I wasn’t aware of but it doesn’t need it. It is a special place and a real memory in our books. May be a bit pricey for the space but felt it was so unique it was worth it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our last stop on our mini tour of Earth & Sky Dwellings and wow were we amazed! When I first researched this place and found out there was a slide I was thinking there would be no way I could go down it. But when we arrived and I actually saw it I knew I HAD to, and oh my gosh it really made me feel like a kid again. You don't get that feeling too often, so this place will always be special to me. The house itself is only one room (besides the bathroom) but it doesn't feel small at all. The tall ceilings and walls covered in fabric really makes it feel like you're in one of the magical tents from the movies. We were in awe of this place. It's truly beautiful here and a magical experience to say the least. From the stunning views to the adorable little tent out back. Don't miss out on this place. We are so very thankful to the hosts for sharing such a wonderful home with us. Hoping to return some day. <3"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! What a view! Extreme attention to detail in the decoration of the Airbnb greatly added to the magic of it. Had an amazing stay. Caroline and Mike reached out to make sure everything was good and to contact them for any needs during the stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing. We will be back!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The magic was in the details. The hosts added so many little touches that added to the wizardry vibes. The location provided beautiful views and short drives to downtown Asheville. The simple furnishings and appliances were perfect for two guests on a weekend trip. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a magical experience! It combined Harry Potter with views of the mountains — two of my favorite things! We had so much fun discovering all of the fun knickknacks around the place. I can’t wait to see what other properties they have!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at the Alchemy for the weekend! It was such a cool and themed experience! We can’t wait to book another property soon!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a magical place to stay! Everything was perfect down to the last detail! Caroline and Mike were very helpful and gave great directions for navigating our way to the tent! Our only wish is that we would have had better weather to enjoy the outdoor space, but that’s just a reason for us to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alchemy was a great place to relax with the gorgeous mountain views. We loved the creativity and effort put into the design! Not only is it great for Harry Potter fans, but it offers a magnificent view of the mountains. Caroline and Mike were great hosts."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Truly magical!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was so fun!! I felt right like I was stepping right into my childhood dream 🥰
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,They took the time to make the houses amazing and the views were spectacular.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our experience! Great place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing property! Caroline and Mike had so many thoughtful details in their decoration and games, if made for a truly magical stay!
They have a few extra cooking appliances available in the cupboard (hot plate, toaster oven) which were a nice addition to the microwave and fridge.
One thing I think is important to know is that during my stay the WiFi was a bit slow. It varied from 2 mbps to 13 mbps and made streaming (Harry Potter movies, of course!) difficult at times. I mostly mention it in case anyone plans to do any Zoom meeting or the like, I would make sure to have an alternate option (hotspot, data) available. Or if you need to download something, perhaps you should do it prior to your Airbnb stay.
Would love to come again! Such an original and fabulous location!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was truly magical! We did not want to leave. The attention to detail was superb and my 4 year old could not get enough of the slide. We appreciated all that was provided including the snacks. Loved that all of the Harry Potter movies were available on Amazon prime. I felt like a kid again. I would highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline and Mike’s place was absolutely magical. Better than the photos. Everyone always mentions the attention to detail, you will have to see it for yourself. Small things like makeup removal wipes In the bathroom really show that they go the extra mile to make sure you have everything you need for your stay. Definitely recommending it to everyone. Directions and instructions for the stay were perfect."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures just dont do this place justice, however cool you think it's going to be, it's even cooler than that. I took my gf for her birthday and the tent had her absolutely fooled, seeing her face when she opened it and saw what was inside was priceless. You can tell how much effort Caroline and Mike have put into the small details, they really have gone all out and it shows. I cant wait to see what the new treehouses/underground houses they're building turn out, will def be back at some point! Just book it, even if you're not a Harry Potter fan it will blow you away. 100% far and away the most awesome Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Thanks Caroline and Mike!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely magical!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alchemy was magical to say the least. We made this reservation months in advance for good reason! It's no wonder the treehouses stay booked. This was a surprise trip for our 11 year old Harry Potter fanatic and it did not disappoint. All the reviews that mention ""attention to detail"" were spot on. Every detail of this place was perfect and well thought out. Highlights were the slide entry into the home, the invisibility cloak, the sorting hat, the incredible views and all the little Harry Potter details. We were especially pleased to find that all the HP movies were pre-purchased on Amazon Prime so we may or may not have been extraordinarily lazy and just stayed in our magical mountain tent all weekend watching the movies, drinking Butterbeer and eating HP treats. :) This place was so great that there really was no reason to leave and we are so glad we stayed. A big applause to Caroline and Mike for thinking of literally everything. Best Airbnb stay we've ever had!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place! Wonderful decorations, an incredible view with a gorgeous sunset and the hosts really did a great job making sure everything was there that guests may need- thank you so much!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alchemy is an amazing stay and the pictures do not do it justice for the experience. I surprised my girlfriend with this trip and she was truly shocked when we pulled up to a tent on the side of a mountain. I highly recommend a stay at Alchemy and can't wait to go back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline and Mike really created a magical experience for me and my sisters. I celebrated my birthday in Ashville, it was very close to down town and the whole experience was so nice. The views were out of this world! I will def be visiting their other treehouses very very soon!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved every minute of my time at Alchemy! I wish I could live there! Thank you for creating such an amazing magical getaway !
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Alchemy! It was such an immersive and uniquely magical experience.

Enjoyed our stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I purchased this stay for my wife as her Christmas gift. At first she was telling me “oh you spent too much money” but once we arrived she agreed is was worth every penny. I love all the small nods to Harry Potter
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ve never stayed in a more perfect Airbnb! Everything was so clean and comfortable. We felt right at home the minute we slid in lol. We will DEFINITELY be back and we hope to stay in some of the other treehouses!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alchemy is a quaint magical abode with delightful touches that will inspire the wonder in adults and children. I highly recommend this stay if you are looking for a special home with an amazing view. The interior is quite small, so plan to pack light. :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magical — if you have the opportunity to book it, definitely don't hesitate. The views are incredible and the attention to detail from a design perspective is top notch. Caroline & Mike were also so helpful as hosts. Would love to visit again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Caroline and Mike have created a magical stay that is excellent for all ages.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an absolutely magical part of our Christmas. The tent was everything we thought it would be and more. We are Harry Potter fans and we were blown away at their attention to detail. The tent was perfect for us and our two young children. The outdoor tent was perfect for games and late night conversations. A welcome basket with snacks and coffee was a nice touch. The real magic was in the giant slide that my kids enjoyed for HOURS. We recommend all potter heads stay here at least once! Thanks for a memorable Christmas.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was everything we thought it would be and more! It was our first anniversary and it was incredible. It brought our imaginations as Harry Potter fans to life and to something physical that we could see and experience ourselves. The views are 2nd to none. I dare say the best view in the area bar none. We will definitely be back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. Attention to detail was incredible!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great trip! Seven year old loved the slide, roasting s’mores at night, and climbing all over the rocks. The selection of family games were much appreciated as was the many choices for kids tv during inclement weather. Will definitely be booking again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent airbnb!!! This place was amazing and my son enjoyed it for his 10th birthday. I will definitely come back again.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What can you say that hasn’t already been said about this magical place? Even if you aren’t a huge Harry Potter fan, which, of course I am, the views, and the amenities at this Airbnb, are outstanding. The firepit at night overlooking the city is spectacular.

I would recommend any of their properties to anyone and we will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but it was so magical—from the decor to the view. The hosts were so attentive and provided snacks and water which was a great extra touch.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a fun stay! We love Harry Potter and our 7 year old daughter loved it as much as we though she would. She went down the slide several times. The fall view from the mountain was lovely. All the decor details were perfect and we enjoyed playing all the Harry Potter games that were curated. Finally, the bed was super comfy. I want to ask what type of mattress this was. Everything was well appointed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alchemy is THE most unique getaway in Asheville! Loved every minute of it! Look forward to coming back soon!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,After seeing a few photos I had to see this place for myself. Me and my husband spent my birthday night here. the location/view was beautiful. Just the drive getting there was fun. I felt like a little kid going down the slide (which we definitely did more than once). Everything about the decor and little details was magical. There were more amenities than we needed and the bed was SO comfortable! It was a wonderful experience for our first visit to Asheville. Can't wait to check out the other properties in the future.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view was amazing and the attention to detail of the Harry Potter design of this Airbnb was absolutely incredible! Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,There are no words for the beautiful experience at this unique Airbnb. It truly was serene and we look forward to venturing out again at some point.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! The entrance was so much fun. I felt like a kid every time we came home! The beds were comfortable & there were plenty of pillows & blankets. The place was clean & the views were so lovely! Definitely a magical stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved every minute of our stay! The treehouse was amazing and every little detail is awesome! We loved the glamping tent, many a game of connect 4 and jenga was enjoyed in there! The view is unbeatable! And our girls thoroughly enjoyed the slide😂 definitely the highlight of their trip! We would LOVE to come back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The views from this house were spectacular!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was magical and exactly as pictured! The attention to detail is exceptional and it really makes you feel like you are transported to a different world. It had amazing views and is only a short drive from downtown (which is where we did most of our activities). It exceeded our expectations and we can’t wait to check out some of the other properties hosted by Caroline and Mike!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at Alchemy was simply magical! There are so many little details that make you really feel like you are in the Wizarding world. I urge you to book your stay - it will not disappoint! I know we are already planning our next stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. It is even more beautiful in person. The view alone is worth it, but the magic of this place is surreal. We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. I originally found the location from a video of the slide entrance, and that was as cool as it seemed. But there's so much more than that. The view is stunning. We didn't do much time emptying the view and the birds. The themeing was also delightful. It's clear how much thought went into it. And on top of all of that everything was so comfortable and well kept. I cannot say enough positive things about this stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an absolutely incredible property! We couldn't have been happier with our stay. Every detail was well thought out, the views were amazing, and we had a very magical time. We would definitely stay here again and can't wait to visit other Treehouses of Serenity!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a memorable experience this is perfect. Our kids will be talking about the tent house with the slide for years to come. The view was amazing not only for the sunrise and sunset, but the thunderstorm was so cool to watch."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an incredible and unique place! The hosts were very helpful and great communication. We enjoyed every second of our time at alchemy, even during a thunderstorm the first night, we enjoyed watching from the beauty of inside the home. Absolutely recommend to anyone who wants a special and unique getaway. I would also recommend driving a 4wd vehicle, luckily I drove my truck and was able to maneuver up the steep hills. Being my first time in the mountains, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Can’t wait to book another adventure at Serenity!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun girls trip to get take a break from the Muggle world & get lost in this magical stay ✨ The details were so fun & well thought out.. & the views were breathtaking.. morning coffee won’t be quite the same! After all this time? Always.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was perfect and everything we could have hoped for. The place was clean and the supplies that were offered were great. My friend and I had the best time, we just wished we were able to stay for more than one night. We definitely plan on coming back soon."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing! We had a fabulous time at this unique home!
Everything was perfect!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are in love with this place! We’re local to the area and happened to find an open night on my birthday and booked it immediately. I was so excited because I love HP, but I wasn’t ready for how incredible this place was. The views were incredible and the theming was so impressive. We had such a magical time and I already can’t wait to go back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Magical stay! There is no place like this! Caroline was very responsive and provided excellent communication. Home was extravagantly decorated but also extremely clean. Views were breathtaking and slide entrance provided much fun! Would love a chance to stay again:)
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great experience. Our two boys loved the slide, I don’t even know how many times they went down it! The view is spectacular! Saw lots of wild turkeys, bunnies and birds. Loved the attention to details and loved how themed everything was even down to the games and there are so many games!! The games were an extra bonus that was greatly appreciated by all!! I would say if you plan a trip during warm months bring bug spray. My son got a tick on him from just walking briefly outside in the back patio area so we made sure we sprayed down before going outside."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical. Make sure you make it back to your cabin by sunset. The game tent was such a fun way to relax at the end of our day. I highly recommend staying here to anyone whether you are a Harry Potter fan or not it’s just a really fun place to stay. I look forward to trying the different cabins in the future with my family.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing. Loved everything about the tent. Host were very quick to respond and super helpful. If you are a Harry Potter fan, it’s definitely worth the visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This has been our favorite Airbnb to date! My boyfriend was completely surprised, he totally thought that we were just staying in a tent. The attention to detail is impeccable, as huge Harry Potter fans we definitely felt as if we were transported into the books! Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Expecto Patronum!! What a magical place to stay. We spent the weekend and had an amazing time. There are so many extra details that make The Alchemy even more magical. Sorting hat, robes for each house, themed games, and even a cloak of invisibility! But the most magical part of this place is the view of the mountains while sitting around the fire pit.
We had a wifi issue that the owners quickly responded to and fixed so we could enjoy a movie that night. There’s a grocery store at the bottom of the hill for anything you need. Only 15 minutes to the Biltmore Estate which was amazing. And we found the nearby small town of Weaverville to be so charming and enjoyed their restaurants for a couple of meals. We can’t wait to come back and stay in another one of their amazing properties here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a must stay. Gorgeous views and ultimate privacy. Spend your night with a lit fire looking northward towards Weaverville under the night sky and the lit town below. Supermarket at the entrance of the street so you are not far from getting food or anything else you need. Short drive to downtown Asheville to take in the rest of what the area has to offer. And if you are going strictly for the Harry Potter theme, you will find small things that make you smile in every area of this property."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Magical! We loved our stay and will cherish the memories for a lifetime. The best “tent” we’ve ever stayed in. Beautiful view!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stop on our tour of treehouse’s of serenity. This place is so cool, I want to live here! I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the most amazing Air BnB my wife and I have ever stayed in! Really nice attention to detail! Such a cool idea, made us feel like kids again! Top notch we will definitely be returning customers!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful trip! The place is amazing! The views were absolutely beautiful! Couldn’t ask for better host! It was very clean and just about everything you need was provided for you!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a fantastic stay. I am a huge Harry potter fan and all the little detail in the decor were amazing. Thank you for one of the coolest Airbnb’s experiences I’ve been too.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an amazing experience for any Harry Potter lover! Amazing view and great set-up!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thinking about booking this location? Stop thinking and do it. There was only 1 available night I could book and I live a full 7 hour drive away, but did it anyway. It was so beautiful and so relaxing. Totally worth it. There is a grocery store and gas station at the base of the mountain, so if you need food, drinks, anything really it is readily available. This is the perfect getaway for a couple or parents with young children (just keep a close eye on the kids when they’re outside - you are on the side of a mountain after all). Fast, reliable Internet available as well as plenty of analog games like connect four and HP themed games, books, etc. Fire pit for s’mores or just warming up. No stove or oven, but microwave is available as well as an electric kettle and coffee maker. Be sure to wake up between 6 and 7 am to see the fog descend the mountain and slowly reveal the surround landscape below."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view of this place is absolutely incredible!! We loved how quaint and cozy the place felt and enjoyed waking up to the the beautiful view. I wish we could have stayed longer! Highly recommend!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Alchemy house. The details were perfect and it was very relaxing. The hosts were great as well!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a neat place they are building there. Super close to downtown Asheville which has all the shopping, eateries, parks you could want. We had a magical little sisters getaway at the “alchemy” house. Thank you to the host for having such detail in their decor and touches! For future guests it might be good to know there is not much super close to the property however there is an Ingles grocery at the bottom of the mountain which was perfect. And the space is very small, could sleep maybe only 3 people tops but it was SO CUTE AND COZY! Loved it. Thank you again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My kids and husband were so surprised when they saw the tent and thought that was it. The slide and all the fun details WOWed not only my kids but us adults as well. My oldest is a huge Harry Potter fan so he was really excited and started playing with the invisibilty cloak immediately. The view can't be beat. A really amazing experience all around. Will be back next for the Treehouses but my kids want to come back to the tent again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely love staying with Treehouses of Serenity! This is our third time and won’t be our last! Caroline and Mike always go out of their way to accommodate anything you need. This time was for an elopement! Highly highly recommend this location to anyone wanting a unique venue for tying the knot! You can’t go wrong with a stay here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was even better than we expected! The space is bigger than you would think and the view is beautiful! Be careful trying to find it, We drove right past the entrance, and beyond the entrance is very very steep and (to me at least) terrifying! But if you follow the hosts directions, you won't have a problem! I cant recommend this place enough!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was INCREDIBLE. The pictures don't do it justice. Super cozy and so much attention to detail.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re a Harry Potter fan, this is a must-see spot. We only stayed for a night, but the magic will stay with us forever. There’s truly just nothing like it. The decor was perfect and I felt like I was in a Harry Potter book. Stay here! You won’t regret it."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cool place to stay. We had a blast. Beautiful scenic views. Really does give the Harry Potter quidditch World Cup vibe, especially when you first arrive and then continue to explore. Comfortable sleeping arrangements."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique and great place. Beautiful views, close to town, clean and well thought out. So much better than spending the night at a hotel."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a very special place. So magical. We enjoyed everything so much!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s always a wonderful stay with Treehouses of Serenity!! Alchemy was WONDERFUL! Just go!!! If you are a fan of the Wizard, the details here are so fun!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in one of their other treehouses before and had a great experience, so I was beyond excited to stay in this HP themed one. As a place to stay, they’ve got the whole situation keyed up with all the necessities, including an easy self check in process with a keyless entry around back (the non slide part!). To finally stay in one of their themed homes, however, was a whole different experience. The attention to fun details and the clear overall goal of making the whole thing an experience to remember had me geeking out the whole time. Not the cheapest stay, but when you see all that goes into this and all their stays, you can really appreciate the value. Highly recommend this and all their properties!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! The Alchemy was truly out of this world. It felt like we stepped right into the Potterverse. Caroline and Mike were so kind. 100000/10 recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a magical adventure. Every detail was thought throughly through allowing for an incredible experience building memories for a lifetime. We will return.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome, definitely the best Airbnb experience we have had. The views are phenomenal and the patio is a perfect, private space to watch the sunset or the night sky. The decor is magical. You might forget you are not actually at Hogwarts. We took the slide in and giggled all the way down."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! What a immersive experience. I would tell anyone to stay here.
We met Mike and he was a delight.
Can’t wait to come back in May!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique stay at Alchemy! Slide down into the quidditch tent and enjoy your stay!! All of the treehouses on property were spotless, came with amenities and great communication with the host. Will be back!"
