2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The boat house was very beautiful. The service was excellent and when something needed looked at they immediately came to look into it. I would very much recommend a stay at the Boat House.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best experience. The villa was super clean and beautiful. The hosts provided clear instructions and were quick with responses. We look forward to returning!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We rented the house boat while family was visiting in town. It was in an amazing location, walkable to the riverwalk, restaurants and shopping. The house was clean, well stocked and very comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very pleasant stay and quieter than we expected for the houseboats. Very walkable to downtown and all the excitement, but far enough way to not have to be in the middle of it."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW! What a fun and unique stay - like staying in a luxury hotel, only this one floats! :)
Perfect location - walkable to all the shops, restaurants, and activities on Wilmington‚Äôs lively riverfront.
One of our favorite Airbnb experiences!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Adrift was a wonderful experience - the place was clean, beautiful, and roomy for two. The hosts were helpful, informative, and very responsive. Great location in terms of being near restaurants and bars. The rear deck was large and enjoyable. Only issue (not their fault) is that parking is not adjacent, making it inconvenient to load and unload. We loved our two-night stay and highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best girls weekend here! It was the perfect location - walkable to the riverwalk so we were able to just wonder between restaurants and bars to get apps and drinks but we loved being about to just hang out at the boat on the upper deck. It was such a cute, very clean place with a great host!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This villa looks exactly as it does online. Erin was very responsive and the villa was very clean. The towels as well as the bed sheets were great quality! The villa is located within walking distance of some awesome restaurants downtown Wilmington. I've already recommend this location to family and friends and I will certainly return. It is worth the cost.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the TOP Airbnb stays my wife and I have experienced. Not only was it comfortable & convenient, it was one of the most peaceful and serene stays we‚Äôve experienced with Airbnb (easily in our top three).
My wife found the ad on social media and it lived up to the hype. We stayed during the week so there wasn‚Äôt a lot of traffic-noise while we were there. The host provided detailed instructions on how to make the most of our time (nearby restaurants, shopping, etc) which were PERFECT for us.
We will definitely be returning to Airbnb the next time we‚Äôre in Wilmington."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful stay at The Cove Adrift!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've lived in Wilmington my whole life and booked it for one night for my friends & I. Their staff & support team were great, super responsive and made the whole
process easy. I don't think I've stayed at a nicer AirBnb or hotel that offers this kind of experience. The boat houses are designed very well and all of my friends were shocked that this existed in our hometown. Even the people staying in the other boat houses were friendly! I'll be back again, thanks for a great night."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful and would love to come back soon!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,My buddies and I stayed here for the Marine Corps ball next door at the Convention Center and it was definitely a good call. Less than a 2 minute walk to the venue. Super clean and cozyü§åüèº
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying on the house boat. What a neat experience!
The place felt brand new, extremely clean and comfortable, beautiful furnishings, comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen. We also appreciated that parking was included, since its pretty expensive to find parking in downtown Wilmington.
The upstairs porch was such a great place to sit in the morning with a cup of coffee, and after dinner with a glass of wine. We loved our time there and wished we could‚Äôve stayed longer."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place. Wish we had more time to stay and relax.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marcia‚Äôs place was fantastic. Much larger than I expected. Beautifully kept, very clean and beautiful place. Very serene and quiet and close to downtown. Would definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome House Boat - Tyler Childers Concert!
What an awesome Friday Night at Adrift in Wilmington. We brought our boat up from Bald Head Island for The Tyler Childers concert at Live Oak Bank Pavillion. Summer's House Boat in Adrift @ The Cove was the perfect place for our Friday Evening of Fun. Very easy to book a slip @ Port City Marina very close to this wonderful house boat. Perfect for 2 couples to enjoy the Patio w a cocktail before & after the show. We made the short walk to Marina Grill for Dinner and down the Boardwalk to the Concert.
The house was beautifully decorated, the perfect size for our group, well furnished for breakfast the next morning and our host was wonderful and responsive to work with.
We will be back for any future events and will recommend to all our friends on BHI!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay in Wilmington, walkable to everything! unique experience on the water! Host was perfect and attentive. A little costly for the fourth but worth it for our needs!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat is beautiful. The AC had some issues and were fixed. However, the dead bugs were not ok. Apparently, that's something to expect near the water. It was a first time for us staying on a houseboat. One and Done for us"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a blast definitely would recommend
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my top rentals this year and there has been many since we are relocating to NC in the next few weeks. Marcia was such a great host, responded very quickly and answered all our questions. We flew in on a red eye and she allowed us to check in early which was wonderful and much needed. The place was beautifully decorated, very clean and had everything you could need. We loved the location because it was within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants. The second-floor patio was the perfect touch to end the night overlooking the marina. Overall would highly recommend and we would love to stay here again! Thanks Marcia!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was absolutely amazing! There was beautiful views and restaurant in walking distances. The door was difficult to get into at first but I got the hang of it the second day. Plus, the host had a video explaining how to get in the door which was thoughtful. It is pricey, but factor in the location and it‚Äôs a boat house well worth it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Delight was as advertised. Traveling alone, the sense of security with access gates was reassuring. The space was modern and peaceful. The host provided local events that coincided with my stay. Highly recommend and would travel there again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely return for another visit.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our houseboat stay was wonderful. The boat's design, decorative style, and amenities made it perfect for the two of us to get away for a long weekend. Everything we needed was thought of and included. We only wish we had chosen a warmer day to make use of the amazing outside space. We would most certainly try to stay here again. What a unique space in a town we love!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool place to spend time in downtown Wilmington! Bang for the buck was excellent, although I'm sure prices will go up during the summer. We are local and it will be super fun to take our boat here and spend the night after attending a concert at the River Oak Pavilion right down the street. Lots of great restaurants and historical sites within walking distance."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We Loved our stay with Erin, the houseboat was exactly as described, it was peaceful and relaxing and within a 5-10 min walk from local bars and restaurants! We nice area as well! The parking was about a 2 mins walk to unit!"

I will definitely be staying here again for the nice accommodations and gorgeous view over the marina!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great three night stay. Houseboat was clean and well described online. We were visiting relatives and the location was perfect. We had breakfast one morning at the Dixie Grill and dinner one night at True Blue Butcher. Both were excellent and highly recommended. Relatives were so impressed with the houseboat that they are planning a one night getaway in the future.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A house on the water - what an amazing concept! Beautiful location - right on the boardwalk. The sunsets over the NC Battleship were gorgeous! In walking distance to so many great resturants and shops. The food at the Marina Grill was delicious, I highly recommend. The weather was mild for December, so it made the trip that much better. The place was EXACTLY as described in the photos - how refreshing that was! Well decorated and stocked. Awesome correspondence from the host. The only issue we had was with the lock. It took forever to get the door locked from the outside, as the key did not seem to want to turn the tumbler. We messed with it a while and finally figured out the trick to it.
This was such a relaxing getaway. We will be back!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs a beautiful villa!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a quick getaway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Delight at the Cove was a true delight. From the beautiful scenery to the beautiful decor on the inside. Our stay was amazing. This houseboat was prime location as it is in the front where you can see the beautiful sunset from your upstairs deck and hear music on the weekends from the marina grill. The kitchen had all you needed if you want to stay in a cook instead of going out. The linens as well as the house itself were very clean. I really enjoyed the bidet on the toilet and the heated toilet seat. That was a really nice touch. Overall, it was a great stay, it was a bit expensive, but we enjoyed ourselves and life is about experiences. So, if you're thinking about it, just do it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place with beautiful decor and calming colors. Being on the water and close to the heart of downtown was really nice and convenient. So many restaurant choices and places to visit within walking distance. I probably wouldn‚Äôt pay that price again, however, it was a nice experience and I wished I could have stayed longer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience!! Loved the boathouse and listening to live music from the balcony at night overlooking the water.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to see a show at LiveOak and the location is perfect for that. No need to wait for an Uber after the show!
Marcia and team have great communication, and it was super easy to get from the airport to the houseboat.
It was the perfect size for a couple and provided plenty of comfort to relax for the weekend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place. The concept of it is incredible! Being on the water and close to the heart of downtown was really nice. I really like the interior decoration and deck up top. Would I pay that price again? Probably not! The host seems to do a great job though and it‚Äôs a great place. Not to take away from that.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The boat house was beautiful! We loved the top deck!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at the Cove!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were traveling through this weekend and decided to do a fun AirBnB for the evening. We love finding unique places for the experience and Marcia‚Äôs boathouse did not disappoint! First off, the entire place was super clean and absolutely adorable in every way. The upstairs deck and lounge was perfect for the relaxation we needed. Love, love, LOVE the egg chairs and felt right at home watching the sunset while listening to live music from the Marina Grill and drinking some cold beers. We cannot recommend this place more and wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. We will definitely be back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you're looking for an experience..this is it! Loved being on the water in a beautiful environment. The upstairs patio area was Amazing!!!! We will definitely be staying here again!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really don‚Äôt think there are enough words to say how wonderful Marcia has been to my family and I. This is our third stay here at the cove in a three week span and our longest (not by choice but thankful it was here). What should of just been a happy two night stay prior to closing on our home ( moving an entire family of 8 from NY to NC) turned into a complete nightmare (the closing part) and an extended stay of a total of 7 nights. Marcia was so accommodating and supportive throughout the whole process and checked in on us daily. The home just like the other two we have stayed in is amazing. Clean, comfortable, and free of clutter. We love the furniture and the beds are super comfy. For us, the deck and location makes it a place to come back to repeatedly (hence the third stay). Thank you again Marcia and the whole team at the Cove for your wonderful, genuine hospitality! We can‚Äôt thank you enough."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Marcia was extremely responsive and went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful stay! She made a great recommendation for a nice restaurant within walking distance of the houseboat. Perfect and convenient for a nearby meal after check-in.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for a short walk to the music amphitheater and dining. Gorgeous decor and spotlessly clean. Parking was very convenient and instructions were clear. Host was very responsive to check in questions. Beautiful and unique accommodations.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay here! We enjoyed being right in the middle of the marina and super close to all the shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back! Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at The Cove on the Cape Fear River was a unique and worthwhile experience.
From beginning to end, my husband and I enjoyed our stay.
While there were a few hiccups, the host Marcia and her team were more than willing to communicate and make things right.
I would absolutely recommend a stay in this beautiful setting and where you can enjoy both the vibrancy of downtown Wilmington while relaxing on an amazing houseboat on the water!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay did not disappoint! Beautiful views and unique experience. Beautifully decorated, clean and inviting. Marcia was very helpful, super responsive and a wonderful host. Will definitely be booking another stay and highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quiet environment. The villa was wonderful! My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay. Host, Marcia was very kind, detailed, and responsive. Thank you so much! We plan to come back to visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked the one bedroom and bath for my husband bday and I wanted to have a cake and surprise balloons ready when we arrive and Marcia made that happen. The cake was delicious and we also enjoyed every restaurant we went to. They were having a boat show and we went to the event. Everything was waking distance. My husband especially enjoyed walking downtown. He was surprised how close we were. Marcia place was very clean and smelt brand new. We will be returning in November 2023 .
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Wow. WOW! Words cannot even describe the feelings I have for my stay at the Cove! From beginning to end Marcia was extremely helpful, thorough and so sweet. The house itself was everything I‚Äôve always dreamed of as it was my first time on a house boat! I booked last minute as my original vacation was canceled and I was in desperate need of a getaway. My spirit was so happy with the time spent on the upper deck on the swings. My inner child was definitely happy. The house was well stocked with literally everything. My boyfriend and I appreciated the extra linens, dishes, and the fact that it was gated! This stay was so peaceful and relaxing. There was one night where the wind was a little crazy but surprisingly couldn‚Äôt fee too much on the houseboat. We definitely had a couple great nights of rest. Again, I‚Äôm speechless but am super grateful to have had this experience! *crying real tears* Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, quiet but also near everything. And can‚Äôt beat being on the top level, for coffee in the morning or drinks in the evening."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much fun staying on the houseboat at the downtown marine in Wilmington. Easily accessible, felt safe within the gated marine docks, appreciated the well-kept accommodations, and really enjoyed the upper deck. Great stay! Thanks!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was a dream! It is quite spacious for 2 and very comfortably furnished. The upstairs deck is to die for and the views are even better. We spent our wedding weekend here and could not have asked for a better experience! Only issue we had was that the wifi did not work unfortunately but we didn‚Äôt really need it so we did not ask for it to be fixed so can‚Äôt complain :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful house boat. Very clean and wonderfully decorated. Great location as well!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful weekend and enjoyed our stay here so much! The house boat is beautiful and in a perfect location.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. The houseboat was clean and nicely decorated. The rooftop deck is a great place to have your morning coffee or watch the sunset. The location is perfect. It's just north of the busy downtown area but just a short stroll to get there. The Riverwalk goes right by the dock so it's a great way to access the shops and restaurants of downtown .
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this house boat was perfect for a girls weekend with my best friend. it‚Äôs so nice! very clean. it‚Äôs on the river walk which was nice. there‚Äôs restaurants and shops just a walk away. 10/10 recommend! such a different place to stay. we had an amazing weekend. we loved that we could sit on the porch and hear the live bands that were performing at marina grill!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great surprise for my husband‚Äôs birthday - made even better because it‚Äôs in our home town!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was completely accurate. We had a spectacular stay and cannot wait for our next visit. Everything was sparkly clean, comfortable, and very tastefully decorated. We loved everything so much! A little perk was that the amphitheater is very close by. We could hear the music from an evening concert so clearly when we were out on the deck. Being on the riverwalk is fabulous too. The location could not be any better. We could walk to so many wonderful attractions and restaurants. Also, when we were inside, we heard absolutely no noise from outside. I give this stay the best rating in all areas. We loved it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for the NCLGISA conference and this place was amazing!!! I absolutely loved staying here and will definitely be back again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√© and I came down for the weekend for a concert at Live Oak Pavillion, which is about 5 minutes from the condo (approximately a 20 minute walk).

Warren was an outstanding host, and we will definitely plan to come back in the future!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in town for business and only staying one night. The location was perfect and the view was tremendous. Warren made check in incredibly easy by sending me videos of how to get into the place which otherwise would have been very difficult. Within 10 minutes of being on the property, I lost the key to the parking deck. After contacting Warren, he put me at ease and we figured out a solution the next day. Great experience overall and I hope to use the property again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great thank you
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is in the perfect location to everything downtown Wilmington has to offer, and you can‚Äôt beat the view from the condo balcony! We never got in our car once during our stay. Restaurants and shops are easily in walking distance."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic location. Superior views. Wonderful bars restaurants right outside your door. Walking river trail was pretty and great for sight-seeing.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my gosh, the VIEW! The neighborhood! The battleship! We had a fantastic stay and loved the restaurants in walking distance, and strolling down the Riverfront. We had a glitch at check-in (nothing to do with the clear and detailed instructions). But Warren responded to my message in 2 minutes, and had it resolved quickly. It will probably never happen to anyone else, ever, but I mention it because it demonstrates Warren‚Äôs commitment to his guests. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent host with an impeccable property. The views were second to none. North to the Cape fear Memorial Bridge south to the battleship, North Carolina, and East with Long views of the Cape fear River."

Check in had a few extra steps but provided clear instructions which made check in smooth. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a wonderful time at Warren's. the best lication in historic downtown with a direct view of the old battle ship.not even the ballast hotel has that! it was 3 of us, my daughter slept on a couch for 4 nights without any complaints. everything was nice, clean and comfortable. the TVs are super small in the appartment with no netflix but obviously not a problem at all since sightseeing and exploring was our main goal. we had a great time in Wilmington and definitely plan on going back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Everything was clean and tidy and had everything we needed. It was a little like a scavenger hunt getting the key and going to room but wasnt awful. Once we parked we didnt have to go back to the vehicle because we walked everywhere, which is a good thing because had we have to go to the parking garage every time it would be a bit much. Not to the point it would keep us from coming back though. We had a great time. this place is close to everything downtown."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great except for me being a light sleeper. That‚Äôs not Warren‚Äôs fault.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The place was perfectly situated to where I needed to be, in town for a job, and the view from the patio is gorgeous. The stay was comfortable, the location ideal, and the host extra communicative and helpful.
Lot of smokers on their surrounding patios so being out on the patio was hit or miss, but that has nothing to do with the stay itself, which was great. PLEASE NOTE you have to have the parking pass to get out of the parking garage as well as in, I misunderstood and got stuck!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but great things to say about my stay, and Warren! The proactive communication was beyond helpful. Made check-in absolutely seamless.
The apartment itself was just as described. And from the moment I walked in, the smell of a freshly-cleaned space was evident, and it immediately set the tone. The price was affordable and the location (view!!üòç) is unparalleled.
I will absolutely take any opportunity to stay at this apartment, or any properties that Warren has without question. A+!!"

Make sure you watch the video for how to use the pass to get into the parking deck, but with that, it is very easy, and having a place to park downtown is so helpful for enjoying the area. Very close mini mart is super convenient for grabbing groceries. Great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pop‚Äôs Place was the perfect location to enjoy the many activities available in the historic downtown Wilmington area. There‚Äôs plenty to do within walking distance, however, beaches and more within 30 minutes of this central location.

The best part of this condo was the view!! It was absolutely breathtaking!! We had a front row view to the river and when the sun was setting it was just beautiful. There were so many shops and restaurants in walking distance of the condo which made it so convenient. It‚Äôs also only a 15 min drive to the beach.

The perfect alcove in Wilmington, with a perfect view of the river (and battleship!), and steps from Front Street‚Äôs dining, shopping, and everything else Wilmington has to offer. There can be a little sound bleed though from the live music of the restaurant in front of the building, but certainly not enough to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the apartment. Warren was a fantastic host, and proactively reached out to help guide us around some blocked streets due to the Azalea Festival. We had a great stay and will definitely be back!"

Warren was very communicative prior to our stay, making sure we had very clear instructions on checking in, parking, etc. He even included videos so we knew exactly how to use the lock box and parking garage! And the fact that this space was centrally located was amazing! We are originally from this area, so we had a list of familiar places we wanted to visit and this space was perfectly located. Warren also offered some recommendations to some new places that have opened since out last visit ‚Äúhome‚Äù. We will absolutely be back! Thank you, Warren, for a wonderful experience!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren was very accommodating. He got the place prepared quickly so I could check in early after my flight arrived. And since there was no guest the night after me, he allowed me to check out much later than scheduled, so I wouldn't need to go somewhere else to wait for my departure flight. Very helpful!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren was an incredible host and his condo exceeded our expectations. The view from the balcony was just breathtaking and quite literally directly across the river from the USS North Carolina. My fianc√© and I loved that Warren left a pair of binoculars out for us to view the ship from the balcony. We will most definitely add Warren‚Äôs place to our list of must-stays again when we are in the area.

This place is clean, comfortable and it has great views of the river and downtown Wilmington. We will definitely stay here again if we have the opportunity to vist in the future."
2022-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The beauty & location of the space is overridden by the rudeness and horrible host, Warren. Upon landing in Wilmington, Warren took to calling & texting me which I thought was initially to be helpful. He told me he would be sending videos to help with accessing the unit. Not once was it made clear that the videos are necessary to watch to access the space ‚Äì things that can all be explained in writing but he chooses not to.
When I sent a text asking a question, he called me and berated me for not watching all of the videos. He apologized via text for being ""blunt."" I let it go because I didn't want to mess with the good mood of the wedding I was in town for.
On the last day, 15 minutes after the scheduled checkout, I hear loud banging on the front door. There's Warren (looking nothing like his AirBnB photo) berating me in person for not allowing his cleaning crew to come in. Untrue. I asked him why he didn't just text me which he dismissed before huffing off. I left the key in the lockbox and left.
Later that evening, I get more texts from Warren accusing me of not having left the key. Accusing me of being a liar and causing problems for the next guests. He realized he was in the wrong but was hesitant to apologize. Would have loved to stay here again when visiting the area, but I'll pass. The host and his attitude makes it not worth it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Answered any questions I had right away, was great at communication! I had mentioned it was for my birthday weekend and he had a birthday balloon outside the door when we arrived! Will definitely be staying again if it is available when we come back to visit!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location right on the Cape Fear River. Wonderful views of the North Carolina battleship and surrounding area. It was nice and private and stocked with what was needed for our stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location can't be beat, and the apartment is comfortable and clean. Apartment is perfectly sized for a couple. The view from the west-facing living room balcony was ideal for watching beautiful sunsets over the river. We enjoyed walking on the scenic Riverwalk to get some exercise, and sitting on the balcony after an active day before heading out to a nearby restaurant for dinner. There are restaurants all along the Riverwalk and all over town, in walking distance. It was nice to have a parking spot in a garage a block away for when we ventured out (to play pickle ball in nearby Robert Strange park, plus we drove to scenic Southport, went to Wrightsville beach; it was even enjoyable driving up and down the city streets looking at all the pretty Victorian houses). The bed was comfortable, there was enough dresser and closet storage, the little kitchen was adequate, and there were convenient places to charge your phones. Oh, and there was tons of ice in the freezer, which was so considerate. Owner takes pride in the apartment and has thought of everything a traveler might need - so different from other AirBnBs that can be bare boned. There were things like toothpaste, hair products, etc, in case you forgot something, and also a first aid kit. There was a candy dish with peppermints that even included some sugar free ones. A convenience store is in very close walking distance, and there's also a bagel store downstairs from the apartment. There's a decent pizza place - the Mellow Mushroom - right next door. This AirBnB was a great value - highly recommend!"

Very easy to communicate with and his instructions for check in were so helpful. Condo was clean, and had everything we needed plus some."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit on an upper floor has a great view of the river. The location is perfect for exploring downtown or a day trip to the beach. Complimentary amenities (e.g. shampoo, coffee, even sunscreen) were greatly appreciated. Communication from Warren was timely and complete. Check in was easy, included parking was a bonus."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place to stay with a great view and lots to do in walking distance. The host is really communicative and makes the stay much easier.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Easy access into the building and parking is nearby.

Look forward to the next stay when we return to Wilmington!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren was a great host. The property and location was great and within walking distance to several restaurants,shops, etc. We had a wonderful time!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren‚Äôs place was exactly as advertised and met our expectations perfectly. We watched the 4th of July fireworks from balcony and it was awesome. Beautiful view of the Cape Fear and the Battleship.
Unit was very clean and comfortable. Location for walking around downtown is perfect. Parking included and easily accessible is a big plus for downtown stays. The few issues we had were promptly addressed and corrected and they were minimal! Will definitely return!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at countless Airbnb‚Äôs since 2014 and this is the first time I‚Äôve given a 5 star rating across the board.
Warren was helpful, communicative and so hospitable. His place is up to date, impeccably clean, located near everything and has an amazing view.
I highly recommend staying here and would book again the next time I‚Äôm in Wilmington."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, everything you need in the place provided by the exelent host Warren. Thank you Warren for a perfect stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! The communication was phenomenal. The view was nothing short of amazing! Also, the little things make a big difference. There was good coffee and real creamer, there were rugs beside the bed and in front of chairs on the balcony. It was very clean and organized. Warren helped us with local suggestions and sent video help for getting in to make sure everything went smoothly. I would definitely stay here again and absolutely recommend this place if you get a chance to stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best and cleanest Air b&b ive ever been to. Warren was the absolute best host. I cant tell you how many times we've been to rental properties and hotels and were very confused, didnt know how to access things, didnt know how to turn on things but warren made it super easy. When we first arrived he sent videos of how to access the parking garage, how to get the keys from the lock box, and how to get to the condo. When we walked in there were various sticky notes describing where to put everything and how to turn things on and off and if we had a question we could text him and get a reply almost instantly. This was the most stress free vacation we've ever had. Not to mention the location. Right on the bay across from the battle ship. The condo actually backs up to Shuckin Shack and Fat Tonys and is right beside mellow mushroom so we could go through the parking lot to get there. Very clean and convenient. We will definitely be booking again for later this year."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Warren is a top notch host and his place is THE spot to stay in Wilmy. Warren provides detailed instructions to make your stay go smoothly. The condo itself is simply perfect. The view is the best in town and the location can't be beat. The construction has moved farther down Water St and the new side walk area is fantastic. You are in walking distance of great shopping and dining and historic sites. The condo is clean and homey, perfect for a comfortable stay. This was my second of what I hope are many stays in this lovely condo."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location and great communication from owner Warren. He allowed us early check in and gave great instructions regarding check in and parking. Would def come back for a longer stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warren was a great host and went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable! The place was beautiful and super close to everything! 10/10 would recommend if you are looking for a place to stay in Wilmington!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is perfect, we loved the river view and being able to walk to restaurants and bars. Warren was an excellent host with great communication."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre going to Wilmington, this is the place to be! Warren is the most attentive and communicative host I‚Äôve ever dealt with on AirBnb..the check in process was quick and easy thanks to his detailed instructions (including videos), and if we had any issues with our room (we didn‚Äôt!), I have no doubt he would have responded right away. The condo was immaculate and comfortable with all kinds of amenities, and within easy walking distance to countless restaurants, breweries, and music venues. The balcony overlooks the river and was the perfect place for us to enjoy our morning coffee. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent host with easy and responsive communication. Maybe the best AirB&B host I've ever dealt with. Lots of great food and activity suggestions.
The unit itself has a fantastic location close to downtown with a terrific Cape Fear River view. You can see pelicans and other seabirds doing their thing from the balcony. Host helpfully provided binoculars.
Apartment is exactly as described. Fully stocked with towels, household items, enough kitchenware for basic meals. Easy to access the unit. Great to have covered parking 2-3 minute walk away in a nearby garage.
You will have to decide how comfortable you are with potential noise because there are likely to be revelers and loud cars even past midnight, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Fortunately, this is less of an issue in the bedroom itself which is set back farther from the street. Earplugs help. For us, the very convenient location was well worth the risk of extra noise and we ended up sleeping fine."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren is a fabulous host, great communication and easy check in/check out process. And the location was perfect for enjoying historic downtown area. We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Wilmington. Thanks for everything Warren!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where do I begin? This was a flawless stay! From the accurate and helpful directions that Warren sends to the cleanliness of the apartment and the gorgeous view. So many things to see and do around!
I won‚Äôt bore you with more details.
Book that place NOW!!!
Ps: Warren is a super cool host, attentive and with a nice sense of humor, hope we meet him in person next time!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. In the heart of the river walk /restaurants/bar area. Warren was a great host!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and view. Warren communicates very well, and the property was exactly what we expected. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warren was an awesome host who thought of everything to make my stay the best experience possible. The videos were soooo helpful! His warm Southern kindness is a pleasant find. This condo is right in the middle of everything Wilmington. I walked everywhere except to my Wrightsville Beach excursion. I traveled alone and felt safe in the area and in the condo. This is definitely a favorite and one I‚Äôd share with friends.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is everything you could want for downtown wilmington. Directly across from the battleship, private balcony with river views. Gorgeous sunsets. You will be hard to find a better place downtown."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren‚Äôs communication made check in/out an absolute breeze! Sitting right on the water with that beautiful sunset view was our favorite part. Restaurants/bars were close enough to walk to. Great experience. Thanks Warren!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful weekend in a prime location in downtown Wilmington! Convenient to literally everything, restaurants (we‚Äôre vegan and still found options), bars if you‚Äôre into that, shops, and even a grocery store within a block of the condo (DGX)! Warren is extremely attentive to detail and very much available if any issues arise (they did not for us). The view from the balcony out over the river is amazing and very calming. Better than any hotel room we could have found, with a much better location, and at a little better price. Strongly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warren is like the best friend that texts you back. His place is beautiful. His communication is perfect. You can just tell there's a lot of effort and passion going into the whole experience. And there's small touches throughout the place that just make you smile. Flowers on the balcony to catch the lovely view with the üòé. Location is perfect for exploring. I could go on. Thanks so much for everything!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What more can I say that hasn‚Äôt already been said. Warren is a great host and available at your call. The condo is perfectly located, nicely decorated with a comfy vibe, and an exceptional value. Bedding was very comfortable and that was a very nice surprise. Warren was very informative and excited to share his experiences of living in the area.
I had to travel solo at the last minute which made the trip a bit more challenging. I had an issue with the cable one evening so I called Warren to let him know and he was there within 30 minutes. We ended up having some nice conversation, sat out on the balcony and sipped on a few bourbons. Some good laughs and stories were exchanged.
I did not expect, nor would I expect my host to provide that level of service. I‚Äôd go as far as to call Warren a friend and I wish him nothing but the best.
Great time!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and communication! Would certainly come back again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren was at our disposal as we needed him, and was very prompt in his replies to us. Other people staying in the building were scrambling to get into the building, but Warren's instruction video was perfect. If you want to stay in Wilmington, there is no better location that will put you in the middle of everything. Thanks Warren!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Agree with all the other fabulous reviews of this place - excellent location & view, clean, comfy. Additional things not yet mentioned by others are that the wifi will support remote work. I had no trouble with video calls. And that the location felt quite safe to me as a solo traveler.
The gem, as others have mentioned, is the host. He prepares you well for what to expect, is incredibly responsive but not overbearing, and is just a delight to deal with. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren is a top tier airbnb host with a top tier Wilmington Condo. Warren sent videos for check-in which made it a painless process. The area is rather safe if you're experience in typical ""downtown"" setting, we walked nearly everywhere for 4 days.
My favorite part of the trip was simply having my morning coffee on the balcony or a late afternoon drink with the sunsetting before dinner. For the price of this stay it's really hard to find that value. The parking pass is a huge plus to not to have to worry about where your car is, or paying that additional cost.
Ton's of restaurants and bars right around town, 20 minutes from the beach. It was a great first trip to Wilmington."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great apartment right in downtown Wilmington. Easy to walk to all kinds of bars, restaurants and shops as well as being in the heart of historic Wilmington. The view of the battleship is truly awesome."

I highly recommend this location and will stay here again if it is available next time I am in the area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warren's unit will definitely be our first choice when we come to Wilmington again. Warren was a host beyond the call of duty and exceeded our expectations in many ways. He was a great introduction to our living permanently in Wilmington.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great rental in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, but parking in the garage was also a breeze.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a delightful stay in Warren's property. I used to live in Wilmy and trust me, this is THE location where you want to be. You can walk one block up for endless great dining opportunities, or down the River Walk for great dining AND shopping. Or if bars are your thing, there are plenty of those downtown as well. The property is just as pictured and described. It smelled so nice and clean and everything has been designed for comfort and ease. Great little extras as to what to do and see in Wilmington. That view is unmatched in downtown!
It's easy to enter the property with Warren's explicit explanations. He is SUCH an attentive host and communication is immediate and thorough. He even provides you with free parking in a parking garage 1 block away, which is so important when you are staying downtown. I found it safe and easy to park. The walk is literally a single block, in a safe and welcoming area on the river. Everything is provided. Warren even sent me videos of where and what I was doing on arrival. Such a super host.
I not only recommend this listing, but I've already re-booked!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren went above and beyond as a host. This is a fantastic location, he gave wonderful directions for checkin, and clears loves Wilmington!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Due to unforeseen last minute construction being done, we were unable to stay in Warren‚Äôs unit. However Warren went above and beyond to find us a unit 2 floors below his that we could use. The unit was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you Warren for making things happen the way you did. Hopefully next time we come to Wilmington we will be able to stay in your unit. David & Lois"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You cannot beat the location and views! Definitely would recommend for any couple visiting Wilmington
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb was simply fantastic. The view over the river is incredible, giving us the perfect look at the NC sunset every night. The shops and dining was a very short walk, as was the boardwalk.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As we approached Wilmington NC, Warren‚Äôs spidey-senses must have began tingling, because he was ready to accommodate our stay with directions, fun activities, and a little bit of humor.
Warren‚Äôs place overlooking the Cape Fear river was exactly what my wife and I were looking for our anniversary/tattoocation. This place was super clean and in walking distance of all the attractions of historic downtown Wilmington NC. We participated in a quizzo over some good local beers, hosted by a charming gentleman Travis, our first night in town. There were plenty of restaurants within a few blocks around the place. Being vegetarians (I know, I know) there were actually some options at most places we went. We even went on a ghost tour and found Warren‚Äôs place close enough to retreat to after getting the willy‚Äôsüëª Oh, and we got some great tattoos at Meow Meow as the coup de gr√¢ce.
I would absolutely book with Warren again, super nice dude who wants out of town folks to see how great his hometown can be."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Condo was exactly as advertised! Quaint, pretty, perfect! Warren is a gracious host, made sure check in was smooth, was there when we arrived in parking lot to make sure we knew where to park car, and he helped carry our luggage upstairs. Condo was immaculately clean, smelled fresh, decor nice artistic flair similar to the Wilmington vibe. Bed, couch, cozy comfortable! Husband loved recliner to watch football, bed mattress very good, perfect for sleeping in. Loved view of river and battleship. Everything you need walking distance, also Family Dollar around the corner

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I usually stay in a hotel when I visit my son in Wilmington but after staying at this beautiful and immaculate home - I don‚Äôt think I can ever go back to a hotel stay. My mother and sister joined me and it just felt like home. Thank you for sharing this little piece of heaven with us.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay here was terrific and we felt right at home. We rented the house for a week to get away, and it was also easy to work a bit at the desk downstairs. Very walkable to downtown, just a few blocks, with tons of great restaurants, bars, and breweries. The house was pristine. Loved the ability to log into TV apps. Hosts were extremely helpful and responsive. Only minor downside is outskirts of the neighborhood may feel slightly less desirable, but we felt perfectly safe at all times and the house is extremely well lit. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others looking for a terrific place to stay in Wilmington."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, new, clean, clever house that is walkable to nearby food and drink as well as Riverwalk/downtown Wilmington. Spacious and well illuminated at night. Super easy to let dogs out unleashed. No regrets."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home is immaculate and very well designed. Beds were extremely comfortable. Close to the Riverwalk area. We brought our dog so it was nice to have the small fenced yard. Our only issue was the digital lock on the front door but the host promptly addressed the issue. Would definitely recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time!
The house was perfect and just as described in the listing.
Pet friendly, so the FurBaby could come as well, that was a big plus for me.
Everything was close by. We chose a different beach every day just because of the close proximity to the house.
The house was very well stocked with anything you might need or could ask for.
I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was hands-down THE best AirBNB experience I‚Äôve ever had. I will certainly be back to Wilmington & I now I have a place to stay. It was simply the best in all ways. Thank you! PS: The dog house was an added bonus & the rocking chairs on the front porch!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful house and easy walking distance to all of downtown Wilmington. Pup loved the doghouse.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay - the hosts are so kind and responsive. Their place is so beautiful and they have so many amenities which was really nice. The fenced yard for our dog was so nice when we all wanted to sit outside. The place itself was very clean and so comfortable. The only downside is checkin is at 4 which is a little late in my opinion but it seems like that is the standard for the area, and the drive to the beach took about 20-25 minutes to get to Carolina beach and Wrightsville. The river walk/the downtown area is so cute and fun and is about a 20 minute walk which isn‚Äôt bad. Overall we loved our stay and would recommend to stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was perfect, we loved the house and really appreciated the fully fenced yard for the dog. When coming to Wilmington again, this house will be our first choice! Thank you for thinking of everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and would highly recommend for anyone who is wanting to stay in the area! Walking distance to restaurants, bars and coffee shops"

Comfortable and well-stocked kitchen and bathrooms with lots of thoughtful extras. Comfy beds. Extra towels, blanket and sheets. Ready for doggies. This host thought of everything. Would stay again and recommend without hesitation."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay here with our two Aussies and was awesome! From the dog accommodations to the abundance of essentials all labeled and neat‚Ä¶this place felt like we were right at home! We especially enjoyed the front porch. Will definitely stay here again!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is AMAZING! Absolutely gorgeous!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and our fur babies had a great weekend here! The fenced yard was a huge plus for us and the home was very clean with thoughtful measures like waters in the fridge and a phone charger in the bedroom. We also loved being walking distance to downtown, 15-20 minutes to the river walk and even had some restaurants less than 5 minutes walk as well. Overall we had a lovely stay and would be happy to visit again! Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely fantastic: immaculately cleaned, tastefully decorated, and great location.
We would definitely recommend this and use it again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space in quaint neighborhood and great location! The hosts were lovely and responsive. Would absolutely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pros: We really enjoyed ourselves! Most unique experience we have ever had! We did not have to contact the host for anything during our stay. However, the instructions were clear and sent in a timely manner! I would/will definitely book again!
Cons: We feel the price is quite expensive for one night (we paid $759). Understandably, it IS an experience, however not for the price.
Also, the cleaning fee should be relaxed down to around $50-$100. There are marks in various places on the wall, the ottoman still showed rings from maybe a previous stay, the chair in the living room when you walk in and ottoman upstairs were both not clean. For the cleaning fee to be included, the house keeping services team should pay closer attention to detail when it comes to cleanliness.
Also, we believe that taking out the trash and placing towels/wash cloths in certain areas is great, however, stripping the bed should not be our responsibility- that is apart of housekeeping.
Again, amazing experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I traveled to the boat house for our anniversary and had a wonderful time. Directions was spot on and instructions to get in were great. If you do travel here I do recommend a cart to pull your things in because the parking lot is gravel and you do have to walk to the boat houses. Other than that you have to visit the boat houses because you will not be disappointed. We will be coming back only this time with the family.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Celebration. We booked to have a date night and enjoy a concert at the Live Oak Pavilion. The house is beautiful with excellent craftsmanship and better than the pictures. The location was just what we needed, walkable to both the concert and nearby great local restaurants. We will absolutely book again, hopefully this time with better weather so we can enjoy the deck more!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Celebration is a Beautiful place. My husband and I fell in love with this home as soon as we opened the doors. The decor was amazing. The place was clean from top to bottom. I felt at home. It was very relaxing.Looking forward to the next stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very rarely has a place exceedingly our expectations and the Celebration at The Cove did! We arrived and when we walked in immediately said, ""Wow, this is beautiful!"" It smelled brand new, looked fresh and clean and the outside upper balcony was the best! We brought so much to prepare a nice Mexican meal with Margaritas on the upper balcony and having a sink, electricity and a dining table was something we knew we needed. The breeze from the water was perfect so from breakfast coffee to dinners and drinks at night we loved this area. We walked to a nice dinner one night and to a coffee shop one morning and felt safe and easy to find. The other guests checking in were all so nice and happy to be there like we were. I love this houseboat concept and it delivered! I already booked my birthday weekend to come back. Five stars!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. I was very happy on how smooth the checkin process was initiated. The house boat had everything that was needed and more. I will definitely make this place a annual staycation.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A friend of mine and I came to NC to visit a mutual friend of ours and the three of us chose to take a day away and go to the beach. We had booked a previous Airbnb and had somehow mixed up dates and had booked for a later date. We were about 15min from town by the time we realized and needed to book something quickly. We found this Airbnb and fell in love with the look and view! We booked it and Erin responded quickly and also allowed accommodations for late check-out! We had an amazing experience and the place was absolutely gorgeous! The views are incredible! We hope to come back and stay longer in the future! Definitely worth booking!

Overall it was a great place to stay! Would definitely stay there again or recommend to a friend."

From the moment I stepped on board, I was impressed by its pristine condition‚Äîit was exactly as described and even better in person. The serene atmosphere made for a peaceful and relaxing getaway, with every detail contributing to a truly enjoyable experience.
The houseboat provided a unique opportunity to unwind and soak in the beautiful surroundings, surrounded by calm waters and picturesque views. It was evident that great care was taken to ensure guests' comfort and satisfaction.
I must say, the experience was absolutely worth every penny. If you're looking for a tranquil retreat that offers both comfort and charm, this houseboat is the perfect choice. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable staycation or getaway. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time for our double anniversaries with us and my brother and sister in law. The interior was so pretty with a fully stocked beautiful kitchen with coffee, cream, sugar for our mornings. The two living rooms were so comfy and a great place to hang out and visit. Bedrooms and baths pristine and comfortable. The cherry on top was the upstairs deck with cushioned couch and chairs, dinining table and chairs. It was a sunny weekend with mild temps which made this our favorite place to hang out and entertain some friends and family who stopped by to visit and enjoy mimosas. The sun felt so good on a January weekend, it was hard to leave to walk to lunch/and or dinner. But walk we did on the lovely Riverwalk which took us to shops, restaurants and a Dollar Store. Everything was so convenient! We absolutley loved our weekend at the Cove and will go back and enjoy another one in the future!!"

A/C was cold, air movement was 100%, wi-fi was fast, bed and furniture extremely comfortable. Excellent location.

My only constructive criticism is that the mattress could be replaced. Unfortunately I found it to be really uncomfortable for a few reasons which would impact me coming back. But truly it was a great stay‚Äîif I could give 4.9 stars instead of 4 I would."

Both hosts were responsive pre-stay and allowed for an early checkin which was helpful for set up of all the supplies. The units are exactly as described and very beautiful. There was a bottle of wine waiting in each unit which was a very nice gesture.

Just clean up after yourself well. If you rent the 3 bedroom it is a walk-up. We loved that. The balcony is pretty peaceful and enjoyable. The river walk is nearby and plenty of shops to visit and check out downtown. If you are looking for a place near the river walk this is a great place to stay.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely fantastic find! This unit is half of an upstairs/downstairs duplex. We had a large group so we booked both units. The place has obviously been recently renovated and was pristine clean and well appointed with nice furniture and COMFORTABLE BEDS! The Keurig with several varieties of coffee/creamer/sugars was an added bonus that made mornings fun and easy. The purpose of our trip was to explore the historic downtown district, be within walking distance and this location NAILED IT. Steven really was a responsive ‚Äúsuper host!‚Äù From the moment of booking through checkout he made sure we were set and didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything. We communicated a couple times pre-stay and he sent the electronic door codes early and allowed a super early check-in. There was a nice bottle of wine on the counter and small bottle of fresh milk in the fridge. He checked on us after the first night to make sure we were good and allowed a late check out. We highly recommend staying here."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"How grateful to have found Steven's remarkable home in Wilmington! From the very first communication, Steven was responsive, personable, and made our stay such a pleasure. Every detail in the beautiful historic home has been thoughtfully planned out anticipating any needs guests might have. We especially enjoyed the expansive second floor balcony with the comfy seating while we sipped wine, and Chandler's Wharf is only a couple blocks away - easy walkable (waterfront restaurants galore). Comfortable beds, lush bedding, tv's in every bedroom, all the kitchen essentials - no detail left undone. Thank you Steven for your generous hospitality, the welcome goodies, and sincerely for making this one of the most memorable girls weekend getaways ever. We are so honored to have been the first guests to enjoy your lovely home. HIGHLY recommend - you won't be disappointed."

We cooked a big dinner and sat out on the patio."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luxurious home with amazing amenities. Close to everything to everything we wanted to do and there was a great coffee table book selection.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Charles place was a perfect spot for my wife and I. We absolutely loved that it was walkable to everything downtown. The place looks better than the pictures. We brought our noise machine because the highway is close and can be loud at times. We would recommend this house to anyone.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Air B&B was in the perfect spot right in downtown Wilmington! Walking distance to several great restaurants and bars and only 20 minutes away from wrightsville beach! Charles was very responsive and the space was clean and welcoming!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and clean space: beautifully designed and decorated. The kitchen is HUGE and the grill is a plus as well. Loved our stay in the gorgeous historic district!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary by staying in this wonderful Airbnb in Wilmington, NC, and we couldn't be happier with our choice. The home itself was not only beautiful, with tastefully decorated interiors and a cozy ambiance, but also impeccably clean, which made our stay exceptionally comfortable.
What truly set our experience apart were the hosts. Their warmth and hospitality made us feel more like old friends or family than guests. They were very friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed, demonstrating professionalism and a commitment to excellence in how they run their Airbnb.
The amenities and special touches, from luxurious linens to a well-equipped kitchen, were appreciated and utilized. The location was also ideal, offering easy access to local attractions while providing a quiet, peaceful retreat for relaxation.
I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Wilmington. We are already looking forward"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, comfortable space. The location was walkable to area restaurants and shops. Would üíØ stay there again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost, the airbnb was great. We loved the vibe, it was really spacious, awesome bathroom, nice big bed, the AC worked great at cooling down, the kitchen was really nice and was stocked with whatever you would need to cook a nice meal, the outside area was nice for chilling out.
But man, the noise from the road across the street (there‚Äôs an exit ramp for the highway literally right across from the house) at times it was really loud. Between trucks, people with muscle cars or even the occasional boat horn, it was difficult to relax at times. As the night went on the noises lessened but that was at like 11:30pm. So if you‚Äôre someone who likes to get to bed early then my suggestion would be bring a white noise machine or something to help drowned out the noise or look elsewhere. It really would make me think twice about booking here again.
Once again, the place itself is fantastic, it‚Äôs just I want to include all aspects of our stay in my review."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The house was newly renovated and very clean.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WONDERFUL place to stay! Not only was it gorgeous, but there were no issues and everything was perfect. Would easily stay there again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect dream of a stay, my only complaint is that it ended--I could've moved right in. Perfect oasis of a bathroom, felt like a spa, walk in dressing area, laundry, tv, comfortable bed, nice outside seating area and indoor breakfast nook and a perfect kitchen. Living room couch is a little small but fine for me as a single traveler (comfortable for 3, not more).
Thank you!!"

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place to stay that was secluded and felt very luxurious. From the kitchen to the bathroom, and the bedroom too all felt like they were out of an interior designer‚Äôs dream with all the premium options! The only negative thing I could say about this listing is the noise from the nearby streets. But altogether a lovely home that we would put an offer on if it were for sale!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying here and it was just as good as last time. Felt right at home and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Wilmington themselves.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Home is redesigned to perfection. Felt very comfortable and at home. Only thing is you better shower together because hot water doesn‚Äôt last long (common in older homes). Love what they‚Äôve done with the place and recommend to everyone!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough about this place!! BEST airbnb we have ever stayed by far!!! The attention to design details, the extra special touches, cleanliness and walkable location were only a few of the amazing things about this place. Do NOT hesitate to book! You won't regret it! We will be back for sure!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here made my stay in Wilmington amazing. The place exactly matched the photos and was picture perfect, had everything I needed, and felt right at home. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting to visit wilmington and are looking for a great place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most perfect Airbnb I have ever stayed at! This place looks exactly like the pictures too - it was genuinely perfect. It‚Äôs in a great location and super close/walking distance to downtown. Only 20 minutes to the beach as well. There‚Äôs the most amazing restaurant called Oliverio that‚Äôs a block away (about a 3-4 min walk) that Charles suggested and it was absolutely fantastic!!
I will 100% be coming back to stay here when I come back to Wilmington :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was fantastic as the lovely home has a grand master bedroom and bathroom. It was very comfortable, and in my opinion, you could fit a bigger crowd. I would recommend and if I come back to Wilmington, this is the first home I'm looking for."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our special getaway when we need some time to just unwind, read, watch movies, and sleep in! We really enjoyed walking to downtown and the house was as perfect as it was the first time we visited. Thank you so much for hosting us for a peaceful and relaxing stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Even ones with really nice pictures end up to be all show with nothing underneath when you get there, but not this one. Everything looked lovely but the furnishings were comfortable and useful, there were nice surprises (a shower where you can set the temperature to the exact degree!), and the ""well stocked"" kitchen truly was well stocked. I could easily have stayed there for weeks without needing to bring extras. Was particularly happy with the cookware, as I often want to cook during a stay and usually have a rough time with poor quality appliances and poor quality cookware. But everything here really was great, cookware as good as what I have at home.
Location is great, short walk to downtown, easy drive to the beach. Literally only negative note I have is that if you're a light sleeper, the trucks on the highway can get a little loud so bring earplugs. I never noticed the noise at other times, though."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and surrounding area exceeded our expectations! Highly recommend!

My wife and I took a weekend away for her birthday and wanted to be walkabout to downtown. Loved, we were only about 5 blocks away. The property is recently renovated, all the right materials were used and the design looks like a magazine. The host was quick to respond and very proactive. We'll be staying again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place looked really good, only wish the shower would stay hot longer. Instructions really clear and very beautiful place."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% enjoyed my stay. I felt right at home tucked away on the end of a quite street with an amazing view. Zen is well appointed and very charming. The kind of place that make you look at Zillow and fantasize about your own second home :) Thanks, Pam."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. We enjoyed lots of kayaking on the inner coastal using Pam‚Äôs kayaks provided. The drive into town is quick and beaches are not too far away. The immediate neighborhood is quiet and great for evening walks. There is even a decent restaurant just down the road at the marina. Highly recommend this location.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little cottage with a gorgeous view. Well equipped kitchen, we were able to cook most meals in the Airbnb with no issues. Looks like the pictures and easy check in, definitely keeping this place in mind for the next time I‚Äôm in Wilmington!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zen is a good description - we enjoyed the peaceful setting and looking out over the water way. Away from the hustle of town but close enough to get anywhere you need fairly quickly. It was perfectly located for all we wanted to do.
Hosts were helpful and responsive.
Would stay again if we come this way."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were a group of three women who came to run The Southern Tour Ultra. The house was super convenient to the race but was a place we‚Äôd come back to for a fun weekend in the area. The view, especially sunrise, was incredible. The house is cozy and so cute! It was very cold so no outdoor activities (other than running 30 miles:) but it looks like it would be so fun in the warmer months. We ate a Pho restaurant which was a short drive, same for coffee Sunday morning. Loved this place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This property boasts incredible views over the marshes and ocean...perfect for watching sun rises and birds. Pam was communicative and very helpful during our stay, which was helpful.
A vehicle is necessary to see downtown Wilmington, with all its shops and restaurants, as the property is located at the end of a quiet road.
Overall, if you're looking for a quiet home base to stay while exploring Wilmington, this property is a wonderful option."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful peaceful stay. Waking up to the sunrise come up from the water was simply breathtaking! It was a good evening to take the kayaks out on the water and simply relax. Highly recommend and will definitely be looking forward to more stays!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful cottage was all we expected and more. From the moment you walk in the view of the intracoastal takes your breath away. The place is comfortable, cozy and peaceful. Wether on the deck or the pier, watching the ever-changing spectacle of nature was just the way we wanted to spend this last week of 2023. There are plenty of amenities nearby, like grocery stores, and it‚Äôs about 20 minutes to the historic center. The Abbey Nature Preserve is just a couple of minutes away and provided a wonderful place for a full afternoon walk.
We highly recommend this home. In fact, we already have."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 3rd time staying at the cottage. The area is peaceful, relaxing and a great place to get out on the water. The cottage is neat and clean. Pam is a great hostess that truly cares that her guest enjoy their stay."

Pam is responsive host. She assisted us regarding a tropical storm forecast for the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"HoriZen is a perfect name for Pam's waterfront cottage. Cozy, cute, and comfortable; everything we needed was there. The beauty and peacefulness made us never want to leave. We look forward to a return trip soon."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam‚Äôs place was truly amazing. I stayed here with my husband and mom while visiting my son at UNCW. We loved waking up to the spectacular sunrise over the marsh and watching the birds and fish from the dock. I would 100% stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at this peaceful, cozy cottage in the marsh of the inter coastal waterway! Although we only had a couple days, it was perfect to relax and unwind while watching the beautiful sunrises! The kayaks were a hit as well as fishing off the dock! Something different than staying oceanfront on the beach (although it is a quick and easy drive to get to) and we loved it!! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing spot to stay and watch amazing sunrises over the water!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a a great space , and best views around . Felt right at home , in this cozy environment , and loved the pier/ floating dock. Plenty of fishing , and beautiful weather . Hope to come again !"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"HoriZen was a dream. On a dead end street right along the Intracoastal Waterway, what more could you ask for. The cottage had a lovely charm to it, everything we needed to be comfortable and provided the perfect getaway for my partner and I."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The water front place was great! Everything we wanted and more!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was the perfect host and HoriZen was amazing. Can‚Äôt beat the marsh and Intercoastal views. Great dock that was perfect for watching the beautiful sunrise, Herons, otters and more. Kitchen had everything you need and furniture was nice + comfortable.
We‚Äôll be back
Larry and Susan"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hoped for a peaceful place in which to chill for a weekend, and we got it in spades.

Perfect."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing views, highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything about this place exceeds expectations! The view, the wildlife, the fishing, the peaceful neighborhood, the short drive to beautiful beaches and local attractions. We were able to get out as a family using the canoe and double kayak and fished off the dock every day. 5 stars isn't enough for Pam's very special place!! We can't wait to return."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The cottage and it‚Äôs surroundings were absolutely beautiful. Made me want to move to North Carolina! We will be backüòé
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're regular world travelers and stay in Airbnb properties 95% of the time. This property is a real find. It's located away from the hustle/bustle of Wilmington, nestled against a quiet nature area, and in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. The views of the ICW, coastal islands, and ocean are spectacular. The interior is comfortable and provides everything that you'll need. A tandem kayak was available to us, and, as experienced boaters, we were comfortable cruising through the marshes and enjoying the osprey, turtles, egrets, herons, crabs, and fish. For those who are not familiar with boating, be mindful of the tides, currents, and recreational boaters in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed every minute of our stay at Pam's Place. The cottage was well taken care of and clean. The view from the back was beautiful and we enjoyed peaceful mornings and evenings together watching the tide and boats come and go. The location was great from everything we did during our visit, but far enough away that we weren't bothered by passing cars. We would definitely love coming back if we find ourselves in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exactly what our family was looking for, Pam was a great host! Looking forward to staying again.
Very peaceful location!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is perfect for getting away, enjoying the view and relaxing.
Everything in the cottage is neat & clean‚Ä¶.. will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful. Everything was clean when we arrived and it was very easy to get in. They had a guide book with recommendations of surrounding restaurants and other places. I would definitely recommend this place and host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, quiet place. Great place to take off and do work there with the beautiful scenery or take time off and relax. Amazing choice of CLEAN beaches nearby and an overall 10/10 experience. Nice people in this area and plenty to do."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely incredible! We enjoyed kayaking around the channel and sitting on the deck watching the moonrise every night!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of my favorite Airbnb properties in the world. We‚Äôve stayed in great Airbnbs all over Europe (including a castle in Ireland) but Horizen is our fav. The cabin is impeccably decorated. Nothing overly luxurious but pitch perfect for the surroundings. Pam is also a great host. She‚Äôs helped me deliver flowers for an anniversary here. However this property is really all about the location. Spectacular views, especially for sunrise, and a convenient place to launch your kayak (which Pam provides kayaks and canoes for up 6 people). It‚Äôs only a 30min paddle over to Figure 8 island which is a great spot to picnic and/or swim. This is a magical place to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos that accompany this listing don't do justice to the place: the view is incomparable -- you can see all the way to Figure Eight Island and spot **waves breaking on the beach** between Figure Eight and the island just north of it, all from the comfort of your living room and cozy deck. The wildlife at the cottage is amazing: everything from the ""everyday"" (cardinals, bluebirds, squirrels) to the exotic (hummingbirds, ospreys, egrets, herons, hawks, and dolphins). You can't look away from it. The cottage itself is so nicely decorated and furnished; comfortable and cozy and perfection. We had a wonderful time and wish we could have extended our stay. Pam was also the best to work with and did us a huge favor, something she didn't have to do, for which we're so grateful. We're so thankful to have found this place and will be back, for sure."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit and it was just as comfortable, peaceful and relaxing as we remembered. The cottage is equipped with everything you need for cooking, relaxing, kayaking, and just enjoying the view. We spent most of our time on the lovely porch‚Äîbreakfast and coffee, reading, watching the boats and wildlife (so many birds!), and wine in the evenings. The kayaks and life preservers are much appreciated. The sunrise is spectacular if you‚Äôre up early enough! Pam is an excellent, responsive host, and we hope to return again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place!! Will stay here again! Tastefully decorated. Cooked in a few times and had everything we needed! Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little home for 4 people. Photos are accurate but do not capture just how beautiful the view is. Exceeded my expectations!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was great, quirky and very cute just the way we like! We loved all of the nature right beside us. It was also in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. We would love for you to host us again.
Thank you..."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The HoriZen was a unique and memorable Airbnb experience due to the view and location. Pam was very responsive and accessible. I would recommend this place to anyone!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great get away. Lovely location. Beautiful two days in February.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Pam was a great host and very communicative. It‚Äôs nice to have the entire place by yourself and it‚Äôs a very quiet and peaceful area. Zen is a reality here!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We ALWAYS love our stay at Pam's cottage on the Intercoastal - it's a perfect getaway for my daughter and I! The size of the cottage is perfect for the two of us and the sunrises are amazing! Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house and location is perfect for a quiet getaway. It is located between Wilmington/Wrightsville and Topsail on a dead end street.
It is quiet, cozy and full of character as this home was built in 1947. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and balance the old wooden floors, walls and ceilings.
There is a wall of glass that face the water and the views are amazing. None of the photos capture how beautiful it is.
You will not be disappointed and most likely fall in love with this place as soon as you walk inside."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this peaceful oasis! Beautiful views you just have to see to believe! Welcoming interior of this quaint cottage.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding accommodations and breathtaking surroundings! We loved everything about this off-the-beaten-path location on the waterway. This charming nook is full of surprises! Booking this cottage will be on our calendar again and again. Highly recommend for a romantic getaway, sisterhood bonding time, mother-daughter adventure, a solo excursion, outdoor lovers, kayakers, canoeing enthusiasts, photography buffs and fishing fans. It‚Äôs got a little bit of everything you‚Äôd want by the water!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a little getaway between Christmas and New Years, and was immediately drawn to the location of Pam's place. When I arrived I walked straight past the front entry of the house and down to the dock to stare at the water. This is one of the prettiest locations you'll find in the entire area, and you can literally see across the Intracoastal and marshes without a building in sight, all the way to the ocean. The cottage is perfectly sized with nice upgrades yet still has that rustic at home feel. This neighborhood is incredibly quiet and the cottage is at the end of the street adjacent to woodlands. The sunrise here is breathtaking. DO NOT HESITATE to stay at Pam's place and I can't wait to go back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was nice and cozy and view was perfect. Was clean and very comfortable.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is beautiful and the unit is very comfortable and quiet. Just what we wanted for a getaway weekend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is paradise.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved every minute of it and hope to be back soon!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a long weekend at Pam's place just to take a break from life, and I believe we found a great spot. It is right on the intracoastal waterway with nice estuarine views and even ocean views in the distance. It is at the end of the road so there is only one neighbor, so it is very quiet. Much of he character of the cottage is still intact with just enough modern touches to make it more comfortable. We did venture out to Topsail for a stroll on the beach, and down to Wrightsville Beach for their Oystertoberfest, but the best part was just sitting on the deck with our morning coffee and afternoon beverages. We grilled out Saturday and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. I fished both off the dock as well as taking my kayak out (Pam does provide kayaks but I brought my own fishing kayak), and did catch a few fish, and also saw a couple dolphin cruising the waterway. If you're looking for a quiet cozy cottage with a view, you won't go wrong with Pam's place."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Pam‚Äôs house is in a beautiful setting, right on the ICW. Pam is easy to communicate with, always responding to any questions promptly. The house was very clean and comfortable. Self entrance and exit couldn‚Äôt be easier. Phone reception is only fair."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you to Pam for being a great host of the HoriZen cottage! We had a wonderful family weekend and enjoyed every minute of our stay. My husband and son enjoyed fishing off the pier, and out of our canoe. I really enjoyed watching all the birds-- snowy and great egrets, great blue herons, ospreys, pelicans, kingfishers, & cormorants! We also saw 2 otters, and dolphins swimming in the intracoastal waterway. The back deck is a wonderful place to watch the sun rise in the mornings.
The house was perfect and the check in/check out procedure was well communicated. Highly recommended!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at this cottage right in the ICW. Very nice renovation with a lot of fun decorative details. Pam is a great host with quick communication to any questions. Would highly recommend!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was even better than we expected. Gorgeous setting, very cute with all the comforts of home.
We are big birders and saw all kinds of birds including a bald eagle! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a great little gem of a place. You can not beat the absolutely beautiful view at all times of the day. The cottage was perfectly appointed for a couple to enjoy this natural setting. I especially enjoyed kayaking around the Inland waterway as It parallels the natural preserve adjacent to the property. Peaceful and restorative.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This vacation was our first week long time away in 5 years! We so enjoyed our time exploring and relaxing the Wilmington, Wright‚Äôs like and topsail areas. Pam‚Äôs cottage was the perfect place to rest and spend time with family - the views were amazing - we look forward to visiting again. Pam went above and beyond to make our time there perfect."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is even more inviting than the listing! It is located in such a peaceful spot, but with access to many shops and restaurants. We loved having our morning coffee on the water and watching the dolphins swim by. I would highly recommend this home for its tranquility and reminder to appreciate everything."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The description did not disappoint. The cottage was charming and clean, with generous amenities. LOVE the stainless steel prep table and use of the canoe/kayaks. The outdoor area on the water side was lovely, with a spacious deck overlooking the spectacular inter coastal waterway. We enjoyed a tranquil breakfast and reading every morning, surrounded by nature; listening to the birds sing and watching the boats ride by. There was even a dolphin siting our last morning there. Pam, our host was great, and responded almost immediately to all of our questions, which was much appreciated.
Thank you for making our stay so special!
The Sterns"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was quiet and really relaxing with great views of the intercostal.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage on the ICW is perfectly comfortable, quaint, and stylish.

This cottage was so peaceful and serene‚Ä¶it was hard to leave behind."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most unique and cool AirBNB around Wrightsville. You can't beat the incredible views of the intercoastal! If you're considering multiple places for your stay and this one's still available - book it, you'll be so glad you did."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A little slice of Heaven is all I can think of to describe this cottage.
It may be small, but it‚Äôs full of charm and character. We enjoyed
sitting on the porch watching the boats go by with the dolphins tagging along.
It is a perfect spot for meditation and reflection.
It has a feeling of seclusion, although it is in a neighborhood.
A very quiet neighborhood.
It‚Äôs a sweet little cottage with a million dollar view! I would and will be renting this cottage again! Pam is a great host and very helpful."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam‚Äôs cottage was a wonderful romantic getaway for my boyfriend and I! The cottage views were beautiful to wake up to every morning. You truly can‚Äôt beat the view! Cottage was very peaceful and quiet. Just the weekend we needed!
The downtown area is about 25-30 minutes away, which had amazing restaurants and shops. We suggest renting a car if you‚Äôre flying in from the Wilmington airport.
If we ever come back to Wilmington, we would definitely stay here again! üòä"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is lovely and the views are amazing. One of our favorite places we stayed in. Very relaxing, but plenty to do for the one that does not want to rest. We will definately be back"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Just as pictured. Very clean and comfy. Neighbors are quiet but friendly. Perfect location from town and nearby beaches - about a 30 minute drive to beaches. Grocery store and dollar store 15 minutes down the road. Great views from inside and out on the deck/dock. We saw dolphins one morning. The canoe/kayak was a nice touch! Fantastic place to take your family. Beds were comfortable and the open concept made it family friendly. Would definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely home with a spectacular view!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We found Pam's place to be clean, spacious, and fully stocked with everything we needed. The furniture and beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed the front room which overlooked the intercoastal. Looks of pretty herons to see every day.
It was nice to be close to the beach yet be able to come back to our quiet and beautiful space. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely view! The kayaks were a nice amenity. We made good us of them. It‚Äôs a thirty minute drive to Wilmington and the beach if you are wanting to visit those places.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I stayed at Pam's cottage for our anniversary weekend and it was exactly what we were looking for. The view off the back deck is magical- and I highly recommend waking up early to catch the sunrise. We enjoyed fishing off the dock, relaxing on the deck, and enjoyed watching the herons in the marsh. The views go on for days. The cottage was exceptionally clean and the living room/kitchen area was so comfortable to relax in after a day at the beach. We definitely plan on returning."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable beach cottage with the most calming view I could imagine. Perfectly decorated-we will be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I went for our 10 year anniversary. We had an amazing time. We fished a lot off the dock. Then relaxed and enjoyed the view.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and had the best time! The cottage was easy to get to, homey, and beautiful. We loved hearing the rain on the roof and enjoying the beautiful sunroom and porch. The dock was great for fishing and just hanging out on. We had a great time!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great cabin! It's bright and airy and a very efficient use of space. The location right on the ICW is gorgeous and convenient. We brought our own kayaks and paddled through the marshes out to the bird sanctuary and some of the sandbars-- it was otherworldly. When we returned, pretty exhausted, the house was the perfect place to veg out to the sounds and the beautiful views on the deck. We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful view!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and open space! We loved this house and location, we paddled out towards figure 8 and saw some amazing wildlife including live sand dollars, several huge conch, and dolphins jumping out of the water on the waterway, but paddling against the current isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart so make sure you plan your time right and have plenty of water.
Also it‚Äôs a small thing but I hate living out of a suitcase so we really appreciated that the closet (with hangers) and dresser were open for use.
We definitely plan on coming back!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice stay. Nothing special as far as the house itself goes, but the view was great. The cottage is certainly old and although it has been renovated it still shows it age, mainly the bathroom. As mentioned it‚Äôs probably not good for small kids as there is no bathtub, but never felt unsafe in there for them though as we traveled with with a 3 and 1 year old. Certainly not a 5 star luxury resort, but good value for the money. I‚Äôd recommend for a single couple looking for a quiet place to stay. We did get to see dolphins one morning and enjoy the lunar eclipse one evening. Didn‚Äôt spend much time at the cottage as we were out and about everyday, but I‚Äôd be fine staying there again if we came back to the area. Location was convenient for the activities that we had planned."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing short of extraordinary. The view speaks for itself. If you can get yourself inside, the home is cozy with a full kitchen, smart tv, comfortable bed rooms. Also close to the beaches! Pam is responsive and answered all my questions during my stay. Highly recommended!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views! Perfect for our long weekend. Proximity to everything is great and local marina eatery in walking distance. Bird watching was top notch too!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect little place with an amazing view! We enjoyed taking the kayak out.. there is a nice area next to the house that is away from all the boats. We look forward to visiting again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of Air Bnb‚Äôs, and this by far was my favorite. It was a great place to get away for a few days. Very private with a gorgeous view, it was everything we could have wanted and more. I loved going to layout on the dock and reading on the deck. Also loved the quaint cottage with a modern vibe inside. Perfect place to watch tv on the couch and cook a great meal. If you‚Äôre debating between this house and another, definitely choose this one!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The best views! Comfortable space! Relaxing vibes! Terrific host!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place! Location is excellent and the cottage is light, airy and very comfortable. We brought our kayaks and launched them right off the dock. We hope to become regulars."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage, well sited with great views from inside. Plenty of big windows. Modern kitchen, comfortable furniture. Kayaks provided daily trips up the intracoastal and out to Topsail island. Clean modern pier. With a large wilderness to the north there are many native birds who sit on the porch and stare at you. A peaceful and comfortable retreat."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Incredible views and great cottage!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage with everything you need for the perfect getaway.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is very relaxing and scenic, looks exactly like it does in the photos. The location is great and Pam provided lots of info before we arrived. Would definitely book again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This charming cottage is comfortable, clean and well maintained. The location has beautiful, expansive views of the intracoastal waterway. Sunrises and abundant wildlife can be enjoyed from the sunroom and deck. The cottage is private and peaceful, yet close to shopping, restaurants and not far from Wrightsville and Topsail beaches. Pam is a wonderful host, very responsive and helpful."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a gem. Amazing views and such a cute place.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an easy check-in at Pam‚Äôs cozy cottage. We enjoyed waking to the most amazing sunrise along the intracoastal and watched the peaceful wild life while having lunch on the deck. The place is so cute and comfortable. The rooms were clean. The bathroom is small, but workable. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and it was nice to have restaurants and other stores a close drive. A nice dock for fishing and bench to just relax. We highly recommend it for a peaceful get away and we hope to return to explore the area more."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Views from indoors are accurately described and amazing. Interior is cozy and nicely renovated. Location is convenient to shopping, restaurants, and just a few miles from Wilmington. Weather kept us from enjoying the deck or kayaks/canoes, but we plan to return in warmer months to take advantage."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam‚Äôs cottage is one of the most beautiful stays we‚Äôve ever had! Pictures do not do this place justice. I felt like we were in a Monet painting or Nicholas Sparks book! Even in the frost and cold we managed to enjoy every piece of the property. If you‚Äôre thinking of booking just do it, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You pull down the street past large, pretentious houses until you reach this quaint cottage at the end. You walk up onto the deck and you are mesmerized by the view, which is also available the entire time you are inside (if you can make yourself go inside)! The interior layout is perfect for hanging out and cooking and the 2 bedroom and one bath are clean and comfortable. The dock is easily accessible and there is a canoe and kayaks available (and the water is right there). We have stayed 2 times now and after each visit we have felt relaxed and re-charged. Besides the view and the abundant wildlife (wading birds, dolphin, and once an eagle), restaurants, downtown Wilmington, and the beaches are an easy drive, and there is a nature center with great trails just a few minutes away. If you like solitude, beauty, and quiet, this place is perfect for you. Pam and Mike are great hosts and we plan on coming back again and again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage. Beautiful sunrises made our morning coffee time extra special. Hosts are 5-star quality. The quiet setting was perfect.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam had it all ready by the time we got there ‚Äî the check-in process was as smooth as it could get, the cottage had all the amenities in place, and the view was just excellent."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this beautiful cottage! Amazing views of the water, lots of wildlife to observe from the porch (we saw dolphins!), and a beautiful home on top of that. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet and beautiful place to stay while visiting Wilmington."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view of the intracoastal waterway! Everything was very clean, Great place to stay for a few days of relaxing! Would definitely come again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about this cute cozy comfortable cottage. It really did feel like home and you could feel yourself relax as you walked in the door. The views were just indescribably amazing from sunrise to the sky full of stars at night. We saw dolphins and caught fish and crabs and soaked in the sunshine and fresh air while we just hung out on the dock and relaxed. Amazing weekend and we can‚Äôt wait to go back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a neat little cottage with incredible views! Waking up early to brew a cup of coffee and walk right out onto the porch to watch the sunrise was incredible. If you're looking for a relaxing getaway near Wrightsville then this is your place!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this little home on the Intercoastal waterway! The location was perfect, nestled at the end of a quiet neighborhood. The house was cozy, yet spacious, with a beautiful open view of the waterway from the dining area & deck outside! The kitchen is stocked with necessities to cook, and clean, and the bedrooms are comfortable! Pam, the hostess, was so easy to get in touch with before, during and after our stay! 10/10 recommend and will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great views with nice outdoor furniture & dock. Front room layout supports views, with windows on 3 sides. Great kitchen with all pots, pans & plates. Roomy shower. Saw porpoise, osprey, bald eagle, blue heron & snowy egrets. Nice sized bedrooms, WiFi worked great, stress fell away walking up to and through front door. Will return."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic little cottage! The views were amazing and we took the canoe out & enjoyed the deck every morning. Thanks for a great stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The views were unbelievable. The house was very clean. We will definitely stay there again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular views, fishing, kayaking; the whole package. Pam and Michael do a great job with upkeep and response to questions and concerns. Well worth every penny! 10/10 will definitely be booking another stay again soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As described. A nice quiet get away!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Pam's place is absolutely beautiful. You can't beat watching the sunrise on the dock nor the proximity (25 min drive) to the beach. It was lovely, secluded, and very very peaceful. The place itself is beautifully decorated and filled with natural light. The walls within the home are very thin so I wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers or loud families but other than that this was an amazing experience. We were able to fish off the dock and there was no light pollution so the evenings were spent stargazing. Cannot recommend enough!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cottage is really special. The sunrise views are beautiful. My family and I literally saw a small pod of dolphins swimming by and a bald eagle perched on a nearby tree. We took the kayak out and made memories as a family. Thanks for hosting us at horiZen Pam. üòä
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was quaint, clean and quiet and the view was breathtaking. Definitely would stay again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, beautiful place. Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage with the best view. The HoriZen has everything you need for an enjoyable and hassle-free getaway. It's quiet and relaxing yet close to shopping and activities. We loved our time there!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved our stay! We will be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Views were fantastic! Kayaks provided and dock access for fishing gave us plenty to do while away from the actual beach.
Place was as described and the entire experience was great! Would highly recommend and will book again in the future! Thanks!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful spot! So private and serene. Pam is so nice and accommodating.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The interior has been updated in a great balance of 1940‚Äôs with modern conveniences. The cottage does smell a little old/musty, but to be expected with the age.
The views are amazing!! If the kayaks and canoe are of interest, confirm they are there. Only the canoe was on property during our visit (I didn‚Äôt reach out to Pam as my kids took it as an opportunity to pivot to SUP rental)."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and the perfect getaway!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great views when the weather cooperates. Good location to access different areas. We enjoyed Surf City Beach better than Wrightsville beach. Pam‚Äôs Cape Fear Seafood recommendation was great. We saw dolphins from the deck as well
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage has fantastic views and a cozy feel. It was a great place to relax. The neighborhood is charming - we loved the location. Pam‚Äôs communication is exemplary - the self check in and self check out process was clear and easy. The kitchen is well stocked and the beds are comfy. I hope to return.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend getaway stay in Wilmington. Beautiful view of the intercostal, cozy and comfortable cottage in a quiet neighborhood area. Great restaurants near by, overall perfect stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The coziest, cutest little cottage on the water. We can‚Äôt wait to go back. Pam was the most amazing host answering my (many) questions prior to and during our stay! Thanks so much for the best week!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful view and peaceful setting! Secluded yet easy to get everywhere in 15 minute drive. The cottage is well kept and maintained and had all the necessities and extras !
Pam is a fantastic host and was easily reached and responsive!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at HoriZen! The cottage was so cozy and peaceful, and the views were beautiful. Pam was a great host‚Äîsuper kind and gave us lots of great recommendations for things to do and see. We spent some time at the beach and walked around Downtown Wilmington. We also really enjoyed just relaxing and cooking meals at the cottage! It was well stocked with everything we needed. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great home in a gray location.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location. Comfortable.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at this cottage. The location was great! The cottage was adorable, relaxing and super clean. We loved having wine on the deck and watching the birds and boats every night. We didn‚Äôt want to leave (my son actually cried when we were packing because he didn‚Äôt want to go) Highly recommend. Cannot wait to book again in the fall ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely tiny place tucked away in a neighborhood that is private but accessible to parts of Wilmington in a 20 mins drive. Topsail and Wrightsville Beach are each about a 30 min drive away. The place has a comfortable living area with cable tv. Heads up for booking, one of the beds in this home is a very small queen (possibly a full?). The views were very nice and Pam was a very responsive host!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little get away!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We highly recommend this house for getaway to the beach. How great to be on the water and away from the crowds, while also being only 20 minutes from Wrightsville Beach. On top of that, the house has a recently renovated modern interior with an open plan‚Ä¶a great setup for spending time with my wife and two children."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed in LOTS of places thru Abnb and this is at the top of my list now. They did a lovely job
remodeling the space. It‚Äôs comfortable, peaceful and quiet. The location can‚Äôt be beat. The views are stunning and the bird watching mesmerizing. I had enough room for our family of four and the kitchen was well-stocked. Next time I come, I‚Äôm bringing my SUP and kayak to explore the marsh!"
2021-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Pam's house is very cute and has a lovely view. We ended up leaving a day early because one of the bedrooms had a strong musty and mildewy smell and it's a small place already so not being able to use one of the bedrooms put a damper on our experience/sleeping arrangements. HLA-DR people beware.
Pam reached out to us after we left to say that a small section of her floor was stained and requested $250 to repair it.
Since I have no ability to look into that any more deeply, I paid the fee and I'm sorry that anything happened to the floor of this little rehabbed fishing cottage.
The owner does mention concerns about preserving the floor in her ad, and since it is made of soft pine, one might consider whether that's something you want to worry about or not.
We left the cottage very clean and as we found it.
Overall, cute place. Lovely location. Owners have created a very nice space, but there are some drawbacks."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was pleasant and definitely met our needs. The views were wonderful. Thanks for a very relaxing weekend. We hope to return soon.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely wonderful! I hope we can stay there again in the future. We loved the deck and being able to sit out and watch the boats, listen to the birds, hang our with friends, or ‚Äî best of all ‚Äî watch the full moon shining across the ICW. We enjoyed the lovely full kitchen and many comfortable places to sit‚Ä¶and TV with all our favorites courtesy of a chromecast ultra which we brought. I especially enjoyed the pretty rugs, perfect for a little post-traveling yoga."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Boy, did we enjoy this spot! Super cute and clean cottage with spectacular views. It was so beautiful and relaxing- definitely had a strong vacation vibe. My husband could not stay off the dock. The water views are second to none. We highly recommend this Airbnb for a NC coast vacation."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space, great location, wonderful views!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You want to stay here! It's lovely and relaxing. The perfect getaway!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. It‚Äôs beautiful. Don‚Äôt judge a book by it‚Äôs cover when you drive up, cause it‚Äôs not much to look at from the driveway, but the second you walk around to the door and see the view, it will take your breath away. The inside of the home is clean and comfortable with amazing windows looking out onto the intercostal. The living space felt very open. The bedrooms and bathroom are on the smaller side, but still enough space. There are dressers to put your things. Pam was responsive and easy to work with. We didn‚Äôt need to communicate about anything but extending our stay because we had all we needed. Would recommend."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view and location can‚Äôt be beat!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a cute little cottage with an amazing view of the intercostal waterway. We had a wonderful stay.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Five stars across the board. Cannot go wrong staying here!!! Loved the cleanliness and location.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was very charming. The kitchen was well equipped for dining in as we planned. It was in a quiet neighborhood on the water. Perfect for kayaking and stargazing. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful spot right on the water ‚Äî- highly recommend! Peaceful and private. Enjoy!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a beautiful, relaxing, unique location. It was very serene watching the sunrise at the end of the dock. The place had all amenities we needed and was very modern and cozy. I would love to stay here again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic location and really nice views. Space was perfect for our needs.
2021-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place has indeed a stunning view and great water-access. We also made use of the provided kayaks and had some great time on the water. The overall appearance of the house is fine, but one can tell that the house needs some updates (inside and outside).
After asking if we could bring our 14-pound, well trained dog, we were quite surprised to see one of Pam's friend cutting weeds in the yard for about 5 minutes. After mentioning that he didn't want to disturb us, it was quite obvious that the reason for his visit wasn't the weeds, but more so checking if we brought our dog. The fact that the following day another team of professional landscapers showed up and finished the weed eating, it was even more clear."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 spent a long weekend and had a great time. Much needed rest and relaxation in a cozy, quiet spot. The place has everything you need to relax and unwind."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful home with a spectacular view! Gorgeous sunrise and sunsets! Nice and clean!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic view and we enjoyed the quiet residential area not far from downtown and the beaches. The cottage had everything we needed and many stylish touches. Airlie Gardens was a highlight.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location. Quiet, beautiful views of the ICW and beyond. Be sure to get up early and see the sunrise."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although our stay was short, we had a very relaxing stay! The views are phenomenal and the cottage was so quiet and cozy! Would definitely recommend!!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place is the perfect spot for a couple's weekend getaway. The location is so private and quiet, and the water view is just beautiful. The interior of the cottage has been lovingly updated and styled, and it was a very comfortable and convenient place for a weekend hideaway. Pam was a great host and we will surely visit at her place again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views of the ICW. Cottage was very well-equipped. Loved our stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's cottage on the ICW is wonderful. Quaint, cozy and has everything you need for a quiet get away. The view is outstanding and while you are remote, it's a short jaunt to Porters Neck where you'll find all that you need. Highly recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't be fooled by the initial look of the place: while it might seem tiny and in poor shape at first glance, you'll encounter a real gem as soon as you step inside and on the deck. The view is priceless, the ability to kayak in the creek is phenomenal. A calm and beautiful haven. You'll need to drive 20 to 30 minutes to reach Wilmington and/or the beach, but the ride was just fine for us, as we mostly enjoyed spending time in the cottage and kayaking."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly Exceeded my expectations. Great location with the perfect view!
10 out of 10. Cottage was nice and clean."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the cottage! It was so serene and beautiful and we had a great time. Amazing and beautiful all around.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the very best views of the ICW in the Wilmington area
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The pictures are nice but you have to be there to understand. The views are unbelievable and the layout/decor/furniture in the cottage is chic and perfect for the space. We‚Äôll be back - highly recommended.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place - views are even better than the pictures!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cottage is in a beautiful and quiet setting‚Äîspectacular sunrise every morning, and lovely view of the birds, changing clouds, tides to watch. It‚Äôs also extremely comfortable‚Äîvery tastefully decorated, a variety of sitting areas with lots of pillows, comfortable bed with super comfy comforter. Pam has thought of everything! The kitchen is equipped with absolutely everything needed to prepare any meal. And a bonus for us as walkers was that the neighborhood was very walkable and neighbors were friendly. We had the opportunity to meet Pam and she was very gracious, telling us about the area and giving us tips. We would definitely recommend this cottage and hope to visit again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location - the view was simply amazing! We spent hours and hours just sitting on the deck, the dock, or in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows gazing out at the wonder of nature. With each passing hour we felt the world retreating and at the end of the week, we were rested, relaxed, and re-energized. We watched dolphins swim and frolic in the Intercoastal Waterway, and we saw Herons, Ibis, ducks, and cormorants - a pair of Great Horned Owls one night, and a Bald Eagle. It was truly spectacular and we created many memories that we will cherish forever. Thanks!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stylish and inviting cottage on the waterfront. Beautiful sunrises. Canoe/kayak around the intercoastal. Comfortable beds. Reasonably close to downtown Wilmington or Wrightsville beach. We would definitely stay here again.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is so lovely. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. We had more than enough towels & the place was very clean. But the absolute best part was the view - so pretty & we saw dolphins swimming nearby. Would definitely visit again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place the view is beautiful Pam was a great host to deal with. The kitchen had just about everything we needed for cooking. Everything was just as described my stay was great.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. This was a great 2020 destination because of the beautiful outdoor space, privacy, and accommodating indoor space for bringing back take out or cooking for ourselves. It is a very short drive to Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach."
2020-11-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I'll try to keep this review fair and balanced but our trip was soured by a unfortunate miscommunication and unnecessary pettiness from the host, Pam.
Pros:
- Nice view of the waterway
- Quiet neighborhood so you can easily hear the ocean even though it's across the waterway/marsh
- Overall very clean (with a few exceptions, see below)
- Generally well-appointed with decent pots/pans and most everything you need
- Tastefully decorated
- Relatively convenient with only a 10 minute drive to grocery store shopping center
- Comfortable beds and quality linens
-Private dock with provided kayaks/canoes
Cons:
- Unprofessional host
- Musty odor that almost smells like someone has previously smoked in the cottage
- No dishwasher
- Very small bathroom
- Washer/dryer only available for ""long term stays""
- We found some pet hair on the couch despite the listing saying ""no pets"" (huge issue if you have allergies and need to avoid a pet-friendly rental)
- The cottage is right on top of another small cottage which is right on top of a huge house. It's not as secluded as the pictures make it seem
- Ice dispenser didn't work on refrigerator and there didn't seem to be a water filter for the refrigerator water. Typical bad-tasting beach water.
-The several roach bait stations, while understandable for a house adjacent to the woods, was a little unsettling
The issue:
We had to bring our infant (3 month old) son with us on the trip due to babysitter falling through last minute. At the time of booking (and at the time of our check-in) nowhere on the listing did it say that small children are not allowed. Airbnb won't allow me to attach photos, but the ""house rules"" posted on the refrigerator did not mention this either.
Looking back, I should have updated Pam prior to our arrival to let her know we would have an infant with us but I honestly didn't think anything of it since there was no mention of it in the rules and he's 3 months old, can't crawl, and would be sleeping in a pack-n-play. This was my mistake but not I'm not sure it warranted the petty and punitive reaction from the ""super host"" Pam.
Since I can't post a screenshot, I've gone to the effort of typing the exchange with Pam below, verbatim.
Me: ""Hi Pam, this is ***** at the rental house. There were only 5 wash cloths here and we may need a few more towels. Are there extras anywhere? If a washing machine is available we don't mind putting a load on."" (there were 4 adults staying 3 days. by my math and standard bathing practices that should be at least 12 wash cloths)
Pam: ""How many guests are in your party?""
Me: ""4 adults and one 3 month old""
Pam: ""No washing machine access. I will have to drop off the towels and wash clothes""
Me: ""Ok that's fine. Thank you.""
Pam: ""You did not tell me you were bringing a baby""
Pam: ""The cottage is not appropriate for small children""
Me: ""It was not part of the original plan. Our accommodations fell through last minute to get a sitter. My apologies, I didn't think it would be a problem. We haven't had any issues with him.""
Pam: ""But the cottage is not safe for little children - it is in my rules"" (it wasn't but she added it to the listing as we were texting and then proceeded to gaslight me about it)
Me: ""Was that in the listing? I saw the rules about pets but nothing about children"" (according to another version of the house rules taped to the refrigerator, pets are allowed...I think you're starting to see the pattern here. This really sucked for my wife, who has terrible allergies. We specifically picked a place with a no pet policy.)
Me: ""He's not mobile and is sleeping in a pack n play. He can't even roll over yet. We take full responsibility for him.""
Me: ""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't think it would be an issue since he is so little. If he was older we would have thought to update the group amount since we would want to make sure the plugs are covered, etc.""
Pam: ""Yes - the rules state no children under a certain age. It's ok. I just would like you to take the dirty diaper trash with you when you leave."" (fair enough...seemed like a reasonable request and resolution to the issue. But keep reading...)
Me: ""Ok no problem. We can take it with us. Do you know when you will bring the linens? I was going to head to the store soon.""
Pam: ""You have 7 towels and 5 wash clothes- That should be enough for you for the number of days you are staying""
Me: ""Are we expected to reuse a wash cloth? There are 4 adults and we're here for 3 mornings...there's not even enough for each of us to have a clean washcloth tomorrow morning.""
Me: ""Don't worry about it. I'll pickup a loofah and body was at the store. Thanks.""
In the grand scheme of things it probably shouldn't be that big of a deal but this exchange really but a damper on what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday. I'll let you make your own conclusions about how Pam handled the situation but this was not what most people expect for an $300/night Airbnb vacation rental with a ""Super Host.""
Even the Holliday Inn will bring you extra washcloths if you ask..."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cozy spot
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about The HoriZen waterside cottage. It's like a hidden pearl. The host (Pam), the cottage, and the waterfront property were all fantastic. We can‚Äôt say enough about how wonderful our stay was. From the back deck and waterside deck, the sweeping views of the waterway, the marsh, and distant ocean were absolutely beautiful.
Beyond the great views of the water, the interior of the cottage is quaint and beautiful. We loved the quietude and found the whole stay peaceful and a relaxing getaway. Everything was very clean and orderly and the kitchen was well-stocked with everything needed to prepare meals. We enjoyed sitting in the large living room and taking in the beauty of the waterside.
Pam was very gracious, kind, and responded within minutes to the few questions we had. We particularly enjoyed using her kayaks and kayaking out to Rich‚Äôs Inlet. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We will definitely look forward to visiting again soon."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The home was fantastic: clean, warm, welcoming, well situated with easy (and quick) access to downtown, the airport, and key roadways. Although a ""vibe"" is subjective and hard to quantify for others, this home had a comforting feel to it. The hosts were gracious and responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was absolutely outstanding! The house, the location, communication, cleanliness, recommendations, the outdoor space‚Ä¶ it all deserves well over 5 stars! We had an amazing weekend and cannot recommend this house enough. Griffin and Tina- thank you so very much for your wonderful hospitality and a marvelous stay üòä."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our family weekend in Wilmington celebrating a cousin‚Äôs wedding. Griffin‚Äôs place is beautiful!

The courtyard was adorable and we enjoyed a great fire in the fire pit. We definitely recommend this place to others!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and comfortable. Host was responsive and organize. Would be a 5 star but some of the doors on the second floor did not close all the way. Overall, would recommend for anyone visiting the area and want to be close to downtown. 4.5/5 true rating :)"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Our group of 12 had a great weekend at Coastal Grandmother. Griffin and Tina were excellent hosts that were flexible with our arrival schedule and provided prompt communication. The kitchen had everything we needed for our large group and the guest house/rear yard offered a great private space to get away when needed. The proximity to downtown Wilmington was great and we enjoyed an easy ride to Wrightsville Beach one afternoon. There was a helpful information book with local recommendations provided by the hosts that came in handy and other small touches made the house feel like home. Our group would definitely stay here again if we ever visited Wilmington again and would recommend any large group stay here!

Would visit again, definitely a high price but I would say you get what you pay for because the place was beautiful.

Overall we had an amazing stay at the location.....thank you Erin
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This houseboat, Aloha, is the last one on a line of houseboats. The back deck has an unobstructed view of the Cape Fear River. It is a beautiful, and I mean beautiful, two level apartment on the water. Fantastic!"

We can't wait to come back!"

It has a cute kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Comfortable beds, and it has a swimming pool right in front of the back door. The house is clean and clutter free.
We had awesome communication from beginning to the end of my stay. Brian was responding to my last-minute request really fast, and i'm so grateful for that.
I definitely recommend his place to everyone. Thank you Brian :)"
