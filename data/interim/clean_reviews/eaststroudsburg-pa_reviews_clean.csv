2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a charming & beautiful gem in the mountains. The view is stunning, we just sat on the patio and watched the mountains & the sun, the sunsets are breathtaking. The sound of the rushing waters below, coupled with the fresh mountain air is healing! What a lovely picturesque cabin, cozy and feels like home. Really close to Bushkill Falls and Alaska Pete's, two of my Pocono favorites. A wonderful trip, many thanks, Dawn!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a beautiful place to stay. Loved the views. No air conditioning but we brought our own small air conditioning tower it and worked just fine for at night so we could sleep comfortably
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, easily accessible and very clean!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Melissa’s place was in a great location with lots of stores and restaurants in walking distance. The bed was firm and the shower was not the best for my boyfriend who is 6’2.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place for a few nights in East Stroudsburg. Clean and centrally situated with Melissa being a great communicator.
Thanks for giving us a good start to our US road trip.

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Melissa’s place was very clean and the location is walkable to restaurants and coffee shops. The mattress is a bit hard, and there’s not a lot of air circulation so it felt a little stuffy while sleeping."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Melissa's place. It is surrounded by much to do within walking distance. Peaceful and private if you prefer to stay in. Her home was welcoming, clean, and had everything listed and described in the booking details. Supermarket not far for those who cook. Parking is good. I am grateful for her and her hosts. I enjoyed my stay. Will recommend. Thank you!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa is a great host and communicated very well with us leading up to the trip. The apartment was very clean and it's in an incredibly convenient location on Main Street with numerous eateries and pubs within walking distance and dedicated parking right across the street. The apartment is surrounded by other apartments (which might be other short-term rentals?) and at times there was excessive noise coming from some of those units (e.g., loud music, shouting, etc.). I would recommend bringing some earplugs or other sound cancelling devices if you book this apartment. Also, the mattress is very firm. It would greatly benefit from a mattress topper. Overall, the apartment is a good value given its location but I would look elsewhere if you are sensitive to noise or if a comfortable bed is a must have."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, super easy check-in, and lots of space! Awesome place to stay, would absolutely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There were lots of food options within walkable distance. The place was clean and included some chips and candy which was a great touch! Melissa was communicative. The only suggestion I’d add is to get a mattress topper because the bed was a little too firm for us. Thanks for a great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and perfect for a weekend getaway to the Poconos. The apartment is located right on main street in Stroudsburg, a cute village with a great brunch cafe (cafe duet), wineries, good bars (like Sarah St Grill, which right behind the apartment building), awesome candy store, arcade, and boutiques. Location is super convenient. You are within 15 min driving to Shawnee mountain, and I believe there are other skiing/snowboarding options within 30 min away. Mellissa was fantastic with instructions and recommendations. The host group is super proactive and very helpful. I highly recommend!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the few days we stayed here. The place was clean and had all the basics we needed.
The internet was hit and miss, steaming on the tv was great but strangely if we tried to use it with our phones it was extremely slow. We had better service by disconnecting our phones from the WiFi.
Overall it was a minor inconvenience. We would certainly comeback."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you , the place was clean everything was perfect"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is ideal both for the foodie wanting to enjoy a hopping downtown scene and still private with a great outside balcony for a peaceful meal. The place was very clean and sufficiently stocked and modern that I felt very comfortable. I tend to be picky when I get away so I was really pleased, although I found locating the apartment a bit confusing. You enter through a common business entrance on main street and are parking directly across the street. We had several bags so I wasn’t quite sure what to do. There is an easily accessible back door from the alleyway in the rear, elevated second floor deck. Although the rear alley looks a little tires, the apartment and deck is quite private and you feel tucked away amongst the red brick and ivy. We enjoyed several meals on the deck. The book store Carol & Carols is one of the best used book stores I have been to. A real gem. We hiked gorgeous trails and came back to a huge tv, quiet, clean, private apartment! Loved our stay!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the place, very cozy and couldn’t be closer to restaurants, bars, and nightlife. Is very quiet and great place to relax. You can’t hear noise of any kind. If I go back to Poconos, i’ll reserve the same place. Melissa is an amazing host. 20 rating stars if possible!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. Melissa and her team are definitely the full package. There was a show the weekend we stayed and someone parked in our saved spot. Without me reaching out, Melissa did and made sure when we got back that we had a spot to park our car. If that isn't an example of dedication and great customer service, I don't know what is. I recommend booking with Melissa, you won't regret it."

Melissa messaged me giving me a list of things to do in the area. The bar Floods was amazing to us. Everyone was so nice in the area.
The location was good and close to lots of the hiking trails that we wanted to go to.
We are already talking about going back to the area!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our brief stay was a warm welcome from the host to very clean and comfortable accommodations. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking if needed.
The bed was very comfortable and the living area was inviting.
The bathroom is small and could use a newer shower curtain liner!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the apartment was clean and located in a great location, right on Main St"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was recently renovated and is very beautiful and comfortable. Although in the main street, it faces the backside and is very quiet. The free private parking is a great bonus. The bed is so comfortable that we ask the host for the details of the matrass to buy for our home. The self-controlled climate system was great. We enjoyed our stay very much and will recommend it to family and friends."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lodging is in the center of town and less than a 5-minute drive to the interstate. It is a good jump-off point to explore the Poconos and the gorgeous Delaware Water Gap national park. I recommend a daytime arrival, which will make it easier to find the apartment and locate the assigned parking. Lots of eating places within walking distance."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This should be a template for how an Air bnb should be this is better than a hotel I love it
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen and Melissa keep things clean! Check in/check out instructions were detailed and helpful! We liked the outdoor roof area too. Would recommend adding a few amenities like a book of favorite local spots.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay here. The location was great and the unit was exactly as advertised. It’s in the heart of the city with tons of things to do within walking distance. We also loved the outside patio area that we were able to relax on after a long day. The only thing we could say wasn’t our favorite was the bed seemed super hard and hurt our backs and made it hard to sleep. That though may just be personal preference.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and value. Beautiful apartment
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was a perfect getaway for a couple. It's very clean and the hosts are very nice and respond to you within minutes. It's a beautiful apartment 😍

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this apartment and would stay again if I'm ever in the area. Central location in town with many options of places to eat and explore within walking distance. Clean and private space (including lovely balcony) with everything you could need during your stay. Free parking provided by the hosts directly across the street from the space was an added bonus. Hosts communicated clearly and promptly, I could tell they took great pride in ensuring we had a lovely stay."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place was comfortable and convenient on the Main Street. Our only critic is having the Airbnb ready when they say the check-in will be
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here and would come back because of:
- Great location with quick access to major roads, highways, popular Poconos attractions and the Delaware Water Gap for hiking and recreation (if you want that, this is the place to stay!)
- A designated parking spot on a lot where my car was safe
- Clean, well stocked house that looks just like the pictures.
- Everything I needed to make stovetop and oven cooked meals at home.
- The very responsive host with thorough instructions and quick to help with any questions or issues. Things to keep in mind: there is one flight of stairs to reach the apartment and as other reviews mentioned you can faintly hear noise from neighbors in the bedroom only at night (it's not constant and during day is quiet)."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen and Melissa’s Airbnb in stroudsburg was the perfect place to stay for a weekend wedding. They included everything that we could possibly need; iron, hair dryer, towels, shampoo/soap, dishware, and even a few snacks. This was much cheaper and nicer than the hotels in the area, and we loved that it was located downtown so we could just walk around and grab food so easily. It was easy to check into and the hosts were always quickly available to answer questions before our stay. We also loved that it was an apartment unit and we were able to have a fridge and microwave etc at our convenience, which we would not have gotten at any of the pricey hotels in the area. All in all it was the perfect stay!"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was cute. It was really clean so that was a huge plus.

Overall was a good stay.

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just as described. It was a bit of a busy entrance near two barber shops. But people were friendly! I had some issues with using the lock— user error! Hosts quickly and kindly responded and helped. I am a bit of a light sleeper and woke up startled a couple times. It was not overly noisy, but not totally quiet. Great proximity to local spots!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Allen and Melissa’s Airbnb. It was a super easy process from booking to checking out, and probably the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in so far after trying several. The location is so convenient as it’s close to everything you may need in town, walkable to restaurants, cafes, wineries and stores, and only a 3 minute drive to Walmart. Everyone in and around the building that the apartment was located in was super kind, friendly and always held the door for us when coming in and out. Highly recommend this stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I couldn't have been more delighted with Allen and Melissa's accommodations . This is the was the ideal spot to stay in the area.

Super close to all the best restaurants and cafes, and easy access to the highway. It is spacious and comfortable, and the back porch was lovely. The A/C units in each room helped a lot. The parking space was clutch. Allen and Melissa are considerate and communicative hosts. Only caveat would be the stairs - they are daunting for someone with mobility issues. Still, an all-around wonderful experience. Thanks so much!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful and Alon was a great host. I messaged him a few times with some questions on the property. He immediately responded and was willing to send someone over if I had any further issues. In addition, he checked in with me the following day to make sure everything was going well. I would like to just suggest a 2 things:
1. Posting instructions on the stove in the kitchen. I personally never knew about the induction cooktop.
2. If it snows, getting someone to shovel the property. My guest and I slipped a few times. My boyfriend shoveled a little but shouldn't have to do that on vacation.
Other than that, excellent experience at his house!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and comfortable house, perfect for 2/3 families. The open floor plan for the living room / dining room / kitchen works really well. Quiet street, great for walks but sometimes the traffic to enter the community backs up making it little annoying. Find and use the back entrance to the community where there is way less car traffic.
Very communicative host."
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"""Luxury needs to be removed from the description. It is supposed to sleep 12 - the bunk beds in the basement are not sturdy enough to support anyone other than young children. They shook with very little effort. The weight limit should be posted. There was dish service for 8 - we used alot of paper plates. silverware was the same problem. We had one towel per person - camp-style towels i.e. bleach stained and thin. There are NOT 4 bathrooms - there are 3 bathrooms and a powder room. Game room looked good but the video game didn't work and pool table was terrible - with 1 pool cue with a tip. Couldn't wash clothes because the dryer vented into a garage filled with paint cans & firewood - kept setting off the smoke alarms. Owners solution was to have us remove the smoke alarms & trust him. Final day - sink backed up and we couldn't run the dishwasher.
We were promised a $300.00 refund from the owner - nothing yet. Airbnb was non-responsive & unconcerned
Check-in was a disaster"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Well kept home with modern tastes and tons of space. The host was very responsive and accommodating. excellent experience and would stay again!

2023-09-01,3.0,Group trip,"I loved the experience I had with my friends here at Alon & Ester’s home! Great amenities, home looks just like the pictures and was very clean to the T! My only concerns was the master bedrooms bathroom, while I tried to shower, the door was stuck and it seemed like the more I tried to push it open, the shower was dislocating itself! I was too afraid to break anything so I had to squeeze in and out as best as I can without trying to force it open! I would’ve showered in other bathrooms but they were occupied each time it was shower time! And the hot tub took way too long to fill up! Otherwise the house was great! I expected to see bugs! It’s PA."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice and comfortable place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house and excellent host. Interior design of the house is fantastic. Host provided everything you need in kitchen and bathroom.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, Hosts are amazing.Quick responses and extremely friendly felt like we were staying at a friends house. Beautiful interior and exterior/location. Me and my family really enjoyed and were dreading to leave. Will definitely book with these amazing hosts again, and would suggest everyone to as well."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay. Ester and Alon were very responsive, answering emails and texts immediately and when we ran out of propane for the grill, they sent someone over within 15 minutes to replace the tank. The unit was nicely furnished and the highlight was the screened-in sunroom where we spent much our time hanging out. The mattresses weren't super comfy and though there was no central AC, there were individual units in each room that worked well but were somewhat noisy. One of the bedrooms was lofted over the common area and, though very pretty, it had a cut out above the door so there was no sound barrier between the bedroom and the common area. I'm a light sleeper and we had a baby with us, so that bedroom was definitely not for me. But overall, we had a really nice time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely house. Exactly as described. Anytime we had questions Alon and Ester were a phone call away and always responded. Will def recommend them to other
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. It was clean and spacious and quiet. Beautiful outdoors. Very responsive and accommodating hosts.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The stay was great! I had my two teenage kids, and two of their friends with me. They loved the luxe vibe and pool table and hot tub. I was able to relax, write some music and go for epic bike rides on quiet mountain roads. Incredibly cozy and the pictures are very accurate. The place is really nice. I would definitely rent this place again, and maybe not bring not bring the kids!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alon was an amazing host, very responsive! The place was beautiful and very clean. It was great for a big group. The community is nice and private and the amenities were nice. Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alon and Ester were incredibly gracious and responsive hosts. Before the day of our arrival, we had communicated with Ester that, because of infant nap schedules and work, we might need to check into the house earlier than the usual check-in time as well as check-out a bit later than the usual check-out time. Ester was able to work with us within reasonable parameters to help accommodate our family's needs on that front.
Upon our arrival at the house, we found a couple of hiccups (a blown circuit and a door that needed repair), and within 20-30 minutes, someone was at the house to resolve these issues. The rest of our stay was peaceful and enjoyable. The house is tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and filled with light. Everyone, from little ones to the not-so-little ones had a great time."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house and great host. I just wished the community passes could be done before getting there so we could just scan and enter as we had to wait for each car even after the requests were sent by the host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great getaway from NYC! , There is a “WOW” factor when you arrive and let alone when you enter the 3 level spacious home , We rate this 5 out of 5! , The ambience , peacefulness , cleanliness and good vibes all around was worth every penny. The hosts were very attentive and responsive to our needs. Our family LOVED it all, we had everything we needed and more."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled from CT to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Josiah was available to accommodate our late arrival.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay at Josiah's place in downtown Stroudsburg. Being able to easily walk to so many restaurants was a huge perk to me. Josiah had great instructions on where to park and how to access the apartment. I wouldn't think twice about staying here again when I'm in the area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Josiah was a great host! Quick to respond and extremely accommodating. Thanks for letting us stay with you.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun place to stay...VERY comfortable and clean. Josiah is definitely a superhost.

Thanks for everything Josiah! : )"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very clean, definitely enjoyed my time here, it felt very comfortable and Josiah was very helpful 5/5 all around"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay - just as pictured. My only reason for the 4 was comfort - the beds are very VERY hard and flat pillows which made for a restless night of sleep. The temperature in the house is also a bit inconsistent - so very cold or too hot. The electric fireplace didn't work either unfortunately.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was quaint, charming and felt like home. It reminded me of my home when I was a child and lived in Trenton. We only stayed at the home for two days. If we ever plan to vacation in the area again we would definitely stay at this home again. There was no washer or dryer but since we only stayed for 2 days we didn't need to wash anything. The driveway was a little tight for a large SUV. I had to let my husband out of the car first in order to park in the driveway. Overall there were adequate supplies for cooking.Dish soap and a sponge was provided for the kitchen dishes. Handsoap in the bathroom and a bar of soap in the tub. I did bring bath towels and wash clothes. There were a few towels supplied but we used our own towels from home. Both beds were comfortable and the duvets were warm and cozy! We enjoyed no clutter around the house and loved the pin pad to access the house. Cute, cute, cute!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable stay, clean and modern decor. Just what we needed!
thanks for a great stay :-)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location because it's practically 30 minutes or less to get to everything (The Frogtown Chophouse, Mt Airy Casino, Poconos Outdoor Adventure, Mountain View Vineyard, Winery, Brewery & Distillery, etc.) By the way, thanks for recommending the restaurant, Orain. They DID NOT disappoint! The plumbing drains slowly so you may want to bring cleaning products to avoid standing in soap scum. No frills, just convenient. Nice to see the deer in the backyard like at home. Place could use a new paint job and dusting in the bathroom, but was staged very well. I would stay again, but not for an anniversary."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Orain was a great host, and the stay was so nice! We would definitely do it again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"More modern feel with clean amenities and surprising amount of room. It’s a Great spot in East Stroudsburg tucked away from the noise but still close enough to the action; great restaurants, Main Street and the college. Stayed here for a ski weekend and it worked out great being only 12mins from camelback."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing place, we had a little issue with the fire place and was fixed right away which I felt I was super bothering the owner . Thank you for everything looking forward to come back to your amazing place, super cozy place , the house doesn’t miss not a bit of thing what you have in your own house , I cooked home and I had everything available there , super super clean house , honestly as long as we’ve been using airbnb I will say this was my favorite place to stay and absolutely will go back again and again, the neighbors are amazing as well, I’m super impressed. thank you again Orain for making our stay so easy and comfortable."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Orian’s place was exactly what I needed for an overnight stay. Lovely quaint home close to many shops and restaurants. Would gladly stay here again if needed.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. Was very easy to find. Close to everything thats drive-able like Walmart, gas stations, restaurants, super market, anything you’re trying to find. Convenient location. The place was clean and smelled clean, however the area rugs seemed like they had pet hair on them even though the airbnb doesn’t allow pets. Maybe it was dust or maybe the area rugs are shedding not 100% sure. It was very cozy, the heat worked very well! If you get too hot and turning it down doesn’t help, there are 2 fans in the Airbnb. Me and my fiancé had to keep the place warm for the little one and we used the fan when we slept. Overall I would stay here again! It was perfect for the Thanksgiving Holiday and visiting family!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely house
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little air BnB was very comfortable and offered a beautiful scene for the fall weather. It was great to cozy up by the fireplace during the cold October night.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Orain is an amazing host. Very accommodating and very quick with responses. I’d stay here again in a heart beat!!!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a one-night stay. Bed was comfy and house was clean. We had a wedding to attend, and the host was flexible and allowed us to check in 1 hour before the stated check-in time. Notes for future guests:
- Bathroom towels are very small
- There is a coffee machine, but you need to bring your own coffee
- No toiletries provided (some Air BnBs do, some don’t)
- The host does not send the house code until is is requested. We messaged 30 minutes prior to arriving and received it immediately"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a comfortable stay in the spacious home which is quite well located. It was very well equipped and nicely maintained. We enjoyed our 5 nights stay but it would have been even better if there were couple of reclining chairs on the patio and some bath-sized towels in the bathroom.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Orain’s as always - I think we have been here a half dozen times or so.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nicely renovated house. Very neat and clean!
The surrounding houses were not kept as nice! Kind of run down.
But house was very close to town, and we were just there one night!
Would have been nice to have chairs to sit outside."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked Orain’s place for a little getaway from the city and it was perfect, exactly as needed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very nice place and very nice stay. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stay at Orain’s place whenever we visit my parents. It’s a great location and my husband and I find it comfortable and convenient. We have already booked again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay!! Place has a lot of fantastic hiking in the area
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Lots to do. Or just do nothing either way you can’t beat the value for what you get

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly and hassle-free. We had to plan a last minute trip and Orain made the lodging part of our trip super easy!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place on a peaceful, quiet street. Orain was helpful and professional. There could be a more efficient check-in process, though. We messaged the host upon arrival and asked for the check-in code as directed, but we waited an hour for a response. It wasn’t a big deal, but might have been inconvenient under other circumstances. Other than that, very smooth, comfortable stay. Thanks!"
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Would stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Felt right at home. Local brewery was great. Spacious, clean, and modern."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night and it was a great experience. The house was spotless, comfortable and clean beds, and on a nice quiet street. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place is easy to find and access and we had a nice one-night stay. The neighborhood was quiet, the beds were comfortable, and the fireplace was easy to use and a nice touch. The place was generally clean, but we noticed that the area rugs desperately needed to be vacuumed. We were concerned about the driveway as noted in other reviews but were able to fit two small SUVs without a problem. Similar to other reviews, we also noticed that the bath towels provided are very small, so you may want to bring your own. Instead of the access code being provided in the app before check-in, we had to message the host for the code. It was provided in a reasonable time frame and not a huge deal, but it would be nice if it was provided ahead of time like all of the other places we've stayed."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and accurate to the description! Private and in a nice neighborhood. Check-in was super easy and Orain was very responsive to all my messages!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and welcoming.
The only surprise where we were caught off guard were the lack of large towels to shower. Only hand towels made available. I’m sure by contacting the host it would have been resolved, but our stay was short.
Overall, would stay again… it was the perfect getaway!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best place i ever stay, i will go back soon"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place

House is located on a quiet street. House was clean and comfortable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were in East Stroudsburg traveling for work. The house is only 1 mile away from the hospital which was great for us. The location was great and Orain did a great job communicating back and forth with us. The house was very clean and very accommodating. There is also a beautiful stream about 3 blocks from the house, we enjoyed walking, running, and biking on."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Quiet neighborhood. Smart TV was a nice touch.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and value. Might recommend bringing your own bath towels if more than 2 people
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Orain's was great. Overall a very pleasant stay. I wish the refrigerator's ice maker was hooked up since it was very hot while we were there, but otherwise a nice place for a few nights."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Orain (host) was very quick with responses and was able to accommodate our needs when necessary. The home is very cozy and located in a quiet neighbourhood.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, modern. Great location. Great host. Comfortable. Nice to be in ""our own"" house."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a nice short stay for one night. Central to shops and restaurants. Orain was very responsive and check in was a breeze!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Clean and quiet house. Orain was prompt in responding to messages. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Orain's place was okay for our short overnight trip. The house was pretty clean and the bed was comfortable. Orain was gracious enough to allow us to check in early, but there was an error in sending us the code (usually, renters receive it the day prior or morning of), and we had to stand out in the heat for a bit to wait. There was a portable AC unit in the living/dining/kitchen area which kept things cool out there, but there was a very loud window unit in the queen bedroom and only a fan in the other bedroom. We were thankful it was just the two of us. While there was a sizeable backyard, the back door of the home was not accessible, so you would have to walk around from the front to get out there. It would have been great to have some directions in the home, too. I did receive some information on the Airbnb account, but my husband couldn't get the TV to work while I was sleeping or find the WIFI password."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Orains place is very clean and comfortable. lots of nature surrounding the property including blue Jay's and cardinals. the porch is a nice setting to see all of these things.
It is wonderfully quiet and relaxing.
stores are only a few minutes away and there is a nice small historical town on the other side of the stream.
I would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was very clean and orderly. It had everything you needed to cook for yourself and the two bedrooms were nice and spacious. It was not far from strip malls with shops or the town. My boyfriend and I loved this home and were very pleased with our stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place and location! Clean, and Orain was friendly and accommodating"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orain answered our questions quickly. Check in was easy. it was nice to have the kitchen space to cook food during our stay. There are kitchen basics
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication, lovely property and a pleasant experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place. Close to East Stroudsburg University. Orain was very quick to respond. Cute decor. Great experience!
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is cute and worked for our time there (weekend). Kitchen is stocked with the very bare minimum. If you are looking to cook, bring items to store leftovers. Communication was sub par. We were left with no toilet paper, windows that were left wide open upon arrival/did not lock. Not my best Air BNB experience overall. Driveway just fit one sedan & truck."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,👍
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable, quiet well decorated home. Close to everything. Don’t hesitate to book"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,2 of us stayed here for a week while working in the area. It worked out very well for us. house was exactly as shown. Might be a little small for larger groups.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Comfy, clean and convenient!!"
2022-03-01,3.0,Group trip,"This was a beautiful home. It was clean and looked even better than the pictures! Very close to Shawnee Mountain. However, we said we were having 5 people stay and there were only 3 towels to shower with. The posting also said that 2 cars can fit in the driveway. But upon arrival we were informed that work was being done to the driveway and couldn’t use the whole driveway. We had two trucks, so this made it difficult to park. Overall, a positive experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orain’s house is perfect for a small getaway for the weekend. The house is within 5-15 minutes of everything in town and for skiing/snowboarding. Would definitely stay again!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Orain's place was fine for a one night stay. Place has nice decor, TV is great and the fireplace amazing. Kitchen can get cold and the parking cant really fit two cars. You need to pay 50$ per person extra for more than two people."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a nice location! Orain was very quick to respond! Loved the fireplace!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, cozy place & great communication from Orain, the host!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was very clean and nice would definitely stay again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the house is about 20 minutes from camelback resort and mount pocono. it looks just like it’s pictured and is a very comfortable stay. highly recommend. thanks for having us!
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Orain, the host, was fine, but it wasn't the best experience I've had with Airbnb. We didn't receive an entry code prior to check in, and we weren't provided one on the app when we officially checked in. So we had to message Orain and wait for a reply before we could get into the Airbnb. The reply didn't take very long, but I wish the process had been a bit smoother. The wifi password as displayed on the listing all does not work, because it contains a few spaces before and after the password itself. We had to message the host about this and they provided the correct password, but this is something I thought they would've realized and fixed by now (because I assume other guests have had this problem)."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great little place, exactly as described and very convenient for Shawnee!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and Cozy!! Perfect location for a Shawnee Mountain Trip:)
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and neat. It was very cold even with the fire, granted it was very cold outside… but with the blanket from the closet we were fine."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,N
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was exactly as listed. Right in the downtown of east stroudsburg next to lots of dining and fun! Lots of things to do all within an hours drive of this place.
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Great area to stay
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay again. Great location
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Went on a ski trip with some friends. About 20 mins from camelback and mount airy. The place was nice and clean. Plenty of stores/food nearby. Driveway can only fit one car. Would definitely stay here again
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Orain's house is a super cute cozy. It was perfect for my family. We went to Shawnee Mountain to go snow tubing and came back to cozy up and watch movies. The house is only 15 mins away from Shawnee and close to downtown Stroudsburg where you can find many great places to eat.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great stay!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Orain was a great host , definitely recommend"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. No complaints !
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home for a couples getaway. Orain was the perfect host and his home was beautiful, will definitely stay again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it’s an excellent place to stay!! It was perfect for my friend and I for our weekend getaway. There is a cozy fireplace, a full kitchen (with a lot of extras like mugs, pots/pans, etc etc), and it had a great location! It was very clean and we had a very relaxing stay!
Some things to note:
- The parking spot is very small and you can most likely fit 1 car. Luckily we were traveling in one car, so it wasn’t an issue.
- The beds are very firm. I prefer a softer bed, but it all comes down to preference!
- The bath tub works fine as a shower, but we couldn’t get it to make a bath"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect home base for a couple's weekend getaway in the Poconos. There were tons of great food options in close proximity, easy access to I-80, and it was perfect to settle down in front of the fireplace after a day on the trails. I would happily stay again if I return to the area!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute little house on a quiet street. You are close to I80 so easy in and out. We were there for a wedding at Turtle Lake in November. There is baseboard heat so it took a little while for the house to warm up but it does have a thermostat and and a gas fireplace that added some instant heat. The house is nicely updated and the bedrooms have nice closets. The mattresses are very firm so if you are looking for a soft bed you may reconsider. We grabbed the extra blanket from the living room for some extra warmth that first night. The house was very clean and nicely appointed. The lock system for the front door was very easy to use and the WIFI was great.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little house for a short trip!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable stay!
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for letting us stay. Super cute house!! Great location.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Orain and I had a slight miscommunication and he was able to provide a solution right away. The place is cute as a button. Perfect for a Pocono getaway! Highly recommend to book without hesitation!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable stay. We would stay again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was so much nicer in person! The location wasn’t what I thought but the house was great and cozy for 2-3 people! Had tons of appliances. The bedding and shower curtain have been updated and are much nicer!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent!!!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little house! Nice, quiet neighborhood. Was the perfect Airbnb for a trip to the Poconos!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. My bf and I enjoyed being so close to everything and having so many food options around. Would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back again.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice hardware throughout the residence. Towels and pillows could be easily upgraded. Slightly strange smell coming from kitchen sink, reminded me of the smell from my mom’s crawlspace. I did arrive in the middle of a rainstorm so maybe that had something to do with it. You definitely smelled something when you walked in to the residence, though I quickly got used to it.
Driveway was problematic to get in and out of on both sides, on the house side, there was a plant that needed to be trimmed back and it kept getting stuck in our car door, on the far side of the driveway, its right up against big trees and you can’t open your car doors to get out. There also isn’t street parking out front so that’s not an option.
Note, if you are sleeping in the front bedroom and its windy out, you may want to put in some earplugs as the neighbors have wind chimes that aren’t that far from you. I wish the curtains blocked more light.
I would suggest the owner get some seating for the front porch, that could be a really lovely addition to this property.
Owner was kind enough to let me check in early. I would stay here again if I was in the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orain is a great host! The home was very nice and well-kept. We enjoyed how close it is to downtown East Stroudsburg.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice living room with TV setup. No direct Access to backyard from inside.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great stay, would do it again!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Orain's place is a compact house, most suitable for up to four people. It is clean, and on a quiet, residential, street. The house is adequately furnished, and the kitchen and bath are both in good shape. Though one or two earlier reviews suggested otherwise, there were in fact sufficient towels provided, and appropriate supplies. The parking situation is a shade problematic. Orain's driveway is quite narrow, making it a little difficult to exit or enter parked vehicles. Moreover, two smallish vehicles could be made to fit, but two SUVs would likely not. This is not a luxurious house, but worked just fine for us for a weekend stay."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in was miserable. Confirmed earlier in the day the house would be ready for check-in at 4pm as it stated, he responded with yes. I messaged when we were 10 minutes out to ask for code to enter home. he never responded. I called multiple times and even messaged him. NO RESPONSE. after being in the car for 6 hours we decided to drive around a little more because we didn't want to just show up to this house and not have entry. After 20 minutes with no response we finally decided to just go and hope someone was there to maybe let us in. NOPE and still no reply. After 40 minutes of sitting on the porch hoping he'd see us through his security cameras, I decided to call Air bnb help center and was on the phone with them for 10 minutes and was told they would try to get ahold of host. I had to wait until 5pm until I could get a refund and hope to find another place to stay. At 4:59 (convenient) he responded with a code to enter the house and offered no apology or anything for making us wait."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Space!! Very clean and modern!! Great space to share with family or friends!! Open concept and comfortably modern. Steps away from everything you want to do!! Highly recommended!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very quiet house in a nice neighborhood. Walmart and other stores are like 5 mins away. Overall very convenient! Definitely recommend for a small family getaway.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy home with anything you could need. There are restaurants/groceries options within walking distance. A relaxing place to stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was very nice and clean. Host was very attentive and responsive.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and quiet place. Location is so cute next to little shops and stores, restaurants, etc. 10/10"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Orain is a wonderful host -- accommodates your needs, responds right away--I can't say enough positives! If you are looking for a private, well-kept place that is both convenient and quiet, Very Welcoming is it"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Orain's house was clean and nicely furnished. He gave clear and simple directions for check in and responded very quickly when messaged. The neighborhood was quiet and the house was only 20 minutes away from where we rode ATVs and only a bit further from the gun range we went to. It's also about 10 minutes away from an outlet mall. Although we bought groceries and cooked all week, there were lots and lots of places to dine and get food. It was blazing hot this past few days thank God there was A.C. We would definitely stay here again for our next trip to the Poconos!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and convenient for all of the locations we wanted to visit. If you want a cleanly place with all of the essentials for a good price, this is it!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful host and a wonderful house. Very cute and cozy. Very clean and there is a lot of stuff to do in the area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had such an amazing experience staying at Orain’s home. Check in and check out was super easy! The house was very lovely and felt super homey. Will definitely be staying again in the future.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Orain’s home was cute and quaint. Perfect for our short stay with our infant. FYI no parking in the street overnight and room for only one car in the driveway. The home was super clean! Would stay again
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice Airbnb. Very clean and spacious. Orain’s communication was great.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Orain was a wonderful host. He responded very quickly to any questions that came up throughout my stay. The home was very cute and comfortable. Highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Check it out! very awesome
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spotlessly clean house is quiet and convenient, with a wonderful host."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice house and just a quick drive to everything downtown!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another stay at this delightful house--quiet, convenient, and spotless. Orain is a quick and thoughtful communicator."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was just as described. It was very inviting and super comfortable. Orain had great communication with such a quick response time! This house is in such a great location very close to restaurants and shops. I definitely recommend it and I can’t wait to return!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at this quiet, comfortable and spotlessly-clean home away from home. Orain is such an accommodating host!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place! Spotless clean. There were a lot of small ants but otherwise 10/10
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Once again stayed at this spotless and comfortable home. Orain is a very responsive host.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartmen, great and safe location. All the comforts of hone"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great (close to ESU, shopping, food). Was visiting to do some birdwatching and to tour the water gap. Close to everything. This place was super clean and the fireplace was nice to sit in front of at the end of the day. Driveway is narrow so parking a little tough, otherwise it was perfect, will visit again"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, this is a comfortable, well-appointed home--quiet and private yet very convenient. And a most solicitous host!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Orain's place was clean, tidy and very charming. The front porch is nice but be sure to BYO chair for a relaxing sit. The kitchen contained basic amenities, a nice dining area and comfy couch and living room. The fireplace is a nice touch for evening relaxing. Our only complaint (NOT Orain's fault) is the neighbors were having a party and blasting the music until around midnight. Keep in mind this is in a neighborhood and not a secluded location. But we are used to that from living in a city! Other than that, great location for nearby hiking, downtown Stroudsburg and walkable to East Stroudsburg main drag."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the beginning, Orain was very communicative. I had to cancel the day of due to a 103 degree fever by the other person who was accompanying me. Orain responded immediately and was very understanding."

2021-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very comfortable to stay. I would recommend this for only 4 people since there’s only 2 rooms and 2 beds. If you travel with a group of 6 some might need to sleep on the floor or on the couch. The place is very clean.
This place is very convenient, there is a lot of shopping stores nearby and it’s close to many attractions.
One thing I would suggest the owner is to have more towels available and have hangers in the closets. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay there."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed here for one night on a road trip through the state. It was easy to get in and get to sleep, and was a great place to crash. Thanks again!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Orain’s place is about the same you see in pictures. Two good enough size bedrooms and open kitchen-living room area. And it was pretty clean. We talked prior our visit and accorded that it was okay for us to get there earlier than check in time to drop off our stuff (we were going to a vineyard) but when we got there, they have not cleaned the place yet so we had to wait 4 hours, which for the size of the place, i thought it was a little much. It’s not a big deal but we would have rather to plan ahead for this. Other thing we were disappointed about is that the fireplace is not actually a fireplace and it was not even working. Someone came and tried to fix it but it just didn’t work, this was one of the main things we were looking forward too and it was a shame we did not get to enjoy it. The area is not the greatest but it was pretty quiet all night.
Overall is a good stay if you need to do something around the area."

I consider the place a work of art. Beautiful and so peaceful- we want to come back. The hosts were very communicative, responsive and helpful!

We visited The Cure Cafe multiple mornings for breakfast."

There were so many amenities, especially for young children, that we could take advantage of with our toddler (and I wish I had these items when I was traveling other places with her as a baby).

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We loved Javier & Mariela’s home! It had everything we needed and more. They were very responsive and answered all the questions we had. This was a great spot since we were traveling for the first time with our two kids (one of which is 11months old) and they had everything we could have possibly needed which made packing easier. The only very little downside was that the beds were extremely uncomfortable. But that would not stop us from booking this beautiful home again! Thank you so much!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. Our kids loved the treehouse and all the books. The community was very safe and the check in and check out was very well detailed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Javier and Mariela were fantastic hosts. Javier rescued us when we got lost in the rain. The house was beautiful and depicted accurately with the listing. Best experience we have had on AirBnB thus far.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic time at Javier and Mariela's home! It is a beautiful, serene, and cheerful home; our daughters (3 and 7) loved the playhouses, toys, stuffies, and books, and the snacks that they left us! The backyard is even nicer than the pictures; at night, with the lights turned on, it was magical. The whole house was really charming. We saw several deer, including a fawn, that came very close to the deck. The community was perfect, with a swimming pool (which alas we were not able to take advantage of), a playground, and a lake all within a few blocks. We biked and walked to these, but it was steep for the 7-year-old. (and maybe for me, I could be in better shape!)
A few things to note:
-Our GPS claimed their house was a few houses sooner than it was, so make sure that the house numbers are right
-Plenty of towels, throw blankets etc, but if you go to the beach/pool, they request that you bring your own.
-The beds are on the firm side"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had the pleasure of staying at Javier and Mariela's wonderfully-accommodating home in the woods of the Penn Estates community over Memorial Day weekend. Registration of our vehicles at the gatehouse was easy, and the house was a short drive from the gate. We used the house as a base for exploring the scenic wonders of the Delaware Water Gap region; its proximity to good hiking and waterfalls was ideal. It had everything we needed and much more besides. We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and by the fire pit, cooking in the spacious kitchen and grilling/dining on the beautifully-lit deck. Our host provided a binder with clear directions for using the amenities (only lighting the grill needed some clarification), and Javier was kind and quick to respond to any questions we had. The property was clean and nicely updated, with cozy, air-conditioned bedrooms, a cathedral-ceilinged living room and a lounge loft on the second floor. We hope to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This weekend getaway was a mother daughter trip for my 8 year old daughter and I. We had such a great time here. We didn't venture outside of the airbnb, as we were looking for a home away from home. This place served its purpose. We spent our day lounging out in front of the TV and enjoying nature. One morning we were greeted by friendly deer and my daughter loved that! We had breakfast on the patio and later enjoyed the hot tub. The outdoor fireplace came in handy for the late night smores. We had difficulties with the fireplace but I contacted our host Javier and he was conveniently in the area and available to help! He came by and got us situated with the fireplace which we appreciated. We also had a few other hiccups, but he took care of those issues right away! The home was clean and had all the things we needed to ensure a comfortable stay. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend their home. The hosts were great! Thank you."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Javier and Mariela's Cozy House with a Lovely Fairytale Treehouse is an enchanting retreat that exceeded our expectations. The pictures do not do it justice, as the place is even more beautiful in person. The attention to detail and thoughtful touches made our stay delightful. The house was immaculately clean and comfortable and had all the necessary amenities.
From the moment we arrived, we felt at home and welcomed. The check-in and check-out process was easy and hassle-free, and Javier and Mariela were responsive and gracious hosts. The quiet and serene neighborhood, surrounded by nature and wildlife, was a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of city life.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was an amazing weekend getaway .. the house is fully equipt with everything you need … very cozy very comfy in a private gated community .. will be back for another getaway soon
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice house
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Javier and Mariela were such courteous and responsive hosts. They were always really quick to get back to me when I had a question, and were also very accommodating in allowing me to check in an hour early. Their home was beautiful, like the photos, but even better in person. Lots of charm and personal touches, and perfect for little children. There was a children's bedroom with a lot of toys for our son to play with, and a tree house in the backyard that he couldn't get enough of. We were about 20 min away from both Camelback and Shawnee resorts, and a little over 10 min away from the downtown area of Stroudsburg which has many great stores and restaurants. The area was very quiet and peaceful and allowed for a good night's sleep. I definitely recommend staying here, and would love to bring my family back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay, just as described. Javier and Mariela responded immediately when we had questions or comments. Highly recommend, lots to do in area. Loved the deer in yard."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house and it was very clean! They are great hosts and it was perfect for a weekend away with your girlfriends!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We ve had a great time !! thank you for accommodating us and the pups for the weekend.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best decision ever! The home was cozy, spacious, and filled with extras that made the experience more enjoyable. There were snacks and coffee provided, toys, books, and kitchen utensils for small children as well as books, music and cable for adult entertainment. They provided soap, shampoo and conditioner and plenty of towels. Most importantly, when there was a power outage (due to the weather) the hosts were very responsive and accommodating. I will definitely be returning soon as we found some local attractions we're very interested in. This was a great experience that my family will always remember."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Our son loved this place it was very kid friendly from the potty to even baby gates we were very happy!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We have nothing but great thing to say about our stay. Once we walked in we had a nice welcome basket and felt right at home. It was lovely that the Christmas decorations were still up. Everything we needed for the kids was right there so it was really great that we didn’t have to pack anything! Javier even bought ESPN for my husband when he was dying to catch a game. 100 percent will be back again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!! gorgeous house. Hosts were always super responsive to any inquiries. Spotless! Great views
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was superb. My family really enjoyed the beautiful cozy house. We enjoyed skiing every day at the Camelback Resort, located within 18 min drive. Coming back to the house, we rested peacefully near the fireplace. The Christmas decoration was so pretty and the outside lighting was like a movie. The host responded very quickly and kindly. We would like to come again to this lovely house for skiing next winter."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything perfect. As described. We really enjoyed it.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house to unwind for a much deserved Christmas break with the family. The house was very clean and had a lot of thoughtful details ( like seasonal decorations and not only). It had a lot of toys and designated play areas for my 2 year old, and that’s always a relief as you don’t have to travel with a lot of entertainment options. The community was very safe and close to everything and Javier was very responsive. We made some great memories in our brief stay here and we will be returning in the future"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Javier & Mariela provided a wonderful getaway for me and my friends. They were very quick to respond and super flexible with our needs. They went above and beyond with all of the little details even down to a very thorough welcome binder with QR codes to help locate local spots to visit. The vibes were just right and the pellet fireplace gave just the right feel for a chilly winter night! We were able to relax and enjoy a quiet weekend away in their gorgeous home. Cozy house is a very appropriate name for their home!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Javier and Mariela's bungalow. Our daughter adored both the playhouses and even braved the chilly temperatures to play in the treehouse. The entire house was spotless and the welcome basket was must appreciated. We wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy more of the surrounding area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spent a fantastic Thanksgiving here with my family. Our hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful in any way possible. My two year old had the time of her life in the tree house and the kids room upstairs.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was well stocked with everything we could have needed from the fruit and chilled water that was ready upon our arrival to linens, toys, and throw blankets to snuggle up by the fire. The place was super clean and Javier communicated very well with us throughout the process. The backyard fairytale cottage was perfect for our two girls and we enjoyed playing tennis and basketball at the community playground. A great weekend getaway!
A few points of feedback for those doing some serious BnB sluething to find the ""perfect"" spot.
- While the community was very secure we did find the neighbors to be a bit close. The photos made it seem a bit more secluded.
- Very cozy and nice but you can hear everything. When the kids were up at 6:20, so were you.
- There are no sidewalks. Not an huge issue but we didn't want the kids walking to the playground alone (9yos) without a sidewalk."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Javier & Mariela’s Poconos getaway was perfect for our family. The kids (4 and 2) were delighted by the treehouse, the play closet full of costumes, toys, and books, and the cozy loft space beautifully equipped for movies on a rainy day. The house was spotless and well-stocked for all of our needs, and the deer and cats that roam the properties were an added bit of magic to a relaxing time away. We were a short 10-15 minute drive from restaurants, parks, and other fun activities. We would come back in a heartbeat!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything exceeded our expectations!
An amazing house and guests! Thank you Javier and Mariela for having us. Definitely a place we will be back soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Would definitely visit again to enjoy more family time in the Poconos.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home
Spacious and inviting
Great option for families to disconnect and enjoy company"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at Javier’s place. It is exactly as described and the pictures are spot on. The beds are all comfortable and the entire house is decorated wonderfully! The fire pit on the back porch is very cozy and the adorable fairytale house in the back is adorable!! Javier was very communicative and available to help if needed. We look forward to staying here again in the future!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly a great place to hunker down and enjoy the woods. Lots of wildlife in the backyard, a short drive to hiking locations and the town of Stroudsburg."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I brought my kids (age 9 and 12) to Javier's house for a long weekend, which ended up not being long enough to enjoy everything about the house and surrounding area. We've decided we'll just have to return sometime! The house is spacious, spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. Plus, there's a ton of stuff there for younger kids to enjoy: the outdoor fairy house, an indoor playhouse, and lots of accessories to go with them. My kids are on the older side, but they were still thrilled with the house and said they were ""enchanted"". The hosts are very helpful and responsive, even sending me a video of how to use the nespresso machine since I am coffee-technology-impaired (there's also a keurig and a simple filter contraption for making coffee). And the house is only about a 10 minute drive to the charming downtown area of Stroudsburg, and about 30 minutes from Bushkill Falls which was amazing. My only complaint is something outside of the host's control, which is that getting through the front gate took a long time (15-20 minutes?) our first two times through, while all of the out-of-towners (including us) were getting their passes. So be prepared to wait a bit at the end of your drive. But we decided it was well worth it. Also, if you have any white noise machines, you might want to bring them along because sound travels in the large house. (Not a diss, just a suggestion; we forgot ours but we did OK.) Overall, highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have to give a 5 star review on Javier and Mariela's cozy fairytale home. it was absolutely perfect for our family with 2 young girls, 4 and 2. the home was perfectly stocked and had a little welcome package when we arrived. the deer that show up at the front door must be trained to do so lol. what a perfect touch! we foundwe were positioned close enough to restaurants/coffee shops and some shopping us all the great waterfalls north towards Raymondskill Falls down to Bushkill and some other hidden gems in between. We think it would be great for a small family or couple. beautiful home and lots of little extras, toys for the kids. Really inviting space and absolutely spotless. Just as advertised. We stayed at Hotel Hershey the night prior and kind of wish we'd just taken an extra day here it was so nice. Thanks to Javier for being in easy contact but not pressing us either"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved your home. Everything was clean and inviting. The woodsy area made for a great fall getaway. The gated community gave a safe feeling. The wine and chocolates were a great touch. Allowing our furry pooch to travel with us made it extra special and though we were not there for the summer season to enjoy some of the other community amenities, we are pretty confident we will be back with the rest of our family. Seeing the deer was a nice treat as well along with access to the gated dog park. Thank you again Javier and Mariela for allowing us to stay in your home and making us feel welcome. Tony and Ally"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Javier and Mariela’s. It’s a favorite destination for our family. The house is clean and well equipped. Everything is easy, it feels like home. This time we did Camel Beach water park one day, and a lovely farm tour day trip the second day. Great location, we are looking forward to being back soon."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Javier & Mariela are great hosts. There are so many thoughtful touches around the house that enhanced our stay. Our family enjoyed hanging out on the back deck watching the deer while the kids played in the tree house. We also had a lot of fun in the community - from the swimming pool to the tennis and basketball courts. We did have a brief issue with the internet but Javier was very responsive. Overall a fantastic holiday in the Poconos.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Javier & Mariela went above and beyond to provide a welcoming experience in their beautiful home. The extra care to details made the stay extra special, my three kids (my oldest being 6 years old) especially loved the exciting opportunity for lots of pretend play in both play houses, and fun new toys to explore. Even my dog had a great time 😆 The neighbors were also lovely and the gated community staff very organized and professional. Thank you again and we hope to return again!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful family vacation in this beautiful home. Children’s amenities galore, which we took advantage of! The backyard deck was a great place for the family to gather after breakfast and before dinner. The deer come right up to the railing. Lovely welcoming amenities and attention to detail by the hosts, who were readily available for any questions. Highly recommend"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, great hosts. Unfortunately, we had to cut our stay short a bit, we were sad to leave. The gated community is great, very green and quiet, still close to shops and family attractions. Our 8-year old niece loved the community pools, the small lake with a nice beach and the deer she spotted. We'd love to come back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Javier and Mariela were great with communication and the house was lovely. Was great sipping coffee watching deer walk by. Great location a few minutes from town. I highly recommend the property.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Perfect for a family getaway with young kids. The tree house and lake were a big hit! Javier & Mariela put a lot of thoughtful touches into the home. They are very responsive!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful weekend getaway! Home was exactly as appeared in photos! Cozy, comfortable and inviting! Lots of detail in providing every amenity. Great communication! Javier was Quickly and easily available! We used the community pool which was delightful and clean! Great weekend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was wonderful!! It was a recommendation from a friend and I’m so happy I listened to her. The home was clean and toddler friendly- which is a big deal for us. They even had an extra potty so we didn’t have to lug ours up and down the stairs. Our son loved all the toys and BOTH playhouses. The only downside the home had was a personal one - we found the queen beds too firm for our liking and I’m only adding this in if you have a back that requires something softer. The twin beds however are sooo comfortable! The community is amazing as well. We fed deer, played with fish in the lake, and spent a day hanging out in the pools. The community center also has really good food! Also good to note, the home is really close to Camelback/Aquatopia- something that really came in handy with a few days of not so great weather. Javier & Maria were amazing hosts and stayed in constant contact. We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great Airbnb! We had a wonderful stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough about Javier & Mariela and their beautiful, cozy home! Check-in was a breeze and Javier was in touch right away whenever we had a question. As soon as we entered, we noticed how clean everything was, and there was a lot of natural light coming through the large windows and skylight. There were a bunch of toys in the closet as well as everything a family with kids would need (I.e. a pack n’ play, booster seat and high chair). Our toddler loved playing on the Radio Flyer tricycle, and the older kids spent a lot of time in the adorable fairytale tree house. The outside deck was large and comfortable as well. My in-laws enjoyed walking to the lake and pool with the baby while the rest of us went to the local theme parks (which were all within 20 minutes driving distance). I would highly recommend this home to anyone looking to have a great family vacation in the Poconos!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Javier and Mariela were so helpful and what could have been a complicated check in process was made very easy thanks to clear instructions. They were so kind to leave us snacks for our toddler, and the entire property was very kid friendly. Really appreciated the baby gates for the stairs! The fairy tree house was SO cute and now I’m going to make my husband build one at our own home. We will be back in the fall hopefully"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect and as described. Highly recommended !!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great long weekend! Loved all of the kid friendly features and amenities!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very kind host, checks in regularly to make sure things are ok. Responds fast.
We appreciated that the house is baby proof (mostly the outlets) so our 1 yr old could walk around safely.
There is an outdoor plug which can be used for EV charging."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here a few weeks ago- what a great place! Super cozy with everything we could want. Javier even put in a bed rail for our toddler ahead of time. No need to bring toys, your kids will have plenty to play with. We definitely want to come back when the weather is nicer to take more advantage of being in the Poconos, but we still had a great time here. Plenty of restaurants and nearby activities, including deer watching from the living room. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was top-notch, clean, and exactly as described. Check in and communication were easy. Located in a community that felt very safe. With so many toys and playhouses, it was perfect for a family with a small child. Plus, there was a fireplace and also a cozy back porch to unwind on. We hope to return again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect place for a cozy family getaway. Quiet, comfortable, and incredibly clean—it had everything we needed and was by far the most kid-friendly rental (right word?) we’ve ever experienced. Our little one was so delighted by the tree house as well as the little playhouse in the kids’ bedroom (and he slept so well thanks to the blackout shades!) He also got a kick out of the outdoor dining domes at the very nearby Cinder Inn:) Thank you Javier and Mariela for sharing your beautiful home!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The personal touches and amenities were great and the are very responsive if there are any issues! I would stay there again any time!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. Javier provided lots of information about the house amenities prior to our visit and was fast to respond to questions we had during the stay. Looking forward to visiting again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I thoroughly loved our stay! The hosts were so accommodating and you could tell they put a lot of thought into making this a lovely and comfortable experience. The energy of the home is beautiful. We saw deer in the back yard, my daughter LOVED the tree house, the indoor dollhouse, and all the toys. She was whispering to her dad that she didn't want to leave when we were heading out. Definitely worth every penny!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend! My family loved the deer every morning
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, our two-year-old daughter, and I had a lovely stay at Javier and Mariela's home. Our daughter was enthralled with the tree house and playroom, and we enjoyed the cozy home and many amenities. We came for a long weekend simply to get away and relax and the home provided that for us and more. Great communication with Javier and we appreciated all the thoughtful touches on their part to make this a great experience. Many thanks!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family went back again. Who goes back if it doesn't meet or exceed their expectations? Great times and great memories. Thanks again Javier and Mariela!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was the perfect spot for our little family getaway! Javier and Mariela were so helpful and thoughtful. We can’t wait to go back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Javier and Mariela were great hosts, and the home was perfectly cozy, super clean and comfortable. My kids really enjoyed the house too, and they especially loved the little house in the kids bedroom and the little red tricycle. It was my daughter’s birthday, and they left a little welcome gift for her when we first arrived that made her night. We were all also able to watch the same family of deer pass through the yard every morning and night - which we all loved. We really enjoyed our stay here at this family-friendly home and would definitely pick this place again in the future!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hands down one of the most convenient and kid friendly Airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed in. Our son loved playing with all the toys, especially the doll house. Our elderly grandmother appreciated that there was a bedroom on the first floor.
It was clean and close by all the big attractions. We would 1000000% stay here again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family & I stayed here during the kids mid winter break. The neighborhood is quiet, safe & perfectly located to many different attractions, restaurants & stores in the area. The house was so beautiful. The tree house was so fun for my kids. Javier & Mariela really have a way of making you feel welcome in their home. They’re also very quick to respond to any questions which is great. I highly recommend this home. I know I’ll be trying to book again next time we go back to the Poconos."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend. Great hosts. Lots of communication and hospitality. Thanks!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was lovely. It was very clean, organized and full of all needed amenities. We liked how cozy it was. My wife, I and our dog stayed there for 3 nights, and we had plenty of room in the house for the 3 of us. The owner was also very responsive and helpful with suggestions. If we had any questions, he would respond within 5 min. The location of the house is convenient to ski resorts, hiking trails, shopping, restaurants and everything that we needed while staying there. This is the first Airbnb stay for us, and it exceeded our expectations. I think Javier and Mariela had set very high standards for future Airbnb houses that we visit. Thank you, Rami"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Whats not to love about a fairytale treehouse?!! My 4.5 year old son couldnt get enough of the outdoor and treehouses. The kids room was a blast- so nice when toys and books are provided. The house has an easy comfortable layout for a small family and is in a great location close to a lot of good hiking. I must have asked Javier & Mariela a hundred questions before booking and they were so communicative and kind offering plenty of suggestions for food and activities to keep us busy. We found great sledding nearby at Brodhead Creek park. You wo'nt regret your stay here. we hope to come back soon!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautifully decorated comfortable home. We saw so many deer and the kids loved the fairytale tree house. It was so nice to have a kids room. The community was so close to camelback mountain and near stores and restaurants m. We cooked each night and the kitchen was well equipped!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a great stay at this amazing house. We were still unpacking the car when we saw our deer in the backyard! We got a little snow the first night, had a fire going...it was perfect.
Javier provided all of the details well in advance and was quick to reply to any questions. I would highly recommend Javier & Mariela's house!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is beautiful . Javier snd Mariela are the best snd very understanding snd they quickly respond . They treat you like family . The place is so clean and updated . Love the woods around . Love the kids room for our daughter she loved that house couldn’t get her out of it . We love the natural light . We would come back .

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was great! Centrally located and clean! Javier was really easy to communicate with. Very accessible. We will book this home again in the future!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sounds good none have been more perfect… The owner took the time to make sure everything was clean and all of the amenities were provided. I wouldn’t have changed a thing about the home… It was perfect to have toys for the children to play with and it was such space for us all to spread out and yet still be together.
We enjoyed being cozy inside while we enjoyed the snowy background and the deer walking by. It was the best weekend we could have asked for to start off our new year.
A definite gem 💎"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication. Our kids loved all the games and activities in the house. They really enjoyed getting outside and exploring the wooded areas. Thanks for a great NYE vacation!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the house it was perfect for the kids (2 and 4) who were so entertained with both playhouses and all the toys!!! deer were outside every day visible from the large living room windows. We will definitely be back soon and really enjoyed our stay in this kid friendly home.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy and pleasant atmosphere has everything you need. Everything is clean and tidy. We recommend it for family with children this is perfect .
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Very clean and well maintained. There are lots of toys and a lovely tree house. Perfect place for kids.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a wonderful place to stay. Perfect for a family with kids. The hosts went beyond what was necessary....wonderful welcome for.our stay. Highly recommended
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect kid friendly house. Very cozy and clean. Can’t wait to book this house again! Hosts were great all around. communication was quick and easy. They even had a bottle of champagne and snacks in the house when we arrived which was a perfect way to start vacation! Thank you Javier and Mariela !
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Javier & Mariela’s house was impeccably clean and it had everything you could need! It’s gorgeous inside and the pictures don’t even do it justice. My kids LOVED the treehouse in the back and the house and toys in the kids room! It was a magical relaxing time! We would love to come back! The nearby lake was gorgeous, the playground was perfect for my kids and it was a great location for hikes! We have a such a relaxing week! You need to book this house!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great experience, highlyrecommended"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Javier and Mariela are amazing hosts! They clearly answered all of my questions before booking so quickly and were very accommodating. The house is beautiful on the inside and outside. It was exactly what we wanted a weekend away in the mountains with beautiful trees surrounding you, fall foliage, and deers! Really felt like a cozy warm cabin in the woods with the fireplace and feel of the place. We looked forward to cozy nights by the fire and comfortable couch. Another added bonus, it was the most kid friendly air bnb we have stayed out. A kids room with a kids table, tons of toys, books, potties, pack n play crib. They also have a little house in the kids bedroom which my daughter loved to play in and they also have a treehouse in the backyard with a kids kitchen! Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Javier and Mariela!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"TRUTH PREVAILED! So here’s the deal. The Mrs. and I do deep searches when we travel. It’s worth it to us. We narrowed our Poconos options to 5 and settled on Javier and Mariela’s place. Best move we made. [Side note, we went by the other 4 houses and they were annoyingly and frustratingly misleading. Many properties here are.]
Here’s why this got 5 stars from us:
1.) Truthfully advertised. It’s what is says and more. The house is cozy, inviting and this sounds corny but it just feels happy. After hiking all day it was a wonderful home to return to.
2. It’s got all the amenities you need. We cooked-in several meals and needed for nothing (but I had my own spice kit so that helped).
3.) Location. Oh the location. PERFECT for us. As far as home bases go, this was it. 15-20 minutes to one of the better towns in the Poconos (Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg), 50 minutes to Jim Thorpe (worth a visit once), 1 hr to Honesdale (cool little town for sure), 20 minutes to Camelback. It was all we needed. Plus the house is in a private community and specifically in what feels like a fun neighborhood. The neighbors decorate for Halloween, smile when you drive pass, etc. And oh the deer. All day every day around the house. It’s amazing.
4.) Javier + Mariela. Couldn’t be any nicer or more accommodating. Response time is about 30 seconds. They’re just great.
Thanks for having us. We would love to return.
Danny + Kim"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to stay if you are in the area. Very quite and safe community with a beautiful lake and creeks! Owners communication is top notch and they were very prompt to respond when ever we pined them. House is amazingly clean. Onset shared a detailed instruction which helped. Kitchen was stocked with all required stuff needed for cooking. K-cup Coffee collection is nice. We cooked meals and enjoyed it outside a cute porch overlooking cute little tree house and woods. We felt very safe with our 5 years and 1 year little ones. Beds were very comfy and house was spacious for our group (4 adults and 2 kids). Welcome hamper was extremely nice touch by the owners. If you are in area and looking for stay in a nice, safe community, please do yourself a favor and book this nice cozy and comfy house. We did and we have no regrets :)
Thank you so much Javier for allowing us rent your place."

The hosts were wonderful and we loved everything about the house! Would highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had an excellent stay and Javier and Mariela made sure that guests are comfortable. In fact, After our first day at the house Javier checked to make sure everything went fine.

Thanks Javier and Mariela."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would 100% recommend staying here. The house was immaculate and the hosts were super helpful and accommodating! You can tell they put a lot of love and care into setting this place up.
I can see why they're listed as Super-hosts! They were fantastic at communicating and making sure we were well taken care of.
Our girls had the time of their lives playing in the tree-house, swimming in the community pool and enjoying the wildlife. (We saw a fox, hawks and a lot of deer).
The location is wonderful, we would love to go back and experience different seasons here."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very kid friendly. Pool and lake is very close by— you can walk but we drive (2 min). Very clean house!!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very comfortable stay at Javier and Mariela’s place. It was home away from home. Place is very clean and had everything we needed. Location is great, attractions were 15 min away and essentials (grocery etc) was 10 min away. The home is located nearby the amenities (pool, tennis court, basketball court and soccer area). Highly recommend their home to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway. Comfortably sleeps for a family of 6. We will def come back in the near future."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home- very clean and cozy, and a/c worked great even though it was HOT outside when we were there! My 5yo absolutely loved all the toys and things to do, and the amenities available in the house were so fabulous. We loved going to the beach (we were so excited to find the sandcastle-making toys in the closet to use!) and to the pool, and also just hanging around the house. This is a great spot for families for sure!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If I could give this a 10 star review I would! The house is immaculate! The hosts are incredibly responsive and helpful! The house has everything you need for a nice getaway. The pool and lake within the complex are well taken care of and were not super crowded. The location is within about 20 minutes from a lot of great attractions including Camelbeach, Tannersville Outlets, and Bushkill Falls. We found a great trail along the river to bike and run on just 8 minutes from the house as well (PineBrooke Park). We stayed for a week with our 5 and 8 year-olds and had a great time! A special thank you to the hosts for graciously mailing a forgotten item to us. Again, I cannot say enough positive things about this rental!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a fantastic stay that we had. Javier and Mariela were amazing hosts. Was a great spot for some summer pool and lake time!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this house! The house is setup for families with kids so it fit our needs perfectly with a 6 and 4 year old. Everything was very clean and the welcome basket was a nice surprise! The hosts were very quick to get back to us with answers to any questions we had. Location was pretty good being about 20-40 minutes to most activities and hikes. Overall, we had a nice stay and would recommend to anyone with little kids traveling to the area."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house and the amenities. Really appreciate that the house is kid-friendly and provided toys, high chair, security gate for the stairs and the tree house."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is clean, beautifully decorated, and caters to the little ones which was perfect was us! Great night sleep and soft linens.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Javier was an exemplary host. His communication prior to the stay and even during was just perfect. The place was well located and very well stocked.
Javier had a bottle of champagne waiting upon our arrival, which was really special since we came with our family to celebrate my sister-in-laws engagement. I highly recommend this Airbnb and host."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Showers had low water flow and toilets constantly plugged up
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin in a private community with lots to do. Well located in the heart of the Poconos. The bedding was ultra comfortable and the entertainment system was great for movies and games. Heating worked very efficiently and the kitchen and grill did the job for us.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautiful! My family and I absolutely loved and enjoyed our stay here. Best for families with small children, especially busy ones! (They had everything needed: high chair, crib, etc.) The space was clean and very accurate to the pictures! Will definitely come back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Very spacious and comfortable. The location was great, too. Very convenient to everything. Kids enjoyed the tree house as well as the park in the community. We cooked a few meals and the kitchen had anything we could need, including an electric can opener and several bowls, cookware, etc.
Highly recommend if you're traveling to the Poconos. Owners were very responsive and kind."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an awesome spot for kids! Feels like most Airbnb places don’t want kids, this one is catered to them! So great!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"And and my wife enjoyed our stay so much the pictures were amazing but when you get there and see it in Person … sheesh! 10/10. Ima be back for
Sure"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed a long weekend stay at Javier and Mariela's house. The house and amenities are accurately described in the listing and most reviews. The house was warm and cozy with plenty of space for up to 6, although the room with two twins is best suited for kids since it's a little smaller and the indoor playhouse is in that room. There was a lot of snow on the ground (February), but the driveway was very well cleared.
Javier communicated very well ahead of time and when we had one question. He provides detailed instructions for getting a temporary pass for your car. The security people are a little brusque, but we didn't have any problems getting the pass or getting in and out easily.
We would stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Javier & Mariela’s. There is a ton of baby gear - high chair, toys, booster seat, monitor, baby gates, crib, etc. The welcome basket and bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, hair dryer) were much appreciated! My kids loved sledding, playing in the playhouses, and watching the deer. Note: the downstairs bed is pretty firm, but the beds upstairs were more comfortable. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a bit of a mixed review because while the house was as described/depicted, the hosts were generous in leaving a welcome basket of Prosecco and snacks, and Javier was very quick to respond to me whenever I messaged through the app, we also experienced a pretty major problem with toilets not working during our stay. We noticed a bit of a problem as soon as we arrived, but by the next day we had one toilet not working at all. When I messaged Javier to report the problem, he replied right away, but we were also right in the middle of a three-day snowstorm. As such, a plumber couldn’t come and even though Javier offered to look himself, the roads weren’t plowed so we told him to stay home and we’d try to make it work. He suggested pouring hot water in the toilets and this did get them usable on a temporary basis. We tried to muddle through that way for a few days, in part because we were nervous about having someone outside our pod in the house during COVID, but eventually requested a plumber. We messaged Javier fairly late at night, he replied right away, and had a plumber there by noon the next day. I write this full description to say that Javier did the best he could as a host in this situation, but it’s also not a five star experience if you’re constantly worrying about whether toilets will work. Hopefully it’s one of those things that was a fluke and is resolved. One other small thing to report is that the coffee pot needs to be replaced— it is taped and has a crack in the glass. I’m guessing this just hasn’t been reported to the hosts.
I can say that our three year old absolutely adored the house and didn’t want to leave. As many reviewers have said, it is a wonderful place for small children with a fun kids bedroom, toys, books, outdoor playhouse, and lots of other things you might need— gate for the stairs, high chair, etc. In general, the space was large and comfortable. Lots of natural light and deer roaming in the yard (again, delightful for our child). I stayed in the queen bedroom upstairs and I wish there was a bedside table on the right side of the bed— it’s kind of a bummer to feel around for my glasses on the floor in the darkness.
I was very happy that the hosts had left a shovel and ice melt out, since we stayed during a heavy snowstorm. My husband thought the hosts should have offered to shovel/plow the driveway, but I sincerely wanted the outdoor time and exercise so I didn’t mind shoveling and didn’t ask for any help from the hosts. If you’re traveling during snow and this would be a concern to you, I’d assume the hosts would work with you because they seem very nice."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect to travel with 2 kids . Had lots of toys , high chair, crib and playhouse , which meant we didn’t have to pack the whole house with us . Only 20-25 mins to mountain . They left us a sweet welcome package with champagne and sweet treats which was so thoughtful . They responded to all of our questions quickly. Great weekend getaway!"

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and very clean!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, very clean and warming"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely house, perfect for traveling with young children! They made it so easy - had all the needed baby/toddler supplies there so I didn't need to worry about packing a crib, high chair, etc. Clean, organized. Had a wonderful trip!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely week-long stay in the Poconos. Using the All Trails ap, we found many excellent hiking locations. Given Covid, we cooked at home and didn't visit any restaurants. But it appears that there are plenty of eating choices in the area when Covid is behind us. The house has a great kitchen set up and large living room space with comfy sofas. We spent a lot of time in those spots."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is AMAZING. It is spotless and GORGEOUS! The owners are amazing and amazing communicators. They had candy and champagne ready for us. A great experience!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, exactly as pictured, even down to the Christmas decorations which was definitely unexpected but so nice. Our toddler loved all the toys and playhouses, as well sitting in front of the fireplace while it snowed outside at night. Mariela was quick to respond to all of our questions and accommodating to our needs. She didn’t even get upset when our son broke one of the lamps. The house probably needs a little updating in the kitchen and bathrooms and there isn’t too much to do in close proximity (especially right now) but it’s the perfect place for some quiet, family time in a cozy and comfortable space. You can tell the hosts truly care about the house and their guests. Thank you Mariela and Javier!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really great house! Open, spacious layout, beautifuly designed. We really enjoyed just being in the house on a very cold weekend. Our 2 yo son loved the tree house outdoors and the wooden house indoors. The house was full of toys and games for him to enjoy."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Spotlessly clean cabin with all the amenities and personal touches that make a visit special. Especially great for families with young kids...plenty of toys to keep them entertained!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at Javier & Mariela’s house. It was extremely clean, spacious, and well-appointed with linens, towels, soaps, shampoos, cooking supplies, dinnerware- everything you could possibly need!
In addition to all of this, the house was very kid-friendly and had a crib, safety gates, baby bath, bassinet, and loads of toys, plus TWO playhouses- one inside the children’s bedroom and one outside in a tree. Our two year-old absolutely loved staying here and was so excited to play in this new environment each day, and all of the amenities made traveling with our four month-old very easy.
They made check-in very easy, and the community they love in seems safe and secure. It also has two playgrounds, which was great even in the cold weather. There are tons of deer around, which my son loved spotting!
Most of all, Javier & Mariela are very responsive and quick to address any questions and concerns you may have. I can not recommend this property enough. It’s no wonder they are considered Superhosts!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a nice getaway. The area was very quite and the house was clean and cozy.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous house in a lovely setting. We loved seeing the deer up close every day, the cozy fireplace, the enormous kitchen, the softest and fluffiest blankets, and - most especially - how much our kiddo loved the playhouse in her room and the fairy tree house out back. Definitely hope to visit again when we can take advantage of the amenities. It was a perfect getaway for our family! Thank you Javier and Mariela!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Clean space, nice patio and good value, hosts were very responsive and nice. Cons: Master bed mattress was extremely hard, house was very close to other houses, and the location in a gated community was a pain due to long lines at the gate. Visitors being prohibited was also frustrating."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent spot to get away with a young family . . . We saw deer nearly every day, enjoyed the warm fire, and really appreciated the features that helped us spend time together as a family (such as a high chair and baby gates). Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was extremely receptive, fast with responses and informative. Very clean, resourceful (available wash machine, dishwasher, soaps, shampoo, etc.) and very beautiful looking apartment. Check in & checkout was easy. AC works great. Furniture was comfortable. Clean floors, up-to-date looking apartment :)! Very nice surrounding area. For the price, it was WELL worth it and would for sure consider coming again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful apartment.. definitely not what I expected walking in ! ( will definitely book again )
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing spot, plenty of parking, super clean, pillows were comfortable, brita filter in fridge for filtered water.
Must pay extra for early check in and late check out.
Only thing that was less than ideal is that late check out was not granted to us until an hour before normal check out, despite the fact that my request for late check out was well in advance (days ahead). On morning of check out, received a reminder to check out by 11, and then afterwards, a message stating that late check out is granted. By then we had already made alternative plans. Wish the communication on this point was better.
But other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To start, I knew I wanted to stay somewhere very nice and when I came across this place I knew it was gonna be my top pick. This place looks exactly like the pictures and there’s more to see when you actually check in! It was so clean and I absolutely love the aesthetic. There’s a beautiful river that my partner and I sat by and had a mini picnic! Surrounding area also has a bunch of restaurants (mostly pubs) which great food. My favorite was the “farmhouse”! The only thing I will say is the pinpad to the room was hard to get a first but all you need is a little push!
Anyways, If you’re looking for somewhere nice to stay definitely make this the top of your list. Not to mention the hosts were amazing and very responsive! I definitely will be booking here again"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using AirBnB and let me tell, Elle & Josh have set the bar high. From the responsiveness and accommodations to their amazing suite we stayed at! We found a great deal and decided to stay in the poconos for the weekend. The suite we stayed at was squeaky clean, and very welcoming. The place looked just as the pictures if not better!
The master bedroom bed was (super comfy). We even asked the host if they can send us the info on the mattress.

Convenient to the highway and Camelback, walking distance to both Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg downtowns, plenty of nice local restaurants and bars. The apartment is very nice. Hot water was a bit limited. The host explained this was a building problem. Also, we could clearly hear voices from the apartment next to the master bedroom but fortunately they were not up late."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very pleased with our stay. Place is even nicer than photos. High end condo finishes in prestige condition. Private, zen-y, quiet and spacious place. Loved the high ceilings and industrial feel. Lots of restaurants nearby. Shawnee ski mountain a quick ride away. Responsive host just a message away. Exceptionally comfortable linens on bed. Highly recommend a stay here. Perfect for a couple, yet big enough to accommodate a family."

All of our clothes, shoes, snow gear, and suitcases fit with extra room. The bathrooms were the cleanest out of any air bnb I’ve stayed. The kitchen is spacious and stocked. It was nice being able to cook meals rather then go out to eat. The beds were extra comfy…. We are actually looking to buy one for home now! Our host responded to all questions fast. Grocery store and Walmart are literally across the street. Plenty of restaurants and pubs in the area for eating too. Washer and dryer on premise was great after a day on the slopes."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very clean and spacious. If you ever want to cook they have every cooking appliances available and there is a nice laundry room. Entire apartment has high ceilings and there are only two windows in the entire apartment so you barely get any sunlight. However, you have to do your own dishes and put the towels in the washers even though you are paying for cleaning fees. The apartment has quiet hours and somewhat sound proof, I was able to hear the next door neighbors conversation, maybe they were too loud but sounded pretty clear. They have Netflix available for you and there are TVS in the bedroom and living room area. Walmart is within walking distance and restaurants are very close. Overall I would give this apartment five stars and communication with the host was very easy and fast."

We had no issues whatsoever with booking and check in, and Elle was super responsive and kind in following up with quick clarification questions.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although we only stayed for one night, we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very clean (I’m a bit OCD when it comes to cleanliness and I was pleasantly surprised), located in a safe and convenient location and you are also given a parking spot.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I was very happy with this apartment. I will say I could have saved time if I had read the check in instructions.

It took about 14 minutes to get to Shawnee. I will stay again.

2024-06-01,3.0,Group trip,Host was great. But the whole house was dark even with all the lights on. It didn’t match the picture as it seems very bright.

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I am sorry, but I need to give a 3-star rating for this place for the following reasons:
1. Getting into this place is a lot more complicated than expected.
2. The place looks much smaller than it appears in the pictures.
3. Most importantly, when I booked this place, we planned to cancel it within another 15 minutes, but the cancellation policy was so weird that it only offered a 40% refund of the original payment.
4. ⁠We booked this place specifically to have a BBQ, and when we arrived, the police told us that outdoor BBQ is not allowed, which was very disappointing, and the owners didn't notify us about this beforehand."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was exactly as described, beautiful!! The owner was very good at communicating when needed.

I was a little upset about the fire pit being full of water and not being able to find wood. There was also a noise in the house which we at first thought was the ice maker but then couldn’t find out where it was coming from and kept some of us up at night. But over all house was comfortable and nice for our weekend trip."

Was the perfect space for our bundle of kids and home cooked meals. Home needs some cutting boards, baking sheets and maybe another set of silverware. We had a fun time exploring and hiking around the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The host, Ey, is very responsive. Ey would answer any questions within an hour usually. Ey gives clear instructions for accessing the gated community and will follow up to make sure you have an easy check in.

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Ey is a great host very communicative and quick to response, my reservation was a last minute and I appreciate how soon she help me with the rental process .
The pros and cons of the house
Pro: house is very peaceful and quiet, we loved the silence and we sleep a lot
Price was ok
Bed is comfortable
Cons: gate entrance with gps take you to the back of the community and it’s a hassle to go back to the main entrance following a guide they provide you at the gate
The house looks humongous in the pictures and I got surprise with the small it is specially the patio , ( less filter)
If you like to cook and grill don’t expect any condiments in the house not even salt, not even sugar for the coffee ☕️, make sure you bring all your seasoning condiment ( I do understand some hostess do it as complimentary)
The patio was dirty and grill so I clean but I do understand it was a last minute reservation so no house cleaning was able to do it before
Also there is only one TV for the whole house"
2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"Upon arrival, we were not registered for the stay. Had to wait 20 minutes for host to send the info to the Welcome Center. There are a lot of rules for this house. Failure to follow would result in $50 fines."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was super nice and clean. Felt immediately comfortable and was able to enjoy the night with no issues! We definitely hope to be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks Ey for hosting us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ey provided clear instructions once we booked our stay in order to have a smooth check-in. The place is as pictured, and we had enough seats and beds for 5 adults and 3 children. The towels were limited and on the smaller size, so I would recommend bringing a few extra, especially if you plan on using the pool. There was hotel-sized body soap so it can feel limiting if you are a large group staying. Wish we had some of the basics for cooking beyond salt and pepper such as additional seasoning and cooking oil. There were 3 pods of coffee, but luckily we had brought our own. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a family getaway. We enjoyed the sauna, game room, balcony, hammocks and deck for outdoor grilling."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,nice and clean house~ I loved the privacy and fun games at the house!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great time in this place, i really enjoyed the outdoors nature, its a quiet private neighborhood,
recommended"
2023-06-01,3.0,Group trip,"The strict and overbearing rules of the gated community that this house is located in prevented us from fully enjoying our stay. They required way too much information from the guest including. licensee plate numbers , year make model and color of the vehicles as well as first and last name of all guests and if they were under 21 years old. It was as if we were staying at the White House. We ordered a pizza to the house they wouldn’t even allow a delivery driver in the community we had to drive all the way to the gate to get our food. We also had a driver come to pick us up for dinner and they would not allow him in unless I provided his plate number and name to security and when I did this they said the name had to be given from the home owner so instead of enjoying my trip I had to make about 15 phone calls trying to relay basic information and we wound up once again just having to drive to the security gate to get picked up. The house itself was very nice and clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was clean and in a very nice gated community. Ey was excellent to communicate with. The only real downside was gaining entry into the gated community. When we first got there (the GPS took us to the back gate), the gate was closed to anyone who was checking in for the first time. So, we ended up having to figure out how to get to the Welcome Center which was a bit of a drive to get to the other entrance. Once there, it was relatively easy to get in with an ID. It was also a huge hassle to get into the community via an Uber which was a problem for all involved after we went on a Trolley tour of local wineries for the day. So, make sure you go to the front gate, and if you plan on getting an Uber, make sure they are able to get access to the community first.
That being said, again, Ey was great and the place itself was very nice and well maintained."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home and amazing stay. Loved the fire pit and living room. Such a cozy home and will love to come back in the winter.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great house just wasn’t able to used the outdoor chimney because it was flooded.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"he is a very kind hostess. She responds very quickly. She helps you to roast the end of your stay in her beautiful and beautiful house ,the house is very beautiful and as shown in the photographs ,very cozy the place felt like I was in my own house and the days of my stay were very relaxing and I will definitely go back to hospitaling in her house. Thank you for being on the lookout for us"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,VERY clean. Lot’s of Beds in various combinations. Newly Renovated… great value!
2023-03-01,3.0,Group trip,"just to point some points out about daily necessary home products missing while our stay.
Mop, wipes, dish washer detergent, just one napkin roll. Also it is advised on the notice here that washing dishes is required or there will be $50 extra charge but there was no detergent to wash and $250 cleaning fee is not justified if we have to clean."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was wonderful and really great. Good kitchen with all the essentials. Also has plenty of beds.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This property was perfect for our weekend getaway. The location is close to everything.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice experience.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Check in was easy and place was just like the pictures. Pictures seem a bit bigger but wasn’t that big. It was just right for a group of 10ppl. Place seem renovated which was nice. Now, place did have a bit of a dust but I feel that it was from the renovation. Stairs to the upstairs floor was a little dirty.
Kitchen didn’t have spices nor brooms to clean crumbs from the little mess we made in the morning with kids. Not, enough towels or no towels in the rooms for guests. And there was this annoying sound coming from the outside by the downstairs bedroom which never went off. I’m assuming it was from the heater. It was a bit annoying but I got use to it. Also, no tvs in the rooms which I didn’t mind at all.
Overall, the place is great with games for the kids and adults. Loved that the top rooms had access to the outside (meaning sliding doors to outside). Loved the fire place. Pool table was a great entertainment for the adults. We definitely loved the place and you get to see deers"

Nearby supermarket which was great and a candle store. There was one question I texted him about (can’t remember what it was ) but his response was quick and also let me know he could be reached at anytime.
Would def go back if I have something planned in that area"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mr James’ place was very nice and cozy and very close to great local restaurants and skiing. The living room was very nice with multiple couches and a large tv. The walls are a bit thin so we could definitely hear other tenants in the building as described in the initial description. Otherwise we had a great stay and a great time exploring the area!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot to spend a weekend. The area is very quiet and private. No noise around the spot at all.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very happy staying here. Very close to everything you need, and still very quiet and cozy."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The property was very well Maintained and close to everything. My only issues were that it was a little difficult to determine which property was the air bnb. There really is no clear marker therefore I found myself making several u turns to determine the home. The other thing was the code for the door didn’t seem to work properly when I returned a second time to the property at 1am ( which was a little scary since it was dark on the main road). I had to enter it multiple times to enter the home, lastly the bedroom ceiling fan was extremely loud. It actually woke me out of my sleep.
Other then that the location was great and the unit was perfect for one person.
I communicated one time with the owner and he was responsive in a very timely manner and informative of the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extremely clean place. Comfortable bed. Nice living room and kitchen. Close to everything in the area.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A very cute place with many modern upgrades, and the host James was very responsive! Comfortable even with 4 people and a dog. We had earplugs or white noise and did not notice neighbors at all. Note that the bathroom is off of the bedroom."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great, quaint place to stay! Just what we needed to recharge after a day of fishing and hiking nearby with our daughter and dog. Easy check-in and cute space!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mr. James’ space was lovely. Clean upon arrival, the accommodations were just as described."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We want to bring to your attention a few things we encountered at the J spot. The apartment was noted to be very clean with very strong air fresheners. It was quaintly cozy, however it wouldn’t be my first choice with the list of concerns
- [ ] porch light inoperable. Very dark outside and unable to determine which location as the address is the same on each apartment door
- [ ] Kitchen table chair seat unsecured
- [ ] Front porch railing loose-potential fall hazard
- [ ] Bathroom power socket inoperative
- [ ] Bedroom fan very very noisy
- [ ] Bed sheets would not stay in place
- [ ] Toilet is positioned In a small cornered space where you can’t sit squarely, you have to sit to the side of the toilet.
- [ ] Front window curtains facing busy road do not allow privacy- unable to close
I asked for a cancellation for the remaining 2 nights after our first night of initial expressed concerns without any accommodation. Further stay revealed additional concerns my spouse noted. Our stay was not comfortable as the stated issues were quite a nuisance."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Found this place on a whim after traveling 3 hours with my family and our hotel plans falling through. This was our first time staying at an air Bnb and it was such a nice/relaxing experience. Easy check in and the house was clean and cozy. Only 8 minutes away from Walmart and 25 minutes to kalahari. 2 adults and 1 toddler and it was just enough space.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay with our pup! Perfect location. James also allowed us to check in slightly early since we arrived to town earlier than expected. We’d definitely come back if we are in town again. :)
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Decent spot. We only stayed one night so didn’t use anything besides the bed and shower. Listing makes it seem like this is stand alone but it is In a house with very this walls, neighbors alarm had us up at 4Am and they didn’t shut it off for several minutes. Dishwasher was full when we arrived, luckily we didn’t need the kitchen. There was a broken chair on the porch that could of been picked up to make it a little cleaner. Overall a decent place"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Driveway was a bit muddy but besides that great stay you get exactly what’s in the pictures.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great value.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot and conveniently near mountains for snowboard/ski trips. Everything inside the place was lovely.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great for our short stay- including its location and close to highway. The apartment was clean and cozy- we were grateful for hot water 😅 Would definitely come back!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy and bright lighting during the day, everything was clean and check in and communication was very easy."
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is in a very convenient location to the ski mountains around town. Was about a 30 minute drive to Jack Frost and is about the same to Camelback.
It's a one bedroom place and is slightly cramped but for a couple or a small group it's not too bad.
A couple things to know ahead of time: You can hear the neighbors through the bedroom wall and on the second floor above you very well and we had to deal with that at 2, 3, and 4am across our stay. The toilet in the bathroom is very cramped and you can't sit directly on it. Lastly, the place is right off of a busy road so if you're used to city noise it will be fine but if you're not it might be hard to sleep at night. The cars are pretty loud going past.
Overall it's a nice place and is a good value for what you get."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So cute!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is a great value. Host was super easy to communicate with and check in and out were fast and easy. Apt had everything we needed. Nice upgraded features along with extremely comfortable furniture. This was a better value than a hotel with more amenities! We were in town for the weekend and this location was perfect! Would love to stay again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Would recommend this spot to anyone staying in the area. Great for a quiet weekend away from the city or for someone who needs a place to rest after a long day hiking the water gap.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the size of this place, clean and cozy. Would definitely stay here again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect cute, quiet place for a short work trip."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great space for a weekend in the Poconos to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday weekend. It's cozy and comfortable!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for a week and it was great for what we (and our pup) needed. The place is really cute just like the photos. I’d fully recommend it to a couple without kids or single travelers.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, great stay! Value was great, location is what we needed; James was very communicative."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Besides the street noise of cars passing , the house itself was a delight ."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host is very responsive, place is well kept and clean as well as central to lots of sightseeing areas!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as shown..it was clean and comfortable even had a nice area to walk the dog. The apartment was located near lots of fun things to do.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I saw some reviews about the place being loud, but it really wasn’t loud at all. Had a great vacation!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mr. James was responsive and easy to work with. The home was clean and welcoming and would be a great option if you’re visiting the area! It’s only took us about 20 minutes to get to Bushkill Falls and there are quite a few options around for a place to eat.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really adorable stay! Easy check-in and clean with very comfortable bed. Mr. James was also great with communication.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was nice and clean!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cozy little area and a great price considering what the hotels are charging for a night’s stay. You can hear the road at night, but if you like white noise, you’ll be fine. You can also hear the neighbors walking around upstairs, but it stopped around 10pm. Overall, a lovely stay."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Returned to this cozy place -- surely the most comfortable and inviting living room in the area
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful little space! Highly recommend.
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property is clean with disinfectants all around. The main road was VERY close. We let the host know who wasn’t too accommodating. Eventually the dog settled down and everything was okay. Only the front yard (near the main road) can be used so don’t expect a quiet “pocono getaway” however the pizza place across the streets (toninos) was huge portions and pretty darn good! Location is great to be in the middle of things, not so great for a quiet getaway. Road and upstairs neighbors are pretty noisy for timid dogs, not a “quiet woodsy getaway”. Everything was clean though which i appreciated."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mr. James made check in so easy! The airbnb was exactly what I expected and he provided a lot of brochures for local activities.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great day experience with my husband! The location was the best part. We were near all convenient stores, restaurants, and activities. I recommend the place!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place pretty much as advertised. We had everything we needed. Place is relatively close to different stores, restaurants and pretty close to Camelbak as well. Mr. James was really prompt with the responses whenever we had questions. If I had a complaint, it would just be that the neighbors upstairs were moving around a lot at random times during the day/night and you could hear it but nothing too serious. Overall it was a great stay and I would come here again"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay with my mom & sis! Two of us slept in the bed & one slept on the couch. We wanted a day in the Pocono’s and it was perfect location to Stroudsburg town and wineries, etc. It had a cute little cottage feel. We weren’t there much but no complaints when we were. There’s lots of brochures with local places too which was nice"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The j-spot was a cozy and accommodating stay for us. The interior is very clean, stylish and comfortable in a great location so we could get to camelback in under a half hour. Would recommend staying here!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A very cute place close to many activities! The place was very clean and had everything needed for a weekend away in the Poconos.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was in a great location, easy to get to all the great Pocono spots and large enough for 2! The only issue we faced was the cleanliness of the home when we arrived, which was resolved and some hostility over the complaint. Other than that it is a comfortable place to stay for a quick getaway."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and in a perfect area for Shawnee mountain .
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot to stay, highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay. It looks even better then the pics on the airbnb website show. We stayed one night before hitting the slopes the next day. We felt right at home and will definitely be returning! Highly Recommend for anyone visiting the Poconos area.
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The J spot was at a prime location for camelback mountain adventures. It says it can sleep 4 but I think any more than 2 people and it would be a little crowded and uncomfortable. It was super clean with everything we needed to cook and a bunch of spices. The water dispenser had an empty water cannister on it, so we had to go out and buy one to drink filtered water. There was a very strong smell to thr place that gave both of us a headache. Its hard to say what It was was but it was a sharp smell. The bedding and bed were super comfortable and so were the couches and there were 2 nice user friendly TVs. The neighbors upstairs were very loud. One of their phones were vibrating on the floor on and off for about 30 minutes at 4 am for 5 minute intervals at a time until I started knocking on the ceiling. James was always available when we needed to chat with him and was very helpful"
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a couple
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little spot for a ski trip getaway!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Very comfortable and cozy. There is an avenue nearby but nothing to disturb sleeping. There are neighbors upstairs walking. But it was not a problem. I recommend and plan to return again. 😊
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and cozy place to stay. 20 min from camelback and 45 min from blue mountain
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our host and cohost have done a wonderful job creating a stylish and comfortable space. The appliances are new and modern, and the very artistic touches in every room make for a much needed welcome and respite. I had a few glitches in my stay, and not only was the response time immediate, but so was the remedy---amazing!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"MrJames’s place was cozy and cute and perfect for a couple or single guest- it was well stocked with cooking utensils (and a kettle!) and had all the necessities to relax and enjoy oneself when not out and about. Good storage space, well heated, a huge TV in the bedroom, well lit, and of course Mr James was very quick to respond to any messages and accommodating of my last minute booking! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended this stay. Cheers!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mr. James’ place is a good place to stay. The apartment is cozy and perfect for two people. Everything in the apartment is up to date and the location is great. Stores and restaurants are nearby.

2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, perfect for a couple’s getaway. It had everything we needed and close to a lot of Pocono attractions. The fact that it was dog friendly was a big bonus! If you are a light sleeper i would bring earplugs, the house is off of a semi busy road and there are upstairs neighbors, but we did not have any problem sleeping in the comfy bed."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in process, right on a main road with quick and easy access to anything you need."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very convenient. Space was super cute and cozy !"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at this location — easy check in, comfortable couch and bed, and clean space. Was perfect for lounging and relaxing after a day of hiking"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is very clean and there are a lot of extra touches, like tea, coffee, fresh clean towels, and free shampoo, that added to our overall comfort. The bed was very soft and plush, and the area is convenient for going to restaurants or activities nearby."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute first floor 1 bedroom apt. We stayed for one night and it suited our needs. It was clean, cozy and we enjoyed the decor. We were about 20 minutes away from bushkill falls and plenty of other natural sights in the area.
Con-Unfortunately my husband did not sleep very well mostly due to noise from the neighbors walking around above through the night."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little place was perfect for our stay! It was conveniently located near many great hiking trails, local amenities, and the campground our family was staying in. The house was clean, check in and out were easy, and we had a couple good night's sleep there. Definitely would recommend to someone looking for a great weekend in the area!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot. It is exactly what you see. Would stay twice.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is conveniently located in the Poconos area, with a really quick ride to many locations. Lots of beautiful parks, creeks, and hiking in the area. There's a Walmart 9 min away, and a Weis grocery store just down the road. Although the house is on a bit of a busy road, we didn't really notice the noise unless the windows were open, and at night it wasn't a problem. The space was really clean and organized and had everything we needed, including a kitchen well stocked with cooking utensils. Would definitely come again for our next Poconos vacation!"
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The floors in at least one room were quite dirty, there were winged ants in the bathroom and the sheets had small hairs throughout them. It’s also most definitely located on a loud main road. Everything else was good. The living room furniture was modern and comfy, TVs were huge, the mattress was nice (new pillows would be a plus though) and the shower pressure was strong with plenty of hot water."
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed twice, once on our travels up and once on the way back home a week later.
Pros: Easy to find via gps. Easy check in with key code entry. Relatively new appliances/couches/tv. Host responded quickly. Pet friendly. Easy access to interstate and mountain hiking trails. Yard in front of home.
Cons: Home is older than photos show, photos show mostly modern appliances and couches but home is older with windows difficult to open and close and baseboard heating. TV volume gave off static sound regardless of what program. Other house/people living upstairs that you could hear walking. Couple items were broken during first stay (freezer handle and bathroom window), handle fixed by second stay and packing tape over bathroom window but window still remained cracked."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a cute little place and exceeded my expectations. Nice little kitchen, living room and 1 bedroom. Everything was well kept. Would definitely book this place again."

The living room was very cozy to watch movies in. The bedroom was comfortable, but if you’re over about 6’ the shower is rather short so prepare to play limbo while washing your hair. All in all it’s a great stay."

PS: I left few dollars tips for cleaning people. I suggest to you too leave any appreciation tips to cleaning guys. I think what they do is worse to have tips, because the place was clean. (Sorry if i have any grammatical mistakes , english is my 4th language)"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As apart of a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, I rented this air bnb because it was super close to Shawnee and he loves skiing. We also did some hiking and it was very close to cherry loop, Appalachian trail and Mt. Tammany which was a pleasant surprise! Very clean, cute and perfect for a couple wanting to get away for a few nights. We have already talked about coming back when the weather gets warmer as we would like to do some more hiking. A great place for a great value and close to many different food places and a super market. We were very pleased, thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. Garth was very responsive. Location was great, peaceful but also close enough to anything you need. Bushkill falls was only 10 or so minutes away, to hike and see the falls."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway (:
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we regularly travel to Maine, and need a place halfway to rest (11-12 hours a day of driving is enough!), soooo we had a place that we used, but then Garth’s place popped up. OMG, I actually hate to make it known, for fear that we may lose out on coming back, but this place is amazing. a gem. a bucket list destination. the river is right there! the sound is so soothing. the interior design is beautiful. everything you need and more. our dogs totally had enough room and were at peace (besides the sighting of a rotund groundhog!). anyway, we love love love this place! can’t recommend enough."

Garth responded so quickly to a couple of questions I had so no need to ever worry about not being taken care of. ✌🏻"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place , we loved the view , the super comfortable cabin. The surroundings are very nice . And Garth as always a very good host. It's the second one sees that we stay in a cottage from him, and we will definitely keep doing it."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Beautiful view and sunroom! Perfect for an anniversary trip or a weekend getaway! Went to Kalahari for the day and felt nice to come back and relax!! Only downside was the road to get there. No problems because we had truck but definitely bumpy lol. Garth was helpful and answered right away. Overall great stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First let me start by saying that pictures don’t do it justice, if you’re a nature lover like I am you’ll definitely love staying here! The scenery was straight out of a movie. I decided to walk around the area and it was nothing but peace and quiet. The fire pit was such a vibe a night 100% recommend. Will definitely book again in the near future! Such an amazing host! Thank you Garth for letting us stay in your beautiful home."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed for a long weekend for a little get away. The place was beautiful and the view of the river was very peaceful. They first night we sat on the front porch for dinner and just listened to the river. The cabin looked exactly like the pictures. Garth was very responsive and answered any questions we had. The only thing was the bed was very noise any time one of us moved.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful little place to stay at. Very relaxing to sit in the enclosed porch and watch the stream roll by.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay. Clean, cozy, well maintained cabin and Garth has everything you need available. Really nice, private area. River is right there. I definitely plan to stay at Garth’s cabin again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very special place -- both the location and the renovated cabin. While situated not far from the main thoroughfare off a couple back roads, you feel in a totally secluded secret place. Updated, fully-appointed, clean, easy to figure out, with many small amenities -- coffee and full spice rack to boot! Garth was responsive, courteous, and very helpful. A little slice of heaven."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the cabin 2 nights and overall had a great experience with just a couple of issues. Let’s start with the amazing:
The location: it is a beautiful home in a peaceful little slice of nature. The river is perfection and the highlight of the trip for my husband. There’s enough houses to not feel isolated but far enough apart for privacy. Lots of exterior lighting.
Sunroom: immaculate (I could have spent the whole time in there)
Bathroom: gorgeously done, with a heater and deliciously hot water.
Misc: heaters with mounted remotes in living spaces; spices in the kitchen; fast wifi; nice neighbors
However a couple of things can use improvement:
The bed is squeaky, the pillows are flat and the mattress absolutely wrecked our backs.
The 2 sets of double windows in the front do not lock and can be pulled open from the outside. (I’m hoping this is on their list of exterior improvements)
We want to come back so hopefully they get more secure windows soon."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super friendly and amazing property would definitely come back here!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was beautiful, the sound of the water was extremely soothing. Garth helped us with everything we needed. Overall amazing place and experience"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience thanks to Garth. I wanted to go on a little getaway with my girlfriend for her birthday and this was the perfect place. I was a little nervous when booking because there were no reviews at the time and again it was my first time using Airbnb but this place was amazing. Garth was very nice & super responsive!! He even went out of his way to set up birthday balloons for me. My girlfriend & i will definitely be booking again this summer!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Garth is always an amazing host. Very responsive and accommodating! He made my anniversary very special! The home is beautiful, in a very peaceful location! I highly recommend! We will Definitely be back!! Thanks again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Garth was extremely responsive and supremely helpful in our stay! The cabin was brand new and beautiful! The river sounds next to the house were quite nice, and the fire pit was quite relaxing at night. It was remote enough that we saw quite a few stars, and a shooting star one night too! The little town of East Stroudsburg is just a few minutes away and had everything we needed, and the surrounding hiking parks were great! Although it was a little chilly when we got to the area in the evening, the sunroom got nice and toasty warm with the sun, almost like a little greenhouse. We loved eating out on the screened in porch and enjoying the view and sounds of the river as we ate! There were a few potholes in the road as you drive in, but as long as you drive slowly and carefully you'll be fine. In addition the bathroom was very luxurious and beautiful. Loved the time out there; wish we could have stayed another night! Thanks so much Garth, we'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arrival to this location, we were amazed at how private, cozy, beautiful, delicate and detailed this cabin was.
The cabin was spotless, impeccable, and clean! Entering the living room, we were greeted with a welcome letter and given the instructions we needed in order to use all appliances and applications at the house. Garth and Savannah also left us a beautiful gift in which we were very thankful. We also had the pleasure of being the first guests at this cabin, and we must say it was amazing!
One of the best aspects of our trip is the fact that if we needed anything, their communication time was immediate. Any questions comments concerns we had were always answered in a quick fashion. Garth and Savannah wanted to make sure that we were taken care of properly and that we received the most enjoyment out of our weekend getaway! and we were very thankful for their attention. The River view was spectacular! The pictures we took were awesome!.Recommend 💯

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful cabin! Vera was incredibly responsive and kind and went above and beyond ensuring we had everything we needed to make our stay perfect. The home itself is as beautiful as the photos. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vera was a great host and the Airbnb was amazing. we had a hard time leaving. A perfect stay for our elopement week. thank you so much for letting us create memories at your beautiful resident. we are already taking about rebooking for our yearly wedding anniversaries. The sauna and master bath were really wonderful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our time at the green Forest retreat. The home is lovely with beautiful features and decor. It was nice to bring our baby and not have to worry about traveling with a portable crib or highchair, since these items were provided. A few things I would suggestfor Vera to add to the home just to make it more luxurious would be a wider variety of glassware, as well as more towels provided, and perhaps robes for using the sauna. We ended up doing several loads of laundry because we always needed a clean towel. But otherwise it was a great visit and we really enjoyed it."

This place was pure relaxation! The scenery surrounding the property is beautiful and calming. The best part was when we were lucky enough to have the deers grace us with their presence. Waking up to such beauty each morning was truly a gift. The home itself was incredibly inviting and cozy. It felt like a true escape into nature's embrace, with plenty of natural light and exposed wood beams and a calming fireplace crackling in the evenings. We appreciated the home decor and fell in love with the art wall that sits above the fireplace in the livingroom.
And then there was the sauna, soaking tub and hot tub! After a day of exploring the natural wonders nearby, soaking in the tub or the steamy hot tub surrounded by lush greenery was the epitome of relaxation.
If you're looking for a place to unwind, reconnect with nature, and create memories that will last a lifetime, this is it! Vera was a great host and always helpful. Don't hesitate to book a stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is exactly as described. Spotlessly clean. The downstairs is very cozy. Nicely decorated. The primary bath is gorgeous. The beds and bedding are very comfortable. The backyard is great. I didn’t use the sauna or hot tub but my travel partner did and really liked the sauna.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Veras place was amazing with all the great amenities as listed in the description! Would definitely stay here again!

Vera was great with communication.
She was very quick to respond and address any concern on the spot.
The only thing was the restricted amount of people that was allowed along with the extra fee for each person.
Besides that the experience felt like a dream."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the welcome website Vera had. It gave us all the information we could need about the property in the most organized manner.
Perfect place for a weekend spa get away. All the amenities were luxurious. The home itself was absolutely stunning.
One of our best airbnb experiences thus far! Would 100% book again and recommend to friends."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I enjoyed the best “staycation” at The Green Forest Retreat! Vera was so kind and informative leading up to our stay and very responsive! I especially loved the digital guide with information on arrival/departure, amenities and nearby activities etc. This home was immediately inviting with the open floor plan, cozy furniture and beautiful artwork. We loved making meals in the spacious kitchen and enjoyed our coffee around the fire pit in the morning. The sauna and hot-tub were amazing!! If only it were summer, we would have taken advantage of the lakes and pools in the community as well! Overall, we loved our stay and I would highly recommend this home for any time of year!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was truly a relaxing and peaceful getaway! Vera’s place has everything we needed and then some.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming home, very, very, very clean! It had a cozy downstairs, nice bedrooms, bathrooms, the hot tub was awesome, the firepit super. The home is in a neighborhood, so you might have some noise coming from other homes, but only one while we were there. It is in the woods, which I love. We were centered right in the middle of the areas we wished to see and play in. Vera's instructions were by far the most thorough I have ever seen. She covered all the bases in a very complete and meticulous way. I have stayed in some Airbnb homes that had no instructions at all. That's not good. She also responded immediately with and concerns and questions."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a really great stay at Vera’s place. The house looked just like the pictures, and the surrounding area is really picturesque and we felt really safe. Great amenities, house was clean and had everything we needed. Only thing to note is if traveling with babies or toddlers, the loft railings on the second floor are not safe. Our 2 year old could have fallen through them if we didn’t watch him, so just make sure you keep an eye on your little ones if they are wild and explorative :)
Would highly recommend to someone wanting a relaxing cosy trip!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Well-appointed home in a great location to explore the poconos. Traveled with my 19 month old, and the house worked out fine with some baby proofing once we arrived. Would recommend for anyone considering a stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. Getting initial access into the gated community was only a bit cumbersome, but still easy. Subsequent access was very easy. Great communication from the host both before we arrived and in response to a few questions we had once there. Hot tub was divine. 😊"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an excellent stay at Vera’s place. We had a little bit of trouble finding the right entrance, but after that, it was smooth sailing for the rest of the trip. Beautiful backyard with great amenities, saw lots of nature. Lovely space to hang out at home or go into town. We did a winery tour which was amazing. Vera was responsive and helpful. Highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a weekend getaway."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a great long weekend at Vera + Alex’s place! We utilized the amenities to feel relaxed and recharged. Was a perfect birthday get away weekend.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house and property was above what we expected!! We have stayed at many homes BUT this one is best by far!!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely one of the best designed air bnbs I’ve ever stayed in. The interiors are just amazing, clearly whoever designed the space has excellent taste ! The kitchen is a joy to cook in, and the living area is comfortable, nice lighting throughout and the upstairs bathroom is stunning.
The sauna and hot tub are also really great amenities to have and they both work perfectly.
However the house is not as secluded as the photos suggest, it is surrounded closely by multiple houses in close proximity. And I also found the beds to be very firm. But other than that I enjoyed my stay at the house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Green Forest Retreat was very comfortable and peaceful. It is the perfect place to relax and unwind. It’s quiet and clean and the host is very organized and helpful. We enjoyed using the kayaks and canoe and also spent a lot of time in the hot tub and sauna. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to just relax and get away from busy lives.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was very clean and comfortable, and the interior is decorated beautifully! Something went wrong with another airbnb we were staying at, and Vera was super responsive and helpful about letting us stay on short notice. The community has great amenities and it was nice to be able to go on a walk around the neighbourhood. You can definitely hear people when they're outside their own houses during the day, but at night it was very peaceful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was wonderful, and proved to be a perfect place for me and my girlfriend to spend our two year anniversary. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a relaxing getaway. The only thing about our trip that I would change is that we should’ve used the sauna more than once.
I will say that getting there proved to be a little difficult for us, being that Apple Maps took us to the south entrance of the penn estates (which is not the correct entrance for guests to check in) but Vera was very responsive as well as the security staff and they were able to get us on a path to the welcome center.
Overall, because of our fantastic experience at the house, we were thinking of rebooking this place for the sometime in the winter."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautifully decorated and has great outdoor space with a fire pit and hot tub . The online guidebook with check instructions and appliance information was thorough and Vera was very quick in her responses.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Vera’s place for 5 nights with our two younger children. The home was decorated beautifully and had a lovely bohemian feel to it. The upstairs bath has a spa/zen tone to it allowing natural light with the skylight. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable. The kitchen had all of necessary items to cook meals and was stocked with coffee as well. We also enjoyed the outdoor amenities including screened porch, fire pit, hot tub and sauna. The house is a mile walk from the pool (has a kiddie pool) and playground which was great for us to get out on a nice walk in the mornings. The beach is a short drive and was just large enough for our two kids to enjoy the warm lake and some fishing off the dock. The one day in the community they were hosting a Disney day at the pool which our kids enjoyed as well. The highlight for the kids was the wildlife that roams the community. The house is nicely done and we would certainly recommend. More than enough space for our family of 4."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I wanted a getaway for a peaceful weekend in the Poconos, Vera’s place was perfect! Although it was just the two of us, the home was spacious enough to accommodate other guests comfortably. There were so many amenities we could’ve just stayed in all weekend to enjoy the house! However, there is so much to do in the area. We drove to the local town for some exploring and checked out the local shops. I recommend Main Street Jukebox if you’re into music and vintage vinyls as we both are! I myself am vegan and it can be tricky finding places to eat but there were lots of options in the area! I highly recommend if you’re looking for a cozy getaway in a beautiful, private home."

Location was great, convenient to local stores and 15 mins to camelback and 20 mins to Shawnee.
We loved the hot tub and the sauna.
The master bedroom was beautiful, the only thing is when we tried to take advantage of the bathtub we realized the hot water will run out by the time you filled the bathtub out. Other than that everything was great."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This poconos retreat is STUNNING. It feels like you’re walking into a spread in Architectural Digest. The shared spaces are so cozy and comfortable but super elevated and design forward. The furniture is super comfortable. The king bed upstairs was very comfortable.
The hot tub, sauna, fire pit is what makes everything so much more special than just an Airbnb.
I have zero complaints and would 100% recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful mini getaway for New Year's Eve weekend with two other couples. The house itself was beautifully furnished and had many amenities. Plenty of hiking and fun breweries around as well. Vera and Alex were extremely responsive to any questions we had. We would gladly stay again on a future Poconos trip.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vera’s place is beautiful, cozy, and super clean. The sauna was lovely! This is a luxurious place to stay, close to Camelback."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"OMG beautiful home!! We absolutely loved staying here during the holidays! Vera and Alex were responsive and friendly. They provided a guide with everything you need from check in, local recommendations, etc. My children felt at home. The hot tub was VERY relaxing even in the cold weather. We can't wait to visit again! Home was spotless and spacious. The bathroom in the master bedroom was my highlight as a mother We need a hideaway ;) Absolutely recommend to stay here"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Vera and Alex's villa! We visited two days before Christmas and got to enjoy their cozy, beautiful home.
The house is incredible, it's beautifully designed, spotless, and very comfortable. We caught a bit of the winter storm and were greeted by some deer grazing happily in the back yard, this made my niece and nephew soo excited (and the grown ups too to be honest ;).
Vera was a wondeful host, very organized and thoughtful. Both Vera and Alex were very responsive to any needs and kind. Their virtual guidebook is super handy and helpful.
Highly recommended staying here and would be thrilled to come back when it's a bit warmer to enjoy the other amenities!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great to get away and ski for the first time in a long time. Vera's place was very convenient to get to Camelback Mountain. It's proximity to NY, NJ, PA etc. make it easy to Ski or Trout fish considering it's near The Gap. It is also centrally located to many eating spots locally ( Try Garlic, and The Cure for dinner and breakfast).
The Hot tub was a welcomed respite after a bunch of runs down the mountain. The sauna ( Hot Box) dried us off after the warm soak and made us ready for some wine and dinner.
The woodsy setting is peaceful and we enjoyed watching the deer meander through the back yard foraging for greens.
We didn't cook in while there, but it is well stocked if you care to enjoy a home-cooked meal with family and friends. There is ample room for a large family, we had 3; our fourth couldn't make it but if he did there was more than enough space for everyone's privacy."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gem Airbnb in East Stroudsburg and really hit the mark. Conveniently located with plenty of restaurants in town. Everything was spotless and well decorated, which bring a peaceful, homey vibe. The host was also super responsive and kind. Great stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Very clean. Vera was quick to answer any questions.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Faultless. Excellent stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space to unplug and recharge. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable for our guests to enjoy. Sauna and hot tub were a dream to have!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience during the whole stay. The neighborhood is quite and safe, there were so many things to explore in this cozy house! I felt like the time is always not enough, hopefully next time I could stay longer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but good things to say about our stay here. It was amazing! I enjoyed the style of the place and all the little intricacies like the cool light switches and the way the living room TV can extend to face the living room. You can tell they put a lot of time into designing the place and making it both functional and chic. The kitchen was so nice to use and we enjoyed cooking in it. Everything was nice and clean when we got there. We used the sauna, and I used the bathtub upstairs, and both were awesome! The instruction site provided made it very easy to understand how to use everything including the alarm. Everything needed (grocery store, coffee, restaurants) were within 10-12 minutes of the location. This place was the perfect getaway, and we had such a relaxing weekend. I would return in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone who asked about a place to stay near the Poconos!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful estate, very warm. Host prepared everything in advance making our stay very comfortable."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here with a few coworkers for a work trip. The place was nice, all of the rooms were good for adult men and I loved the hot tub and sauna at night. Overall I think it was a good find. Only negative is the stairwell is rather narrow so make sure you’re comfortable with hauling your luggage up stairs"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and convenient home in the Poconos with countless amenities. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place with great hosts -Vera.
The place was clean, organized, well decorated with good taste and no crazy rules like most of the houses I rent.
We are definitely coming back."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was better than perfect I surprise my girlfriend and she was in love with this place definitely will return
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Green Forest Retreat, everything was clean, tidy, and organized upon arrival. The amenities inside and out were great, the location was low key and relaxing. Highly recommended for anyone trying to wind-down and enjoy nature in the Poconos. The hosts always made themselves available if needed, and had clear instruction for a smooth stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really loved this place. It was equipped with everything we needed and more - the sauna was such a wonderful treat! The house was immaculate and the artful play of patterns, textures, and colors gave it an eclectic vibe. The location was perfect - close to a big supermarket, lots of restaurants and shopping. It was just an hour and 40 minute drive to NJ where we parked and took the PATH to Manhattan for the day. Vera was very easy to communicate with. We definitely recommend this stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An excellent place to spend a few magical nights with the family
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this retreat! I came with a group of 5 girlfriends and felt like we had plenty of space. The sauna and hot tub were great, we used them every night. Campfire was so nice with plenty of wood available. The indoor space was designed so beautifully and every detail was well thought-out. Would highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and thoughtful space, just as nice as the pictures. Really impressed by how thoroughly thought of we felt. We felt like the place, instructions, etc were made specifically for us and our comfort and ease. Really incredible stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home was super clean, beautiful and comfortable. Beds were very comfortable, which is a huge plus. Vera communicated with us throughout and provided all the info we needed to make our stay easy. East Stroudsburg is super cute. We also explored Honesdale."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying at the Green forest retreat! It was so beautiful and the hosts are super responsive and kind. Will definitely be staying again one day!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vera and Alex's place was very relaxing, clean, and beautiful. Love the decor! Vera checked in once per day just to make sure that we had everything we needed. Also, their place seems to be a prime proposal location, because we too just got engaged here 10/11/22! Thank you so much Vera and Alex! 💕"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully appointed, comfy house that was immaculately clean and great for a low key weekend getaway with friends. Backyard amenities including hot tub, fire pit and Turkish sauna were all put to good use and rigorously maintained. Neighboring houses are fairly close by so you feel like you’re definitely in a residential area rather than in a secluded wooded area, but we did not experience any loud noise or intrusions (except for many deer brazenly snacking in surrounding yards)! House is in a gated development so that was positive from a security standpoint, but frustrating from an access standpoint due to lengthy delays to enter through non-resident gates because of high volume of cars that need to stop and be registered (or don’t know how to use guest passes correctly). Our hosts were extremely responsive and professional and checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable and had any needs. Was a bit pricey but overall good value when split among a few friends looking to spend quality time in a lovely setting in the Poconos."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The interior is beautifully and artistically designed and the hot tub/outdoor sauna combo made us feel like we were living in our own little spa! I highly recommend this getaway to anyone who needs to decompress! I hope to be back soon! Thank you so much!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was absolutely beautiful! conveniently located near a lot of restaurants and stores - Vera recommended a few of their favorites. the check-in/check-out process was extremely easy! we truly enjoyed our time here in The Poconos and will recommend this Airbnb to anyone!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in and is not only a design inspiration but full of surprises. Glad I used it to pop the question! Gained a fiancée 5/5
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property with a great sauna and hot tub. Extremely clean house with cool decor. Very happy with our stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean modernized property . Host is very quick and Helpful. I had a great experience and would recommend to anyone
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is phenomenal. Everything is as beautiful as advertised, and we found ourselves needingfor nothing during our time here. The hosts are very professional, and this level of professionalism is maintained through every aspect of the stay. Check in, guides, instructions, communications, check out; all immaculate. Do yourself a favor and book this stay quickly!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The amenities were absolutely perfect, the art and decorations in the house were beautiful, and Vera was welcoming and communicative. *Chef's kiss*. I had a great stay and am already planning my return."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic environment! Amazing home!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was unbelievable! Clean and beautiful- would highly recommend booking it! We can’t wait to come back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vera's place is an absolute 5-star! the architecture of the house, the furniture, the decorations, the plants, the hot tub and sauna, the arts-covered walls, and the skyline master bathroom. My kids and I are in awe!
Vera was super communicative upon check-in, as well as accommodating for late check-out. The gated community made us feel safe as a mother with two kids. we enjoyed the pool and the 3 lakes. We saw about 20 deer and 3 of them kept showing up in the backyard where the hot tub is.
The location is awesome as well, 10 mins from camelback and 15 mins from tubing/canoeing. We had a great time in the Poconos and are so inspired by Vera's house! Thank you with love!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing! The property was great and very accurate the photos provided. Communication from Vera was always prompt and clear. The amenities provided were top notch and the overall experience was one that we will seek again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time in the Poconos. This was exactly what we needed.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely immaculate! We came with our 2 children (ages 3 and 9 months) and had a wonderful time. The space is beautiful and so clean. We watched the deer, roasted marshmallows around the fire, lazed on the hammock, and enjoyed the hot tub and sauna (such a fun feature!). We are already planning to come back. The hosts clearly put a lot of thought into this beautiful home. Thank you for sharing it with us!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 11 month old son and I stayed at Vera’s home for 4 nights. The home was perfect for our family vacation. They provided a pack and play for our son to sleep in the second bedroom, while we slept in the king bed in the main bedroom (which was extremely comfortable). The main bathroom has been beautifully renovated with a soaker tub (our son loved playing in the tub on the rainy afternoons). The upstairs is complete with a reading nook and rocking chair where we enjoyed some reading during our son’s naps. The main living area has a comfortable sofa and lounging chairs to watch tv (Netflix/Hulu, etc all available). The outdoor space was also fantastic - we used the grill for making dinners, enjoyed the fire pit, hot tub and sauna in the evenings. The home is located in a nice gated community, we enjoyed short walks around the neighbourhood and playing/swimming at the lake (which is a 5 min drive). We also enjoyed multiple hikes around the Poconos. Would highly recommend!"
,,,"bitter sweet review. The apt itself is 5 stars. the fact that it's in the hood, brings down to no stars. the music playing every night till late is a deal breaker. I was on business and couldn't get 1 decent nights sleep."
,,,"We arrived at 10 PM to a house that had not been cleaned and indeed was a disaster. It looked like the previous guests had held a party in the house:
- Glitter everywhere
- Balloons all over the floor that were randomly popping
- Partially empty takeout cartons and beverages on the kitchen counters-
- Full trash bags in the kitchen just sitting on the floor
- Unmade beds with no replacement sheets
…and the entire house smelled like used women’s hygiene products. The host was responsive but kept writing “omg” which was grating and felt insincere. His offer of half off our first night, and asking us to wait around for the cleaner to come was an insult. So, we had to find a hotel at 11 PM. We had brought food with us to cook and had to store it in a hotel mini-fridge which barely fit.
Very unpleasant experience 0/10 do not recommend."
,,,"At first I was really excited for my stay, & it seemed like a nice place but when I got in there was no electricity or heat & it was freezing. Orain did not respond about there being no electricity or heat for at least 4 hours, we left to go to a concert & when we came back at 1am the lights came back on but the heat still had not. So it was freezing our whole night stay, thankfully we only stayed that night. I barely slept that night because it was so cold & it really did suck because I am epileptic & I have been recovering from having lots of seizures recently, so sleep is important in general as an epileptic but especially after seizures. I paid $323 for a 1 night stay & tried to get a reasonable refund for my issues, like 50%, but all the host would give me was $60 & they told me to take it up with Airbnb support cause they won't refund me anymore than that. Which I find unprofessional & I think shows that they are an inadequate ""business owner""/host personally, I would never do business that way. Someone who properly runs their business would make enough money they have money put to the side to cover unforseen expenses like these.
Orain can respond to my review with whatever excuses they would like to try to make me look like I am in the wrong or I am exaggerating but I am not. Heat & electricity are a necessity & isn't a wild thing to want a reasonable refund for."
,,,"The place was occupied. The person occupying the place has same confirmation that I had. Place was double booked. Mr. James NEVER responded to my calls or text. Airbnb could not help. By 8:00 pm all the did was refund my money which may take 15 days. I had no place to stay and no money because Airbnb has over $600.00 on hold
I will never use Airbnb and hope Mr. James is not allowed to host ever"
