2024-06-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Pros- the house was cute and very easy to find in a decent neighborhood. I was allowed to check in early which was great.
Cons- the stairs to the loft felt unsafe to me as I almost fell down them a couple of times just bringing my bags up there. Couldn‚Äôt control the thermostat which then made the upstairs loft super hot even with the fan going up there. I couldn‚Äôt sleep in the bed because it was too hot and not safe for me to carry my infant up or down the stairs. There is a door leading to the other side of the duplex in the upstairs loft which made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe as I didn‚Äôt know who was next door. The neighbors in the duplex next door was loud after 10pm as late as 1am most of the nights I stayed which kept my infant up and even woke him up after he finally fell asleep. There wasn‚Äôt slippers or sandals like I expected. The travel size soaps and stuff like that most were used.
My stay could have been better but you get what you pay for I guess."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location by Aggieville and can‚Äôt beat the price.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This charming old house will certainly make you feel at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Would recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my time here and everything was as expected. They were very responsive to my questions and easy to work with for check in/check out. The neighbors were very audible due to the age and layout of the place but it was not at all deal breaker for me. There is not a tv in the living room for passing time but that was a welcome subtraction which led to good conversation.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for a quick walks to Aggieville!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed very much. Everything you could ask for.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have spent Christmas at Donita‚Äôs for two years and have had a nice cozy time!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for game day and access to Aggieville. Walls were a bit thin if you‚Äôre expecting full privacy from any renters next door, but other than that, couldn‚Äôt have been better. The hosts were also very accommodating."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location üëçüèº
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Great location. Accessible to good places (restaurants, bars, and parks). Close to KSU."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking distance to Aggieville. Was very clean and had great character. Walls are thin so if your neighbors are loud you will know it.
Based on location and cost, we would for sure stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's outdated but the pros outweigh the cons. Clean, walking distance to Aggieville/campus, priced right."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Nice and clean!
My only hang up is that we had no access to the thermostat and while there were blankets and a space heater available we very very cold both nights we stayed there.
That being said, we will absolutely rebook and stay here again in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! We had everything we needed. There was plenty of dishes, cookware, games to play, etc. The hosts were kind, informative, and all around awesome. The only things that were less than ideal was the comfort level of the mattress on the pull out couch and the stairs. Like many old homes, the stairs to the loft were very steep with short foot beds. We have a 4 year old child so it was a bit nerve wracking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Compared to the hotels in town, this place was quiet and an easy walk to the night life. Bed is kind of small however but I don‚Äôt think you could fit a bigger bed up there. Lots of towels and very clean. Great stay! Will book again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy, unique and charismatic place! Highly recommend. Good price, super clean. Donita (Matt and Allie??) was super responsive! Felt right at home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Donita‚Äôs place. It was clean and affordable.
I would suggest future guests bring bottled water. There were none in the fridge. The climate control is located in another part of the home. You do not have access to this. It was 95 outside the day I arrived and a tad bit warm in the home. Fans are provided for air flow, but I was still a bit surprised by this. The stairs to the loft were really sketchy. They are very narrow and steep. I had to carefully navigate going up and down them. I was afraid of slipping and falling down the steep incline. I eventually brought my big suitcase back downstairs so everything I needed was on the main floor level so I didn‚Äôt have to navigate the steps as often. One more note, I am very sensitive to dare I say ‚Äúparanormal‚Äù entities. So when I saw the upstairs closet with no door or covering over it I freaked out a tad bit. Perhaps a curtain over the door would have eased my fear of the closet monster staring at me while I slept."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Vintage Loft was a good place to stay. Great location to Aggieville and KSU campus while not being loud in a college town. The value was great. The only 'negative' thing that I would like to point out to others is the stairs to get into the loft. They are very narrow and very steep. I did find it a little challenging to get up the stairs, so when it was time to go to bed, I didn't come back downstairs at all. Everything else is located on the main floor."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting my son
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location and wells stocked home with amenities. Host is very easy to communicate with.
It is an older home and comes with its uniqueness (thin walls, creaky floors)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place close to everything i needed!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donita‚Äôs stay was a great choice for my time in Manhattan and she was incredibly easy to get a hold of as well :)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay, and the place is very close to Aggieville. It was nice to be able to walk to so many things to do. The games and decor were also a nice touch!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Reasonably priced and close to so many places to enjoy.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, super comfy bed"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a holiday or game day stay. Compact and close to Aggieville! I was able to walk to the grocery store or your favorite restaurant in the bar district. Host is very responsive, and kind. I will be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice old Victorian home great for a game day stay over.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great comfortable stay! For a great price in prime location.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place in a great location. Alll you really need for a two-night stay for a football weekend. I will say the walls are bit thin and we could hear the people on the other side of the duplex wall. However, when visiting Manhattan for a football weekend we weren't really spending too much time in the unit so it wasn't a big deal at all."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really cute and cozy, there are a lot of necessities available for you to use. Be very careful if you are afraid of heights because the stairs are very steep! The walls are also incredibly thin, so if there are tenants in the other half you can hear much of their activities. I overall really enjoyed the house and the hosts."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot close to Aggieville. Overall great place to stay at.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent place for a weekend, recommended"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A nice place close to Aggieville and convenient to most of Manhattan.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location, communication and ease of check-in was great! We really enjoyed playing the games that were available. Everything was neat, clean, organized and very welcoming. Some people might mind there was no TV, but we didn‚Äôt. We had fun playing games instead! The stairs to the loft were a bit treacherous but manageable. The only issue we had was the bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable. It was wiggly and squeaky. It felt like we were sleeping on plastic. So we didn‚Äôt get a lot of rest."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to Aggie. Clean and secure.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location if you want to be near Aggieville, very short walk. Nice older neighborhood and friendly folks. Great value for the location."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the space! It was perfect for what we needed, especially for a weekend visit. Note that older folks would be staying on the downstairs sofa bed, as the stairs leading to the loft are a touch steep. Everything else, from the kitchen space, bathroom, and living room setup, was just what we needed. Great place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, loaded with all the necessary things even for basic cooking."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was nice
2022-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great stay. Communicative host and easy checkin/checkout. Great location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Donuts was a wonderful host üòä
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Comfortable stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hosts were extremely helpful and prompt. The house is really cozy, well-equipped with anything one might need for a long stay (2 full weeks), and also furnished with taste. Also, it is within walking distance both from KSU and Aggieville. Definitely recommended!"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time when we visited the house was within walking distance to aggieville which was a plus.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, sweet little loft. Thank you. Fabulous communication"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a charming little place! Two minutes walk to aggievile and easy access and very clean. I highly recommended this place and I would stay again. Thanks!
2021-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was an okay place to stay, plenty of room to sleep. Location is good, 2 blocks from Aggieville. Missing some amenities that I really wanted and or needed, which was disappointing. I wanted to check in early, but never heard back from anyone before time to check in.. again a little disappointing."
2021-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Bright side: great options for breakfast. Nice kitchen equipped with the staples. Clean and well decorated. Plenty of space and places to sleep.
Downside: Not an accurate listing. No tv, no way to control the temperature. The stairs to the bedroom are extremely narrow and unsafe. Water pressure and temperature also appears to be controlled by the neighboring air b&b. Bed is covered in a plastic liner (which is great for germs, but noisy to sleep in).
Overall not what I was looking for but could see how staying here would be great for someone trying to go to a game or hang out with friends nearby."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a very clean place and we could walk to the campus and Aggieville.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house - very clean, stocked with everything we needed, and awesome location! Definitely will keep in mind for future Manhattan trips!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing price, amazing location, amazing vibe, overall it was a perfect stay!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! Right down the street from Aggieville :)
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute historical home near KSU! We particularly liked sitting out in the sun room when a thunderstorm came through. Loved learning about the history of the place in the home guide. This place is near KSU and lots of places to eat. Little touches like a mounted extension cord near the bed made charging devices easy. Would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and comfortable! The peonies and roses are beautiful!! Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay very affordable! Manhattan is a great place! Very good stay
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, and lovely home for our short stop. So close to downtown!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed with Skylar multiple times and this house is by far my favorite!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable! and the shared living space is nice!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Skylar was an amazing host. I highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable place to stay. Some items that I feel I should share is with this being a historic home the floors were loud and creaky. You could definitely hear anyone above you walking and walking throughout the home. The exterior walls or windows were thin as well. We could hear traffic and sirens driving by at all hours of the night. Overall for the price that we paid we felt this was a good deal.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is BEAUTIFUL. Pictures don't even measure up to the decor in this house. It is so clean and spacious. It was very sort notice and she worked with me. I will continue to stay at any of her places üòäüòä
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Skylar's home is very clean and in a great location! It was well decorated and she was prompt in responding.
We did have challenges getting into the front door, but was able to get in easily through the back. We also could not lock our own room when leaving - unsure why or if it was just how the lock works.
There were also some issues with the other residents not being considerate of the bathroom and shared spaces, with one person spending upwards of 30-45 minutes in the bathroom, and were watching videos. Another resident in a different room had a baby who was crying throughout the night. Then, at 5am, when people were leaving, they were slamming the front door. I have been in hostels and have rented shared rooms and this was unusual. Of course, this is not due to Skylar at all and was based on the other individuals who rented a room, so if you struggle with being respectful to other residents then maybe this is not the best place for you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So comfortable!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful old home, spotless, great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, always welcoming and host is very helpful and quick to respond"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here multiple times and highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this charming, 130 year old home so much! Pretty and full of character. Comfy beds, great shower, lovely decor. Kind and responsive owner and mom. Quiet area of Manhattan but near campus, shopping, farmers market, etc."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my favorite place to stay. I highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay! We would love to come back one day!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,100 percent recommend this great place. Very quaint and clean. Love it!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and great accommodation! Would stay again. Close to downtown too and an easy walk home after a night out in Aggieville. The room was very clean and living spaces and kitchen were nice amenities to have too.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I was in town on business and really enjoyed my stay at this house! It was much cheaper than getting a hotel and the room and amenities were still great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible place to stay in Manhattan. Picture perfect charming historic home!! It was decorated for Christmas which made it even more cozy. Skylar has gone above and beyond. I will be returning in future to this lovely Airbnb!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cool house, cozy room GREAT value for the price. Skylar was amazing, super responsive and kind. Very conveniently located too- close to downtown area.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was nice for the price!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved my stay! It was so cute and comfortable. It felt right at home and I as so clean. Made the trip worth it and had such kind host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a quick trip to KSU!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Her home is a home away from home. Skylar was very responsive . In the morning I took a walk- 3 miles around the area. Peaceful , safe and nothing that brought concern . I was traveling alone. There were other people in her home renting rooms as well, and i never felt unsafe or concerned . Make your own breakfast lunch or dinner in her cute functional kitchen. And she has plenty of sitting area as well. Private bedroom and just enough space to wind down between activities .. lots of restaurants around . Manhattan is a decent size city! Gas stations. Starbucks , etc
the price point is a blessing to our family as we have to travel so far to visit . I‚Äôm so thankful and thrilled with this little find ! Thanks skylar !"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy stay :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming and well appointed. Work well for us.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very charming home! Quiet and close to downtown and Aggieville. Will stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When ppl have a passion for doing something, it's obvious in the result(s). So we see this right off in her design, renovation, hospitality, etc. But what's amazing is how egalitarian she seems. No idiotic snobbery: she makes it as lux for those with less to spend as those with more. I wonder if I've encountered better."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a historic house converted to airbnb units. Everything was very comfortable and all the amenities you expect were provided all while preserving the history. It is a simple place, but was a great place for me."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,A quaint spot with lots of charm. Check in is easy. Great value in a neat established neighborhood in Manhattan.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This room was very clean and comfortable. We had a very restful visit and would absolutely recommend this room to family.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Skylar is an amazing host! The home is a beautiful historic structure and is in a fantastic location. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Manhattan.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place has an amazing setting and is an amazing value. Super convenient - super comfortable - super responsive host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Zero issues
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This lovely home has a lot of character and has been decorated with a very cottage chic vibe to match its vintage bones. The entire place was very clean and had character. It was a good space to enjoy a night in the Little Apple. üçé
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place to stay! Skylar is a wonderful host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay in Manhattan. Easy to get in and everything was super clean. Everything you could want out of a place! Will be staying again sometime!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. I would definitely recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here. The Renovations Skylar did are beautiful while at the same time preserving the old school charm of the house. It's very clean and there's plenty of space to spread out. The bakery in town is fabulous!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay! Loved the patio and lights.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at skylars lovely home! The neighborhood was great and we could walk to a bunch of restaurant and bars.
The house was clean, a bathroom with an awesome shower, a well equipped kitchen and a gorgeous patio where we could enjoy our breakfast outside in the morning!
We would definitely come again if we ever drive through Kansas again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Really nice place. Very clean . Skylar was friendly . Love to stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love this place. An amazing value--clean with all the amenities. Walking distance to nice restaurants and cafes. Cute neighborhood. My only regret is not meeting Skylar IRL, though she was prompt, polite and helpful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,geart place to stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about Skylar's place. The house is historic, with lots of charming touches. The downstairs bedroom I rented was small but comfortable and next to a lovely living room. The kitchen was excellent and very very-equipped. There was coffee and a sunny room overlooking the charming back yard to drink it in. I felt right at home. Located on a quiet street, parking was easy. Skylar and her mother were delightful and helpful. I felt very much at home and will absolutely stay there again when I'm in Manhattan."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the first Air B&B I have ever used, and probably set a standard no one else will ever meet. The bedrooms, bath, kitchen, yard, sun-room were all outstanding, accessible, tastefully decorated. Full kitchen with a serious gas stove for cooking, and nice big fridge. I met Annette, Skylar's mom, who is just lovely--so helpful, imaginative, excited about helping people have a great stay. Skylar communicated perfectly, even when I couldn't figure out the keypad with an after midnight arrival.
Fantastic value for the price!
We fully intend to return, probably to rent the whole house for any family gatherings and events while our daughter interns at K-State Veterinary. You cannot go wrong with anything Skylar and Annette manage!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This historic home is my first choice when in Manhattan for work. It is just a quick 2 block walk to restaurants and groceries. Skylar always keeps the yard and flowers looking great! The backyard is a little haven after a busy day. Thanks again, Skylar, for keeping the home clean and always responding so quickly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this cute, quaint historic house. Very comfy, and had everything I needed!
Skylar was very quick with communications and special requests.
Looking forward to staying here again in a couple months!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Skylar‚Äôs place! The home is lovely, especially the sunny, quiet, beautifully planted backyard and sun porch."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful historic home! Believe it or not, I travel with my own TV because most rooms don't have one but this house does. I only found they have Roku loaded on it, but I don't have a Roku account. This a safe, family neighborhood, and I have already booked my next stay! I'm so glad I finally found a place in Manhattan with walking to grocery, restaurants, & shopping and a beautiful outdoor patio that feels like home!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Thanks Skylar
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a quick place to crash for the night after a Cats home game and it was perfect!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful! It is a newly updated, historic home and very comfortable. I especially like the porch off the back of the kitchen. There is plenty space. I never even saw another guest so it was private, too."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This historic home is very comfortable. I would not have changed anything. Skylar is a wonderful host with a fantastic place! You will be happy with your stay, I am sure."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful home. I would definitely book this house again, it did not disappoint!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here for graduation weekend. House was spotless when we arrived. Keevan was so easy to communicate with and always quick to respond. Was actually a closer drive to everywhere in town that we needed to go then I thought it was going to be. Neighborhood is quiet. Kitchen was fully stocked. Beds were comfortable. We have stayed at a number of places while our son has been at KSU and this one was one of the best. Would definitely stay again if in town.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home with excellent amenities! We wanted to permanently move in! Keegan was easy to work with, helpful and responsive. Totally recommend!"

We entered the home and had a welcome sign and some fruit waiting for us. ALL of the bedrooms were very nice! There is so much seating to eat and to sit and watch tv! We loved the open concept of the common areas. There was ample parking for our four vehicles we had there at one point as well since several of us had to come separately. Keevan was close by in case we needed anything and super responsive prior to our check in and post check out! We thought being out a little farther would be a huge inconvenience but it really wasn't as far out as we initially thought. We were able to get to most places in Manhattan within 10-12 minutes.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our short stay here! It was clean and cute.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy and stylish stay! The house is quite charming and also unique. Clay had excellent communication and was very accommodating. One thing to be aware of is the stairway to the loft. The stairs are very very steep and might be difficult for young children and the elderly. Once booked, you can read that children are discouraged from using the stairs unaccompanied, and for good reason. Unfortunately, the loft bedroom has the bunkbeds which are best suited for children. This could make the second bedroom almost unusable depending on your age demographic. Besides this potential setback, the house was wonderful."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for a quick weekend trip. The place was beautiful and very unique. Super close to Manhattan which made it a great spot to stay for the football game but still be away from the city.

The location in Manhattan works well for a quick drive to the K-State campus, Aggieville, and to the downtown area for restaurants.

It was built in 1920s, so if you stay in the middle bedroom, you can hear the basement guests as clearly as if they were in your hallway lol thankfully, the 2 outside bedrooms are quieter.
Mel was always responsive, letting us know about the Air Conditioning repair guy that came over for an hour and how to park up the driveway. This was overall a very comfy stay."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, would recommend to anyone. Would stay again when in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Close to Aggieville bars and campus. Nice, comfortable home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute, spacious, and clean place! Already have it bookmarked for future visits to Manhattan."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Great area. Could hear people on lower level very early morning.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jack and Mel's place is perfect for any family including ones with children. We enjoyed the play park across the street and also made good use of the board games in kitchen cabinet. We had plenty of parking very near on Colorado street as well as the spot behind the house. All three bedrooms are a very nice size with super comfy beds. There is plenty of room all around the dining table so no one is squeezed in or trapped. The living room has a big comfy couch and a large TV. Each bedroom also has TV. We would definitely choose this house next time we need a place to stay in Manhattan. It is centrally located and just minutes to anywhere in town.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here for the weekend. Our son plays LAX for KSU so we were in town to watch. The house was the perfect size with lots of space for my entire family. The hosts were accommodating with check-in and it was easy to access. The house was clean and had everything we needed. We would recommend this place for others.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"First off Jack and Mel were amazing hosts! The house was absolutely adorable, cozy, and very clean! The beds were so comfy as was the living room furniture. Was nice to just curl up on the couch with my sisters, and just laugh and enjoy ourselves. And having such an inviting home to stay in, added to it all!
I definitely recommend this house!
As it will be the Airbnb I reserve when I visit the, Little Apple!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked this adorable bungalow for our weekend at KState celebrating our daughter's birthday. We were able to comfortably host her and 5 friends for a brunch on Saturday morning. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed. There was plenty of room and surfaces to set up a food buffet and seating around the dining table. We slept comfortably that night in our queen size bed. Overall a great place and we would love to stay again for a football game weekend in the fall as the location is perfect for the university.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable home. Great beds. Convenient location. Check-in and communication was easy. You might notice some street noise in the front bedroom, but the back bedrooms were super quiet. If there are guests staying in the basement unit, you might hear them through the vents. We didn't know anyone was there until the morning. There is parking near the back door, but be aware that the driveway is steep and there are places that might need high clearance. We parked on the street and walked around. The old wooden floors do squeak, so if you are someone who gets up a lot during the night, be aware that others will probably hear you."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks, great stay!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay while in town. Place was as represented.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was well laid out. They made good use of all the space. Very open and inviting. The neighborhood felt quiet and safe.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super place to stay. We were coming from abroad so needed to be confident the place would be right for us. Very spacious and great layout. Large comfy lounge area.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean home with a great location!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"No stocked with a lot of dry goods, if you prefer to cook meals in house. And no dishwasher-FYI. Walking distance to park for those with little ones. Steps to back entrance (parking) are a little cumbersome, but doable."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,very beautiful house and area well stocked and convenient wish I could have stayed longer
2022-10-01,3,Group trip,"I was prepared to give this Airbnb a 5-star rating.... it was clean, a good location and the communication was very good! However, about an hour or so before we were going to check out, I saw that I had an email from the host. The email asked that we move one of our cars so that the tenant who was staying in the basement could park their car in a spot. What?!!!! That was a shock to me and my family members who were staying in the house. We had no idea that there was someone else staying in the house with us. When you rent an Airbnb and it is listed as ""Entire 3-bedroom home"", you expect that you have the entire home, but that was not the case. The fine print stated that someone may be staying in the basement, but when you rent an ""Entire 3-bedroom home"", it should be expected that you have the entire home and they then will not rent out the basement because that is part of the entire house! So, much to our surprise, there was someone (who?!!!!) staying and sleeping in the basement of the house. Yes, there was a separate entrance, however, the entrance to that basement area was through the main entrance at the back of the house through the porch that both of us entered in. (Maybe they locked the outside door, maybe they didn't!). We could have easily opened the door from the kitchen to the porch and been startled by someone standing there inside the house that was not one of our family members. Or, we could have heard someone enter the house after we had gone to bed and not knowning that they rented the basement and had access to the home and we thought it was an intruder and called police. This person/people may have been the nicest people you could have ever met or they could have been a serial killer. The host knew nothing about me and my family and I'd assume they knew just as much about the other party in the basement. This home is an old home and the floors are very, very creaky! I don't know how they slept while we were up late that night and early that next morning with all those creaky floors and we didn't try to be quiet because we thought we had the entire house as it was advertised! We had 6 adults in the home with one bathroom so there was a lot of movement. AND, I'm sure he/she/they heard all of our conversations as there are many floor grates in the house. If the basement is going to be utilized by some other party, then the Airbnb listing should be ""Entire 3-bedroom 1ST FLOOR"". I just thought that was very unprofessional and misleading! I wanted to give this home a 5-star rating, but I could not do so after knowing that someone else was in the basement - too creepy! Just thought anyone who rents this Airbnb in the future should know that you are not actually getting the ""Entire Home"" and are actually only getting the ""Entire 1st Floor"" and you may have someone you don't know sleeping in the same house with you, entering and exiting the house and you are expected to meet their requests when you rented the ""Entire Home""... it was just wrong!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming home in a convenient location. Beds were comfortable and house was well equipped for my group's short stay.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"A charming home, clean and comfy with cozy decor. Communication with the host was quick and helpful. Clean home, fresh towels, lots of tv‚Äôs and comfy beds. Although we didn‚Äôt cook there, it had everything you‚Äôd need to do so. The driveway was a bit steep but we were able to drive our suburban up it and park with no problem. I would definitely recommend this spacious home!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Entry way in back is set up so you can have your pet here to sleep if you‚Äôre not the type to allow them in bed yet‚Ä¶.once inside it‚Äôs darling! Modern and comfortable and tons of space. Covered front porch has ample seating, ceiling fans, and a porch swing. Literally 4-5 min away from everything and right across the street from a small park for strolling. Beds comfy too. Also a nice Shark vac that‚Äôs lightweight to clean up any messes"

It's very welcoming and very clean, with a comfy bed, and lots of extra touches - coffee, water, snacks, extra towels and blankets - all the comforts of home. What's more, Mark is one of the most friendly and proactive hosts I've ever encountered.

My dog enjoyed the backyard and grass space around the house. The home has new appliances/features that made the stay comfortable. I appreciated the security of the property as well. Would stay again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed 3 days for a football weekend
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Sandra's rental. It is quiet neighborhood, away from the bustle of students, yet close enough to campus. The space is exactly as depicted, which is greatly appreciated. Plenty of space, and everything we needed for our weekend stay. Two things that were non-factors for us, but may influence your decision: As depicted in the photos, there are a number of steps from the driveway down to the entryway. If stairs area a struggle and you will be in and out, just be aware. Also, there is a step in to the tub/shower. I'm 50 and was a non-issue, but I know for my parents it would have been difficult. Definitely not a problem, just a FYI. Sandra was proactive and helpful whenever we had questions and needs. We stay at AirBnB's every game weekend, and we'd stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,A cozy and quiet place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Sandra was very responsive and communication was very open and easy. Our daughter was there for an extended stay and it like having her own place.

We peaceful neighborhood with a view. Even enjoyed the visit from some deer (a mama and a fawn) on a couple occassions. If ever back in the area we will definately stay with Sandra again.

Sandra has great and clean property which made me feel right at home. I could tell that Sandra really cares about giving her guests a great experience and i highly recommend renting from her!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was so much better than staying in a hotel!!! The place is big and has a functional kitchen, including a full-size refrigerator/freezer.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Rose's place 3 times now. She is always helpful & responsive. The unit is clean & everything works!

We stay here when we visit our son who has a house just a few blocks away."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with wonderful hosts. The sound machine in the bedroom really helped with the noise from Aggieville. It was nice to be able to walk to restaurants and the university.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in one of these units every year, and this was another great experience. The location couldn't be any better, and the apartment is clean and spacious. This was my first time being upstairs in the building. Unlike the downstairs units the bedroom upstairs is on the street side, which made it a little noisier from car traffic, but still surprisingly quiet on a weeknight. The noise machine was a nice bonus. I'll be back again next year!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for our 4 night stay in Manhattan. We had everything we needed and the place was very comfortable.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a very last-minute booking to get my rental tenant into a place so we could fix plumbing issues (pipe connection failed suddenly. They had us accepted and with a keyless access code within 30-minutes to an hour (so-so fast). Then when we needed to extend the stay, it was approved very quickly also. Such an efficiently run and quality place to stay. It was exactly what we needed--full kitchen for my tenant while he was displaced from his home, a much better alternative to a hotel. I would absolutely use again. In fact, I'm tempted to book for myself so I can have a research retreat to get some work done away from the demands of home."

There was a comfy couch, spacious kitchen, and huge bed! Only downside is the ambient noise from the road (North 11th street) and from the night life (house music on Friday-Saturday). Most definitely would recommend staying here."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in was super easy, communication was prompt and good, everything was clean. The only issue was the noise in the area. However, that comes with the territory of being in that area close to restaurants, etc. Overall a great value if you need a place to stay in the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I always look forward to staying here when I‚Äôm town
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot!! Great location! Nice accommodations!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Was super comfy and we loved the location that the apartment was in üôåüèº
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience staying here! The apartment was clean, quiet, and spacious. We were walking distance to Aggieville and I highly recommend for your next stay in Manhattan."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great spot. Easy access. Good value. Responsive hosts. Definitely a place to stay to be near it all in Manhattan.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. My husband and I don‚Äôt want to stay any other place in Manhattan. Just like the photos!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thanks again for the great hospitality and we look forward to staying with you again while in Manhattan.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably the best Air BnB I've stayed in yet! It is an absolute steal for the price!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and a great place to stay with restaurants in walking distance!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow. This place was great! It had everything I needed and was so much better than a cramped hotel room. I plan to try for it every time I return to Manhattan for conferences. It's so comfortable.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and within walking distance of Aggieville! It had everything we needed and the perfect amount of space for any length of stay
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Rose's and we loved it again! It's in walking distance from everything you need, it was comfy and clean and relaxing to come back to with little things stocked so we didn't have to worry about anything. Will stay again!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love how CLEAN this apartment is. We have stayed here repeatedly and always find it to be much cleaner than any hotel.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place was amazing. Super clean and comfortable. Everything you need is already there except for you and the food? The stuff around the room is great. I suggest the fish tacos at Taco lucha. I also suggest a trip to Topeka to visit the Evel Knievel museum. But the best part was the price. The value for what you get is unbeatable.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, bed and couch are comfy. If you‚Äôre planning on cooking full meals, you‚Äôll struggle with lots and pans and utensils."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievable value. Spacious and comfortable. Best of all, Rose thought of everything. I've stayed in places that don't even have paper towels. Rose has stocked everything from pods for the washing machine to Saran wrap for leftovers. Aggieville can get pretty noisy at night. That's the price you pay to be right next to all the great downtown restaurants, bars and coffee shops. I slept like a baby because I always keep foam earplugs next to my bed (I have 3 kids). But, as a we were leaving, I noticed that Rose had actually supplied a dedicated white noise / sleep sounds machine. She really thought of everything. Equally as impressive, everything was super clean, to the glass to the plate to the fork. Can't say enough. Stay here. You won't be disappointed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful home away from home.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay. Right in the heart of Aggeville. Walking distance to Town Center, K State College, restaurants, stores, walking trail and much more. Public transportation stops right in front of apartment. Definitely would stay again. Staff was very friendly."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here multiple times and always a great experience- clean, stylish, excellent location ... this is my favorite airbnb!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I spent 3 months at Rose's place and felt completely at home. Some reviews have talked about noise however I did not find it a problem. I would stay again if needing accommodations in the area.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came here for a girls getaway weekend. We had a great time and the place was perfect!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd visit to Rose's place and everything was great!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Roses place is super nice! They have everything you need to stay there for a decent time and they have many apts you can choose from. I ended up staying longer and rose/penny were more than happy to help me arrange that. If you have any questions or concerns they respond very quickly and are super friendly. I would definitely come back if I‚Äôm staying in the Manhattan area.

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures.

I had an issue with the door code and co-host penny answered the phone immediately although it was already pretty late. So, great place, great location and great communication!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place with an awesome host!
2019-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Close to eating. 1.9 miles from stadium.
2019-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean, neat and tidy. Advance communication was right on time and accurate. Unit was easy to find. Great location. We came to attend the football game and were close enough to walk across campus to the stadium. Negatives are not things owner can control. Our bedroom was on the street side. As a result, we had a lot of road noise. We both had difficulty sleeping even though the bed was really comfortable. On Saturday morning around 7 a.m., another resident was in the parking lot playing loud music. Looked like he was getting ready to go tailgate at the stadium. Also, whoever was staying next door in Unit 7 was very noisy and partied until about 9:30 p.m. when they apparently went out for the night (Saturday). I guess I'd forgotten how rude and inconsiderate people can be."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rose is is very quick to respond and very professional.

The king size mattress was extremely comfortable, making for a great night's sleep! The co-host, Penny, quickly responded to a question we had, and even arranged an extra short term parking permit for an elderly family member who came to visit us for brunch so they wouldn't have to walk far. We really appreciated that kindness. This unit is a great value and we would definitely recommend it. We would stay again in the future."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had to come home to manhattan for a family emergency. Booked last minute, super affordable, easy check in and so close to Aggieville!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our quick get away to Manhattan with this beautiful home! There were lots of things we enjoyed! The kid friendly basement (with lots of family pool)!

After talking to the co-host, they were very happy to accommodate us last minute! The home was clean, absolutely gorgeous, and we had everything we needed. It really saved out trip and we loved the home and have already talked about coming back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a very nice place to stay. will be looking at this home on our next trip. very nice view of the lake.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We recently spent several days in your beautiful home. We came to that area with an agenda that was very stressful.

And above all, your home was extremely clean and well kept. Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful home with us."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfy stay, honestly couldn‚Äôt have made a work trip better"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this old house. It was clean and comfortable. The floors do squeak, so when someone would walk down the hall, it woke me up. It just happens to be the someone walked down the hall every 1.5-2 hours during the night, and in one of the rooms had a new born baby that woke up several times. I was there for work and had to wake up early daily for 10-hour shifts. The other occupants made it challenging to sleep. This was no fault of Skylar, she is a great host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Skylar is very responsive in communication as needed!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful space and wonderful place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in Manhattan at this historical spot. Everything was perfect and we learned about Johnny Kaw. The walk to downtown was easy and we enjoyed the Farmers Market. We‚Äôd love to visit again.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"if you're tall the upstairs shower is not ideal however everything looks and feels at home. great location and neighborhood, and host."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cool place to stay. The check in was easy and the housemates were cool too. Unfortunately I was busy on my work, so couldn‚Äôt send nice time with other mates, they had invitations to party."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly what I needed a quite place for school studying.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful historic home in historic neighborhood. Easy walking distance to downtown, Aggieville, and K State."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best Air bnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable home with an old charm yet also usefully modernized appliances and fixtures.
The surrounding neighborhood and areas are pretty and conveniently close to MHK airport. The bathrooms are very large and the upstairs bathtub was great for a soak. Only downsides I can think of is it's a bit creaky upstairs, which I imagine could've been bothersome/embarassing if there were other airbnb'ers staying in the other rooms when I was there. The inner finish of the bathtub was also chipping a bit but it wasn't too crazy, and it was still perfectly enjoyable to relax in!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The quality and size of the room is way out of our expectation!! Strongly recommend for people who are looking for a nice cozy place during their stay at Manhattan :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Skylar was amazing to us! i couldn't find a hotel to spend the night (they were all booked) and she was so nice to accept my staying request eventhough it was late. The
home is very beautiful, historic design... super clean!
we'll definitely be back
next time we come to Manhattan"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Skylar is gifted at hosting. We've stayed at her other location before and both were great, peaceful visits. She gives every room all the touches."

I LOVED reading the history of the house in the provided binder!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay while in town for a family wedding. Skylar‚Äôs place was just as described, clean & comfortable, and quiet. We know the other rooms were occupied but never saw or heard them."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute little older home with a few quirks! The bed was so comfy, and I loved the blinds and curtain combo to keep the light out! Valued for a quick trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice room in an already older but well preserved house.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very welcoming
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. It was quiet and clean and exactly what I needed.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice host, and nice neighborhood. All that being said, kinda tough to rationalize giving this a full 5 stars. For what it was, it was fine (being a room in a shared home). However, the vibe and feel of the house was much more-so that of a nicer hostel than that of a bnb. Bathroom doesn‚Äôt lock, earlier checkout time, no toiletries, ran out of toilet paper. It was clean, and if you‚Äôre up to that style of accommodation this listing is perfectly acceptable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very affordable especially for a guy going there just needing a bed to sleep in at night. Very appreciative of the awesome one of a kind deal.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was a K-State undergrad from 2006-2013 and I love the city. It was nice to stay in town again and in such a lovely and historic house. It reminded me of some of the house I lived in while I went to school.
Phenomenally clean, comfortable, and quiet. Skylar is obviously a pro at making people feel welcome. I met Mom too while she was doing some laundry and had a lovely chat.
I am currently an online summer grad student and will be back next summer (or sooner) and this will be the first place I look into when returning.
Thank you Skylar, fantastic job! :D"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Skylar makes a very comfortable home. It is within walking distance of the town center. The interior is updated and very comfortable. I especially liked the back porch. She is a superhost for a reason. She does a great job!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet. I would go again
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs an older home but comfortable. My room was cold but that‚Äôs to be expected with older homes that use radiators for heat. I asked for an extra blanket, and Skylar was nice enough to deliver one relatively quick. For a night or two, I‚Äôd definitely return and likely will be in the future since I travel through Manhattan on the regular."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This my favorite Airbnb so far and not just here in Manhattan, but anywhere I've used the service. Skylar is doing a fantastic job providing a very high quality lodging at an even more affordable price.
The house is renovated and very comfortable. This is also an historic home, one of the first houses built in Manhattan's ""first neighborhood.""
I really like staying here. This will be my first choice on any future stays in area and there is no question about it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location close to everything and the hostess was kind and responsive.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a true Airbnb: it's local, cheaper than any surrounding hotels, and the cleaning requirements are very minimal.
This house is historical to mhk and is within walking distance to multiple restaurants, the mall, and kstate. The only gripe I have is that at 5'3 I was about eye level with the shower head, so be prepared to squat down if you wanna shower and are a taller individual.
Skylar always responded quickly to questions and provides a detailed binder about the area in the room so you can navigate around if you've never been to Manhattan before."
