2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My boyfriend, my son and I stayed here for a couple of days (we do long distance so he came to visit) and it was pretty convenient. Not too far from home, not far from the other springs, just nice and convenient. I loved the decorations in the house and the bathroom is gorgeous too! My only issue is that for someone that makes a lot of food only being provided a small pan and a big sauce pan, was a little difficult when it came to making some meals. The energy was also a little off in the house too so we didn‚Äôt really sleep well at night either. Besides that it was a good short stay and the host was professional and friendly."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Arturo was extremely attentive.
Love the huge backyard with a very clean pool pool. I had to come down in February!
Very clean, love the bathroom. Shower is everything anyone says it would be, pure bliss!

Will definitely see next time if it's available.
Thanks Arturo. ü¶ã"

The temperature is controlled remotely with Nest, and the host is responsive if you ask him to change it. The fridge, microwave, and snacks are convenient, and the apartment is stocked with paper plates and plastic silverware, which is great for eating breakfast or reheated leftovers. Its about 15 minutes from Blue Springs State Park. 35-40 minutes from Daytona Beach."

Great hospitality, privacy, services were some of the many great things we found at Manuel & Nancy‚Äôs place. I definitely recommend this home to anyone visiting the Deltona area.

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy and Manuel were very friendly, they gave all the information required, and though this was an apartment attached to their home, they gave us complete privacy and there were absolutely no issues. We loved our stay so much!"

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfy space in a quiet neighborhood. We had a conference in the area and it was a perfect spot to stay. Beds were very comfy. Really prompt and good communication from the hosts. They were flexible to let us check in an hour early. Recommend!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great value. Very nice space. Super clean. They even leave welcome snacks and drinks which is a nice touch! The check in was super broken down with directions and pictures very well done. If you want super privacy this probably isn‚Äôt the place for you as you share a wall with them. The space is attached to the home. You get your own private entry which is nice! And they will let you use the hot tub which my son loved. It‚Äôs not close to the Disney parks. So we drove 1 hr to sea world and 1.5 to LEGO land. But they are only 25 mins from the Sanford Orlando international airport which was convenient. I would stay here again. We were out the entire time and just slept and showered in. Thank you guys!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a comfortable one night stay! It was easy to communicate with Manuel who was also very flexible to let us use the hot tub (best part of our stay) beyond 9PM. All in all, it was a lovely stay."

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Place Good Value
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very clean and the shower was really nice! As others have commented, the walls are very thin, so when you're in the adjacent areas to the family house, you can hear noise such as chairs moving. It was not unreasonable and did not awake us."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect! Close enough to very popular locations.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay while in deltona! Hosts were very accommodating and nice

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay very quiet neighborhood awesome family very gentle
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Manuel and Nancy were very welcoming hosts. The apartment was perfect for our needs and very clean. The kicker was the pool though! Being able to hangout in the pool in a very quiet environment was so relaxing. I am definitely staying here again when we visit in the future if it is available! Highly recommended!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small apartment off back of house, walk into bathroom and there are 2 good size bedrooms with enough sleeping for a family. The have a small coffee pot, coffee and condiments. Had a small dorm size refrigerator stocked with 2 each: yogurt, sunny D, water bottles. Also had 2 snack packs of peanut butter crackers. Walls are a bit thin between main house & apartment, so we heard a bit of chatter, so we watched TV in the second bedroom. Nice pool area. Great communication!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Manuel & Nancy‚Äôs place is great! Very clean and spacious! They are very quick to respond and are very accommodating!

2018-07-01,2.0,Group trip,"They communicate with you through messaging, but not in person. If you want to know anything about the area or about how to work stuff in the room, you have to ask first or they won‚Äôt tell you."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute and clean little guest house behind home. Highly recommend for a small family.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our first Airbnb experience and it was incredibly nice! Truly a greater experience than staying in a hotel. A lot of small details that Manuel and Nancy thought of to make our stay that much more comfortable. You know you feel right at home when you're out enjoying the city life and continuously mention going ""home"" by accident instead of saying ""let's go back to the hotel."" The 2 rooms are attached to their home, but closed off from their actual home so that it doesn't feel like you're sharing the space with anyone but yourself and whoever is staying with you. There's also the freedom of coming and going as you please. We only saw them one time and they were super friendly. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Manuel and Nancy are absolutely AMAZING! Communication was excellent, place was SUPER clean and they are extremely friendly."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely wonderful! It was super clean, smelled nice, comfy, and exactly what was expected. I have a bad back and the hot-tub was such a nice bonus to the space!

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Manuel and Nancy‚Äôs place is on point! Super clean, nicely decorated, and spacious, we actually got more than we bargained for. Even though we did not get to meet the hosts face-to-face, they always replied expeditiously to any questions we had. Hence I really recommend staying in their apartment!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay here! The place was perfect and Manuel made sure we were taken care everyday. Also great for the price. Thanks for a wonderful stay Manuel.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The hosts were very responsive but respected my personal space as well. If I ever need another place to stay in the area I will definitely return. Definitely recommend
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is cute and quiet,tucked away and a great hot tub."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here! It was super clean, the pool was nice, and the hosts responded quickly to us. The self check in was also great!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Manuel & Nancy‚Äôs place was a great experience. They were very flexible with our check in options. Place was pristine, and very easy to get to. Place was very convenient for us. If we had to rent in the area again will deff consider their place. Thank You!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, super friendly, wonderful experience overall"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first encounter with Airbnb. I couldn't have picked a better place to stay and nicer people to deal with than Manuel and Nancy. They were very prompt with all of our communication and everything was exactly as they described. They accommodated our late arrival and everything was extremely clean and tidy. They left us welcome snacks and beverages as well, which was a very thoughtful touch.
My biggest regret about this trip was not getting to take advantage of the pool or hot tub that was right outside our door :-(
I do feel like I would definitely reach out to them if I I'm in the area again and would book their place in a heartbeat. What a great first experience!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My experience was amazing! I never formally met them but they were very friendly when communicating. The place was very clean and stylish. The pool area is beautiful and very well kept. We enjoyed the complimentary refreshments, soap, shampoo, & conditioner. I was very pleased and comfortable the entire stay. I highly recommend booking this spot it‚Äôs not far from Daytona where we spent most of our time on the beach."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Thank you, great place to stay in Deland.
See you."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely amazing family. Great people living tha American dream.
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay in a location that is reasonably convenient to Orlando or Daytona.
Hosts were very accomodative and the 2 bedroom apt. was nice and clean.
Enjoyed our stay! A small round table in one room would be nice in case 2 couples travelling together might want to watch tv or play cards, etc."
2018-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is attached to the main house and the entrance is in the back through the screened in pool area. The renters gave good space and did not intrude on our family space or time which we are thankful for. Unfortunately we did not take pictures of the entire place upon arrival and were later asked to replace all three sets of bed sheets and the back gate. Our family insisted these were not a result of their stay. We saw no stains on the sheets from the photos provided and the gate was not something we noticed during the stay but was also minor. In the end we paid for half the requested replacement value. In all honesty we had planned to continue to rent from them each year when our family arrived but it's just too risky, who knows what they will want replaced next time."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time ever using Airbnb and looking for a home and it was pretty scary for us since we didn‚Äôt know who the hosts were but Manuel and Nancy made us feel very welcome and the apartment was very clean and they met all of our needs. The pictures are true to the apartment and if we are to ever come back up we will definitely pick Manuel and Nancy again. Only thing that bothered us was when he came into the apartment when we were gone and turned on the outside light. It was honestly very kind of him because it gets really dark but we would‚Äôve managed.
2018-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This was a convenient house to our needs in Deland.
2018-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice and the host accommodating while at the residence. However, we felt that they need to be more honest that the rest room is the only entrance of the apartment. Therefor, if someone is taking a shower or using the restroom other guests must wait to leave or enter the restroom."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excelente lugar.
2017-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures are very accurate and say it all. Good location.

Thanks again!
Juston"
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A private, quiet and convenient place to rest our heads while visiting family. The coffee and juice on arrival were much appreciated. Bed was high and firm. Space was very very clean and checkin a breeze. Thank you for checking in to see if we needed a little more heat during the cold snap!"
2017-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Premises were conveniently located in Deltona area. Hosts made themselves available during the check in process and were accommodating with check in hrs due to late flight. The premises were very clean and the towels smelled so fresh. I would definitely consider this location if the need arises.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Accommodations were very clean and comfortable.

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Manuel and his daughter were lovely, very friendly and exceptionally accommodating, even ran out to get a hair dryer for me! Their place is comfortable and just right for the 3 of us. It has all you need along with a lovely outside pool and grounds. They even managed to get everything perfect after hurricane Irma had left them with no air conditioning for a week! Couldn't have met for our needs this trip to Florida any better. We will certainly recommend it to others and will use again if the need arises. Lorri, Bob & Kurt Judson"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were with Manuel and his family during Hurricane Irma. Although we lost power, Manuel made sure that we were comfortable. The communication was fantastic and so were the accommodations. Thanks Manuel and family. Say hi to Max for us!"
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Manuel was waiting for us at the door to take us to the place. He was really nice. The communication was great. He let us check in earlier to accommodate us. The place is very comfortable for at least 4 people. I would recommend it
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay while on a trip to explore the blues springs area. Met Manuel upon check in. He was very nice and accommodating. Offered suggestions about things to do/places to eat and was very quick to respond.
Place was very clean and has direct access to pool and hot tub. We really enjoyed our stay.
Would definitely come again.
Thank you for being a wonderful host!"
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were on a mini-vacay to the springs for a couple of days. We needed a clean, quiet place to stay that was also affordable. This home was definitely clean, the neighborhood quiet, the hosts attentive and kind, and the pool was a great plus!
The only cons I can think of are minimal and can be easily fixed. Having to meet the hosts f2f in order to get the key & tour was not my favorite. Please get at least one side table in the bedroom for phones and also a lamp."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Manuel and Nancy have an excellent and affordable space. The location is ideal for Blue Springs and/or visiting Cassadaga. We were able to see in 2 days, Canaveral seashore, Blue Springs, Silver Glen Springs, Casadaga, and Juniper Springs at this location. Manuel was excellent at communicating with us the details and very kind. He is an excellent guide to the area. The rooms were flawless and very accommodating for us. We hope to be returning soon. 10/10 would stay again."

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved this apartment for my parents and younger siblings, and they said they really enjoyed it! Manuel offered an early check in, which was nice. He was very quick responding to my questions, and it was a plus that he speaks Spanish. I would definitely recommend this place!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful location close enough to places but not to close. Great open lines of communication! Had everything we could have needed from shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the shower to water and yogurt in the fridge. Highly recommended.

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Manuel and Nancy were great! This was my first time using AirBNB and they made it a great and easy stay. They replied quick, too. Thanks once again guys! :-)"

I'd definitely go back here in the future!"

But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Rachele is the most thoughtful, gracious host, and I would rate this home as one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alexis place was perfect for 2. It felt brand new and was an excellent idea to come stay there the night before flying out of Sanford Airport the following morning. It was a quick, no traffic drive to the airport.
She had provided snacks and drinks and even some items for quick frozen meals in the freezer. We appreciated a few of the snacks during our flight back to Canada.
The bathroom was amazing and the washer & dryer was perfect for not coming home with a lot of dirty wet clothing. I need that mirror.
The ONLY tiny downside was the fridge running was a little louder than I‚Äôm used (as it is a bachelor apt type setup and it‚Äôs all one room) but we still slept amazing as the bed and pillows were amazing.
Parking was great and any questions were responded to very quickly.
It‚Äôs a remote quiet loft over the garage in their yard but privacy was no issue.
I will definitely re-book for our next trip to Sanford/ Daytona.
Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your beautiful spot."

Overall, it was easy to find via WAZE, had designated parking and the space was exactly what we needed. The only thing to be aware of before booking is if you are not able to climb a flight of semi-steep stairs and haul your luggage up, this might not be the best one for you.

The location was great. We felt safe and like we weren‚Äôt too far from things, but far enough where it wasn‚Äôt loud or anything.
There were quite a few plug ins, which personally give me migraines. And the kitchen wasn‚Äôt super stocked with all the things we needed, but as a newer Airbnb, that‚Äôs totally to be expected.

The home is spotless, beautifully and tastefully decorated and Very comfortable, it felt just like home.
The neighborhood, very dark at night, but very quiet n safe. We often went for walks in the evenings.
Nothing is within walking distance so you‚Äôllneed a car, however, there‚Äôs a Publix, Walmart, Dunkin doughnuts, dollar tree, Burger King, and many other places of interest all within a short drive away.
Everything closes early, 7 or 9 pm so plan your day accordingly.
The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you‚Äôll need to cook. Plenty of coffee k kups, salt n pepper. Tony provided paper towels n toilet paper for the first few days.
Beds were very comfy.
There are lime trees in backyard that Tony said we could help ourselves to.

The location is very, very quiet with little street traffic and the fenced yard was a real treat as well.

Kitchen table only seats two so we could only fit at the counter to eat a meal. The house was minimal so it looked clean on first glance, but after spending time there we noticed our socks were black. The shag rug in the living room was filthy and looked like it hasn't been vacuumed in months, there was so much hair that transferred on to anything that touched the rug. It was gross."

Master bathroom rugs were old, not enough towels, cheap bedding and mattresses. Outdated coffee pots overall just not a vacation away experience. A lot of nails on blank walls.

The kitchen was well stocked but could use more serving bowls , dish towels, and pot holders and storage containers for left overs.
The beds were very comfortable! The pool table and foosball tables were fun. We spent every meal on the patio, loved being able to have all the sliding doors open! The backyard was magical! The pool was great size! My daughter and husband spent all mornings fishing from the dock.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mirian has done a great job having a lovely pool, boats, fishing poles, hammocks, grills, etc. The back yard is the real gem."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best place ever. we've stayed at MANY Airbnbs, but this was by far the best. You will never want to leave. we tried to go to the beach twice and left after 30 mins to come back here. We also fell in love with the neighbors. Such wonderful people. :) Can't wait to book next year's trip here again. When a place is this perfect, how could we not."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved my stay here ! Me and my friends LOVED the pool and the house was beautiful, perfect house and it made my birthday amazing. I would definitely rent again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I loved the home. location and communication was easy and prompt. I'd love to rent it again. üëç
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I feel lucky to have come across this house. We usually try to stay right on the beach when we go on vacation. This time we weren‚Äôt sure which pools would be open at the hotels (since there‚Äôs still a lot of construction going on) so we decided to do something different. I am so glad we did! Having the private pool was the best part. I wish we had more time to cook and use the outside kitchen. We were hoping to, but there‚Äôs never enough time on vacation. Everything we would have needed to cook, was stocked in the kitchen. We did get to take the kayaks and canoe out. Honestly, the only negative I can find is that I had to beg my kids to go to the beach. They would have loved to stay at the house all weekend and do nothing else. Beds were comfy and the furniture is beautiful! Infact, I‚Äôm motivated to go home and redecorate my house. üòÜ
If we‚Äôre ever back in the area, we will try to stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 4 time we have rented this home. With so much to do, you can not possibly get bored. the pool and our side kitchen is so nice to have. We love the late night swim along with the fire pit to roast marshmallows. I love sitting outside in the morning with my feet in the pool overlooking the lake while having my coffee. Beautiful home! Never a disappointment! Thank you Miriam for being such an awesome host! Can't wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, highly recommend and would be happy to stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our plan was a peaceful getaway with our 90 year old Mom to relax, this home fit the bill. We didn't do a lot of exploring in the area, since Mom cannot do a lot of walking, so having the beautiful view and the pool was wonderful. The home is very clean and exactly as described. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen had anything you'd need to prepare meals at home, just bring your food and you're set.
I did need to contact Miriam for a couple of items specific to the assistance for Mom, and she responded each time within 3 minutes or less, always very helpful and accommodating.
If you're looking for a nice place to get away and enjoy your family, this fits the bill.
If Mom is able to travel again, we will definitely return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the best air bnb I have ever stayed at! My family enjoyed it very much! The view is beautiful. The lake access is amazing and we had a great time boating!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As a Co-Host of an Airbnb I expect a very high level of service & Mirian went above & beyond for my reservation as I booked her place 2 months prior for a proposal.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! We would definitely recommend. Great home away from home. A warm and inviting feel. Other than eating out and mini golf we pretty much stayed at the house. It‚Äôs so peaceful there with the lake in the back and we enjoyed kayaking. The pool was amazing too. The sound of the waterfall... The water was abit chilly in April but refreshing after laying in the hot sun! It was in the 70s when we were there but was warmer the week before. We didn‚Äôt hardly see any people in the neighborhood. Pretty quiet. The backyard is more private from the one side but on the other side the neighbors could see the backyard from the windows of their house. There are no trees and bushes along the one fence like the pictures show.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great girls weekend at Mirian's! Fresh towels and sheets and a very clean place. Beautiful view on the lake having morning coffee and breakfast. Pool was very refreshing. Nice location. Mirian was very communicative! Perfect for our girls weekend to Cassadaga!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This generous home was just what we needed to decompress after 6 days at Disney. The house is well loved and had everything we needed to chill in the pool. Cook big family bbqs, canoe and kayak on the lake and relax in a hammock with a good book. The home also came with all the towels, bedding and cooking extras we could need and had amazing laundry room that was invaluable.
The local area is also full of amazing nature, we could have easily stayed longer. Although you could see a lot just sitting in the garden.
Miriam was also responsive to all our questions before and during our stay. Would strongly recommend."

We used the kayaks and canoe to explore the lake that is steps from the house, caught fish off the dock, and sat in the swing chair drinking coffee in the morning watching the ducks swim by. The gas grill and well stocked large kitchen made cooking extremely easy. The beds were comfortable, and there were multiple TVs in the house. The master bedroom has a large desk that I used for work. The house was very clean when we arrived. There are pool towels and a lot of bath towels and extra blankets. We would stay here again. Publix and other stores are just a few min away."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Miriam was very kind and understanding. We stayed during tropical storm Nicole and had to leave very early. The house is truly a gem, very vintage and well kept.
The only negatives I have would be the scented candles (I'm very allergic to them). It would also have been more homey without the sign in the bathroom.. But I absolutely understand why it's there.
Thank you Mirian.‚ù£Ô∏è"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, we only got to stay for a night, what a huge mistake!! We should've stayed for more days!! The pictures are great, but it's so much more amazing in person! The kitchen, questionably the best feature, is FULLY LOADED with everything you could imagine needing in a kitchen. Even a mortar and pestle?? so yeah, definitely made pesto with that. It's listings like this that make you understand and appreciate the whole point of Airbnb's. It was truly our home away from home. Thank you for your hospitality Mirian!"

Just an FYI for those considering: Pool is not heated, and there are a few trip hazards outside for small children.

2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Not here to waste time or money.
Someone else is definitely staying on the property while you‚Äôre there even though it says the whole house is yours. It made us very uncomfortable and in turn my family of five stayed in one locked room during our stay. The pool was definitely dirty with dead slugs and other bugs. The house was not clean to a standard that requires a cleaning fee and there was small pests that we had to deal with during our stay. The backyard has a beautiful view. Would be much better if there was some type of upkeep on the house."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was BEAUTIFUL in every way possible, so much to do with family of all age groups from fishing , swimming to kayaks and even games in the house !

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This home was a perfect home to rent for us. It was located only 12 minutes away from my son and his family for our holiday visit. Everything was clean and neat and a full kitchen meant we could eat in all week together. This was helpful with the baby! Richard even had a Christmas tree in the front room to help us celebrate. The pool area is relaxing even without using the pool (the weather was too cold to swim) and the arcade room and game closet kept the kids happy. We did use the fire pit which the kids liked making smores at. Beds were comfy and clean and the TV had all the channels plus more to watch. Every morning we walked around the nice neighborhood where sidewalks were plentiful. Walmart and Publix are right down the street when we needed supplies. And Richard was always only a text away if we needed him. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and was very happy with our stay. Richard was very responsive and a great host. I asked about XMas decorations since we were having our family XMas there and he even got a tree so we didn‚Äôt have to worry about getting one.

The house was fully equipped with the necessary items, pool was great with a TV to watch as you tanned. I also felt secure with the 24 hour security system (Ring) which is located in front of the house and door.

Not only did he have arcade games, but he also had games to play in the back yard such as horse shoe and other games I was able to play with my family. The pool and house was clean upon arrival.

We were surprised the pool was open, and it was actually hot enough in March to take a quick dip.
There were snacks and basic essentials in the kitchen. Great touch."

We loved hanging out in the pool area, relaxing and listening to music on the tv (youtube) and having meals at the bar. We had lots of family fun playing games inside and outside (he has a closet full of them). The living room is also very comfortable for relaxing and watching movies/tv. The area is quiet and only 30-40 minutes from either Orlando or Daytona Beach. In fact most things, restaurants, shopping etc, are only a short drive away.

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was everything I needed for my getaway!! Nice and clean and had entertaining amenities!! I'd highly recommend.

The home is located in a quiet residential area. The location was reasonable driving distance for us to Disney, Discovery Cove and St. Augustine.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean and roomy house with a great host.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Kids loved the pool and arcade games. Richard was very responsive. And location worked great while we were visiting family but also could quickly get to Daytona Beach and Blue Spring State Park.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Deltona in order to visit family who already reside there. It was a great location close to our family but also close to Sanford (cute town with lots restaurants, etc) and only about an hour from Disney. Overall, the stay was wonderful! The house was clean and decorated beautifully. The pool was the perfect size for my little boy and his cousins to play in together (when they came to visit) as well as my husband and myself. We were also pleasantly surprised that the pool had a small deep area (approx 6 feet) at one end which creates fun and a safe way for the kids to jump in.
In addition to the home, Richard was more than accommodating. Every time we had a question or needed something he always responded. He made sure that we were aware of all the amenities within the home and answered any questions we had. He responded quickly each time we reached out and was at the home within minutes when he was needed.
The only thing I would make others aware of (and it‚Äôs mostly for those traveling with children) is there are lots of decor items throughout the home. The home is beautiful but when children are around I had a fear that they would bump into a coffee table, knock something off and break. However, we were able to remedy this on our own by picking up most of these items for the duration of our stay, putting them in the closets or in taller locations and putting them back before we left. Very, very minor thing.
We will stay again the next time we come back to visit family."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, very nice place to stay highly recommended"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is lovely, very clean and smelled very nice upon arrival. The interior design of the home is very modern and gave the home personality and style. The hosts as well as all of the amenities were easily accessible. And the game room is an added bonus to the stay. It was just what myself and my group were needing for our short stay. Definitely would recommend to check out."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely exceptional. Hosts were above and beyond in every way. House was immaculate and a lot of attention was given to providing an amazing experience. Hosts are good, good people and went out of their way to accommodate us on our stay. I've never been more satisfied with an AirBnB or vacation rental."
,,,"The bed is a twin size bed instead of a queen size bed. The mattress and the sheet are the worst. Mattress is super hard and the sheet and blanket are not made with cotton. Me and my boyfriend cannot fall asleep the whole night. We booked 4 days but have to left the next day and choose holiday Inn instead. I don‚Äôt know how this place have 5 stars review. These reviews bring me to their Airbnb. To be fair, I need to say this is not a bad house but the bed is really really poor. I think I‚Äôll choose hotel instead of Airbnb in the future just Incase this kind of situation happened again"
,,,"This is my first negative review but this place was terrible and none of the items we notified night we checked in were addressed except for the AC on the last day. Living room ceiling fan is pieced together and can‚Äôt use due to noise and wobbling. Master ceiling fan doesn‚Äôt work at all. Master shower head sprays water all over the bathroom and you when you turn it on so we never could use it. Dirty dining room (chairs had food and crumbs all over them). Dirty towels left behind. Yard is not completely fenced but we managed that fine. Frustrating to notify them right away, they respond and say they‚Äôll do something, and nothing happens. This house is in a quiet area but it‚Äôs not in good shape. It‚Äôs great decorations and well done pictures and then you get this. We‚Äôve shown up to other places and had things wrong and left 5 stars anyways because they were addressed. Overpaid and will never stay there again."
