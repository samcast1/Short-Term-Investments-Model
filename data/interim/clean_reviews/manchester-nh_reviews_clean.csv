2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! This was my second stay at the Factory. The room was nice and clean. The Boho theme is great! Please check the plants when you get to the room. They were a bit dry so I made sure to give them water. The best part of the room is how sunny it is! If you like lots of natural light this is a great room.
It’s not far from the airport and there is a lot to do around Manchester. I visit for work, but I like the convenience of shopping."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such an amazing find. My boyfriend and I stayed the weekend and it was such a welcoming atmosphere here. I would definitely return again!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in! The hosts were very responsive and helpful. The room looked exactly like the pictures, and the natural light was amazing."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this has been my favorite place thus far. I wish I could live there!! the artsy vibe is right up my alley and everything was A++++ and when I went to leave at 6:30 am and then realizing I had left my cell phone in the apt with the keys inside and a security door I managed to text Mariana (the host) from another device and thankfully she responded immediately and guided me through getting back in and up to the room to retrieve my phone. she was excellent and just all around amazing and friendly esp for that early in the am. I would have understood if she hadnt gotten right back to me but I was thrilled that she did. make my stressful mistake a breeze to get through so I could get on with my day. she's the perfect host. thank you Mariana, for everything I absolutely will be back as soon as possible. the bedding/ mattress/ pillows were an absolute dream to sleep on."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my go-to place to stay when I’m in town. It appears the hosts are responsive to reviews/comments, as several items I would have enjoyed having in the rooms in the past are now included. Lovely place to stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay for our visit, so comfortable and clean and quickly felt right at home. Being on the top floor meant lovely sunlight in the mornings. Host was proactive and friendly and also gave us a heads up for the plow car. Easy to check in and out."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mariana was so kind and gracious when I had an issue with booking an additional day. Mariana even gave us a piece of her Christmas cactus to bring back to the Vineyard with us!
I didn’t realize that there was a place for garbage and we left ours tied up together. That was completely my fault, I missed it in the directions on where to dispose of it.
The place had a great vibe and we really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My flight got cancelled out of Manchester, so I had a 2 day layover. I was very happy to avoid a hotel room, and to have a nice, comfortable, affordable place to hang out and read a couple great books. Thanks, Mariana!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you to Mariana and the Factory on Willow team! This was definitely one of my favorite AirBnB locations I've ever stayed at. Even though this studio is located in a historic factory building, the windows and central air/heat worked perfectly to protect us from the cold 20-degree weather outside. We could not have possibly been more comfortable. Thank you again for a great stay and I look forward to booking here in the future when I visit again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I keep staying here because it works on so many levels. thanks mariana
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Mariana was very helpful and answered our questions immediately. This Airbnb is so beautiful, clean, and peaceful. It is close to downtown and other attractions in the area. We would definitely stay there again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here many times: excellent spaces, well designed, with easy, flexible pick-up, and parking in one of two lots. The rooms themselves are beautiful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Factory is my favorite place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana’s place was described exactly as listed! The place was spacious bright and squeaky clean. The location itself was very cool, we loved the comic book store on the main level of the building! And so much to do nearby. I would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well presented and clean studio in a very well looked after development.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, on the smaller side, but it's comfortable. The only nitpicky things I would have are that there is not any extra bedding (other pillows or blankets) and weirdly no tissues. Only reason I noticed this is because I can get bad seasonal allergies. Also sad that, after asking an employee at the bottom floor, that the bean shop described, was apparently not there anymore? I could be wrong and I should have asked the host. Overall, nice location, a little loud, but I'm a heavy sleeper, so that didn't matter to me."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super clean and stylish with lots of amenities. Super walkable location and gorgeous loft.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've been here many times. Very well maintained.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was wonderful! Gorgeous!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was so bright and open. The windows and high ceilings make the space seem even bigger. Perfect size for 2. Despite being a large building, it was SO quiet the entire time we were there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my birthday there last weekend and it was peaceful. It was nice to get away alone and I felt safe
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,lady accused me of smoking in the hall way when I went outside 😒 every time and I left a back pack and had to do excessive driving to get accused of smoking little rude
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, short drive/walk to downtown and other amenities. Beautiful clean room!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mariana has been outstanding and I have stayed with her properties several times. Top Notch!

2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, well pictured. The natural lighting from the windows was great. Bathroom was spacious. Closet space was easy to access. Pots and pans were accessible. My fiancé and I did cook meals, sink is small. Be cautious of tidying up as you good. No knives or cutting board but a wonderful experience. Would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an extremely clean and well themed boho space. Very helpful host. Big Windows and natural lighting made space feel open & bigger.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana was a great host! Very friendly, responsive, and understanding when we accidentally slept in past check-out time. Shoutout the very comfortable bed! The place was beautiful and exactly as pictured in the listing. The brick walls with the plants and macrame decor were comforting and felt like home! Check-in/out was very easy. Overall an amazing stay! Thank you Mariana!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, very communicative and helpful host. Great price and just as advertised."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bohemian Paradise is just that... Paradise. It felt like home immediately. I had everything I needed plus more. The studio apartment is in an old mill building with stores on the first floor for an extra perk. Great location. I felt safe and secure the whole time. I will be trying out the other themed rooms next time I need a getaway.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time this weekend. The accommodations were beautiful! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented a few rooms to stay at during our wedding reception at the venue located downstairs. The rooms were AMAZING. So clean, meticulous, beautiful views and you can tell they think of every detail from the guest point of view. 100% recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful facility with a host of amenities. Very convenient location and attentive staff. Highly recommend
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed staying there. Unfortunately my boyfriend is on probation and we weren't informed that having a probation officer was against the rules there, as we were informed we weren't welcome back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect Airbnb for a getaway weekend.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely experienced a ghost, that said the rest of the stay was wonderful. Very interesting key system for moving around the building. If you’re looking for a reason to come I would say the location is the best part of this room. It’s far enough from the city to where you can’t hear the traffic and close enough to get where you’re going comfortably. Old building and a nice comic shop on the ground level. Make sure to be respectful in the room however, you never know who’s watching 👀👻👻"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"such a funky building, nice gym, nice room. you're going to need a car to get anywhere. not walkable"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for the easy and relaxing stay! Wonderful accommodations, just as described. Picturesque room and views. I loved the room and all the amenities. Great design and fun art vibe in this remodeled warehouse.
The area felt quiet and safe, while being very active and inhabited. The building feels like a popular place to visit because of the awesome chocolate shop.
I felt like if I needed anything or had questions, I could easily find a response."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brilliant concept! So nice to see a lovingly reclaimed old brick factory building turned into a modern and tasteful space to stay. The boho room was WONDERFUL with floor to ceiling windows, yummy sunshine, the perfect little studio kitchen, and plant friends hanging in macrame in the south facing windows. 100% better experience than staying in a hotel! Thank you so much for creating this option for Manchester!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very secure feeling, surprisingly quiet location, close to good food, good size for a couple. Pretty ideal Airbnb. Would stay again for sure."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Safe, quiet, cozy, and clean! exactly how it looks in pictures. I had to stay there for graduate school things for a couple days and found I was able to study and enjoy the space easily. Mariana is very responsive and kind, with clear instructions."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this Airbnb. The place was lovely and bright and the bed was comfortable. It was not too far from downtown and other nearby attractions. If we ever stay in Manchester again, we’d definitely stay at one of Mariana’s places."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modern, clean cool space! Great building!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best bed we ever slept in! like for real...this was so great. the whole apartment was really nice and we would have loved to even stay a bit longer if we would have had the time. The apartment has everything you need. Even if you find something that you miss...Mariana will take care of it immediately. You can't go wrong with this one.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana was very helpful and responsive to any requests we had. The apartment was delightful, and well located for our needs. Would def stay here again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Third time staying at the Factory in the Boho room. Fantastic everything! Mariana is awesome!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a few nights. Clean and comfortable.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time staying at this location. Excellent every time, feels like my home away from home. Quiet, clean, safe, nice, and very comfortable."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely Boho Retreat apartment in a unique setting, but some of the missing necessities made an impact. Basics such as an extra blanket and pillow, tissues, and a cutting knife would have made a nice difference. Some renters complained of noise from local businesses, but after a three nights, we found it quite peaceful. The entry keypad does not work well and we learned on our last day that the key fob opens the door! Communication about that, and where to take out garbage, would have been helpful. DO NOT forget to put parking pass in the car window! The building seemed deserted, the hallway had a strange smell, and there were no food trucks, but on the whole, we wanted a unique and peaceful location and that’s what we got."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved being here. The location is amazing. I told my friends to book here! It’s super clean and so safe feeling. Also wicked cool to have a food truck option. This was my first time booking an Airbnb and the interaction with Mariana was so positive and understanding. She is legit a super host. I’ll def book her again in a heart beat.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the Factory on Willow. The studio was very nice! Exactly as described. Great amenities in the building. Check in/check out process was easy. Great view for 4th of July fireworks. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly best bed and pillows ive ever had from any hotel or BNB. The building is very secure and is within walking distance of many bars and restaurants.
Rooms atmosphere was very cozy and my fiance was in love with it."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A great stay. What you see is what you get. The Factory is an interesting housing & work-space concept.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Factory is an affordable and fun getaway for anybody coming to the area. There are aspects of the place that are so cool (original wood from shoe factory, a bookstore, and even an authentic phone booth). We did not take advantage of the events but there was live music and even a food truck. A millenials dream. Great value. Just be aware that you are next to a bright and decently loud area as a trucking company is across the street. I am a CDL driver myself so I have sympathy but it can get a bit loud. The darkening shades helped but just beware and plan accordingly. We had a blast!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Great building amenities of the gym and game room. Most comfortable bed. Beautiful windows of views to wake up to the sun. Convienant for 15 minute walk to downtown. Chic and comfortable furnishing
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here while in town and it was absolutely perfect! We loved the vibe of the whole building and the host was so responsive! We will definitely come back
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful air bnb! Comfortable bed, super clean and adorable decorations. The whole building is very well kept and feels very safe. Can’t wait to come again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t beat the price on this cute studio apartment! Clean and stocked with anything you could possibly need with the convenience of being near food and other downtown locations
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay here again. 5/5
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Meticulously clean room! Good first Airbnb experience!
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,When we arrived we had a little hiccup with our original room. I messaged Mariana and she responded quickly and moved us to a new room. This room was way better and we enjoyed it. The location was near plenty of shopping and restaurants. Overall it was a very nice stay.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean (outside of kitchen counter utensils) and bright. Check-in was easy. I appreciated the water fill-up station in the lobby and the thoughtful, functional room set-up. Found the unit to be noisy with street, airplane and heating element noises. My back didn't love the bed, but if you like super soft beds you'll love this one! Pretty convenient location but you'll def want to have a car to get to shopping and dining."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and convenient!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our experience at The Factory! The room was incredibly clean and everything we needed was provided. Check in instructions are very thorough, and there are maps on the wall in the lobby if you don't know where to find your room.
If you're like me and you live in the country and aren't used to being centrally located, just a heads up to remember to close the shades BEFORE you shower 😂"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Modern feel. Awesome place to stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this was such a beautiful studio to stay in and it was located to all the things you could want to do! it was close by to amazing food and fun shopping. the apartment itself was beautiful and so clean. checking in was a breeze and we would love to stay here again when we visit New Hampshire in the future!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, plenty of light!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Really nice place to live at. The host is really nice and friendly. Worth the price for sure!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little apartment was perfect for my needs. It was cute, clean, comfortable, and convenient. I’ll definitely be back in the future!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great; the house was clean, easy to find. The host was great, and communication was good. The only downsides the street noise was high and we weren't given a parking pass and our car was towed. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but be sure to ask about parking just to make sure. Otherwise, it was a good stay."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice studio!!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The studio was amazing! Less than 10 minutes to downtown and truly the best restaurants I have ever been to! The price was worth it and the entire building was clean and even had a small game room in the basement that we took advantage of while waiting for our laundry. Place was truly worth the price and would recommend to anyone staying in the area!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic room, building, and amenities. We loved staying here!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cute! We loved the bathroom and the sheets were so soft! Will definitely stay here again in the future.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place to stay! The check-in was super convenient and the place was very clean. Fantastic location if you want a short trip into Boston or to go for an arduous hike in the mountains!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The factory was so neat! The room was clean and the windows opened up to see the sunrise! the building itself was a whole experience within itself. So if you are wanting a taste of the city this is your place!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Mariana is responsive to questions.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great space and easy travel to food, downtown, pharmacy, grocery. And day trips up north to the mountains! We stayed for a week and felt right at home at the Factory. Great for short and longs stays."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay at the Boho Paradise apartment. The unit is really cute and comfortable and Mariana was very easy to communicate with. I would recommend this spot for those looking for a place to stay in Manchester. Thanks again Mariana!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host. No complaints
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay ! Would recommend anybody stay here !
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! Everything was just as pictured and described. The building is very beautiful
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfy spot! Very clean and worth the money.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The place was very nice and clean! The giant windows provided lots of natural sunlight, which was amazing! One thing to note is that there’s an auto body shop right outside the window and an exhaust shop down the road. The guys are up and working early and sometimes work late. The boho paradise was a very cute, clean place to stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The whole building was very clean, and friendly, as was the actual AirBnb. Loved the stay, the plants were a fantastic addition!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy place to stay at do recommend this place, loved how beautiful it look. My fav part was sleeping in those comfy blankets!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a wonderful time at the Boho Paradise Airbnb. The space was clean and comfortable. The Airbnb was very close to downtown Manchester, NH which was a great city to spend time in. We were thankful to Mariana for a great experience and we would stay at Airbnb’s she hits if we’re in the area again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room, stylish, comfortable, and very clean! The room is located in a restored factory building and is fully updated while keeping some of the ascetic elements from the original factory (wood beams, original hard wood floors etc). Ample parking and very safe building and location. 10/10 would recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. Mariana was very helpful in communicating with us before we checked-in, and we felt that if we had any questions during our stay, we would get answers quickly. The space is very cute and cozy inside, and the Factory Apartment Complex that the apartment is located in is a very cool space as well. However, the surrounding area is very industrial, and the walks between the apartment and the downtown area are not the most scenic. The place itself is very bare-bones, but the natural light, plants, TV, and stovetop in the kitchen make it great for a weekend getaway."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very clean, organized, and so cute! I will be coming back!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was PERFECT for our short stay in Manchester. Such easy check in and check out, great accommodations, quaint, quiet, and delightful! We wanted to stay in our little loft and relax all day! Mariana was also very communicative and lovely to work with."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about the Factory space. The space is new, clean with everything you need. I used the workout space and was able to eat in my studio or go out. It was a quiet space to relax, but easy to get downtown if you wanted more of that feel. My only worry is that when I come back to Manchester, they will be so popular, I won't get a room! This is a great place to stay for work, staycation, or a get away. I used it as my ""homebase"" to see other parts of NH (seacoast & white mountains) as day trips. Highly recommend it!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Beautiful high ceilings, fast wifi, lots of natural light, spacious mini fridge, and more!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great at Mariana’s. It was a great location, and the apartment was very neat."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome studio apartment. Very convenient to a lot of things by car. I wouldn’t advise walking downtown from here. Check in was a breeze, and Mariana graciously let us check in a couple of hours early. We loved the mattress, very comfortable for both of us, though we have very different preferences. The plants are such a nice touch. I recommend ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper, as walls between units are thin and there are lot of active birds in the morning. For the price I would definitely recommend and return."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You cannot go wrong with Mariana and The Factory. Her communication is prompt and accurate. With my changing travel plans, she was flexible and opened a new unit early to extend my stay. Above all, Mariana is a truly nice person who exudes positivity and good humor."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Place as expected, very clean and good location for my purposes. Very friendly & quick communication. Would recommend for sure!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a few days in Manchester. Place with Nice and clean and the shower very relaxing, thanks, Kevin"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying at an AirBnB. This place was close to the house my daughter lives in. We could walk to her house. I will definately check out AirBnB the next time I visit her. Thanks
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was very responsive and flexible for some last minute changes.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect little apartment
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was comfy and clean and Kevin was super helpful! A perfect place to stay for my three days in Manchester!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kevin was very welcoming to us and our fur babies! The space was small, but oddly very spacious! 10/10 would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was super responsive respectful and always answered within 2-3 minutes if I needed anything flexible and helpful I will always book with him when I need to book air bnbs thank you so much

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us. The location is great, very close to downtown restaurants, etc. Very clean and exactly as it was described. It is in a quiet neighborhood and you park right out front on the street. The bed was comfortable (and warm), the weather was really cold when we were there in January. Nice place."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Kevin‘s studio was small but cute. It had all the necessities and was well worth the price, but there was really no place to sit and relax. There was the bed, and then counter height wooden stools. That was clear from the pictures, so shame on me for not noticing. The place is great if you’re just looking for a place to sleep. Kevin was very accommodating. Nice, clean and a great value for the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was extremely responsive, in two languages! There was a small issue with the water at one point, and as soon as I said something, he immediately explained and fixed it.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay very near downtown. The Airbnb is as advertised in the photos. You can park right out front. Easy to get in; two windows for natural light. Do check out the Bearded Bakery, only a block away. Great pastries for breakfast!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great house, fit our entire family….it helped create a great end to our daughter’s 4 years at Saint Anselm College.

Large yard (although it rained).
Enough parking for our 4 vehicles. Overall, we would recommend!"

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was not too bad but the house was not very clean. There was heavy dust in several places, the walls, doors, and light switches were filthy. There was mold in one bathroom and the other had an unpleasant odor. In the kitchen there was food and ants on the (sticky) floor and hair and crumbs in the freezer. The towels and bedding smelled suspiciously of febreze and not laundry detergent.
Otherwise, the location was good and with a proper cleaning, I think this would be a fantastic stay."

It worked out great for my family to get together with us all coming from different states. Six adults stayed here. Everything you could need was provided in this home. Good size rooms. The beds were very comfortable. Having 2 bathrooms was a plus. All and all we had a wonderful time and were thankful to be able to stay here together. Thanks.

Nice dining table - good for playing games.

We would not hesitate to return if the situation arises."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The person I was staying with asked me how the home was listed, and before I could answer he said, “it’s so quiet here. Surprisingly so. They should highlight that.” The neighborhood is very accurately described. Not far from anything in the city without feeling like it. The yard is lovely and being fenced in made it perfect for the dog. The house itself is spacious, clean, and comfortable. Kevin is also very accurately described as a Superhost. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking to feel at home when not at home!"

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"I came to Manchester with a group of friends to run a race. Kevin’s house was perfectly located about a mile from the start/finish line of the race. While we could have gotten hotel rooms and stayed right at the race site, it would have been much more expensive let alone we could not have all fit in one room. The house was perfect with four bedrooms and two bathrooms + a couch that could also provide a place to sleep if we didn’t want to double up. The house is an older home in an established neighborhood with modern touches throughout. Some of the highlights: lots of thick, fluffy towels, soaps and shampoos; plenty of blankets (temps were cold, so much appreciated!); location…walkable to downtown; comfortable seating; working appliances (trust me…that isn’t always the case…); quiet neighborhood; and easy entry and checkout. My friends and I had a fabulous time and would absolutely recommend Kevin’s place! Thanks for your hospitality!"

The neighborhood is nice & quiet. Cooking in the kitchen was great as well. The cabinet filled with spices was a welcomed surprise and made cooking so much easier. We loved the cleanliness and the coziness of the home. And the AC’s made sleeping very comfortable. Thank you! We hope to stay again in the future. Entry was very easy and Kevin was attentive and responsive. My Bichon Frise, Luna, enjoyed frolicking in the fenced-in backyard. Great stay!"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Old house, but lots of great updates. More 'extras' than I would have thought would be in in Airbnb - towels, bottled waters, paper towels, tissues, new condiments in the fridge, ice in the freezer, etc. 3BR upstairs share the 1 BA. 1 BR main floor has it's own BA. Shower upstairs a tight squeeze, but doable short-term. DR area seats 6 - bar height chairs. Couch (pull-out) in LR/den comfy - small room, but ok. Messaged a couple times w/Kevin - very responsive. Suggested he add more furniture to MBR - he responded it was already on order. Seems very on top of things, & was helpful. Isn't as close to SNHU as I'd thought, but it wasn't really an issue. We drove & found parking ok. Overall, I'd recommend if traveling to Manchester."

They could play outside in the fully fenced, large back yard. They had their own room to stay in upstairs. 3 bedrooms upstairs and 1 down. There was absolutely nothing lacking at this house. Park with a playground is about 2 minutes away. Walmart is under 10 minutes away. Neighborhood is quiet in a good location. If you forget something, it is probably stocked in the house. Everything that we wanted in a house was there. I will definitely be staying again."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"I stayed at Kevin’s air Bnb with 6 people for a CrossFit competition. We needed to be in Nashua for 7am, so the house was only 22 minutes away. For 1 couple and 4 friends it was the perfect amount of space for everyone to have their own bed. Kitchen was fully stocked with bottled waters which was a nice treat when we arrived and for us to take out the door on Saturday. Kevin’s description of the house is spot on and we felt very comfortable there."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family was traveling to Londonderry for our granddaughter’s baptism and chose this residence for it’s location to the Manchester airport.

There were motion detection lights in nearly all rooms. The wood flooring in the home is beautiful. We found the neighborhood quiet and welcoming. And it is convenient to downtown Manchester. By the way, if you are a disc golfer the Hollows courses are a lot of fun."

2021-08-01,4,Group trip,The location was great and the bedrooms were spacious with memory foam mattresses. Kevin let us use the washing machine even though we were only staying for two nights instead of a week which was very helpful. My only complaint was the musty smell and humidity level throughout the house.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay and Kevin was on top of any questions or requests. The house came with everything we needed and some things we forgot we needed.

Amenities such as kitchen utensils and beverages on hand were helpful!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great Airbnb experience went with kids and a couple adults. The location was perfect, close to many restaurants. There were so many little touches that were so appreciated at the house like a case of water in the fridge, extra soap in the closets. Small things you may have forgotten Kevin remembered. Highly recommend!"

The space was super comfortable, and my friends and I (7 people total) were able to feel right at home when we came back from our activities (hiking, beach, etc. via car). Whenever there was a question or concern, Kevin responded quickly and checked in with me before and after our stay. Honestly, the place was so nice (decoratively and amenities ) and comfortable my friends didn't want to leave; they especially miss the beds. ha ha ha"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was very responsive. The house was very clean and comfortable.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in the apartment - it was cozy but spacious, nicely decorated, so clean, and had everything you could ask for, plus private entrance and easy parking! It was a short walk to the many restaurants/bars Downtown. We really appreciated the list of local recommendations, very helpful! We would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was exactly what we were looking for. It's walkable to all of the shops, restaurants and bars that downtown Manchester has to offer. It's a 1-bedroom apartment that works well for what it is. It has a private entrance, all of the amenities you need, and is clean and comfortable.
Scott and his team were very easy to work with and offered plenty of advice on local attractions. The were responsive when our travel plans were delayed and offered help just when we needed it."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and his folks were awesome. Very responsive. Everything I wanted was there. Even like…..chip clips. It’s slightly off the main drag of downtown, and you’ll need a car to get places, but it’s Manchester so you kind of need that anyway, and honestly I feel like that’s baked into the price. Also note that it’s a third-floor walk-up. Stairs are outside but well-covered so there was no issue with ice or anything. Parking is super easy. There’s a Dunkin across the street, and also a good pizza place. Nice and quiet. Well maintained. Black-out curtains in the bedroom. Personal touches when I got there. Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, great place."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and in a good part of town. Only concern we had was the bed. It is extremely uncomfortable, hard as a rock. We bought a mattress topper to make it more comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom was very clean. This is a great place, but the bed keeps it from being a 5-star stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and Michelle’s apartment was amazing, they were so nice and incredibly quick with responses to any issue that arose. Scott gave us an entire list of amenities that Manchester had to offer within our first day. Wonderful hosts, and wonderful people we would definitely stay again! 10/10"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great space and great hosts.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot describe how amazing our stay was. The place was clean and pristine, and the attention to detail was spot-on. Scott made us us feel like home; we even felt sad having to leave."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean and comfortable spot, easy access with a private door, and Scott is very communicative, friendly and helpful! Looks just like the photos.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A very nice place. We brought our dog and the place was clean and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,10/10 the best
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Michelle’s place went above and beyond. For the comfort and care that went into the home, its convenient location, and the attentiveness of the hosts, it is more than worth the reasonable rate!
I’ve never seen a cleaner bathroom, and really appreciated the thoughtful gestures and amenities (first aid, extra toothbrushes, candy!, feminine products!!!). We have family in town and a lot of reason to visit Manchester, and I will not consider staying at another location or with a different host on our many subsequent visits!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place. They even left baby proofing supplies for my one year old and had toys and books she enjoyed playing with.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really enjoyed my stay with Michelle and Scott. super responsive hosts. easy to communicate and gave good recommendations for local restaurants and coffee bars . will definitely stay with them again when in Manchester. highly recommended.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a longer-term rental after our cross-country move with our two pets and Scott and Michelle's place did not disappoint! It had everything we needed for our stay! The location was close to so many restaurants, walkable to downtown, and close to major highways for our work commutes. Scott and Michelle provided great local recommendations and were always helpful and responsive. There was even a sample of local coffee and chocolates when we arrived! The bed was very comfortable and we really appreciated the desk for remote work, and other small touches for laundry and toiletries. Could not recommend this place enough! Great value, location and hosts!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very responsive and proactive. Place is adorable and makes you feel at home. Clean! Loved the private entrance.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely the best place I’ve stayed at in Manchester! Very clean and felt like home! The bed is very firm and the couch is super tiny, but for an Airbnb this is a really great place to stay and I’ll definitely book again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was amazing. 10/10, would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking to stay towards the city in New Hampshire. Only thing I would mention is if you like a softer mattress, bring one to put on top as the mattress is pretty stiff."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Michelle are great hosts--very responsive and happy to share tips on things to do. This was a work trip so I didn't have much extra time, but I'm keeping their recommendations in mind for the next time I'm in the area. The apartment is just as described. It's very comfortable, clean, tastefully decorated, and has all the amenities you'll need. I even found a nice welcome card and a few treats when I arrived. The area is quiet and I really appreciated having an off-street parking spot. The heater was great and I never once felt cold despite the chilly nights outside. If you have mobility issues, you should see if they have another unit available. This apartment is on a third floor and requires climbing a couple of flights of stairs. But I had a great stay and would gladly stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Space was beautiful and clean. Right near downtown. Hosts had great suggestions and always answered right away

2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We really felt comfortable and safe. The place was very cute, and the decor was lovely. We loved the full kitchen, even though we didn't get to use it as much as we would have liked (visiting family & friends). We always got a quick response the couple of times we had questions. We would definitely use this place again when we visit New Hampshire. Thanks."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great Stay here . Nearby Downtown , From the Apt walk to downtown just spent 10min . Everything is so convenient. Scott and Michelle are really really kindly and nice . I do recommend when guys come to Manchester, this Apt is your top pick .🥰🥰"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancé, dog and I stayed at Scott & Michelle's adorable apartment for a month while visiting family in Manchester, NH. The apartment is decorated so nicely, it's super kid-friendly for those traveling with their little ones (child-proof drawers, games, kids bowls, etc), and there are so many helpful touches throughout the whole place. Upon entering the apartment, they left us a note with some local chocolates which was so sweet. There are also a ton of supplies in the kitchen, like spices, oil, coffee filters, etc and items in the bathroom that you might need as well. We worked from the apartment for the month and the wifi was great - no issues. You are also right next to Elm - so a quick drive or walk away from lots of food. Fratello's is a great Italian spot we loved! There is also a gym down the street and a Rite Aid next door. We would definitely stay again. Thank you Scott & Michelle!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was literally great! I will definitely come back here
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, convenient to downtown"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean. Walking distance to dining options downtown. Parking space is a big plus.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Michelle were excellent hosts! They have great recommendations for the area, and there were nice welcoming touches in the apartment. The area around the apartment made me worried at first as a solo female traveler, but I had no issues while I was there and the other residents in the home were extremely nice!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Really nicely furninshed apartment.
I was impressed with the kitchen set up particularly.
Bed is Very Firm.
."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This apartment and everything in it is in fabulous shape. It's nice having a private entrance, there's plenty of parking, access to 93 is really convenient, and it's walkable to shops and restaurants. Scott and Michelle were really responsive to any questions I had."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This apartment at the north end of downtown Manchester was perfect for my needs! Walking distance to necessities and restaurants, easy access to major roadways to head any direction by car. My first apartment AirBnB, and it was super quiet since it is a corner unit on the top floor. Portable A/C unit kept the apartment comfortable, even on the 90+ days. Well stocked kitchen, comfy couch, workspace with strong wifi, dedicated parking space. It was really nice to eat meals out on the covered porch/landing, sometimes chatting with a neighbor in passing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at your place. Thanks for making it so homey and welcoming! We really enjoyed our stay

2024-04-01,2,Stayed one night,"I really hate to leave a bad review!! We arrived late and were exhausted. I honestly wish I hadn’t stayed. The kitchen had a horrible smell. There was a weird room in the back that wasn’t disclosed in the ad, computers set up with web cams. There was a sign that stated closed for storage??!! Ashleigh’s communication was great and she did refund for a second night that I was supposed to stay. I find it hard to believe this space is a guest favorite or 5 stars. My daughter and I felt very uncomfortable the very short time we were there."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great hosts. Very responsive and communicates well.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and space.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall this is a great place to stay for anyone needing a home away from home. It’s thoughtfully set up with everything a person needs (including a basket of toiletries in the bathroom should you forget an essential item). It’s clear Ashleigh takes great care to insure people have a comfortable stay. Communication with Ashleigh was easy and prompt. Hands down the best option for a stay in Manchester.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was amazing! We came from England to visit our family and we felt right at home. The neighborhood was lovely and quiet, close to everything. The house was stylishly decorated, with cozy pillows, comfortable beds, and ceiling fans. The kitchen had everything we needed and more.
This was one of the most well-equipped Airbnbs we have ever stayed in, both in America and abroad. There were plenty of fluffy towels, cleaning products, bin bags, toilet roll, and paper towels. We were so glad we didn't have to rush to the store as soon as we got there!
We were also touched by the thoughtful gesture of Ashleigh and Rob, who set up a Christmas tree and some festive decorations for our kids to enjoy on Christmas morning and throughout our stay.
The communication with the hosts was excellent. They were always quick to respond and very friendly. We would love to stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful place to stay in Manchester."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to meet up with our friends. Clean, cosy and plenty of room for two couples. Well equipped kitchen.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about Rob and Ashleigh as hosts and the apartment itself! they were both incredibly kind, responsive and accommodating! we hosted our first family holiday dinner in 10 years and everyone kept saying how perfect it was. the apartment is roomy, clean and set yo perfectly for a couple getaway or a family stay. the attention to detail was so appreciated (bathroom essentials, mints on pillows, childrens utensils and high chair, board games, etc). I am so excited that we have found a comfy, safe place to return to in the future when we visit family! thank you for everything, we will be back!:):)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at Kevin's apartment in Manchester, NH, and it was an absolute delight. The apartment is not only cozy and super clean but also peacefully situated in the heart of the city. Kevin provided clear instructions that made our stay seamless and stress-free.
What set this place apart was the beautiful art and cultural decorations, which highlighted the Netherlands, including orange motifs of Holland, reflecting Kevin's love for Ajax soccer team. This unique touch added a lot of character to the space and made our stay even more special.
Whether you’re in town for business or pleasure, Kevin’s apartment provides a perfect, centrally-located retreat. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy a bit of culture in the comfort of a welcoming home.
Thank you, Kevin, for such a memorable experience!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, we travelled mostly, so didn’t spend a lot of time in, the neighborhood looks nice & was quiet."

Kevin thank you very much for having us at your place ! we never felt unsafe !"

Great stay, would recommend and stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy from start to finish. Kevin was quick to respond to any questions. Easy to access the apartment and everything was exactly as seen in the picture. Clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Kevin was an amazing host always responsive and kind. The amenities were just as described and when there were some loud and challenging guests across the hall from me, he addressed the issue right away. I would definitely recommend staying at Kevin's airbnb!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great for thanksgiving. We needed a place to stay while visiting family and this was a great option. Close to many restaurants and the highway. The photos need some updating as the place is actually better than the listing! The couch and beds are very comfortable. There is a roll out twin that was super nice for any guests throughout. I will say the check in instructions were a little different, from the message. I was glad Kevin messaged us and gave us detailed instructions. They even decorated for the holidays while we were there!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended, great location and very comfortable place to stay."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and attractive accommodation after a narrow climb upstairs. We had all the facilities that we could possibly have needed, but the fan/lights combo wasn't to our taste and one of the bedrooms didn't have a wall switch at all."

Would stay again."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This is a comfortable and spacious apartment near central Manchester, with a bit of venerable age to it. The bedrooms are large, the kitchen is well appointed with mostly new appliances, and there is adequate air conditioning for the really hot days. Good TV and wi-fi. It's not a new home, so there is a bit of creakiness here and there, but that's part of the old charm of this pleasantly quiet neighborhood. We fixed our own breakfasts, but enjoyed the proximity to downtown Manchester and its restaurants for our dinners. We had a nice weeklong stay."

There was salt and a shovel left for us on the stair landing. The apartment was lovely; it's exactly what we wanted. The kitchen was outfitted beyond my wildest expectations! There were muffin tins should I want to bake! There was an extensive spice rack and a beautiful knife set! One thing that impressed us very much was the presence of a large recycling bin right in the kitchen. The main bedroom and the living room had giant TV's! The outdoor area was lovely, too.

It was really nice since we had to toss a few items at airport security. One evening we came back to find that the TV not working and I messaged Scott and he responded right away. I had turned off the outlet at a light switch an easy fix. They also provided a list of local restaurants and establishments that they enjoy as locals. It’s a convenient location to the SNHU arena in case you are traveling for a graduation. It’s close enough to visit all 6 New England states on day trips. A great experience and would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have family in Manchester we typically stay with and with the graduations underway this past weekend we couldn’t all fit so we decided on an Airbnb.
We booked this location and it was perfect, it was so local to family a few blocks away, graduation was close, nice area and walkable.
The layout was great and even had some things stocked you wouldn’t typically come across in airbnbs.
We couldn’t locate the key to get in and Amy replied immediately with assistance.
We would defiantly rebook here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy was great - a very responsive host and her space was just what we needed for this trip.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a base to explore from and this checked all the boxes. Convenient to an airport. More than enough room for the 2 of us. Comfortable and clean accommodations. The perks were the cute decor and tea/coffee/cocoa amenities. I highly recommend this place. We loved it!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy was so communicative and understanding! The place is cozy and has plenty of room, and everything was super clean. Thank you for everything."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description is NOT accurate. The claim is it is 2 bedrooms. BUT IT IS ACTUALLY 3 BEDROOMS. This is a wonderful place to stay for a weekend or a month. I will be back to stay here again. Amy has very keen decorating skills and appoints her spaces with flair and I would say a loving touch. This is a comfortable place to stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment is clean, convenient, quiet and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking. We very much enjoyed our stay here!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place in a central location that is easy to get to where you need to go.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was very quaint with wonderful decorative aspects. Bedrooms are cozy and spacious. It is important to know that the bathtub is a beautiful old fashion claw type tub with high sides making it very difficult for an elderly or disabled person to get in it. also, there is a total of 15 fairly steep stairs to climb - also very difficult for the elderly or disabled. This should be noted in description of apartment when looking on line. However, overall it was a cozy, delightful place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and very pretty and safe."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s listing was perfect for our stay in Manchester. We stayed at the house for 11 nights and have no complaints.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The rental was great - clean, nice, comfortable. Amy was prompt in her responses, polite, respectful, and super helpful. The only (very nitpicky!) issue was that the internet wasn't quite up to ""work from home"" standards for a computer programmer - and even with that hard-to-accomplish request Amy did everything she could to help us out. Seriously, this rental is a great choice."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment oozes vintage charm and is fully stocked with modern amenities. Amy is definitely a super host!!!

Amy was truly effective communicating with us throughout the process.
She was very proactive, anticipated our questions, and made sure that our all needs were met.
The apartment is clean, nice, comfortable, and contains pretty much anything that a traveler will need without having to go buy it in a store. We felt very safe in the area and we had a great time at Amy’s place.
She was also flexible with check-out time, which was extremely helpful.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy accommodated us on short notice. We were traveling on business and needed a good central location for driving around NH and MA. The apartment is nicely appointed with little details that were very welcoming. We left something behind that Amy set on to us without a blink, which we were very grateful for. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and as we were only there in the evenings for sleep, the comfort of the beds was supremely important. We would stay here again without hesitation."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,The location is perfect for getting to know Manchester and surroundings: Quiet at night while still close to city center and close to freeway.

Highly recommended."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the absolute perfect space for what my friend and I needed! We are grad students at NHIA and needed somewhere to “call home” for 10 days during our January residency.
Amy’s place offered us each our own bedroom (far enough away from each other for privacy and no disruption), a great common space and kitchen- Perfect for making coffee and tea and munchies when we were back from class.
The bathroom was fully stocked with everything needed which worked well as my friend traveled from around the world to school.
In the cold month of January the space was perfectly toasty.
We already have our eyes set on staying here next January as well! Thanks Amy!!"
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,This apartment had everything you need for a comfortable stay. The host was extremely nice and accommodating. Her communication was the best I have ever experienced. She had water for everyone by the beds which was great in the middle of the night. Everything was perfectly clean and ready. I had a great stay!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at Amy’s went very well. The apartment was exactly as described. The neighborhood was quiet and easily accessible from the highway (I-93). Amy was very friendly and communicative during the entire stay. Also, this may be minor to some, but the check-in process was very easy, and the details were sent to us with ample time. We did not have to wait until the exact minute of check-in to receive details as some hosts are known to do. If we travel to the Manchester area again, we would definitely stay again."

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great space! Amy's apartment was bigger and more charming and well-appointed than expected (the photos don't do it justice, in my opinion). It's in a quiet, residential neighborhood that made it easy to relax after a long day's work--I was there on business. Everything I needed--and more--was available. And Amy was very quick to respond to any questions I had. The self check-in and check-out was extremely easy. There is a flight of stairs to get to the apartment, so that's something to be aware of for anyone with mobility issues, but Amy makes that clear in the apartment description. I highly recommend Amy and her apartment."

There was plenty of street parking, and the neighborhood was quiet. We appreciated Amy’s hospitality and would recommend to everyone!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy's place is really nice! Our family enjoyed it immensely. One thing I greatly appreciated was that the back bedroom is not immediately adjacent to the front bedroom, nor is it adjacent to the living room. That meant I could put my kids to bed and then hang out in the living room and not worry about waking them up."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s apartment was immaculately clean, as well and comfy. The check in process was extremely easy and it felt like you were home! It also was huge!

Adorable coffee and tea station in the kitchen, travel map with pushpins, and soothing, chic decor made this space feel welcoming. Never heard the tent downstairs, but know that the high school (and its marching band) are a building away if you plan to sleep in. Otherwise, location is entirely safe and near TONS of good food and small markets. Highly recommend."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cute and very clean. It was nicely decorated and a great place to stay. It was nice sitting on the balcony porch for a bit when the weather was nice. Amy was so thoughtful, she put extra towels out knowing I had 2 teenage daughters. I look forward to going back in the future."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy's home is absolutely beautiful with great amenities. All I had to do is unpack and relax! This is the perfect home to stay in for several days. The bathroom was my favorite place to relax in a nice hot bath while reading a book or listening to music. The finished touches and bathroom amenities were perfect! The rooms are very large and there was plenty of space for a group. If you get chilly at night, the central heating works great throughout the house. The neighborhood was very quiet and the home was easy to access with parking on the street. There is a large porch in the front of the house with beautiful flowers. If I needed something, Amy responded quickly to my requests. I have no doubt that Amy's home will continue to be a top choice for tourists visiting New Hampshire and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy's apartment was the perfect home base for my recent business trip to Manchester. I was accompanied by my Mother who cared for my 2 yr old son, and the place was ideal for us. It was a 20-25 minute walk downtown for me, and a 5 minute walk to a nice playground for them. The apartment was clean, very comfortable, and every detail was considered by Amy. So much better than staying in a hotel for us but just as luxurious! Thank you Amy!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy’s place is a home away from home. Our little family had a fantastic stay in Manchester, with all comforts of a home.

The apartment was perfectly clean and in a nice & calm neighborhood.

She even stocked the fridge with cream for our coffee and there was a jar of cookies! I highly recommend Anna and her beautiful property!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in an enchanting location, right on the Merrimack River. Morning coffee on the porch, catching the early light on the surface, was a perfect start to the day. Anna is an engaged and responsive host and I would highly recommend her property for a stay of any length. A lot to do in the area, including lots of great alternatives for food, within a very convenient distance (my family kidded that everything was “nine minutes away”). We look forward to our next opportunity to stay here, hopefully in warmer weather, to use the kayaks and outdoor kitchen."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing stay! It was the perfect serene home to return to each night after our work conference.

We are so excited to visit again soon!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna's home is very inviting and cozy in these New England winters. We had a family wedding in this area and stayed at Anna's for a girls retreat, relax,and recoup weekend and were in our glory. The jetted tub is heavenly. Anna's attention to every detail has everything you could possibility need during you stay. Spectacular river views from almost every room make sunrise and sunsets enchanting."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna provided a lovely home. We came to Manchester for work, and could not have found a better place to do so, as well as relax. The view from the main bedroom was fabulous every morning. The fridge nicely stocked with what you would need in the morning, but don't think of ... And there was eggnog!! We so appreciated it :) Best desert ever!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place , great views and great host"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 stars all around I would absolutely stay here again. The home was very comfortable to lounge around and sleep. The kitchen was well stocked with amenities provided from the host. Communication was prompt and reliable. The biggest compliment is hearing my wife and sister in law saying they would return again. We appreciated the great stay thank you for letting us use your home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really wonderful place better than expected
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and to provide supplies for our stay. The home was very comfortable with more amenities and supplies than we have ever had in an airbnb. The setting was lovely and very safe. I would highly recommend both the home and Anna as top notch and memorable! We want to stay there again soon!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"I would like to express my appreciation for Anna's outstanding communication throughout our entire stay. From the moment we started our booking inquiry to the time of our check-out, she consistently demonstrated promptness, clarity, and courtesy in all of her interactions."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna’s home was beautiful with amazing views throughout! It was pristinely clean. Lots of space, inside and out. All the amenities were so appreciated. She was helpful and quick to respond and gave great local restaurant recommendations. We all loved staying here!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna is an amazing host - very responsive to questions and very helpful with recommendations. She and her husband came to the rescue when there was a problem with the TV - fixed quickly! Great host - definitely recommend staying here!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house is located with beautiful river front views. This place has lot to offer when the weather is better during spring and summer . Host Anna was really proactive to provide more details about the house and surroundings. Also wanted to mention this a old house but charming
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The space was lovely and had all the amenities we needed! The windows were beautiful and the temperature control was great for the warmer summer days!

Convenient accessing places as a travel nurse !"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,If it was anything to complain about at Mariana’s was that we wish we could’ve stayed longer. We want to say thank for the beautiful apartment. We felt so safe and the love in the building was wonderful. We appreciate you giving us the opportunity to stay in the Factory well we vacation in New Hampshire. My puppy’s loved it as well. If we had to rated this stay it would be above and beyond the rate. Thank u Marianna. We hope we kept it as clean as it was we got the 😘😎🌼

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second stay at the factory! never disappoints! highly recommended the factory if your visiting the Manchester area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re traveling to Manchester The Factory on Willow is an amazing spot. There are fun things on site-distillery and a great comic book store. It’s near restaurants and SNHU arena. And if you’re traveling with pets it’s ideal. It’s quiet, it’s clean and there’s a great little dog spot."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I love this location. I wish there were year round rentals in this size apartment and set up. super cute.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall a great place to stay at. The check in was very easy and easy to find the room we were staying at. There were a few stains on the sheets of the bed but besides that the room was fairly clean.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great room, nice neighborhood. always would recommend to book here if you are traveling in the Nashua/Manchester area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay. Although small it is great for one person. The communication with the host snd thrir responsiveness was fantastic.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"fantastic stay in this spotless apartment. My pup and I really enjoyed the building and the space. surrounding area isn't fantastic in terms of beautiful surroundings, however, there's a huge green space, and a really clean and beautiful interior and I felt safe at all times, as a single woman. also there's about 10 million things to do and eat nearby - not really walking, but definitely driving and Doordash."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mariana’s place is centrally located to everything you need and was a fine choice for what we needed.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the Factory at Willow Airbnb room. The bed was extremely comfortable!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating & responsive host. Perfect place for a getaway in Manchester. Close distance to downtown! Will be booking again in the future!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for a guy and his dog! (Or couple) Easy access and plenty of space
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice place, definitely will stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nice place, easily accessible to rest of Manchester. Place was clean, quiet, and a nice amount of space."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great weekend in manchester with wife and two dogs while staying at the factory. Check in was smooth and entirely self service. Room was clean and had all the essentials. Some night time noise after quiet hours (10pm-8am), but probably as expected on the weekends. Walkable to downtown area in decent warm weather. Would recommend this place to friends and family."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in this room over Thanksgiving weekend. We had a great time. The accommodations in the room were perfect, and Mariana was delightful to meet and very welcoming."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The studio was great! Everything we hoped for and we would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana’s place was lovely, exactly as described and easy to find, easy to park, etc. We were in Manchester for a concert at the SNHU Arena and we loved the easy walk there and back (wouldn’t want to do it alone at night, though…).
The furnishings are pretty simple, but functional. The kitchen is more for show rather than actual use, but it’ll serve for basic needs.
Would absolutely recommend and stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!
Well-used space, was clean, bed was comfortable and location worked well for us."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Served my purpose. The renovated factory building is really well done. Everything is automated and instructions are clear. Room was stylishly appointed and quiet. Very cool place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very much enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a fantastic stay. We love that we could bring our dogs with us.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my fiancé and I’s first time in Manchester and we had a wonderful time!! The bed was comfortable and the AC blows super cold. You can’t enter the building unless you have a key FOB which made us feel comfortable and safe. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! And also amazing hosts!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This place was everything the was described to us. We were there for baseball, so we have a lot of down time, therefore I wished I had gotten something a little more roomier. But it was very clean and looks just like the picture. It is very safe, can't get anywhere without the fob. Washer and dryers had an app, very convenient. Jamie, bldg manager? was very helpful in guiding us to restaurants and where and where not to walk. Not sure if in description but the frig does not have a freezer, hard to make mix drinks without ice lol. Communication was fabulous with everything."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at The Factory in the outlaw suite. For the most part it was quiet and the space itself was very cool with a lot of character. Definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with industrial vibe. We loved our stay and the peacefulness of the apartment. If you are planning to cook, the bare essentials are available. I will note there are no kitchen knives for cooking, only butter knives provided (due to insurance restrictions per host). We enjoyed our stay and will happily return in the future."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great, safe, secure building. Room was clean. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the lack of bath towels (we had 3 total and our stay was 6 days), and I found the bed and pillows uncomfortable. It would be nice to have more than a few throw pillows and 2 standard size pillows for a king size bed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It looked exactly like the pictures, it was very clean and the building is very safe! (You need a key fob to get around). We were only there for 3 nights but our stay was very comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Maiana was super helpful and great to talk to. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Room was spotless! Easy check-in/ out with very clear instructions from the host. Being able to bring our dog with us was a huge plus and they had bowls available for him. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Hotel at the Factory was great. Our dog loved all the friendly folks who wanted to pet him that we would run into in the hangout area and on the elevator. Lots of good parking. Our only complaint was that the fitted sheet on the bed kept popping off the corners while we slept which was pretty annoying.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is modern, convenient, and comfortable, with tasteful decorations and good amenities."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is adorable and was extremely clean. This building had great security because there are definitely a couple areas very near by in Manchester that are a little concerning. A couple small things to note were the Netflix didn’t work for some reason. The tv kept logging us out when we would start to watch something. We tried to unplug the tv, restart it, and nothing really worked. There was also a dog fiercely barking and howling for several hours in distress upon our arrival in the air bnb next to us. I LOVE animals and I have two dogs myself that I did not bring with me & I think it’s great this place was pet friendly but just something to note. Several hours later I think the owners came back or checked out cause we didn’t hear anything when we came home from dinner. Overall a good stay & it was adorable and very clean. Mariana was responsive about those two issues even though no solution was really offered for them. It was a short two night stay for us. So not a huge deal."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worked out great
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to check in. Safe and secure. Clean and comfortable. Tastefully decorated. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A cozy little place perfect for a dog and his human on a work trip. I was a little disappointed to see that the mini-fridge didn’t have a freezer to keep my frozen foods cold, but that’s my fault. The listing says “mini-fridge”. I assumed it also had a freezer but they don’t all have that. I should have inquired in advance. Minor problem, but just FYI for those of you who might assume the same."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, interesting space with easily managed logistics!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was very pleased with this airbnb and would definitely return. It smelled fresh and clean without being overwhelming on product. Everything clean, nothing dusty or sticky. A little dog hair on the throw blanket at the end of the bed- no big deal. Overall, cleanliness exceeded my expectations for a pet friendly space. Honestly, better than most hotels I’ve visited.
You can hear your neighbors and may get some minimal hallway traffic, but generally, everyone is very quiet! We rested well there. I appreciated that the Factory is so near by restaurants and things but just far enough away to be tranquil. Easy in/out and an elevator if you have mobility challenges. Parking lot may be full at times, but there’s extra spaces on the street.
Marianna’s instructions were friendly, thorough and easy to follow.
I’m greatly appreciative of spaces like this that allow me to bring my elder bunny on trips. Other airbnbs rejected us, even knowing he doesn’t come out of his cage. Thank you so much!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay and great host. Would use again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful mini stay for my graduation and was within walking distance to SNHU Arena. We felt very safe, as everything is well secure inside and outside the building. The loft apartment is very clean and we felt right at home like we could live there! Loved all the amenities and being able to bring one of our dogs was a plus! And did I mention there’s a little dog park for your fur babies, this made our Luna feel right at home <3"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My recent stay was amazing! The historic feel of the building was beautiful and added a unique touch to my stay. The whole apartment was clean and comfortable.
The comic bookstore downstairs was very cool and unique. Overall my girlfriend, our dog and myself had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a memorable stay in the area.
During our stay we saw Rent at the Palace Theatre, very cool and worth checking out if you have the time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, right in the city, close to everything. We’ll equipped and very comfortable!
The vibe is perfection!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This our third visit to The Factory on Willow. It’s always a great spot—the rooms are comfortable, there’s ample parking, and they have a comic book shop now! I highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was such a find! Complete with board games and dog treats in the lobby, friendly neighbors, and a great sushi place down the street. Samson and I had a really nice time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,After issues trying to find a hotel to accommodate me and my husband and our 4 small dogs I turned to airbnb and found this listing. I reached out to inquire as to any pet limits/restrictions and I got an offer to book a stay even though I mentioned 4 dogs and a reply saying simply I hope i get to meet them. The room was exactly as listed and being my first ever airbnb I was able to figure out the checkin process easily. Was excited to learn they are so pet friendly that there's even a mini dog park/walk on property which my dogs absolutely loved. This is definitely going to be a go to when in the area in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,very nice place in a loft like building
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely great
Love the building and the faciltys are fantastic"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great stay. If the location is good for you, then definitely an awesome place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was just as described. Will definitely stay here again on any future trips to Manchester!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time it’s was peaceful loved the gym and arcade
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Goal of my trip was to get to the coast and the mountains and we had half marathon race in Newmarket NH during fall foilage and wasn’t sure if coast would have much so we chose Manchester which was easy access to all and still have safe, fun, and pet friendly environment. Everyone in bldg was super nice and it was quiet which was important to me. we did hear upstairs moving around but the elevators are not near any rooms and walls for side neighbors we couldn’t hear anything. had great restaurants near us and show at the arena that would’ve been fun to attend. had plenty of space and was very cozy and everything we needed for kitchen (just note no freezer). I read past notes to bring hard knife cutting board etc . Shower was fully loaded with shampoo conditioner and soap but you will need to bring hair dryer , bar soap .. maybe a dish towel . I have already told my friends about this awesome refurbished bldg that was industrial /mountain decor (totally my style ) and highly recommend it . I will definitely be back again.
*If it’s more than two people there isn’t anywhere to lounge outside of the bed. Had a two seater breakfast bar that was great for take out dinner that we did . It does have one small chair (I would recommend few more chairs for when people want to have reading or lounging outside of 2 people. But for us and our dog it was perfect)."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying here!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and super comfortable bed. I’d stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. Exactly as pictured. Apartment was very clean, bed very comfortable. Highly recommend"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoy staying at the Factory, Clean,quite,relaxing,comfortable"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean & convenient to everything, love that pets are allowed"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is the best place ever! Clean, modern, well-designed with HIGH ceilings! The high ceilings make all the difference! The internet is stable and fast, the laundry facilities efficient and easy to use. Mariana is such a wonderful host! I cannot imaging anything better at this price level, or even at a higher priced place -- other than probably more bedrooms. For two people traveling with their pets, this place is unbeatable!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This space is great! Cool, minimalist vibe close to downtown. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Overall, the place was big, had a decor that made the unit cozy like home, as well as a great thermostat to have the desired temp an individual would enjoy. The team, was able to make a home away from home, in which is priceless for any guest's short or long-term stay. They genuinely want to make sure you have a terrific stay and will do anything reasonable to ensure it (under the agreement terms). Loved it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An ideal place to stay while in town for work—very convenient and the apartment has everything you need!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we enjoyed staying here with our pup. We were all very comfortable for 3 days! there's a pup bed, available bowls and lots of space!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little find in Manchester. An old factory building has been converted into gorgeous apartments. This studio was perfect for my short return home to visit family. Great amenities, including the pinball machine in the basement!! I would definitely stay here again when I am in town."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous place for our stay visiting family and exploring Southeastern New Hampshire. The Factory is clean, comfortable, and convenient for an extended visit in Manchester and beyond."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is great. As someone who travels a lot with work, sometimes short term and sometimes longer term, this is by far the best facility that i have stayed in. Everything you could need is in the rooms and the building itself is in a central location. Mariana and Carmen work hard to make it a great place to live and it’s evident. They’re very approachable and quick to help to make it a great overall experience."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana and team do a fine job. Some really loud guests a couple nights, but most of my stay was quiet. Good value for the price."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I enjoyed staying here with our rabbit for 10 nights. It’s a great location close to restaurants and stores. It’s spacious, the sink is a little small and we bought a dish rack from the dollar store to dry the dishes. Small fridge, no freezer.
The food trucks were as others have said. You must try the food! It was a quiet building, walls are a little thin and you can hear the next door neighbor. Building security is great with the key fob.
There is a laundry room in the basement that takes quarters or you can use the app. No machine for detergent or dryer sheets. We bought detergent at the grocery store.
Overall we recommend staying at this Airbnb!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sweet room. Very pleasant & quiet. Well looked after! Absolutely wonderful for the price.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay with pets, and there’s plenty to see in the area. Thanks for hosting us"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay here! Was a really cute little apartment and had everything we needed! Had some mild issues with the sheets coming off the bed constantly while we were sleeping, but not a big deal at all and didn't detract at all from our great stay. We were able to enjoy both food trucks while we were there."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really nice boutique hotel type of airbnb. new, clean and more spacious than expected. Kitchen is very small and limited (no sharp knives, cutting board..) so you cannot really cook much, but good enough for quick meals.. Good location with free parking. Nice dog walking area:) We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Factory is wonderfully preserved with original wooden beams and old timey wood stairwells along with all the modern amenities and accessibilities such as elevators. It was fun using the fob key system. The size was perfect for a restful comfy cozy stay and large enough to feel the separate areas: bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and eating nook. The t.v. offerings were plentiful and we enjoyed listening to our favorite songs via the t.v. music apps. Loved it!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a wonderful place to stay! The property has a lot of amenities and is very dog-friendly. Our dog gets a little excited around other dogs but we hardly saw any and had the dog park to ourselves. The coffee cart outside was a really nice touch! We would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! We enjoyed our stay! Super recommended!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marianna and the Factory on South Willow was an unexpected fine. The location was perfect for us. The outside area was well light with lots of parking. There were plenty of green spaces and a dedicated fenced dog park. A gourmet food truck and Vegan pop-up were available next to the building. The apartment residents and hotel quests were all very friendly.
The room was spacious and sunny. The hardwood and tile floors were perfect for our 2 Shar Peis and the kitchenette facilitated their food prep. The heat/ac, instant hot water, and large screen TV with many streaming option added to the experience.
We consider our stay as an excellent value. Our Manchester family and friends are sure to recommend the Factory on Willow!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great central location to all different areas. Extremely clean, comfy and simple. The room was so cozy and clean. 3000% recommend"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,This place is so cute! Check in was easy and the place was extremely clean. Mariana is really quick to respond if you have questions. Centrally located. Close to restaurants and downtown. I would definitely stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana's place is spotless, quiet and convenient to downtown Manchester. It's an easy 20-minute walk to the restaurants and bars on Elm Street. Very easy check-in/out and plenty of parking if you have a car. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The room was spotless. The building has many locks on the doors, which makes me feel safe. Residents that live in the apartments are friendly. The dog park is fantastic for your fur babies. Differently recommend."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Building over all very clean and nice. Room is modern, clean and comfortable.
Location has everything around it you need to be comfortable.
Good value"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Factory is an attractive and newly renovated classic mill. It is spare and modern in keeping with the current style, has simple amenities and apparently a coffee stand and food truck patio is in the works. It's about three blocks from the south end of the bars and restaurants along Elm St. Mariana's communication was great.

I considered giving 4 stars because the Factory is not really ok for an extended stay. There is no freezer in the small fridge unit, no sharp knife nor cutting board, no dish rack and a tiny sink."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and loved everything about Mariana's place. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice stay! I stayed here for a long weekend with my girlfriend and it was comfortable and charming. Would definitely be a great place to bring a furry companion!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The studio was spotless, the bed was super comfy, check in was easy & it’s a good location - close to restaurants & museums -I definitely recommend staying at The Factory."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is super cute and a great getaway if you want to take your furry friend with you!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Convenient location, nice security , laundry & grounds for dogs were good. Place was very clean upon arrival only negative is there was no cleaning service or in unit cleaning supplies available."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The Factory was a great place for us to stay with our pup! Fantastic location in downtown Manchester, close to Boston, So. Maine, and northern NH - perfect when you need to visit friends and family through the area! The building is a completely renovated mill with some nice touches (including an on-site laundry room). The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had what we needed for our time away. We would definitely stay here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The building and setup were beautiful! The staff at the front entrance were very helpful when my check-in instructions hadn’t come through. I felt very safe with the locked doors, so only people with a key fob could enter the building."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very responsive host, could not have asked for a better location for a better price for my wife, myself, and our six month old. Very highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed each moment there. The owners thought of everything down to the smallest detail!! Love it. Thank you. It was a pleasure
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and close to downtown
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for your flexibility and quick communication with checkin. It helped me a lot. Outstanding.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay and we will likely book again! Such a cute loft area and Tyler is very attentive to his guests’ needs and requests. We love the full kitchen and small-town charm of the area; when we don’t cook there are dozens of restaurants in walking distance. Despite being very close to bustling downtown, there is minimal noise and we feel very safe and private each visit. For anyone considering working while visiting: there is also a great island area or desk for meetings with great WiFi. Cannot recommend this for business or leisure high enough!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,we loved this place! so creative and nicely decorated. squeaky clean. comfy beds. nice kitchen. Loved the tea bar :) Thank you!!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute loft right off the Main Street and a few blocks away from the river, would stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. Everything was perfect, the check-in was very easy and the place was very easy to find. Even though it was a block away from the city, it was very quiet and peaceful. There was so much to do. There's a theater down the road where we saw a magic show and the restaurants were fabulous.
The space itself was super clean and very nice. The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable we've ever slept in. We will definitely return for another weekend getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My nephews stayed here for 4 nights while visiting. What a wonderful place - clean, comfortable, fun, and a great location. Tyler was super attentive and easy to communicate with. An easy and very positive experience every step of the way. Very highly recommended."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place and very convenient to restaurants, bars and other city life. Nice living room and kitchen separate from the bedrooms. Very comfortable and clean. Well stocked kitchen made cooking and eating super convenient. Very cool upstairs bedroom loft that my daughter loved. Will definitely reserve again next time in Manchester."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Space was adorable! Comfortable, clean, and well managed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful! It's in a wonderful area, very clean, matches the photos perfectly and stunning.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best air bnbs I’ve ever stayed in. First place where the pictures were accurate it was affordable, couldn’t have been better located. Literally not a single complaint my wife and I were so happy. Will be staying again next time we’re in the area visiting family."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay in this very well equipped airbnb. Close to all amenities on foot. Very clean, host available and very helpful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo ""1840's Gem w/ Modern Lavish Spin"" was great. The place was clean and tidy. The kitchen was clean and spacious and had everything you needed. The TV area's furniture was comfy, and the TV had all the of the streaming-TV services available that you would want. The upstairs loft bedroom was cute and cozy. The bed was awesome. The place is downtown, but parking was conveniently located right across the street. The bathroom was clean and all amenities were provided.
You are able to walk to many sites and restaurants from the property location. The Strange Brew Pub is less than a block away and is great place to hang out and watch live music. Another great place is The Cat Alley and Cat Alley Cafe, which are both about a block away directly east on Dean Ave. Cat Alley has murals of cats by local artists, and Cat Alley Cafe is a cute book store with coffee and muffins. You can go down to the river where there sidewalk and stop in at restaurants and cafes along the way."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute place! We stayed here for a concert on Saturday, which was walking distance to the venue and felt right at home. Place was so easy to get to, clear instructions for entry, great atmosphere, and the bed was even comfortable. Great location as well with restaurants and late night food surrounding. We will return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our stay here! What a lovely little spot, cozy and comfortable, great space for us to each have our own space and also a nice shared living/ kitchen area downstairs. It was very clean, safe, nice touches like tea, coffee and snacks out, and pleasant overall. The communication from Tyler and team was above and beyond! They communicated regularly, answered a question I sent about check-in at 6:30 am in about 5 min (like I said, above and beyond!), and were super helpful. When another guest had taken the parking pass home, Tyler and Lodgism team were communicative and helped figure things out with an easy-going and helpful attitude. Super-host for sure, they should get 6 stars!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Great location. Adorable spot and nice touches. For an elderly person though, probably not a great option of stairs for going up. And would have liked for the spot to have 2 included parking passes. We had two vehicles.. one of us drove up 9 hrs and one flew in and rented a car. The street and location was perfect. Everything was updated and comfy. Very nice place and we enjoyed it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great service and hosts got back to us quickly when we had questions
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place to stay and the location is central to all the night life.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as great as it looked in the photos. Tyler and Team were extremely helpful and communicated very well. Can't wait to go back and stay there again. Definitely recommend this for others, but take note of the loft, as the description mentions, the loft is not for young children or those unable to climb a ladder. But for those who can, awesome loft!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place! Great condition, clean and well stocked. Great location next to restaurants and downtown Manchester. Beds were very comfortable. Worked great for cooking evening meals with our family. Hopefully it’s available next time we’re visiting again."

Any questions at all about the property they were very quick to respond. Super convenient location if you want to grab dinner or drinks walking distance to so many places to try. Will definitely be staying there again in the future!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest loft area that was so peaceful and cozy during our winter stay; also a great location, just one block away from lots of great restaurants!

Combined with convenient location to pleasant walking areas and the hosts quick response to messages made for an amazing vacation. Highly recommend the Lodgism team for a very enjoyable stay.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice studio. No luxury but it is quiet, very clean and the price is right."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite place to stay when I have long shifts at the hospital. Room is very private and the private bathroom its just like staying at a hotel that feels like home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,.wonderful people worked with me and my need to stay an extra day very grateful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we first arrived we were concerned that it would be too noisy for us to sleep because of how close several other houses were to James' house. We live on 80 acres in a rural setting. But other than a short stint of dogs barking, we slept like logs. It seems to be a quiet neighborhood.
The studio was smaller than I expected, but once we got settled, we had enough room for our things and us as long as we kept the dishes washed and the counters neat.
The bed is very comfortable, with a thick pillow-top mattress and a warm duvet.
The room was neat and clean with plenty of shower and bathroom supplies. There are dishes, glasses, coffee mugs, silverware, coffee, tea, electric tea pot, French press, microwave, sink, dish soap, sponge, etc.
Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay.
If you have trouble climbing stairs though, choose somewhere else to stay.
Thanks, James and Shoushan!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Will definitely come back! It was exactly what we needed. James was very helpful!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great studio! And the bed was really comfortable!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, comfortable, clean, easy to find street parking. Easy to get into even though I arrived well past my original time due to flight delays. James was very proactive about sending me check in info beforehand. There were only minor annoyances that did not detract from an otherwise great stay (such as the blinds not going down all the way, or the clock hand falling multiple times all through the day and night). Even with those I rated 5 because I’ve stayed in many Airbnb locations and this was one of the better ones, and enjoyed my quiet and comfortable stay! Bed was phenomenal, and the skylights were a welcome touch."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cozy and private place. Very attentive and responsive host.
I hope is available for my next trip.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, secure, small studio with a kitchenette. Great for solo travelers."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recently stayed at this charming studio for one night, and overall, it was a pleasant experience that matched the homeowner's description.
The studio's heater is a real gem, especially during the winter chill. It keeps you warm and toasty, creating a cozy atmosphere. Parking was a breeze; there's a designated spot on the street, making it convenient for guests.
While the space was generally quiet, there were some noticeable sounds from the clock and pipes. It wasn't a major issue for me, but it's worth mentioning for those who are sensitive to noise.
The studio itself is well-maintained and exactly as described. It's a great spot for single or couple travelers looking for a comfortable place to stay. I appreciated the attention to detail in the amenities provided.
In conclusion, my overall experience was positive, and I would recommend this studio to fellow travelers. The host was responsive and the space had a warm and inviting vibe.
Thanks for a lovely stay!
James Z."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and cozy."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at James's place in Manchester, NH, and my stay was as great as the first. The bed was super comfortable, the apartment was clean and tidy, and the shower head in the shower was great. The kitchenette set up was great for heating up and enjoying a quick meal. Both James and Shushan were responsive and friendly hosts and I had everything I needed. I loved that there was ample street parking, too!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Went to Manchester to see the PBR, found this Air B&B, close to SNHU and surrounding restaurants. James was easy to contact and let us check-in early. Room was cozy, no face cloths but we made due. Nice stay for the night!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing all around! I absolutely loved my stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very responsive and clean, very cute little space :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really cute place. Unfortunately I did not get to stay as long as intended because of a personal emergency.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Jame’s place to have some privacy while we juggled all of our family holiday celebrations and it was perfect! The bed was extremely comfortable (my husband is 6’6 and it can be tough to find a bed he can comfortably sleep in!), the room was clean and the location was very quiet. James was a fantastic host, and was even able to accommodate an early check in. We’ll definitely be booking here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for me and my best friend to stay. We are quiet book people and this was the ideal fit and location. Will book again!

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is very nice, good condition, I would return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio was perfect for our stay in Manchester. It was well taken care of and set up with similar amenities as a hotel. James was very responsive and a great host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James’s place met our needs and we’d certainly stay again if we were back in the Manchester area!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Apartment was as described… James was very accommodating by letting us have an early check in… convenient parking
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Two of us stayed here and it was a base camp for exploring disc golf courses in NH and Massachusetts. One of us slept on an air mattress and I wish there had been more room for that, but that’s my mistake. The pictures and description are pretty clear. It was a clean space, the AC worked well, and street parking was easy."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great private place to stay. Small kitchenette was really convenient. Would recommend it to friends and book it again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"James’s place was clean, comfortable, quiet, and in a convenient location. It was exactly what we needed for our stopover in NH while on the way to Maine. Would definitely recommend and book again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,James place exactly matches his listing. it was clean and comfortable.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very comfortable bed is a huge plus too!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,Nice upper room. Plumbers came in and woke us up at 7 in the morning. Didn’t have a heads up but James resolved the issue satisfactorily. Not a bad place to stay if passing through.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"James was very responsive and patient with us. We were delayed several hours due to a traffic accident. Check in was easy & check out was extended for us bc of our late arrival. James was kind, personable, and understanding. The Spruce Studio was clean & it's perfect for those who just need a place to sleep. We were in town for a family party and needed a place to stay one night. Hotels in the area were way overpriced. James' studio was just what we needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you James for providing such a clean and comfortable place! If we are in Manchester again we know just where to stay. Thank you!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James was so responsive and was great about answering any questions I had. The place looks just like the pictures and is very convienently located.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place! kitchenette was a little bare so bring your own plates/bowls if you need that, but well stocked otherwise and the AC was great."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"James was very accommodating, especially for those with children; our baby slept very comfortably in the pack-n-play that was provided 😊. Will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Host was kind and responsive and answered any questions I had. It was a nice get away for the night and really close to downtown Manchester. I would book with him again! The places was very clean and organized and everyone in the adjacent apartments were quiet and respectful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing place exactly as described a lovely place to stay James was great also!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is really great for a night in Manchester! About 5 min from a really great brewery (To Share brewing Co.) and the Millworks area. Small and cozy, comfortable bed, hassle free checkin and a shower with great pressure! Only gripe is that we weren’t able to get a street parking spot directly in front of the house however there is plenty of parking and the residential neighborhood the unit is in seems quiet and safe so still a 10/10 stay."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Comfortable and just what we needed for a one night stay. Note that the stairway is a bit steep with several steps to get in. James was very responsive to our questions.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Despite some unfavorable rain conditions James was wonderful. He communicated with us about conditions. Place was very clean and comfortable. Some of the surrounding neighborhoods were a little questionable but his place was away from that area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James was always promptly responsive and wants to accommodate his guests!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Will definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"James's place was simple and sweet - just what we needed for a quick one night stay. The room matched the listing and all the necessities were provided. Not everyone has the same preferences for beds but it's helpful to know that this one is very squeaky and bouncy, so it's not the best for couples if one is a light sleeper. Also, the AC is a window unit which makes some pretty wacky noises (as most do), and it's very close to the bed, so be aware of that if you're sensitive to sounds while sleeping. When the unit is off, there is road noise, so you have to choose between the two. Another thing to point out is that this place is indeed very small. If you like to spread out and have some personal space away from your travel partner, this is not the place for you.
Bottom line, if I needed a place to stay for a few days or an extended duration, I personally would seek out a different place than James's. But for a single night, it was just dandy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a nice, clean place, close to the heart of Manchester. I enjoyed my stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean & mellow
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at James' place! We had a rough day of travel and had to book last minute. James was very accommodating and quick to respond.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was as described and was very clean as well as in a quiet neighborhood. I would stay there again.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We chose James’ place because of the proximity to my stepdaughters house, we were there for her baby shower, and her house was one block over. My biggest complaint was the bed. Literally springs popping every time you moved. Very uncomfortable. Also, the bathroom sink is actually a kitchen sink in the bedroom. Definitely not worth the price considering my stepson & his wife rented a very cute cottage with all the amenities for less money just around the corner."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James’s apartment was well kept and perfectly adequate space-wise for 1-2 people. It also had all of the desired amenities to make my stay comfortable. Check-in and check-out were both well documented. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"James’ place had a relaxing vibe. It was comfortable and had everything we needed for a one night stay. James was very responsive, gave clear check in instructions, and gave us a heads up when the room was available earlier than our scheduled check in time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, easy to access, and fairly affordable. The shower had the water pressure that only the Gods experience in the heavens, the bed was pretty comfy, and the amenities were sufficient for a night or two. Manchester is meh, I stayed because I knew someone local."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy studio for one or two people in a residential urban neighborhood with ample street parking. I stayed for three nights and was quite comfortable and relatively quiet. I suggested James provide a few more kitchen utensils beyond plates and silverware (like a sharp knife, can opener, cutting board, bottle opener)."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. Unfortunately, my husband and I had to travel to manchester for a funeral. We decided on this airbnb because the pictures looked welcoming and comfortable. The location ended up being in a super convenient spot. Less than 20 minutes away from the airport and just a few minutes away from my relatives. The space was warm, welcoming, and it felt just like home. James was really sweet and flexible with us when our flight was delayed and we had to check in much later than expected. Overall, I highly recommend staying here.

The space was SUPER CLEAN, and James was flexible with check in due to my need to be at a sound check at a certain time. The space is a great lil place if you need a no frills crash space. The linens on the bed were soft and nice. Mattress was a bit bouncy for my taste, the pillows were super nice and allowed me to just unwind after my show.

There is plenty of parking (you can park on either side of the street in the same direction). The apartment is about a mile from the downtown restaurants, conference center, etc. but is very quiet at night. The water pressure was very good and the apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything I needed. James even went above and beyond in accommodating some of my specific requests. Would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended this place to friends whose parents need a place to stay when they visit Manchester. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a private suite in a typical New Hampshire house. It was cute and good to sleep in. The bed and shower were good. Actually, the bed was great."

The wall clock functions within a different spacetime continuum 😉"
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a good nights rest, this is not the place you want to stay at. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, gave us some back pain. They also didn’t have a lot of parking when we showed up both nights. All of the spots were filled, and had to circle the block a couple of times until someone left."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,nice place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect spot for an overnight in Manchester or a 2-3 day stay if you plan to be out and about (and like your traveling partner). It’s a cozy space but very comfortable and welcoming. And comfortable enough if you’re stuck inside due to inclement weather!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location is close to main highways for easy access to Concord and the outlets in Merrimack. James left great instructions.

I definitely recommend this listing, It was exactly what i was expecting, nice neighborhood, plenty of birds singing in the morning, the water pressure in the shower is a Must..plenty of parking space. thank you James"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Spruce Studio for a couple nights and this was our first air b&b so we didn't know what to expect. But everything went great 5 stars for sure! We loved the secured building. Check in and out went smooth with clear instructions on what to do. The studio was clean, cozy, and tidy. The private bathroom was a plus! The shower was on the smaller side but did us good with great water pressure. The only thing was the dog next door barking every time we walked in or out, but it's not their fault and to be honest it didn't really brother us. The bed was compfy, there are no dressers but the closet was big enough for our bags and clothes. All around a great experience for our very first air b&b!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a rare find! Private studio with all the necessary items for a long term stay (shower with shampoo/body wash, comfortable bed, microwave, fridge, French press coffee + teas, closet with an iron, phone chargers, television with all your standard streaming channels, etc.). I felt right at home, sleeping under beautiful sky lights in the ceiling. James is so accommodating and responds in a timely fashion. He even let me check out a few hours late. I would highly recommend this apartment. I couldn’t ask for me in a spot and had an amazing weekend. Thanks James!!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was a perfect studio for remote work in Manchester.
It had all the comfort and privacy I would have needed for long term living, so it exceeded my expectations when 1 ft of snow dumped on the down...and i was cozy & warm.
It's my benchmark for a future apartment.
Thanks for hosting, and shoveling out my car.
Also, the 20min walk to downtown was easy for a cool night out on a Thursday."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute little attic apartment. has everything one would need. kind of a dingy area but it was quiet and quaint. We did get an email from the host around 1130 to please be quiet during quiet time. we couldn't figure out why this was but nobody bothered us and host was very responsive and accommodating.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome place anx its perfect if u are looking for down time for your self room is upto date and and very clean

There was even decaf coffee available (which in my experience isn’t always the case) available to make w/the French press. James was super accommodating to our needs and communication was great as well. Highly recommend!! (ps. I should also mention that if you’re traveling with a small baby, James has everything you might need!)"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very clean, homey, quiet"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The shower water pressure was the best out of any places we have stayed! The room is small but very clean, cozy and comfortable. We would stay here again if our travels bring us to Manchester again."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You have your own kitchen area with dishes and a microwave. Your own bathroom too. I just wish there was also a sink in the bathroom as well but otherwise an amazing place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. This place is awesome. It's modern, attractive, cozy and very comfortable. James thought of everything someone staying may want. I thought the french press and kettle, plus sugar and creme were just such a thoughtful touch (get that Keurig out of here!!). From the plethora of soap, to the wireless charging lamp/nightstands to the Roku and extra table in the closet...it was like the swiss army knife of Airbnb's, we loved it! We loved everything. The bed sleeps so well and the skylights just make you really feel like you're on vacation. The host gave so much consideration to the details so each guest could have a very comfortable stay. There is even a check in and check out PDF, a host after my own heart. We are totally coming back, even if just to stay in the BnB, it was just that good. Great value too!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was quaint and wonderful, just as described. James is very responsive. The location is quiet, yet very close to the city center and all the distractions one needs. The check-in/out process was easy. It is a wonderful, comfortable space and great for the value."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Leonardo’s place. Very clean and a super spacious bathroom with an amazing shower. I would recommend this place to any single traveler or couple visiting the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Although I was unable to stay here do to a cancellation I have stayed at Leonardo's place before and enjoyed it very much. It's close to everything and although the space is a little smaller it's very private and liked the setup . Private entrance is a pulse ! I definitely do recommend staying here if you are ever in the area
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described and thorough instructions. Very hospitable.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I needed somewhere to stay after flying in to MHT at midnight. It is close and a very simple spot. Very helpful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leonardo's place was perfect for the quick weekend trip I had planned. It was quaint and very clean and organized. I loved the space and the little touches of decor throughout. Leonardo was extremely communicative throughout my entire stay, and accessing the space was quick and easy. An added bonus- the bed was SUPER comfy and the shower was amazing!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Space was clean and convenient. If road noise bothers you, this may be a concern as the space was located in the front of the home along a fairly busy street. That being said, we slept well and space was comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay. Enjoyed exploring the area. House is clean and comfortable. Host is friendly and responsive.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything looks just like the pictures! Very nice, private space. I do agree with the other reviews mentioning you can hear cars passing by on the street, but that did not detract from my experience. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,Good
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great little place! Great host. very clean and comfortable. easy checkin and out
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,check in process was easy. location is in a great neighborhood. The space was pristine with a gorgeous bathroom. highly recommend this spot to anyone coming to Manchester area! Leonardo is a fantastic host!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute cozy place for my wife and I to stay the night for a show downtown. Thanks!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely little getaway
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Leonardo is a great host. My only complaint is that the walls are pretty thin and I could hear the dog barking. Other than that, I had a great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"we had a quick visit, but we really enjoyed this place!! Loved the comfy bed and pillows! The bathroom was so pretty!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Always an excellent experience staying at Leonardo’s. He is a great host and it shows in his property.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Leonardo is an excellent host. The area of the home the room is in is very private with its own bathroom and entrance. Other reviews mentioned the noise from the road, however that was not an issue at all. We never heard anything. Highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a clean and well appointed room. The bathroom is amazing!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything as advertised. Clean and neat house and good location. Would recommend
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Due to unforeseen personal reasons I was unable to stay the night like I had hoped but the stay was nice to just relax and enjoy my evening! When I rescheduled it was very easy as well and had great communication with Leonardo. I did try to reschedule again (just my bad luck I guess) but was unable to, he did an amazing job explaining why he couldn’t which I do not blame him for at all! He did an awesome job knowing my circumstances. I am new to airbnb and this was my first attempt at one, it was a great experience overall!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend and I needed a place to stay in Manchester over night and this place was so cozy and clean. Definitely recommend! Beautiful bedroom & bathroom.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely a unique bnb. Not much room to put things, but very comfortable bed and cozy surroundings. Check out was not flexible. Personally an 11 o clock checkout would have been less stressful , we woke up late at 9 so an hour to get dressed and ready was tight. But overall I would recommend it."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was fine. A few odd things - bedroom light through the fan cord instead of the wall switch, no bedroom table on my side so my phone and glasses were in the floor, bathroom fixtures that were loose or fell off - but generally good for a night’s stay. Nice big shower room. Sounds of traffic, but that’s what you get for an inexpensive rate and good location. I’d return if my other local favorite Airbnb spots were booked."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is perfect for two! The bed is super comfy, the bathroom is so boujee, super cozy overall"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Easy to find and very clean. Plus the hosts are very kind. Would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! The photos accurately represented the space and everything was very clean. The bathroom especially was very nice especially the shower. One thing, but just me! I live in a very quiet place so I wasn't use to the street noise. Leonardo was very responsive and accessing the space was very easy. It was very nice to have a separate space from the rest of the house so I felt very safe."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had to call about the breaker had tripped off at one point. They were very quick to respond and remedy it.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sgueakie clean , nice linens on bed, great shower. we had difficulty operating tv remote, noisey street"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying at Leonardo’s place.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Leonard's place was just as described.
He was clear on check-in and check-out procedures. it is easy to find, easy self-check in and very clean.
Other than being close to the street with a weekday early morning commuter traffic (probably not on weekends) it is a fine stay. Very nice tile spacious shower."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay! :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quiet. I would stay there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I was looking for a comfortable and safe place to go after flying to Boston from California. Leonardo’s place is perfect . It is a luxury hotel room in a house. I brought my favorite coffee kerrig pod after reading that there was a machine available. I was warm and comfortable. The big TV screen was nice for unwinding after my long flight and it is smart to get out of Boston proper to avoid the traffic in the morning. Leonardo even messaged me that I’d left the dome light on in my rental car. Very thoughtful and attentive.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My 2nd stay! Was in town for 4 days of training. Again the place was just right and as advertised. Extremely easy to get around - and to the airport. Had great nights of sleep and hot showers with all the needed amenities. Thank you again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the feel & decor of this Airb BnB, very comfortable bed, large bathroom, shower amazing including a dispenser for shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Easy on site parking. We will book again on a return trip."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy to access. Parking right out front. Clean.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo’s space was clean and quiet. Very nicely decorated, bed was comfortable. Had good communication and was very happy with my one night stay. :)"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The suite is on the front of the house, near a busy road. Noise from the road was noticeable until later in the night. Space is comfortable and spacious and the host was easy to communicate with."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"It’s a decent place to stay for a night. Couple of things to note: 1. Bedroom is extremely small, barely has space to open a Carry-on bag on the floor. 2. Bed and the mattress are very cheap quality. 3. There’s no way to control the room temperature. 4. There’s some noise from the street, which was not a big deal for us. But, rest is fine. Clear instructions to Check in, parking spot, and good bathroom."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cozy little spot was exactly what we needed for a quick overnight stay. The interior was modern, & we loved the bathroom design. Although traffic got a bit loud during departure time, we did not notice it in the evening & nor was it loud during sleep hours. The black out curtains were also a bonus."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Place for a couple of nights stay. Really clean bedroom and bathroom. Big PLUS.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for the price. Leonardo keeps the place nearly spotless and the bed was very comfortable (A rarity!) The only thing is that the hallway when you get in is a bit small. Not too big of an issue for me, but can be for some. Will definitely keep this place in mind next time I visit Manchester."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! It's a private, updated space, and most importantly clean! We'll stay here again if we travel back to the area in the future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,we had a pleasant and easy stay at Leonardo's place. It is tastefully decorated and well appointed. Great bed!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would stay here again. 😊
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Comfortable and serviceable, if small, room for an overnight. Bathroom is huge and quite luxe! Easy in and out."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was in an area I would not have stayed in generally if I knew the area. The host and the property was nice!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to NH for a wedding. This place was perfect! Just what we needed for a short stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pretty incredible Airbnb in the Manchester area. My wife and I stayed one night before we headed north. Very comfortable space with beautiful furnishings, easy check in, and very clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay overnight. Has all the basic necessities you will need for an short term stay. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a last minute trip, and Leonardo‘s accommodations were perfect! I am a light sleeper, and I did not have any issue with noise. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bathroom is amazing.
Leonardo, let me know immediately that there were Internet issues, and the issues were resolved quickly.
I wouldn’t hesitate to come back here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simply said, you’ll be a fool to pay local hotel prices when you have a place like Leonardo’s. Clean, comfortable, and accessible."

2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice Bathroom. Clean with lots of towels. Bedroom small. No place for suitcases. Lots of street noise and aircraft noise. Loud plane taking off at 5:15 am for example. Featured coffee in advertisement, and had tea, creamer and sugar available, but no coffee pods provided. Must bring your own. Also bring soap. Shower dispenser for shower gel was empty on our arrival."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although simply a place to sleep at night, the place is spotless. Impressive bathroom spotless as well. TV selection more than adequate and WiFi worked very well. Parking conveniently located at the door. Quiet neighborhood too."

Good yet simple amenities (some of which I forgot at home - thank you!). Clean spaces, comfortable bed, nicely decorated and “just right” size of rooms. A bonus: The quick commute to the airport avoided major roads and traffic. Thank you Leonardo!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space to come back to after exploring Manchester and surrounding areas! The lights make finding the house and getting inside easy. The hosts are very nice and the place was very clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and Host. Very clean space and nice hot shower. Thanks for hosting!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was beautiful and extremely clean. Leonardo gave very clear instructions on how to get in and I really liked how we could lock the door at night and when we left. Overall a great place to stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and clear instructions!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay overall, only complaint could be that it got a little noisy at night due to road traffic"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leonardo was always in communication with myself. When needing more towels and help with the internet he responded immediately. I would highly recommend this AirBnb. It’s great for an overnight stay or who comes and goes….
Thank you Leonardo!!!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed one night,Good place to stay for 1 night. Listing stated there was a window AC unit but there wasn’t. No way to control temp. No washcloths. Internet wasn’t reliable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Super clean! Layout of the Airbnb is amazing! Will definitely recommend
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place looked great. Wish I couldve stayed.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first AirBNB experience and it absolutely set the bar very high for others we will have. Excellent communication, it looked exactly like the pictures, comfortable bed. We couldn’t have been more pleased. Would definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Will stay there again next time I get to Manchester!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my third time staying here, as previously noted it is clean, comfortable and convenient. I would recommend and stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To make a long story short, Leonardo and his wife were beyond courteous during my stay.
From lending me a charger when I left mine back home to friendly interactions whenever we crossed paths, they are very responsive and incredibly hospitable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect accommodations!!! Would absolutely recommend and would stay again!!!
2023-05-01,3,Stayed about a week,"I want to say that this private suite was super charming, clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and is in a very convenient area. It's only 10 minutes from the Manchester airport and only about an hour away from amazing trip destinations in Maine and Mass. Though, my mom and I did have a few issues during our stay, which is unfortunately why I can't give it a perfect rating. First, this suite is perfect for staying in Manchester for a night or two. My mom and I stayed for a week. During our stay, we ran out of toilet paper, and had to buy our own supplies, like coffee, sugar, cream, paper towels, plates, cups, and spoons, which should be readily available or resupplied. I would have asked the host about it, but I don't think he physically looks after the property or lives there. Also, it's an old house, so the walls are thin. The noise from cars on the street echoed and when it rained, a loud dripping sound made it tough to sleep. Again, it's a great little suite for a couple nights in Man."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I loved the quaint suite I stayed at with my boyfriend this past weekend. It was a bit chilly when we came in, and no way to access temperature, luckily after a few minutes the heat did kick on. Although we were only staying for 20 hours, I would have expected to see a back up roll of toilet paper, but we ran out of the roll we had and had to make do with what we personally had on us. Exactly as beautiful as pictured, very clean and cozy & would definitely recommend for a place to stay while in Manchester. I hope this review is constructive and I really had such simple communications with Leonardo, thanks for welcoming us into your home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we needed was provided, all the essentials. Convenient check in and clean lodging made this space stand out, and it was nice to have quiet hours from 9-9 😊"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and simple. The basics done very well.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay at this location! Thank you Leonardo for your hospitality and we would recommend this location to anyone.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great price on a beautiful space! Perfect for the one night we needed it for. Very clean and cute and homey!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo and Adriana were great hosts. Their communication was clear, professional, and friendly, and they were very responsive if I had any questions.
Twice a year, I drive from Boston and stay overnight in Manchester because I sing in late Saturday holiday Masses at a local cathedral. Leonardo and Adriana were flexible about my return time after the Easter Vigil Mass.
The space had everything I needed for a brief overnight stay: a comfortable bed with a memory foam mattress and soft bed linens, lots of natural light from the windows and solid curtains for privacy, a cute foyer with a stocked coffee bar, fridge, and microwave, and a gorgeous and spacious bathroom with a well-appointed walk-in shower.
The red door and parking space out front made their house easy to find and access. The space is directly connected to the house but completely private. It is the ideal size for a traveler who is looking for a comfortable place to land. I would definitely stay there again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and cute en-suite. Bed is very comfortable. It’s a beautifully done Airbnb! There’s even Yorkshire Tea bags provided! Very surprised 🤩
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo was so friendly and accommodating. This spot is very comfortable, clean, and has what you need for a pleasant stay. Beautiful shower too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,clean and quiet place. Close to malls and Merrimac outlets. The only missing is coffee cup.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay!
2023-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"PROS**
• This place was spotless, very clean and modern.
• The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is large and spacious.
• Though we didn't use the coffee bar, there was one present with to go coffee cups, coffee, tea, etc.
• The host was super accommodating when we requested early checkin due to a family wedding.
• Communication was always prompt with the exception of a little hiccup getting the key code which was resolved.
CONS**
• Busy road so lots of traffic all night - bring ear plugs.
• This space is attached to a main living space (I'm guessing) so conversations can be heard through the wall.
• TV reception and picture isn't the best but not a deal breaker.
• We stayed overnight due to a family wedding so we would've loved to sleep until 9 since checkout was at 10. At 7:45 AM we were awaken by loud male voices talking and laughing followed by power sanding and nails being banged into the wall :{ This is the only reason for the 4 star review."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo’s place is a gem. The place is simply beautiful. It was clean, and had everything a traveler would need. Leonardo is very responsive and his messages had all of the information needed. I highly recommend this place when you’re in Manchester!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Leonardo’s guest house and it was absolutely incredible! The rooms were even better than they appeared in the photos and I instantly felt right at home. The shower was gorgeous!!
It’s so convenient that the parking spot is right in front of the entrance door. It made coming and going a breeze and was especially helpful when bringing in luggage.
The room itself was incredibly quiet and peaceful which made for a great night’s sleep on the comfortable bed. Thank you, Leonardo, for being such a wonderful host and for making my stay so memorable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,So thankful for your quick responses and ease of communication. You were just great. Loved the place and made life easy for us.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, bed was very comfortable. Small space but perfect for a quick stay!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The rooms (a nicely converted porch) were beautiful and well decorated. The shower and bath were great. The bedroom was tiny, with only room for the bed and a thin desk table and two cafeteria style chairs. Nice big TV, fast internet. The bed was a queen sized memory foam mattress. We slept great. The only downside (my own fault for not checking) was the lack of room for comfy chairs for hanging out in. If you need a bed and bathroom and only intend on clocking an hour or two awake, this is your Airbnb. (or you really like TV in bed)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, modern private suite in a great location. Easy self check-in, private entrance and parking right in front. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom is very nice with a great walk-in shower. Host was very responsive. I will definitely book again for future business trips in the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for an SNHU graduation and it was great! Location was near what we needed and it was a safe, quiet area. It was nice to have such a big bathroom and a private parking space. Hosts gave detailed check in and out instructions."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Perfect spot for my wife and I when we needed it. Great value for such a nice little spot!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It’s two rooms; a very neat and monochromatic bedroom and an oversized bathroom with a very cool shower with a bench. It’s NOT big enough for more than two guests or a large dog. The host was great. You can hear through the wall though…
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a cute place! I highly recommend it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovey, clean, convenient stay near the heart of Manchester."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just the right size, easy to find and a good place to spend a night."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"A very cute place, and SUPER close the airport, which is a huge bonus!
* I LOVED the shower, so much. I wish I could've taken it with me.
* The shutter doors in the bathroom didn't stay closed, so I had to drape the blinds over them. Not terribly a fun thought that you have to have a wonky system to prevent people outside seeing you doing a number 2.
* The bed sheets were very, very thin. I didn't get cold, but... if you like thick sheets, these sheets they are not.
* The rooms may be few, but they are all VERY styling and functional. Had few to no problems with them.
I'd recommend this place in a pinch, but not for long and cozy stays."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo’s place was a wonderful spot to call home while I was traveling. I stayed for one night before catching an early flight the following morning.

Check in was a very smooth process and the space had great amenities including coffee/tea, a fridge, a spacious bathroom, and a cozy bedroom with a large tv.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a nice place to stay. It’s small but still a good size and has a work space. The location was nice and quiet. I enjoyed sitting out front in the fall weather. The communication is really quick too.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place to stay!!! I had the front of the house to myself and never even heard anyone else in the house.

Add to all of this that it is extremely clean and you have one of the best!!!

The place was immaculate and we really like the idea of the coffee bar with a small fridge and microwave. The bed is very comfortable, and the added touches of the different cords for your electronic devices was very handy. I would definitely stay there again.
Thanks Leonardo"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"***PLEASE READ***
Leonardo & Adriana's cozy, comfy suite was Absolutely, Spotlessly, Clean and expertly designed, complete with beautiful wood flooring and exquisite architectural crown and floor moldings throughout, as well as neat, convenient touches of built-in outlets/USB ports in the bedroom's desk and nightstand, along with bedroom flat-screen TV and hallway fridge and coffee-maker.
The Ultra-modern! bathroom was equally nice, with its attractive and intricately tiled floor, and oh-so-cool shower (with slate floor and seat) giving it a great, earthy vibe. The comfy bed provided an extremely restful sleep. The private entrance, right-outside-door parking, and the digital lock for easy check-in/check-out, were all sooo convenient. If you stay with them, we know you'll also be saying, ""Leonardo and Adriana, thanks again for a wonderful stay!!"""
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Airbnb was fabulous! Super clean, very nicely decorated— the extra touches like water, charges, and a big TV with Netflix etc were great. Could not recommend more :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is beautifully renovated, clean, and comfy. 10/10!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really liked our stay! It’s very convenient to the airport, local highways for exploring, and in a cute, quiet neighborhood. The parking pad was great for our rental car.
The only hiccup was the bed frame. It’s industrial style, made out of metal and wood, and extends past the mattress on the sides. It has really sharp corners on the footboard. Because it’s a tight space, I kept knocking myself on it to the point that after a 3-night stay I have bruises on my knees."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and simple. Liked the big shower.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great, small place! This was in a location for a trip to Manchester and Portsmouth. It is a small space but it was the perfect size for my Mom and me. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Most cozy place I stayed in 10 years of AirBNB. Such a great vibe!!!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Leonardo’s place was wonderful! It looked exactly like the pictures and the location was perfect.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is as advertised. Loved the small details of the house - from the map in the bedroom to the wall art! The bathroom is beautiful and well lit. The shower and bedroom is also very clean. Communication with the host was fast and check in was simple and easy. Really appreciated the water and Leonardo's suggestions for places to eat in the area. A very nice place if you need somewhere to stay for a night or two, especially after a long day. There is no oven so you can't cook but there is a mini fridge to store your food. Overall, great stay and would highly recommend!"

As you enter the property there are a few steps, the hallways is where you have coffee making facilities, fridge, water etc. to the right is the beautiful bathroom and to the left the bedroom. We only stayed for one night as a stop over and it was wonderful and had everything we needed. If we were in the area again we would definitely consider staying here again. Thank you 😊"
