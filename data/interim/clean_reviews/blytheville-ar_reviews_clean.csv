2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easily accessible from interstate but difficult to locate due to no outside photo of the house on listing and hard to see/read street signs. A wrong turn took us into a very rundown area. The inside of house was immaculately clean, comfortable and well stocked. Beds were very new and excellent. Neighbors started playing very loud music and partying at 3:00 a.m. until sunrise. I learned that I need to read other reviews before I book."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely place to stay. We had everything we needed and were very comfortable! I do agree with other reviewers that the neighborhood is in rough shape, particularly a couple of streets over. We felt safe there but it’s good to know that going in!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, helped with everything we needed. Night or day"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Other than the location, this was great. Host was super responsive and flexible. House was spotless. Bed was extremely comfortable. Loved the couch. We had everything we needed. Price+fees seemed really high to me for the area, but everything around was booked up.
Area seemed like a rough neighborhood, with most houses having bars on windows and doors. Loud music and partying all night along across the street didn’t help us get a lot of sleep."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,fantastic
2023-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"This was a very clean, nicely remodeled house on the inside. Dawn was kind and responsive. The only downside to this place is the location. It is in a bit of a rough looking neighborhood."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, and the cost was less than or comparable to the good hotels in the area. All the hotels were sold out, so im glad I found it.
The host was SUPER responsive. House was still under a little construction, so I'm sure it will look better next time we visit.
Overall, well worth the money and check-in/out was very easy. Place was very clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great communication."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As my first stay in an Air BnB, and co grounds keeper of a traditional BnB, I was beyond please with my visit. even checking during my stay if anything needed attention. if you have the chance, this is an absolute blessing of a stay. Don't hesitate."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's sunroom was so cute, cozy, and spotless. We booked this room when we were in the middle of an 18 hour road trip and plans for a hotel fell through. She was so kind about allowing us to book later in the evening/sam day and provided very specific directions for how to find the house. We did not have any trouble getting here whatsoever. Sara has lots of candy, snacks, and drinks provided in the cabin that make it feel cozy and welcoming. I truly have nothing to complain about with this cabin. If we are ever in this area again, we will be sure to book this sunroom. A million times better, safer, and cleaner than a hotel room."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The sunroom was absolutely wonderful to stay in! The area it's located in is very serene and peaceful. The room itself was very cute and clean. I had to leave my fur babies at home for this trip so it was very comforting to have such friendly dogs to greet us. The best thing about our experience was Sarah. She was very descriptive and informative, she kept in touch, and was so friendly! We definitely will be looking to come back in the future."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and hubby really enjoyed the complimentary snacks! Thank you!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful place, friendly dogs, wonderful host 🙆💯"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Sunporch is the best! This is such a peaceful and relaxing place. Sarah is one of the best host I have ever had. I am going back there for a weekend by myself and I am gonna sit in the swing overlooking the pond and simply relax. Great experience.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place to stay! The sunroom is perfect -- so well thought out and planned. Everything you needed and so many thoughtful touches. Sarah was terrific at answering questions and communication -- all of the instructions were so clear and easy to understand. And we loved the pups! We were welcomed by two of the sweetest dogs in the world; they were also fantastic hosts! We only wish we could have stayed longer so that we could have explored the beautiful surroundings. We felt so at home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah has always been a great host. Our contractor wants to stay at her place every time she is in Paragould. Sarah has always been very flexible and reasonable when we've had a last minute change. Will continue to book her place as long as its available.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay, Sarah is an amazing host. All pups were super sweet and very playful with my pup."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was a great host and communicated throughout the process of staying on the property. The only thing I didn't care for was a lot of traffic coming in and out of the main house on the property, but we did have a great time fishing in the pond, and we can't wait to be able to stay again with Sarah."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The stay was amazing. Our dog played well with the farm dogs. It’s very peaceful.. Couldn’t have had a better host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah was such a lovely host! She was extremely responsive and even put up their precious pups to allow my girls some time to themselves.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: the check in is convenient, the dogs are cute, the outdoor area is nice, it’s clean, and it has all the essentials (plus some treats which is nice). Cons: It was freezing when I came in, to the point I sat in my car for 30 minutes to wait for it to warm up. (The heater does work fine once it’s been turned on for awhile, I ended up cozy). I’m not certain if the value is there considering hotels in the area go for the same price or cheaper. (I don’t intend to be harsh on the hosts, I’m still giving 5 stars. this is just my honest review for fellow travelers)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here - would definitely stay again. Everything was AWESOME. Willie was our favorite - the sweetest boy! Thank you for sharing your place with us.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If there was a rank above Superhost, this family would have it. They checked on us several times in our stay and even bought our supper one night. They went out of their way to make us feel at home and we did! We will definitely find a reason to come to the Sun Room again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute and clean place. The dogs were sweet and adorable. I saw 2 shooting stars sitting by the pond at night, so I loved that."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place! Very clean and private. The bed was extremely comfortable. Very well put together and thought out. Will definitely stay again! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved The Sunroom ! The bed linens were so comfortable and cozy that it was hard to get out of bed this morning! The snacks and beverages are a nice touch. Sarah was very responsive, and we greatly appreciate the pet friendly accommodations. The yard was immaculate, and her pack absolutely adorable! Willie made sure we were welcomed and kept near me when I was walking my dogs late last night. We will definitely book again when in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying there loved it
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the sunroom exceeded my expectations. Super clean. super friendly hosts and super friendly dogs to play with my husky. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another place booked and upon arrival it was infested with wasps. We had to quickly find another place to stay and this was it. They were fantastic being available on such short notice and super responsive and helpful. The dogs on the property are super friendly and really make you feel at home!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place for us and our spoiled pup and this was a great place. The Sun Room was everything we needed. We arrived after ark and Sarah made sure all the lights were on outside so we could find our way.
Everything we needed was inside, including snacks for us and our pup.
If anyone needs a great place to stay in Paragould or in the Jonesboro area, this is the place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best place on our trip from Orlando, Alanta and here. Beautiful and relaxing room!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah’s place was just as pictured. It was a perfect private guest suite with all the things you would expect. It was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfy. We would definitely stay here again as a stopover on our return to Texas.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the ,""Sunroom"" 2 nights with my special needs daughter. We were all very comfy. My daughter loved petting the super friendly dogs, Sarah even had some treats to give them and my daughter loved it. We fed the fish at her peaceful pond. Bed super comfy and super clean.
Thanks Sarah,
Jean M."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah offered a great Airbnb! We were not disturbed once, and it was like out own tiny home. Overall, the Airbnb was very cute and comfortable. The dogs were the sweetest and so lovable. This was an amazing stay, and Paragould is great for a nice weekend get-away.
Ps. The local Checkers has the best milkshakes and fries for a midnight snack!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was very responsive, considering we made a last-minute reservation due to issues with another Airbnb host. The room was very clean and stocked with lots of candy and soda and water. The home is a little out-of-the-way, so it wasn’t super convenient to get to, but we found it just fine. The host has two very friendly dogs that stay outside and during the night they woke us up a few times barking which meant we didn’t get as much sleep as we were hoping for. Also, there are two large windows in the room that don’t have any shades, which meant we couldn’t sleep in because it got so bright in the room. Other than that, everything was fine. The host was very friendly and responsive. I think it would be great for someone who isn’t a light sleeper like myself."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very good place and hosts
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah’s place was easy to get into, I didn’t have any issues finding the house. Inside was clean and had everything I needed for my 1 night stay. I appreciate that her place is pet friendly. Her dogs were adorable and came over to say hi, just beware of this if your pet doesn’t like to be approached by other animals."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was exactly how described. nice and clean lots of privacy, very roomy while feeling cozy. the great Pyrenees dog is so nice and beautiful."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The directions were unclear for me. I know you can’t pick your neighbors, but the road in had lots of rough looking, junky homes. It was hard to believe such a lovely little place like Sarah’s was close to these homes. Her place was immaculate; so clean and smelled lovely.
The pond and patio were fun to spend time on. We saw rabbits, frogs, the catfish feeding routine and enjoyed petting their great perinese dogs.
When Sarah learned that we had some special needs for the visit, she was instant in beginning preparations to accommodate us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at The Sunroom was great! It was very clean and was exactly as described. The snacks, drinks, and coffee provided were very appreciated. They even went above and beyond to accommodate our late check out time. Will definitely stay again if we’re in the area!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was very friendly and quick to respond. The morning we left for our trip she made sure to send driving directions, helpful tips, how to flawlessly use the keypad to help ourselves into the sunroom, and what to expect when arriving. The place is nicely decorated, and cute. She made sure everything we may need was stocked and in good taste. Beautiful country scenery. The fur babies were an added addition, however, very very well mannered! There were treats left so that if we wanted to make friends with the pups, we could. Again, they were very mannered. Check out was super easy, just a quick message to let her know we’ve gone. We hope to revisit this place and enjoy the amities we weren’t able to during our stay due to the weather."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfortable home! They thought of everything!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place !
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunroom is great; exactly what I was looking for. It's somewhat secluded and very peaceful. It's exactly as described and very clean. I especially enjoyed the deep soaker tub (something hotels rarely have) for easing aching muscles. The patio is really nice, and if you want a small fire just walk across the road and use the fire pit/ring next to the pond. I didn't think about it at the time, but I suppose you could build a small fire and roast a few hotdogs and/or marshmallows. The pond is full of catfish and you can feed them or try to catch some from the dock with the included fishing gear (I preferred to just feed them). The Sunroom is just a few minutes from visiting friends/family, shopping, dining, entertainment and Reynold's Park (I think that's still the name) which can be accessed by at least two directions (I used both). Overall, a very pleasant experience and one I recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the sheets! I came after dark, so was a little tricky for me to find, because my eyes don’t do great in the dark. Thank goodness for her directions in addition to the GPS. Her directions were spot on! The place was roomy, clean, and the dogs friendly and made me feel safe coming in at dark."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of my favorite places i've ever stayed! the host is such a wonderful person to communicate with, very fast responses, very sweet. We booked this place super last minute due to storms and she was so understanding! The house is so comfortable and clean. The property is beautiful, The dogs were adorable and so sweet, and i really am looking forward to the day i can come back here!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah went above and beyond for my parents during their anniversary stay. She made them feel welcome and part of the family. She helped them find all the things to do in town. My parents couldn't say enough about how amazing she is!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an off the beaten path (literally, as there is a gravel and dirt road you take to get there) place. It is very cozy and clean. As noted, there are unleashed dogs around, so be sure that works for you and your pets."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here! It was so nice and peaceful. Derrick even brought us over a fishing rod so we could fish at their stocked pond. Great hosts and cute dogs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute studio about 4 miles from downtown. The place was clean and the dogs were sweet. It's on a gravel road that is nice for a morning stroll (take dog treats for the friends you'll meet on the way).
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a beautiful place, comfy bed. The only disadvantage was that the Wi-Fi didn’t work and I had no service at all, but that wasn’t a big deal to me at all. It was such a nice and quiet little area.We loved getting to pet the fur babies and my nephew loved the pond and getting to catch toads."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time here, would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was perfect for our needs while visiting family in the area. The bed was comfortable, always important!! Loved the snacks she left for us (we ate ALL the kisses 😬), and she and her husband, Derrick, were so friendly and quick to respond to anything we needed. Loved the intro photos of the dogs..:when we finally met them, we felt like we were meeting celebrities! Although big, they were very friendly to both the humans and the canine in our party. The setting out in the country was very peaceful. Hopefully we’ll be able to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host is friendly, and there are a lot of snacks."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick overnight stay at The Sunroom on our way to Texas. It was just right for our needs and was in a lovely, peaceful location. Sarah was a most helpful and attentive host. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A true example of excellent hospitality. The room is beautiful, very clean, quiet, spacious, nicely designed, bed and pillows are comfortable. Really great place to stay. Serene and peaceful surroundings. Bathroom is very good, super clean, equipments work great & there are all necessary toiletries of perfect quality. Snacks, sodas chocolates, water were also provided. Wifi is also available. Sarah is a good host, professional and very helpful. I love the dogs, they are very friendly and welcoming. Pure good souls that love people. I highly recommend Sarah's place if you are in the area. Will definitely come back again. Home away from home. ❤"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Sarah for the amazing stay at “The Sunroom”. The place was SUPER clean, smelled amazing and very peaceful! Sarah was very responsive, helpful and friendly! The dogs on the property were very sweet and the amenities were great too! My son loved the provided snacks! I would definitely recommend staying here and we would definitely come back!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this place! Very thoughtfully designed and finished. Everything is provided, including snacks. Super clean. There were fireflies everywhere at night and nocturnal birds singing. Its a short drive off the freeway but so worth it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunroom is a gem in Paragould located on the route we travel from Kentucky to Texas. It is maybe two miles from the main drag and easy to find. Just my wife and myself were in our party. The Sunroom is not huge but plenty of space for two people that like each other or a couple with one or two children. Spotless, squeaky clean with all amenities and plenty of extras (Keurig coffee maker, soft drinks in the fridge, breakfast food, and a truck full of sweets). Extremely well constructed with a well thought out floor plan, efficient use of space, and a very interesting and tasteful decor. PEACEFUL AND QUIET which is what we were looking for after a long drive from Houston. Clear, timely and friendly communication from Sarah. Everything top notch. Would stay again in a heartbeat if available on our next trip.
Thanks for a great stay. We truly appreciate the effort.
Jim and Betsy"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The dogs were wonderful!! We had a great time fishing in the pond!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was perfect, for our weekend get-away. The space was very peaceful and very clean. Enough linen for all 3 of us. The dogs were just as peaceful as the description said they were. Always a nice presence in such a relaxing serene area. Thru messaging, Sarah was a very present hostess, most mannerly and welcoming. My husband also loved the fishing pond. He caught (and released) fish and he loved that they gave him some fight. Definitely recommend staying here. My husband is already wanting to go back! Stay, Sarah does leave the light on for you!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunroom was excellent! It was very peaceful, very remote, and very relaxing! Sarah was an excellent host! She was very helpful with any questions I had, and had a super quick response time! I can not express enough how welcoming Sarah was! We walked around the pond, sipped on the DELICIOUS complimentary coffee and watched the fish. We sat on the swing and enjoyed the beautiful, peaceful atmosphere.
I can not wait to tell my friends and family about this beautiful location!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a beautiful, quiet little getaway out in the country. It is dog friendly and the hosts' dogs are super friendly and love to approach pets. The hosts are friendly and easy to get in touch with if I had any questions. The place was easy to find. Everything in town is nearby and easy to find and I would definitely come back and stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was beautiful and secluded. Sweet dog’s beautiful stay. Didn’t realize it was a duplex But didn’t feel disturbed by anyone there reminds me of a tiny home! Loved it it was so cute and the interior design as cute. Wouldn’t recommend bringing frozen food it’s got a compartment abt big enough for an ice tray but not for frozen food. Host were very friendly and helpful. My large dog love all the land and my small one loved to bask in the sun 10/10 would recommend for couples who appreciate peace and quiet and nature. Only abt 10 mins from a gas station and Walmart along with some other restaurants.lovely place !

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's place was lovely and Sarah was so wonderful and helpful! I booked the place last minute but she had everything ready when I arrived late at night with my dog. She had turned the air on in the cabin, turned on lights AND left me candles and a lighter in case the power went out (heavy storms were rolling in). I found Sarah very responsive and friendly and the place is beautiful! The dogs greeted us and were friendly and the pond and nature was beautiful"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had sure a great time. Beautiful stop on our road trip. Would stay her again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here while passing through the area. Wished we could have stayed longer. It is a very clean, well kept place. It was a great little find and the owners were very friendly and helpful. It is close to town if you desire. There is also a great pond out front stocked with fish and fishing rods and a big bench to enjoy the view or enjoy from your front patio. Would definitely choose this place again if ever in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place. It's quiet, private. Very clean and organized. Sarah is kind and thoughtful. She let me know that severe weather was expected on my travel day so I could plan accordingly. She even texted to check on me after I arrived that night during the storms. Check in and check out were super easy. I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome. We love the place and the amenities. I will definitely let others know about this place.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying at this Airbnb and was again a great experience.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I can truly say we haven’t had a bad experience with any of our bookings in the past, but Sarah’s little place was over the top. Everything from the place looking like you could eat off the floor down to even the smallest little details like drinks candies you name it. That wasn’t all tho it was really like wow someone these days even makes sure the candy is exactly where it needs to be. I would go back any-day and most certainly would recommend her place for a stay or 5. Thank you Sarah hope to see you guys again soon.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet place away from the hustle and bustle of life, you could not ask for a better place, and yet close enough to town that you can easily access anything you want within 10 minutes!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Looking for a quiet place in the country, this place is a hidden gem!
The accommodations are fantastic and the attention to detail amazing. From snacks, drinks, to breakfast and coffee Sarah thought of everything!

We only wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah's place was a perfect stop for a night along our road trip. It's location was safe & the sunrise was gorgeous. Her dogs are cute & friendly, giving some much needed cheer after a long drive!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a quiet country getaway but full of amenities than this is the place. The studio sunroom is beautifully decorated, very clean, and modern with country appeal.
Beautiful porch to enjoythe pond, dogs, birds, and nature. It was a relaxing place to stay while I was away from home for work and was MUCH better than any hotel. The dogs were so sweet and well mannered. I would recommend this quaint getaway for anyone looking to be out of town but just close enough."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay nice and clean and very peaceful

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Beautiful property and very clean. The dogs were super adorable and friendly! Would definitely stay again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A place that will make you feel right at home. A beautiful property. My dogs loved it !
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice Airbnb with everything you’ll need in a nice countryside area. Though it is an one bedroom suite it’s attached to their house, yard is still shared as well as, privacy."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay and wake up to morning sunshine. was also great getting greeted by some nice dogs and having treats provide to give to them.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's home was better than we could have imagined. The space was very clean and more than enough room for a couple with 2 dogs. The bathroom and kitchen were stocked with items that we found to be a nice touch to the place. Even the doggos had a treat! The yard was more than large enough for our pups to run around in and they even played with Sarah's dogs (who were extremely friendly to both dogs and humans). Overall, we loved our stay and would recommend Sarah's to anyone!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This kind of place is the reason I like to stay at airbnbs and not cookie cutter hotels. This is a private unit attached to Sarah and Derrick's home. They were very helpful and kind (even when I accidentally parked on their lawn!) The unit was very clean, stocked with snacks and spacious. But the best part of this stay is the sweet, friendly dogs hanging out on the property. The dogs were eager for pets and head scratches but also veryyy chill with me and my dog. I'd definitely stay here again as a pit stop on my road trip home."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s a beautiful room with beautiful scenery outside.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute space! The dogs were so friendly and cute. The place was very clean and the snacks/water bottles to have when we got in late from driving were so nice! We stayed one night to break up our long drive and it was a great spot!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable bed, nice coffee for keurig , and very clean."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great space. Peaceful and quiet. Great bed. Great snacks. Friendly hosts!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Expect to see a cozy spot in a somewhat rural area. The family-oriented location is surrounded by woods with a small lake. Large doggies reside here but get along with another well mannered pup. The room is clean and accommodating; perfect for a quick stay.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute and unique little place. Sarah is a great host. The other family members we met were very friendly and welcoming. The dogs added a great touch and helped me feel right at home. The area from the driveway to the door of the room is very user friendly, all concrete, flat and no steps."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was perfect! I have been to a lot of airbnbs, but Sarah has been the most hospitable host I’ve had! Her and her husband really made sure we had what we needed and enjoyed our stay. We definitely overpacked because their airbnb had pretty much all we needed! They even had dog treats and offered to get us things for the holiday. (: It was the cozy, secluded, and relaxing getaway we were looking for to spend the holiday. The cutest little airbnb ever! Loved every minute of it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The sunroom is a beautiful space, lots of windows and lots of sunlight to enjoy while relaxing in the spacious room. This is a repeat spot for Airbnb-ers."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunroom is really comfortable room in a quiet setting. Sarah and Derrick were both really great and super responsive to emails and questions.
The shower was hot with good water pressure, the wifi was fast and reliable. The furnishings were comfortable.
The snacks were a nice treat and the Kuerig was great with lots of coffee options.
There is not a way to cook so plan accordingly. There is a microwave and mini fridge which worked well for our needs."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING!
Sara went way up and beyond her ""call of duty"" as a host! The ""Sunshine"" room was beautiful. Such a peaceful place!
Loved having Willie (their oldest dog) greet us when we first arrived. 🤗 I will
DEFINITELY stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and very welcoming.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was greeted by big Willie at the drive way and was the start of a great stay. Was a perfect spot to stop on our long road trip with our dog.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place very nice. There was a pond across the way that you can sit at there was very beautiful. The house are very accommodating and they help give me kits to do around town. Will definitely go back.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immaculately clean, modern guest unit. This is an efficiency style guest house attached to the hosts' home, in a serene setting with a view of a pond. The owners have 4 friendly dogs. It was hard to find in the dark, but the hosts went out of their way to guide us there. Sarah also put out extra effort to give us recommendations for restaurants in Jonesboro."
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Several aspects of this rental didn’t meet expectations, and I offer the following comments in a constructive spirit in hopes that conditions improve as a result. I would have expressed them directly to Sarah, but she was out of town. (In fact, I saw no one at all on the premises for the entirety of my stay.) First off, the positives: The remote setting is peaceful and quiet; even the very inquisitive, super affectionate resident dogs were –thankfully– “bark free”. The compact rental unit was tidy (with the exception of the toilet bowl, which was streaked and obviously had not been cleaned, and a bucket littered with cigarette butts between the two patio chairs on the small outdoor seating area next to the front door). The Keurig capsule coffee machine was in fine working order, but most other aspects of the kitchenette were sadly deficient. Here is an inventory: There was no flatware or eating implements save for a small wicker basket with plastic forks and spoons – no knife of any sort. The drawer labeled “Utensils” contained only scissors and one plastic spoon. No bottle opener or corkscrew. No bowls at all, no plates except for small and flimsy paper plates and a few larger plastic ones that warped and cracked when heating up take-out food in the microwave. For drinking, there was a solitary tall water glass (but four coffee mugs). Some of the missing elements were puzzling: Breakfast cereal and milk were provided, but there were no bowls. Is the guest supposed to use a coffee mug and a plastic spoon to eat the cereal? The small kitchen sink did have dish soap, but no sponge or dish towel. In other respects, there were no hooks to hang clothing or wet items (rather awkward given the heavy rains on both days of my stay), although the unit was adorned with several Christian crosses inscribed with Bible verses. The only potential clothes storage options were a heavy metal bar with one hanger perched precariously under the AC unit and directly above the bed; there was a bureau at the foot of the bed, but the top three drawers were stuffed with extra bedding. As to the bed itself, the mattress was adequate, but the all-polyester sheets were uncomfortable, and the bottom sheet was riddled with pilling. Finally, the Wi-Fi signal was weak (the router must have been in the main house next door): It worked, albeit quite slowly, on my iPad, but not at all on my PC laptop. If Sarah opts to resolve these issues, The Sunroom would be a much more satisfying retreat space."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These are the types of hosts that think of everything. Space was clean and check-in, etc were super low key. Would stay again if we were in the area!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was out third visit to Sarah’s Sunflower Studio. It was very clean again and everything was in good working order.
How nice when you come in on a hot day to a cool room and a cold drink."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cannot express how great this place is!! cutest little suite with everything you would need and the property is so fun complete with a pond of fish and farm doggos!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The “Sunroom” was perfect for a weekend trip! Sarah was very quick on responding to my questions. The dogs are super sweet especially Willie and the sweet puppy Annie. We will be booking another stay again!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"absolutely ADORABLE property! so sweet and homey with everything you could need and more. the dog welcome squad is an added bonus, and the views at the pond are lovely! excited to stay again soon!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very awesome! Perfect hosts!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Sunroom!! Everything you see in the pictures and write-up are true and even better in person. We will certainly stay there again if we return to Paragould for events we heard about this trip. Sarah was always checking on us by messaging to see if we needed anything. Such a peaceful setting that I think we need to return with no events to attend so we can just enjoy the peace & quiet & the birds & wildlife.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a clean and comfortable space. We were greeted by sweet furry pals and had a great rest before our drive. Sarah was thoughtful, had many details in mind and available when ever we needed something. Would love to visit again:)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time we stayed here, great place away from the hustle and bustle. Keep up the good work!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Sunroom was the perfect stay after a long day of driving. Incredibly clean and decorated to perfection. Sarah was an excellent host and very communicative.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly host, nice get away while traveling. Recommend this nice little place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Cozy and sweet. The people were kind in the moments we talked to them, but for the most part they gave us our space. We caught some awesome fish in their stocked pond. Their dogs were sweet and didn’t bother us at all."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute little place, just out of the way enough to be quiet and close enough to be convinient. (And there is cereal!) Take some time to feed the fish!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, quiet, & comfortable. Our second visit was just as good as the first."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and good communication
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet country setting with relaxing tree swing and pond to enjoy. Deer right outside. Friendly horses and dogs.
Paragould has plenty of places to eat and see. We were down for a quick overnight stay with business in Jonesboro."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, spacey quiet place with lots of privacy. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful area of the country. Sarah and her family are very warm and welcoming and made us feel like family. My wife, 10 year old son, and I had a great time and we all caught a lot of fish in the fantastic pond. The place is private, comfortable, and extremely clean. Great front patio as well. Will definitely stay here again and recommend enthusiastically."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely place this is! This studio was just what I needed after a long day of driving. It is super clean and the AC works very well. There is a place to park right next to the door and the dogs are very friendly (Hi Willie!). And it is very quiet and serene. I wish I had been able to stay longer. I look forward to coming back.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love coming to stay at Sarah's Place! This is our third trip. The accommodations are quiet and comfortable, and we sleep SO well in the absolute peace. Our old dog (16.5 y/o) loves to roam around the yard and play with Willie, the canine Airbnb host. Our gracious (human) hosts also gave us apples to feed the horses and there is food to feed the fish in the pond. Paragould is a neat town with lots to offer and we are so glad we found this location. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or looking for some peace, quiet, and calm, you will feel right at home here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a pleasant stay at the sunroom. Our booking was very last minute but the hosts were very accommodating and provided a truly pet friendly experience. We were greeted by Willie, the family’s Great Pyrenees who was gentle and calm the entire time. The pond is lovely and we enjoyed feeding the horses. The space was very clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah is an excellent host! She is communicative, thoughtful, adaptive, and offers everything a person could need. She was particularly helpful on our last trip as I broke 3 bones in my foot the day before we were due to arrive. She helped me navigate through a cancellation and rebooking excellently. And I'm also happy to say her location is very handicap accessible! Paragould is a delightful town with lots of food options. Our dogs felt welcome and pampered and we were even given apples to feed the horses on-site. If you are in the area, you couldn't do better than with Sarah."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a slice of heaven for sure! So easy to find, and near everything you need. It is tucked away enough to be removed and peaceful, but near attractions and stores. If you like animals, nature, and clean modern styling, this is the place for you. Sarah was around with a warm smile for anything we needed, but provided us plenty of privacy and space. They even gave us apples to feed the horses; it really made the trip for me. My son caught a catfish from the pond on his first cast with the extra bait they provided. I am sure we will all have fond memories for all our lifetimes. Thank you so much!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay only minutes outside of town. I was exhausted at the end of a long day working and was completely able to relax while sitting on the front patio, looking out over the pond and listening to whippoorwills. The tranquility and quietness was a welcomed relief from a hectic day."

Plenty of space for our dogs to roam/be walked safely. An outside sitting area, fridge, microwave and kitchen amenities. A quick 12 minute drive to town. I couldn't ask for anything more and plan to stay again as we return home from our journey. The host(s) was quick to respond to all my inquiries and was a pleasure to meet. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or just want a quiet get-away, this is your place."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah was on it with communication! We came in at 1am after driving all evening with our 4 yr old and 14 week old pup, Thor(soon to be service pup!) to a WELL lit up outside and the lights on inside! It smelled nice, it’s newly renovated, clean, simple but all the necessities! Bed was comfy and it was quiet.
After a walk around the pond we met some of the family pups and they were all well behaved, friendly and wanted belly rubs! Thor got to make some friends before we got back on the road!
Finding these little gems have made our road trips even better!
*Next time we know to bring our poles for the stocked pond!"

Bonus points for us was that papa johns delivers to the guest house. After driving all day it was nice to not have to do anything extra for food. The guest house itself was very cozy and the windows provide lots of natural light (my favorite). The kitchenette was stocked with snacks and lots of drinks and coffee options. The bathroom was also stocked with essentials and the water was nice and hot! The hosts were so nice and love dogs! They were very kind to my poodle. They are also very responsive to messages! Wish I could have stayed longer.

The front porch was where we spent a lot of our time enjoying the privacy & beauty of land. There’s an amazing porch swing & 2 TVs to enjoy while relaxing out front as well. The outdoor area is a beautiful park like setting & very well maintained. There’s a private stocked pond available for fishing which our family thoroughly enjoyed during our stay. The pictures online do not compare to seeing it in person. Home sits just behind a well maintained ranch which had miniature horses & other animals. During fishing we were greeted by them & had so much fun interacting with them. This home is absolutely amazing & so tastefully decorated for a true county cabin theme. Extremely clean & wonderful amenities inside. The huge open area shower was so relaxing & the smart toilet was an added bonus! PERFECT!! We will definitely be returning & highly recommend!!

Deanna was awesome. She and Frankie were so personable, yet not intrusive. There's a reason she's a SuperHost.The farm fresh eggs in the fridge were a nice touch.
On the wedding day, we were gone around 10 hours and they made sure our little Molly (Malti-poo) was taken out for a walk several times, and loved on her, which she loves. We don't use Air BNB's often in this area, but we will probably come back, just to spend more time on the property, resting and enjoying the scenery. And, next time, I'm bringing my fishing tackle!!!"

Farm fresh eggs were a plus and we had a good morning greeting from their beautiful husky who was taking a morning stroll. We had a 12 yo with us, so felt uncomfortable staying right in the heart of Memphis, but a quick 40 minute drive from the air bnb to Memphis made for a perfect location. The host reached out before we got there asking if we would like them to set up the blow up mattress for our third guest and they had the mattress made and neat for us. Bottled waters in the fridge were also awesome. They have board games and the bed was very comfortable. Can’t say enough positive things about this stay. Will 100% be back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time! Beautiful place and wonderful host.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Truly felt right at home! Such a beautiful and peaceful property. Thank you so much for having us. We can’t wait to come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely place in a really nice neighborhood. Lots of open land, trees, everything we needed was there."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful ""cottage""! Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. And the only negative is now my wife wants me to redo our house to look just like Jo's Country Cottage! :-). It was a truly comfortable and inviting stay. We loved walking our furbaby down the driveway and seeing the chicken's so very interested in us (I think we must have been coming near feeding time for them :-) ). I also loved listening to the birds and enjoying the fresh air on the screened porch area. Deanna was so accommodating and flexible as our travel plans had to change slightly. It was a wonderful place to stay, and we highly recommend it!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deanna was a wonderful and helpful host, and she was excellent at communicating about our stay. She and her family were hospitable, left a helpful binder for any information needed, and even left fresh chicken eggs for us. It is clear that they are very thoughtful hosts! The Country Cottage is such a lovely, peaceful place, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place for vacation or even a weekend getaway!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love it! It was clean and absolutely beautiful! Deanna is amazing, she even left fresh eggs for us. Thank you for everything!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Driving cross country and stopped at Jo’s Cottage for the night to rest. It was so clean and beautiful. Had all the amenities we could have asked for and on such a beautiful property. Our pup loved sniffing around the pond and saying hello to the chickens. Felt so private but Deanna was such a friendly host via messages. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfy and cozy weekend outside the city. Very private and peaceful place with great hosts who were so friendly. My pup loved exploring the area and we both enjoyed seeing the chickens. We hope to stay again soon!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful stay at Jo's Cottage! Deanna was very helpful and we loved the farm fresh eggs every morning. The space was perfect for our pups and I would definitely recommend this beautiful location for a peaceful stay. Thank you for your hospitality, Deanna!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed Jo's Cottage very much . It was very peaceful and well-appointed. The book she left for info was very thorough. She communicated very well to us about everything. Experience peacefull walks down a country road, rooster crowing in the distance, farm fresh eggs, incredable sunrise and sunsets, the quiet, and abundant varied bird sightings."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I travel a lot and frequently stay at ab&b’s. This was my favorite place to stay. Deanna was so attentive. This place was perfect for me and my needs. I felt safe and at peace while at Jo’s cottage. It was spotless and beautiful. I will definitely stay here again!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay loved the surroundings and the host was so polite everything as promised.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Jo’s cottage so much! Everything was clean and the location is great! We especially enjoyed our farm fresh eggs!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Never met them in person because got in late and left early, but nice over emails & texting. Very nice place ... kind of an in-law apartment off the main house with easy access and good view of yard and chickens."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful place to stay in Tennessee. I only wish I could spend more time. Deanna and Frank are so friendly and wonderful. The space is gorgeous and welcoming. The bed was so amazingly comfortable and everything I could possibly need was in the house. Our little family was so comfortable and I will be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We so enjoyed our stay, location was perfect for visiting family in Stanton & Bartlett.
Everything was as advertised, anything we needed was there, plus farm fresh eggs in fridge when we arrived. The cottage was also beautifully decorated for Christmas.
Such a relaxing, pleasant get-away.
Thanks again, Deanna!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jo's Country Cottage is the PERFECT place to stay if you are looking for a beautiful and peaceful place right outside of Memphis. Deanna, our host, was so very kind and hospitable and we felt right at home. There were lovely farm fresh eggs provided for our enjoyment, and we sincerely appreciated that we could bring our dog with us to stay. Thank you Deanna for a wonderful experience at your cottage!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our Host was amazing! Always available & responded quickly. Wonderful people! This cottage was amazing!! Everything that you would need plus more was provided!! If you want to get away from the hustle & bustle, the noise of being in town/city this is the place to go! A quiet country setting! You can actually see the stars at night!
We’ll be highly recommending this place to all our family & friends & anyone else who ask!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Beautiful property, quiet & peaceful. Perfectly clean and comfortable too. Deanna was a great host, we even had farm fresh eggs from her hen house in the frig for our breakfast &
a selection of tea for a hot beverage on a cold night. 5 stars isn't enough, I'd give this 10 stars if it went that high. Thank you for such a warm & welcoming place to stay on a cold night. Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If getting out of the busy city and staying in the country in a beautiful cottage, then this is the place for you. Very updated and new, well stocked with everything for your basic needs, and grocery store is only a few miles away. Deanna was very responsive and very friendly. This place is a must and permanently on our list."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very tidy and lovely cottage in a great location with beautiful views. We especially appreciated the fall decor through the cottage- it was such a homey touch! Deanna is a great host and provides everything one could possibly need for comfortable stay. We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There aren’t enough wonderful things to say about Jo’s Cottage! Deanna and Frankie are wonderful hosts!
The cottage is immaculate! Clean, had everything you needed, and then some! The scenery around is fantastic, I could spend every spring and fall there!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is absolutely adorable and so homey! The space itself is nicely decorated and modern, and super neat and clean as well. There were plenty of towels in the bathroom, throw blankets in the living room, and extra bedding in the closet. The screened in back porch is an awesome place to sit and read and listen to the sounds of nature - minimal noise pollution and lots of cricket sounds! The pond (which I did not expect to enjoy as much as I did!) is stocked with several types of fish, and anyone who wants to will be able to catch something! Deanna was amazingly responsive and accommodating. There was a basket of fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge when I arrived, and trust me when I say you haven’t had eggs until you’ve had farm fresh eggs. Expectations met and exceeded for sure!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The property was beautiful and hosts were great. Very well maintained, and cleaner then several other places we've stayed at with Airbnb. You will not be disappointed in your visit, and the fresh eggs were amazing. Our husky had so much fun roaming the property, and seeing her first chickens."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the best AirBnB I have ever stayed at. The cottage has EVERYTHING!!!…you may need for your stay. It was clean and comfy! The outdoor space is tranquil and the fishing is amazing! My kids were catching bass within minutes of throwing their poles in the water. Lastly, what makes this place special are the host Frankie and Deanna. They are good down to earth people who went above and beyond to ensure my family and I had the best time possible. Thanks for everything guys!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of my favorite stays ever! Felt safe and slept wonderfully on the comfy bed! Would love to come back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I bold the Cottage for my parents to stay while they were in town for the September birthdays in our family. This is what my dad had to say about the place.
“Jo's Cottage is awesome. The owners went out of their way to make sure we had a Great weekend. The cottage is beautiful inside and out. The screened porch overlooking the pond is so peaceful. They are true Christian country people. We will be staying here again. Our whole family has fallen in love with these people, Christian brothers and sisters and they are such an encouragement”"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stay at! The bed was very comfy. I felt at home and the neighborhood was very quiet. They have a great view of their pond and you can sit out there and fish.
I love the screen porch and watching the hummingbirds. Great price for the amenities!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Charming and comfortable cottage in beautiful setting. Highly recommend! Many thoughtful touches and delightful porch.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Frank and Deanna are the best host possible, and their property is as good and comfortable as it can be. So many details to go on that are perfect for the guest to feel right at home. What you read that you will get is what you get and more. Everything was at pristine condition. Wish I could have stay some more days."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing stay at Deanna and Frankie’s property. Check in was so easy and the place was absolutely beautiful and clean. They were so hospitable to us the entire stay, they even left us a dozen farm fresh eggs in the refrigerator! The fishing was terrific, my husband caught so many fish! I highly recommend this property for a relaxing getaway. We are already planning our next visit!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful and sweet getaway! Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most wonderful stay. The cottage was absolutely perfect and the decor was very modern and pretty. We had everything we needed. This is a very wonderful place to stay.
Thanks, Donna & Keith"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Best place to stay in Oakland! Kindest, most gracious hosts you could ask for. The property is beautiful and so are the living quarters. I absolutely loved staying here for a month and look forward to going back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna and Frank welcomed my wife and myself as their first guests, they were amazing hosts. Very responsive. Check in/out was very easy. The place had everything needed to enjoy our stay. Very relaxing location in the country. Perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of the big city but, close enough to get out and enjoy what Memphis has to offer. Several small towns nearby for dining out/groceries. This was by far our favorite Airbnb experience: the location, the hosts, the home and the little touches around the place to make us feel at home. There’s a small pond to relax by or the small screened in porch (we enjoyed our breakfast there each day). They have some chickens you can visit. They even brush some eggs our first day there! We hope to return someday for a longer stay and bring our daughter with. Can’t say enough good things about this experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay felt right at home
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryan was easy to contact and very quick to respond. He was flexible on check in because I arrived 2 hours earlier than expected. The livingroom did get a bit warm for my taste because the AC unit is in the bedroom. But I’m always hot when I’m down south, so that could be partly me! Otherwise the house was comfortable and supplied with all I needed. Wonderful stay overall."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great for the price. Quiet neighborhood. Staying here until we close on our house we’re purchasing. Easy scenic walk to downtown.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is quaint and more spacious than it looks! Lots of natural light, especially early in the morning. We would have benefitted from a check-out checklist in the property, but hopefully we left everything ok."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, will definitely stay again and also recommend when we have family in town"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was looking for a place to stay on my way down to Texas and Bryan's place was perfect. I needed to work while I was there and had everything that I needed to do my job effectively and the house was clean and very comfortable. Bryan was also very responsive if I had any questions. Thanks again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bryan’s place was as listed. I’d definitely come back again when I’m in town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place. Very clean and easy to find. Liked having a dedicated parking spot. Host was very proactive with communication. We honestly had no questions because he told us everything before we could think to ask. Great experience.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay overall and definitely would stay again in the future.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bed was comfy and water was hot. Couldn’t sleep well because of neighbor cussing and banging around. The shower curtain didn’t fit and the outside one was stained with rust. Not to mention someone’s hair was all over the shower from previous renters. Also under the bed was rose pedals left from previous stay. The internet was freezing up every time we tried to watch a movie. No extra blankets anywhere in house, the living room gets chilly because the heat doesn’t reach there. Over all it was not a clean place, very old and smelled."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"first off, the first night we stayed we had the neighbors ( which we were unaware of it being a duplex) come pounding on the door telling us to turn down our music and how thin the walls are when you couldn't even hear the music in the livingroom really, then we had the neighbors yelling through the walls at us while being intimate and pounding on the walls. then the neighbors would blaring their music when we were trying to sleep ( which didn't bother us other than them being rude to us about what little noise we did make while there) Also, we were not very pleased to find live Mice in the house, not cool when your walking to the fridge in the dark to open the fridge and find a live mouse right by the door of the fridge. last but not least the floors are super cold in the house, in order to warm up the house we had to put the heater in the bedroom on TURBO mode and keep the bedroom door wide open and by the time it would start warming the house up, your overheating in the bedroom"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was exactly as advertised. Enjoyed my stay. Definitely worth the price.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect little place with all the basics. Clean and comfy. Bryan was a great host and always responsive to questions and requests.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to Dyersburg Hospital
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host, very responsive and easy instructions to get inside. Front door sticks when opening and closing but little push and your in. Cute little duplex overall and well stocked."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying. Just like our first stay, very comfortable clean property. The bed is extremely comfortable in a pretty good sized room. The entire home is super clean and well decorated. I’ll continue to stay anytime we visit in the area!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay! Clean and Plenty spacious! I’d definitely stay here again! Responsive host, they were kind to let me do a later check out time!
Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, great host woul recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Came to west TN for hunting and it was a great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With its quaint and quiet atmosphere, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay with lots of time to connect and share with each other. It was my first time being in Tennessee, and I am glad that this air bnb was where I got to experience it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very happy to have found Bryan's listing for a long-term stay! He was very helpful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The bed was most comfortable and I felt our host had a lot of extra toiletries that most air bnb don’t provide
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute place. Heater was in the back bedroom. Front room where the pull-out sofa was stayed alittle cool, may need an extra blanket."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,", nice place enjoyed my stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great. 2 or 3 min from our family that live in Dyersburg. Cozy and comfortable. Our only issue was the water temperature. The shower/bathroom water was barely room temperature and we had to take cold showers.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Totally recommend! Nice and quiet.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small, clean, private. Could use a little more thought on the decor. Maybe store the extra bedding in something other than a plastic tub, a lamp or two for the bedroom and living room. Host is a great person to communicate with. We have rented this place twice, the cleaning lady was still there when we arrived 30 minutes after check in. Will probably rent again because of the location and price. Wish they allowed pets."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just disappointed overall, there were two in the open mouse traps. The air conditioning system was difficult to work with in lacking in my opinion. screen door would be nice to to be able to shut always felt like it was open to bugs etc outside. Just a bit of a letdown based on what I saw in the pictures."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The photos and descriptions match exactly. There were no issues other than a car in the assigned driveway. However, Bryan responded immediately, and the car was moved in minutes. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. I do recommend that another AC be placed in the living room for guests who prefer it cold. It was clean enough and uncluttered. As a previous maid, I spotted areas that needed help, but as a current travel agent, I highly recommend this Air B&B for the price. What a great deal!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay here when I visit my family. Good little place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing bad about this place at all I do only wish there was a television in the bedroom but everything was amazing. Comfortable clean, especially cool on hot days."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Host responded quickly.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute little place to stay. Easy check-in, smelled nice when you walked in, everything was clean, comfy bed, and nice furnishings.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Cute cottage. Could be a little more comfortable with some simple additions. Left a private note for owner.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, clean, safe, and comfortable bed!
I intend to return in the future:)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a nice little place as described. The home was clean and comfortable. We were there for a wedding and family reunion and it was conveniently located in a nice older neighborhood. The price was great could have gotten a motel.
The only issue we had was there was no bedding for the pull out couch and it was in need of repair or replacement.
My only suggestion would be to make the place a little more equipped would be to provide a toaster and a new coffee maker. But all and all it was a great place that I would book again if I was in the area in the future!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and didn’t have any problems!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely recommend to book!
Bryan had all the necessities and was very responsive.
But bring extra blankets and your own shampoo/conditioner.
The cleaning fee I felt was a little much because the place wasn’t too clean. There was hairs all over the bathroom sink/tub and inside cabinet. Pull out couch also needs to be replaced.
But overall good stay."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I would have left five stars but there were a few issues but they were resolved after our first night. I would recommend Brian’s place to friends for sure.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked out well.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool little duplex. I've stayed several times and would recommend it.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was great, enjoyed my stay here."
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was as listed. Very cold weather hit this location causing the heat to not be enough to heat the unit all the way through to the living room, kitchen and bathroom. Only the bedroom and hall were warm. Could use some basic maintenance."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication quiet place
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very Clean and Cute Place. Cold in the living room needed a space heater but Lowes was close by. Fireplace wasn't real. Would definitely stay again. Close to hospital but nothing else walking distance. But stores and food 5 min drive away.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Friendly, responsive host. The stay does have a private drive, but beware of bottoming out (Mazda3 bottomed out every time). The location is what it is and we wouldn’t recommend this part of Tennessee in general but in our situation, it’s where we needed to be and this stay was more than sufficient. The home is secure feeling and is a simple uncluttered space.
It should also be noted that the entry and exit is controlled by a third party app. If you are unable to load another app to your phone or don’t have your phone charged/available/etc you will not be able to enter or exit without the host overriding (which naturally, you wouldn’t be able to notify them if you have no phone charged or available). There is no key or keypad available as an alternative and to lock when leaving you must also use the app.
Overall, for having to travel to a less than desirable part of the state, this stay definitely made the experience better, it’s quiet, feels safe, quite clean and friendly host."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations were as described and perfectly suitable. Definitely download the august app beforehand to make check-in smoother. I forgot to do that between the delay from booking to actual reservation and it made getting in the house sticky. Host made himself available to help day of check-in, though."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As described with peace and restful stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bryan was very helpful and the location was great!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Property was as advertised. Thanks!
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The place is small but as described. It is decorated well.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay, only no central AC gets a bit warm in living room. AC is in bedroom."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is just like the pictures! Cute and comfortable. Supplies are there to get you thru your stay ( toilet paper etc)
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Good place for one person. Everything is functional. Washer/dryer nice to have. Tight parking.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Decent place for an older house. Everything is functional, the kitchen is tight but functional. Convenient to everything in town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Polk house is centrally located near restaurants and stores. Very clean and great communication with property management.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great property, convenient to restaurants and shopping. Neighbors were quiet and pleasant. A property we will stay at again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at this site for half a year. The location and proximity to Dyersburg Hospital was the motivating factor in selecting this location. The cleaning staff and the owner provided me with a safe, secure, clean stay. The unit is as pictured."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Working in the healthcare field, I was happy to fin this gem! Anybody who’s taking a contract at Dyersburg Hospital please consider this unit."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I enjoyed a weeks stay at this unit. I can say the host was responsive and the property met all my needs.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The stay was great and much appreciated! Pros: great location and close to everything, august home app made it easy to lock/unlock the door, washer and dryer made my two week stay much better, host was very responsive and a sweetheart.
Cons: Neighbors fight almost daily (physical altercations and screaming). Walls are very thin so you can hear everything. Not the host's fault. I'm a neat freak and I personally wanted to clean better but theres no access to a broom, mop, toilet bowl brush etc. Other than that I had a wonderful stay and I would 100% recommend booking with btk."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This air b&b has been one of my favorites I have ever stayed in, the neighbors were a bit noisy but it wasn’t constant, we loved the house, we will be back for sure!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable bed, clean linens, and good price"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool old house.
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was difficult due to the use of the August Home App. I couldn't get in the house until the homeowner was contacted. They had to let me in each time. The place was nice,.
It is a duplex and the neighbors were loud for 2 nights with arguments, pounding on the wall, and loud music."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for price. Neighbor was loud first night but after that was fine.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for small groups! Has everything you need and is close to town. There’s enough parking for 3 vehicles and the neighborhood is safe.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,These are great people to stay with. They hav a nice house and everything you’ll need. The only downside was the nasty neighbor in the other side of the house smoking weed and can smell it.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great property for a short-term stay, has everything you need!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A relaxing stay in a new town during training week at a new job. The cozy cottage was a joy to come ""home"" to. The host left some coffee and creamers to get through our first day, which was much appreciated. The neighbors are nice and the neighborhood is older and quaint. We were able to walk to church on Sunday. The kitchen was nicely setup so we could enjoy our own home cooked meals. The hosts were very responsive to our needs. We had car trouble one day and I forgot to lock the front door. I called them and they were able to lock it remotely. Tip: Bring a hair dryer, if you need one."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although the stay itself was really nice, there were some fairly loud neighbors, which made sleeping a little difficult."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was cute and cozy. Pictures are spot on. Take heed to all the comments about parking if you have a trailer! Worked fine for us. The bed was super comfortable and I loved the checkin/key process!! Would stay again!!
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It is a nice home. Had everything we needed. The host was very responsive. We had lots of issues with neighbors. It is a duplex, the other full time tennants are marijuana users and the Airbnb smells of it daily, if they are home."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy spot in a quiet neighborhood it was the get away from the noise that we needed
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall the property was as pictured. It was nice and cozy on the inside. The host was also very responsive and quick to address any questions we had during our stay.
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s was a nice quick lil get away
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for the money however a lot of in and out from the neighbors
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very Clean ... good value...
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little old duplex. It has been refurbished with a modern feel. Hosts are very attentitive.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place and the hosts seemed great! The ONLY downside is the parking is not good if u have anything bigger than a car (we had a truck and a boat, it was our mistake for not checking first)."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and clean place to stay. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Hosts are kind and easy to contact, if needed. Definitely recommend for any length of stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean....host answered and communicated very well and quickly. Super cute space that looks just like the pictures. Stayed nice and cool on a hot day. We will be back for sure!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brian was super helpful to us during our stay. He allowed us to check in when we arrived earlier than planned and had a restless one year old in the car, he accommodated our having some unexpected visitors, and was great with communication!
Only caution I would give is that the driveway and street parking is a tighter fit than expected. If you are driving a car it will be fine but we were driving our truck and it was a tight squeeze. It was fine! Just took some maneuvering."
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot for the price for a quick or extended visit.
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is very beautiful, the only is we had was the wifi was very spotty almost every day!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There’s no question, this will absolutely be the place I stay every time I visit Dyersburg.
Great place!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very modern. Clean and nice updates. One thing I recommend is downloading the app that allows you to unlock the door. I was not used to that system of entry. I suggest getting the app a day day before arrival to be prepared to get into the space. Especially if you intend on arriving late night.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely as described and decorated just as you see in the pictures. Very, very clean. Not far from amenities, stores, and highway's. Bryan was very quick to respond to needs and very hospitable, would definitely rent from again!!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic property with a perfect host. The property is exactly as pictured (maybe better). Great neighborhood.
Bed was very comfortable, kitchen roomy, deep bathtub. Host was very accessible and accommodating. I highly recommend this property."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very comfortable stay. BTK properties was very responsive to any questions or concerns. I especially appreciated having a washer/dryer unit available and that the space had a security system in place.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cute place to stay. The bed and couch were very comfortable. Everything was furnished. Great place for travel nurses like us :)
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a travel nurse, and 12 hour shifts are exhausting- especially night shifts. This place is FANTASTIC! Is is literally less than 3 minutes to the hospital! Every amenity is provided you could wish for- the only complaint I had was the stash of Hershey bars in a dish welcoming me when I entered every day. That was NOT conducive to a diet!!! The bed literally made me melt- I always went right to sleep. The bathtub is nice and deep- wish I had more time off between shift to soak more! Best host too! Also was available to answer the simplest of questions- checking in was a breeze, all you need is a cell phone! A hidden gem for sure! STAY HERE IF YOU COME TO DYERSBURG!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice house in a secluded neighborhood
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay in a convenient location will be looking forward to booking again
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Gloria was very responsive and friendly. The house was quiet and it was easy to find the place. The house was kind of dirty. When we showed up, the TV was on and we were wondering if we were in the wrong house lol. There were also some stuff left behind. One of the plates left out had crumbs on them and there were makeup eyebrow supplies in the kitchen. There was also some unwashed stains on our bedsheets. It seemed like someone stayed at that place and we walked into the place right after it was used. Overall the house is nice but there could definitely be improvements to the cleaning."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Recommend this place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Gloria was amazing! Will book again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gloria’s house was great for our intended use. Myself and two friends were on a purpose driven trip to Arkansas and that was to duck hunt. We had a few questions for Gloria before our trip and she was more than willing to answer our questions and even continually checked in during our trip. We did not do any exploring while we were there which is what drove my 4 star review for location. The only amenities that we explored were the grocery store and gas stations so I can’t speak on amenities. The Kroger grocery store was excellent and had absolutely everything we needed. All in all Gloria was a great host and the house was newly renovated, we enjoyed our stay. Gloria also had basic kitchen necessities in the kitchen for cooking, as well as a charcoal grill to use, which we used several nights while we were there. The washer and dryer were excellent to have as well. We were running ahead of schedule on our way out to stay and Gloria was more than willing to let us check in early!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great little place to stay in Blytheville.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deanna was the perfect host. We were constantly bugging them about farm fresh eggs from the chickens they have and they were so so sooo accommodating and kind. Always responsive and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall a nice clean place. Will consider staying there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed in town for our friend’s wedding, this spot was PERFECT for us to get ready and rest after the festivities. Make sure to take a look at the stars!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked here last minute and Kellie was informative about everything. Thank you Kellie for the great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We met Kellie and her husband right away because we accidentally turned into the wrong driveway. They were extremely friendly. We found the rental to be even better than expected. Very clean and smelled so nice. Kellie had thought of everything. It is located outside of town which made it so quiet. She and her husband told us that the cicadas had arrived. We actually enjoyed listening to them. But the rental is so tight that we never heard them inside. The bed was soooooo comfortable. We made the decision to always stay there if it’s available when we visit Paragould. We stayed three nights.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, very clean, and very comfy, if I’m ever working up here again I will be staying again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place really nice and clean. It was really quiet and peaceful. Kelli was good about responding when i contacted her.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This perfectly fit my need to be based between Jonesboro and Paragould. The space was flexible and comfortable and I loved being in such a quiet area to get quality rest!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very pleasant place to stay out in the country. The kind of place we love. And Kellie was especially helpful and gracious as a host. Two thumbs up!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can’t say enough about this wonderful little getaway. Absolutely beautiful job on decorating and design. Clean and modern with a private feeling and beautiful surroundings of nature. Love love love it !
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t say enough good things to explain this little gem! It was a great place all around for privacy and relaxation . Very clean and modern which we like!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a bit confusing pulling in, since our GPS told us to pull into the main house entrance and the guest house’s entrance was VERY steep. But it was a cute little house, very clean, and was in a great location. We were out of town, but not too far out that it was an inconvenience to get around. We did see 2 deer when we were there, so that was awesome!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little getaway! Very friendly. Beautiful place. Super quick responses to my questions. 10/10 would stay again!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place. A few bugs but not many. Probably there due to previous visitors. Nice shower and restroom. Liked the comforting blankets. I would recommend staying away from Ikura Japanese restaurant though unless you like sushi with bones in it. Responsive host. Google maps stops at her driveway though and not the Air BnB driveway so it was a little confusing and so is the key pad. Overall enjoyed the house and world recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I always love this place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and clean. The bed was pretty uncomfortable but we had a wonderful stay and would come back again.

This place is the go to place if you need to stay in Paragould Arkansas. We will definitely be booking this place in the future. We are looking to retire to 72450. This place would be what we are exactly looking to buy when we come down. Much Appreciated"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous place, quiet and clean!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my friend and I's first experience with getting an AirBnB. We had a good time at Kellie's. It was cozy and had everything we needed. There was a Kum & Go near us so we had a place to grab some snacks for the trip. Also, Kellie was very responsive which was great! If we go back to Paragould, I'd def. just stay at Kellie's :) def. recommend :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and comfortable, I didn't want to leave!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. It was quiet and very well furnished. Everything i was hoping for. And Wilson the Brown lab is the sweetest dog ever. He came and said hello to us everytime we came back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We travel every year to the area to duck hunt once a year. Kellies home made the trip better than ever before. It was very clean and well maintained. It was very spacious even for a one bedroom. It had a bonus room that we were able to utilize by using a blow up mattress. Kellie’s home will definitely be apart of our duck hunt every year from here on out.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don’t let the plain exterior fool you! You’ll step inside to find a spacious, comfortable, well-appointed retreat. The country setting was lovely and very private! This of the place to stay if you are visiting the Paragould area. We will be back."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. Kellie is an excellent host. Check in was simple and easy. Nice kitchen appliances and bathroom.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"adorable little cottage, that was perfect for my granddaughter and me. I am in town at least once a month, and it was nice to have our own space and be able to cook and have a fenced yard for my granddaughter to play in. I felt at home. I will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location for us to see our daughter in Paragould with a new grandbaby, as well as our son and his family in Jonesboro (Brookland)! Our visit could not have been more perfect! It quite possibly could be our new place to stay while visiting our kids!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute and clean place to stay! The only downside was the bed- sinks down in the middle and very uncomfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kellie’s place was great! It was a very peaceful stay and felt very safe. The home was super clean and it was very quiet. Kellie suggested local restaurants that did not disappoint. We also appreciated the white noise machine in the bedroom! Felt right at home!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kellie allowed me to book her place for my technologically impaired parents. Lol. They usually stay at hotels and always complain about the noise. They loved it at Kellies place. They said it was the best place they had ever stayed. Quiet comfortable and private. I would have to say they will never stay in a hotel again. Thank you, Kellie, for a great place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was impressed with the cleanliness and we loved the dog that came out to say hi! Definitely a huge plus. We only stayed one night, but there were dishes and utensils that would accommodate a longer stay. I would recommend it!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit to Kellie's place. We were so happy it was available again this time. We don't know how to use the streaming TV (old people who have cable) so I sent Kellie a message & she came right over. She couldn'tget it to work either so she flagged her husband down as he was mowing the yard. He was just finishing so came right over & got it working. He made sure we knew how to turn it on and get the stations we wanted. They are a very sweet couple. We will be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place to stop while traveling.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come again. We were in town just for one night, and this place was a better option than any hotel would have been! Very nice amenities and squeaky clean!! The driveway was a little hard to find since the map took us to the main house, but finding it was easy enough after realizing the mistake. The bed was a little soft for our taste, but the rest of the stay was top notch!"

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kellies place is a great, clean, stay out in the countryside. You have everything you need at her place- beautiful kitchen and living space. If you don't like dogs- I would be hesitant to book because she has several that roam the property- we are dog people and did not mind. If you need a quick place to stay- this is perfect but we wish there was a little more privacy overall on the property."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kellie's place was quiet and quaint. We so enjoyed the location and being out of the way of the city. It's a lovely property and a clean and comfortable home. Would highly recommend and stay again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a return visit for me. The location is close enough that you don't have a long travel time to get necessities, but far enough out that you have a PEACEFUL stay. Kellie's place provides a wonderful view and you feel right at home."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,The place itself was clean and neat. The driveway was very under described super steep. We love dogs but when we pulled up dog was running in front of car while we parked and barking. It then continued to bark all night long and kept us up. Don’t recommend if you need to sleep.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find & off the road a little, it’s very nice and cozy. I enjoyed the private nature of the location. House was extremely nice and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall happy with our stay!
My only real problem is that the driveway is a bigger deal than the listing makes it sound like. Small vehicles would have trouble. I was in a Yukon XL. A VERY large SUV, and the length meant that I scraped when pulling out unless I cut the tires very sharply.
Nice place and convenient! Taxi’s run in this area with enough heads up."

We were in town for a family event and needed help with some tools for the decorations, and without hesitation we got the help we needed. Awesome communication! One of the best airbnb stay I’ve ever had. Next time we will definitely be staying here if it’s available. 10/10!"

I cooked all my meals in the full kitchen. All pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils provided, just bring your own food and oil for cooking. Walmart and Aldi nearby if you forget anything. Visited Crowley Ridge State Park (only 15 minutes away) and ambled down a couple short hiking trails. The hosts are very friendly, respond promptly, and give you your privacy while making it clear that they’re happy to help if you need anything. I would be happy to stay here again!"

Country smell + the frog noises was my favorite. I live in a big city now so this was definitely a treat. Never saw the host / family besides the dogs during our stay even though the houses are near each other. Nice little private place if you’re looking for a quiet country get away.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kellie gave me a wonderful first experience with Airbnb! She was very communicative about check in, but we didn’t have to see her after arrival if we didn’t want to, which was great.

I would definitely recommend staying here!!"

However if arriving after dark I would check in with the hosts to make sure they are able to guide you as you get close to arriving, as there is no address listed on the driveway for the guest house! Thank you so much for hosting Kellie."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy and quiet! Located close enough to Jonesboro, yet, far enough away to not have to hear it! Didn't see the owner once! Which is a great thing, IMHO! Never had a reason to contact them, which is the ideal. Great stay, great place, great privacy! The trifecta!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, very clean, quiet little guest house on the beautiful country side. Would definitely stay again."
,,,stay away
,,,"let me preface this by saying, I didn't stay at the home. the listing was inaccurate, it was no longer active. I reached out to Gloria 2 hours before arriving to get the code to access the rental, to which she never responded. I was 5 minutes from the place when I was finally able to get in contact with air bnb, who was easily able to speak to her when she ignored my calls and texts. they informed me the listing wasn't *supposed to* be active. I had to find a quick cheap hotel at 10pm as I was out $300 and had a long trip. once in the hotel, she texted back to me saying ""I'm sorry but I don't have any listings"", making me feel gaslit and enforcing she had just been completely avoiding my messages."
