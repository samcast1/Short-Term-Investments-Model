2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Lori is a very responsive host and as sweet as can be. The cabin was spotless, and I appreciate that! I spilled some water in the kitchen when we got there and wiped it up with a paper towel. There wasn’t one spec of dirt on that paper towel! The beds were comfy with lovely quilts. She has a great gas/stove & oven, a microwave, and a toaster-type oven perfect for cooking big breakfasts. My favorite part, though, was hanging out and grilling on the amazing outside deck in the back. Such beautiful nature all around, and so peaceful. I loved enjoying my morning coffee there as well. Bring a few camp chairs for the deck. Lori also gifts you a homemade delicious cinnamon coffee cake. Thanks, Lori! We will be back!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the Big Barn and this place was amazing. We didn’t rent it for the event space but Lori had no issues with us using it if the weather was bad due to our event being outside. Everything was described as is and Lori is an excellent host. I love all of the personal touches, from the bottles of water in each room to the delicious homemade cinnamon coffee cake that she leaves in each cabin. There was also extra cabins to rent which came in handy because we had one more coming and didn’t have the space in the barn. If you are in town and need a place to stay or an event place this is it!! Again an amazing stay. Thank you Lori for being such a wonderful host and allowing us to enjoy your space. We will see you again next year."

Stall 1 & 2 are just bedrooms. Stall 3 has a 1/2 bath in it. Stall 4 has a full bath in it. There are two additional large bathrooms coming off the main living area. Cold blowing air conditioning!! Two big central units for the main area (& ceiling fans) and then each bedroom has a window unit in it. Perfect for the hotter months.
The campground is lovely. There is a play area for the children & a pond with ducks in it. It was neat just to walk around and see how they have everything displayed.

The scenery around it, just the whole way their little campground was put together is beautiful and our little town is blessed to have this place. Lori is amazing. Not only was she quick to respond and answer all of my questions. She was a joy to just talk and communicate with. I had really great visits with her through messages on here and I got to see her when I checked in. It’s one of those places you’re sad to leave because it’s just so comfortable and peaceful.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a great place to go relax by yourself, to host a family reunion, have a birthday party or small wedding, this is the place!!! Went on a business trip and chose to stay here with some colleagues instead of a hotel and we can't wait to go back and host our own private event there. While inside the big barn, we were like kids looking at so many neat details on the decoration of this place. Strolling around the property looking at the other buildings just made our minds run wild thinking about how great would be to have the entire property for a big family and friends' reunion. Lori the host is the sweetest host!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Katelyn was a joy to work with! The Airbnb was perfect for what we needed for our stay. Very cute Airbnb and well stocked.
The house does have central air but Katelyn provides window units in all 2 of the 3 bedrooms and the living room. Which is nice for how hot it gets in Louisiana but the window units did put off a moldy smell and the living room filter was very dirty. I was able to clean the filter and put it back but the whole unit was covered in dirt/mold/dust and it left our house smelling musty. The unit does not have a TV, which is listed in the description but I overlooked that detail. It would have been nice to have a tv to watch in the mornings or at night time. Which these are all smalls things, just things we noticed. Overall, our stay was nice and comfortable. Katelyn is very accommodating. Very welcoming!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A sweet little ‘home away from home!’ Would certainly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed here for a week. The home was very cozy with comfortable beds and lovely linens. The neighborhood was extremely peaceful with lots of trees. You’d never know you were close to town and yet a park, shopping and restaurants were all less than 2-5 minutes away. The neighborhood, as well as the town, made me feel comfortable and safe. I went out alone several times after dark and felt completely secure in doing so. Katelyn was not only super responsive but also very friendly and easy to communicate with. She gives clear instructions for check in, WiFi access and check out but she also posts them in the home which was very convenient and helpful! She and her husband are available 24/7 and make sure you have numbers to reach them if needed. The kitchen has pretty much anything you’d need to make meals including several small appliances. The snack basket was a nice treat but my favorite thing was the homemade bar of soap! It smells amazing! Thank you for being such a great hostess!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"What a hidden gem in DeRidder! Katelyn’s attention to detail is impeccable! This is by far the best-stocked home we’ve ever rented. It has super comfy beds, lovely linens, plush pillows, and soft towels. The house was spotless. So many nice touches, including a gift of homemade soap and a heartfelt message on the chalkboard upon arrival as we were visiting after losing my husband’s brother in Dry Creek. We have a small Dry Creek home damaged in the freeze, so we hope to return and stay during renovation. I can see why this home stays booked. You can’t go wrong with this rental. We were only there one night, but I could see us being comfortable for an extended stay. Thanks, Katelyn, for your hospitality and very reasonable rental fee during a tough time."

There was good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Neighborhood was quiet and safe and very close to all the things you might need in town. We hope to return on a future trip to visit the grandchildren. Thank you, Kate."

My Pastor, was actually able to go on the back porch and study which he said was very quiet and a great spot for him to meditate on his message.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gin's place is an excellent place to stay. I have used her place three or four times with no issues. However, this time my guest were attending a wedding and the Groom was staying there. He had out of town childhood friends drop in to visit on Friday and Saturday night, although it was not a party the neighbors was looking at the cars. We personally talked to neighbors and they said it was not an issue with people stopping by but I guess it became a problem. However, Gin and I communicated very well and we got through the weekend with no issues. I definitely would recommend this place if you are looking for a nice, cozy place to bring your family."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gin is a great host and her guesthouse is a great place to stay in DeRidder! It's completely spotless and outfitted for whatever you need. The kitchen is stocked with pots and pans, there's a separate dining room, fenced yard, and a desk/office area. It's an older home, but well cared for. I'm an AirB&B host and EXTREMELY picky, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this house is!
The best part is Gin herself. She sincerely cares about hosting and takes her work very seriously. She is easy to communicate with, and even when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, she happily accommodated us. We also received a hand-written welcome note and delicious cookies at our arrival. Gin's place made our Thanksgiving so much more comfortable!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect choice for my trip to Deridder! Home was exactly as described. Gin provided everything possible to make us feel welcome and comfortable -- including a personalized welcome and baked treats! The plastic ""left over"" containers and baggies were appreciated; most Air B&Bs do not provide those and they are a necessity when eating out or cooking in.
The games and toys were a big PLUS for the kids. The recliners were a big PLUS for the adults.
The neighborhood was nice, the neighbors were pleasant to visit with, the yard was nice to sit in and for the kids to play in (grass nicely mowed and area was bug free).
Highly recommend this home when traveling to the area."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time ever using an Airbnb. Gin was amazing! The communication back and forth and checking in to see if everthing was okay was beyond what we expected. Gin completely spoiled us. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. She set the bar high. The house was so cute and had everything we needed. I look forward to staying here again when we come back to visit our grandaughter. You won't be disappointed here!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I highly recommend this place! Gin was very easy to communicate with. The house was very clean, updated, and cozy."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gin's Guest House in Deridder is one of the best homes we've ever experienced through Airbnb. She's provided a reasonably priced house that is immaculate, attractive, and very well-appointed. The house has been stocked with numerous thoughtful touches, some practical and some purely aesthetic, and all very much appreciated. The wi-fi worked very well. I didn't test it, but we obviously had a very fast connection. I'm always looking for houses with a recliner because I sleep better on one. Gin's Guest House has four in the living room! I was thrilled. Yes, I only used one, but the other three looked just as comfortable. I slept very well, by the way. The spouse said her bed was wonderful as well. The house is in a nice quiet neighborhood within five or ten (usually just five for us) minutes or so to just about any place you'd care to drive to in Deridder. Do note, as some other reviews have pointed out, that there isn't a TV in the house. If you have to have one, this isn't your Airbnb solution. Spouse and I don't go on trips to watch TV so we didn't expect or miss one. We did, for the first time ever in an Airbnb home, play some rousing games of Sorry, using one of the games in the sun room. I loved the desk setup in the sun room for my laptop. I could go on and on. This is just a really nice house that provided all we could reasonably want in an Airbnb. If we get back over to Deridder, we'll definitely be wanting to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our experience at Guest House was excellent. The house was very clean & had such a welcoming feel to it…. & My children loved the fenced in back yard!! Gin has literally thought of every little detail.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay very much. Gin was a great host and has a very clean cozy house! Would highly recommend it if you're in the area!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, clean and super organized. We'll stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Spending a long wedding weekend at the guest house was amazing! The house is cute, EXTREMELY clean and the host went above and beyond to think of everything we could possibly need! We even got home baked goods which we enjoyed for breakfast the first morning!!!! Gin was so easy to communicate with and this is truly one of the best and easiest Airbnb places we have stayed!! We hope to stay here again and recommend it to anyone needing a place in the DeRidder area! Thanks In for a wonderful weekend stay!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a super great spot to stay if you need lodging in the DeRidder area. The house was super clean, there were many thoughtful touches to make you feel welcome and comfortable, and Gin was exceptional at communication for anything and everything you need. The location is quiet in a residential neighborhood. I won't hesitate to stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy 3 bedroom guest house in DeRidder, Louisiana is the perfect home for a family of 5. The neighborhood is so quiet, the location is perfect and the hostess is so helpful and makes everything so easy. Gin was always available to answer any questions and went above and beyond any other Airbnb has done. Upon arrival we were taken back at how relaxing the atmosphere was, the hospitality of snacks, coffee and everything you could possibly need. The house is beautiful and the decor is amazing. The price was very affordable!! I would definitely stay again in the future over any hotel room in the area for the price!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect, quiet and very comfortable DeRidder retreat! This home is absolutely as advertised/pictured and full of special touches and amenities. It's been newly renovated, incredibly clean and has quality linens - even multiple bed pillows for different firmness levels. Everything is clearly labeled for ease of use (cabinet contents, light switches, etc.) and it has a very well stocked kitchen. Our communication with Gin was perfect and her special welcomes, including home baked breads, were so appreciated. I can absolutely say, if this fits your group's needs, this is a superior experience and value versus local hotels (I've now done both). Many thanks for our good experience!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent property to stay in. It was easy to locate, very close to town and was extremely clean (spotless - and my standards are high for that). We had everything that we needed during our stay. The host has even put labels on every cabinet/drawer so you don't have to search for things. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet. The only con I saw was there is no TV in the home. This didn't affect our stay but if you have children you may want to bring a laptop/iPad so that they can watch videos. There is good WiFi there for that purpose."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful, with little touches like a nice thank you card and some home baked cookies for my two boys. The home was very clean and suited our needs perfectly."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, clean home in a quiet neighborhood. Easy to find with gps and easy access with the door code. Close to Dollar General or Family dollar and not far from downtown Deridder. Very accommodating host and would fix or bring anything needed. Relaxing atmosphere and feels safe. Lots of labels on things, bottled water in fridge and snacks on the counter, a Keurig with lots of options. Nice size shower in master bathroom. In fair weather the back lawn is perfect for grilling or relaxing and the small table in the carport is ideal for morning coffee. It is just as pictured or even better! Without a doubt this home is worth staying at!- Marianne"

Thank you for having us, the pictures doesn't do it justice, it was perfect."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time in Louisiana. Nancy had a book of places to visit at the house which was extreme useful. Major stores were about 8 minutes away.

2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"our first time staying here and it was not terrible.. but we wish we would’ve known some things before hand. You aren’t allowed to flush any toilet paper down the toilet, you have to turn off all heaters to use the microwave, it is hard to get any signal, even with the hotspot, you need to take out your own trash, which, by all means is a norm for us on the daily, but we have not gotten asked of this at any hotel or airbnb we’ve stayed at.. all of which was not included in the description and stay here. also be prepared to hear vehicles from the road and any other activity outside.
overall our trip was ok. host was nice. just glad I had someone with me to make the time fun."

Not recommending this one. Sorry

It was very clean, and smelled so fresh... It is decorated so cute... I told her when I first got there and looked around.... I thought, ""We could be friends...

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Christy's place wholeheartedly deserves a five star review! I don't know where to begin! It is exactly as described, plus some! This is the best AirBnB I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. I am very observant of cleanliness and there was not a corner or a spot untouched or uncleaned in this property. There were even little toiletries laid out in the bathroom drawers, much more than what is expected - mints, facial wipes, etc.! My children loved the large yard to run around in, and I loved the quietness and privacy! We were even visited by the roosters! Everything I needed was in the home, and Christy was always responsive and helpful. The furniture is clean and comfortable. We loved that there was no TV. My children played with each other and enjoyed the children's books and played with toys. The adults talked and enjoyed the solitude. Do not hesitate AT ALL if you are in the area and need a place to stay. We will stay again when we are back in Louisiana!"

The furniture and beds extremely comfortable and the stone shower in Master Bedroom was amazing and large jetted tub in 2nd bathroom was great for soaking on cold winter day. The attention to detail was amazing from the decor to well stocked kitchen including snacks and coffee bar, and bathroom accessories. It was easy to find and located in a safe country setting a few minutes from town. Christy had a quick response time and left great instructions. Cabinets and light switches were clearly marked.
