2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute place! A hidden gem for sure
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful estate and grounds! Extremely peaceful, safe and quiet! Lovely family host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay here. It is charming and I love it.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Easy to find and get into and very private and peaceful. Caroline was a fantastic host
This would not be a good place to drive a truck and trailer into. A regular truck or other vehicle is fine but a trailer would be very difficult to turn around in!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came for a writing retreat. I needed a quiet place to write and work. This is the ideal location. The scenery is beautiful. The place gets wonderful lighting during the day. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. It is a historic home, so if you don't appreciate the charm and traits of such, this will not be the place for you. Unfortunately I had to cut my trip short, but if I get the chance, I definitely plan to return."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caroline was a great host. She even brought a TV up for us to watch during our stay. The carriage house is clean and feels very private even though you’re right behind the main house. The property is awesome and has lots to look at. Not far from the downtown area, about 10 minutes. I would highly recommend this spot if you like unique stays with a lot of history."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,No complaints & we had a great weekend.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place to stay in St joe! This is a beautiful apartment which apparently was the old carriage House on the property. It was quiet, peaceful and just lovely!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline’s place is a wonderful place to lodge. We enjoyed the comfortable accommodations; the fireplace was particularly cozy on this chilly Saturday. The reading material was appreciated (historical information about the Carriage House and other interesting architecture around St Joseph), even the inside of the bathroom door provides interesting reading.
We took advantage of the sunny afternoon and walked around the grounds. Early spring flowers were in bloom all over the grounds.
All in all, a great place to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little private place on beautiful grounds. Waking up to hear all the different birds was one of my favorite parts of Caroline is extremely nice and an over the top host who made sure my stay was pleasant. Thank you!

E when I arrived late. Even helped me get inside. So friendly and a beautiful place. Highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet with pleasant ambiance in the winter. The gas fireplace used for heat offered flickering light in the bedroom. Perfect to disconnect, simple decor. Worth staying at instead of a hotel: less expensive, less noisy, more privacy, complete kitchen for light meals."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay. Very peaceful, private and beautiful. We wish we could've stayed longer!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, very neat and tidy when I was there, beautiful surroundings and Caroline was extremely nice during our stay, would 100% come back again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming property rich in history and character. Rental was comfortable, spacious, quiet, safe and secure. Temperature was easy to adjust and control with actual flames from the gas fireplace which added ambience. Linens and towels were all fresh and spotless. Great place when you need to relax and unwind."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely experience. Everything exactly as described. Clean, comfortable, cozy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my 2nd time staying in Carolyn's beautiful carriage house with my mom around Thanksgiving and it remains one of my favorite airbnb stays.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and it's host we're amazing! I'm glad to have chosen this place to stay, and she was always communicating with me about what to expect when I got to the house, as well as a few recommendations for food places. The host and co-host are extremely nice and friendly."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This is our second stay in 6mo. We love staying here. Beautiful home inside and out. Everything you need. Comfy beds and lots of them! Lovely kitchen to make your own meals.

She was proactive about letting me know about a boil order due to a water main break in the town. the house is huge, clean, and very cozy, and we were able to feel right at home there! I will definitely work with Kristen again if the opportunity presents itself!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"If you’re looking for a weekend getaway in a beautiful historic home, this is your location! Beautiful decorations, lots of amenities, perfect for our girls weekend!! Lots of corners to go have private conversations or even time to be alone and read a book if you wanted. Plus Kristen was a pleasure to deal with! Very accommodating and friendly! Definitely recommend and will be back!!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Kristen has an absolutely beautiful home! The original wood and pocket doors along with the decor set this house way beyond the others. Her rates are great deal compared to others in my opinion. She was fast to respond if we needed anything and super friendly. She offered everything we could possibly need inside the home which was great. The house has a great location too. We tried some of the local restaurants and were very impressed. Also just down the road from a super cool Axe throwing and lazer tag place. We highly recommend renting from Kristen if you're coming to the area. We will be renting from her again for sure!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the charm of the Painted Lady with its interior furnishings matching its rich history in St. Joseph. Also the house was so clean, beds were very comfortable, and the large kitchen was great for our extended family. One of our favorite places at the house was the large porch were we spend numerous evenings visiting with family and enjoying the wonderful fall weather. Kristen anticipated our needs and had instructions on how to operate everything from ceiling fans to washer and dryer. We really appreciate the opportunity to stay at this house. Kristen has done a wonderful job making it attractive and comfortable for visitors."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our 2 night stay went great. We had 6 adults with only 1 couple so we used all bedrooms. Very clean and comfortable. The history and decor of the house is a bonus! We enjoyed the gas range and eat in kitchen for meals and game night. The porch has a swing and some chairs with shades-great place for morning coffee. Also a beautiful flower garden and a drive way for off street parking. Friendly helpful notes around house were very nice. And great communications before check in, during stay and after checking out. Plenty of room for all! Every room has a little detail to it that makes you smile. We will definitely be back as we stay in St Joe quite often!!!!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful well-kept house. The owners took extra effort to make it feel like a home. They also had very interesting information on the houses 100+ year old history. My kids and I enjoyed learning its history.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful getaway! One of the best airbnbs I've been in for the price. Reminded me of the smell of a cabin in the forest. Hot tub was great and we enjoyed the games they had. Really big kitchen.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,highly recommend awesome cabins beautiful view quite clean spacious cabins amazing stay comfortable beds
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my third time staying with Anthony. It is champagne accommodations on a beer budget! It's a beautiful spot. Quite, peaceful lil get away that is always clean fully stocked and communication is a 10. if it's your first time it's possible I would recommend arriving during the daylight just because it's easier to navigate it's pretty dark out there being that it's away from the city. that being said Anthony does give amazing instruction on how to get your check in accomplished"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at this quaint cabin right on the river - peaceful and quiet and had everything we needed. Very comfortable and the host was responsive and helpful!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The only thing I didn’t like about this cabin was that your neighbors are literally on top of you! If you try to take a bath the construction workers next door are right out your window smoking & talking from the living room you can see into the living room of the condo below from the skylights which would creep me out if I were below and then walking back and forth from your door to the parking lot you may encounter the guy in the red truck who has a bit of an attitude, or the ppl smoking on their front porch in the dark so as long as your not looking for private this spot is amazing!
The cabin is done in wood and I love that the bathrooms are small but very nice with a beignet and wonderful tubs! The ac is a little strange but it works ok and they have fans everywhere so with the both it’s ok.
We were unable to find the kitchen lights so that was a bit of an issue and the Wi-Fi was horrible bring you own Wi-Fi box if you plan on watching anything."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was so worth it, very beautiful place .😍"

I got turned around in it a few times lol.
I felt like every time I started looking around I found a new room! The view of the Missouri River while taking a bath was so cool!!!
I would say the water could be hotter or a larger hot water tank.
I would come again, really fun with the cabin feel. I would recommend it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Easy check in and out.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Because of a family funeral, we stayed in a couple of Anthony's places. They were both wonderful, and we would definitely recommend these to anyone coming to Saint Joe. I left a little more detailed review on the other cabin, but I definitely would stay here again! And actually, plan on it! Highly recommend it!"

The carpet was super clean, and I was able to lay her on the floor without worrying about it being dirty. Everything was spotless-probably the cleanest Airbnb we’ve stayed in.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house is more in town than I thought it would be, with neighbors on all sides of the home, so it didn't always feel like a ""get away"". The backyard is not fully fenced in, so there was not as much privacy as I hoped in the backyard. I stayed in the front of the house and avoided being in the kitchen too long due to the kitchen windows not having any curtains or blinds. Often, I would look out a kitchen window and see a neighbor staring right at me.
Communication with the owner was quick. The home was spacious and very clean."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I had a delightful getaway at Jessica’s lovely home. It was squeaky clean with plenty of linens and towels. The chocolate milk and cookies were a wonderful addition. The location was excellent, as we were there to attend a concert at the Missouri Theater and meet with my sister’s daughter and granddaughter. We were less than 10 minutes from all places we wanted to see - Pony Express Museum and the Patee House among the many historical sites. We had an excellent early dinner at Pappy’s Grill and Pub on our way to the concert. We were comfortable and cozy in the house with the wind blowing a gale outside. My sister and I are definitely in the “senior” age range (79 and 82), and the house would be comfortable for all ages. There is a nice yard for when the weather is a bit warmer, plenty of games for inside. All in all, a great place to meet family when coming from different parts of the country."

When we are in town, we run around like crazy to keep up with parents, brothers, sisters, and kids, coming back to this quiet and peaceful house made us ready to do more the next day.

So many times, Airbnbs will have what seems like someone’s old cast asides, and too busy…but this place had just the right amount of furniture and art. It was absolutely immaculate with enough HOT water to fill that old tub. Ahhh… Also, we enjoyed the books/magazines, coffee, chocolate milk etc. The location was perfect for us. Jessica was accommodating and allowed us to check in a little early. Loved it!!!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is truly an incredible host -- the location was gorgeous and even came with a thoughtful surprise treat of locally farmed chocolate milk. I suffered a medical event while on my stay and I cannot give enough kudos to both AirBnB and Jessica specifically for the way it was handled. I'm well today because of it.
But back to the place itself - it really is a lovely getaway. The bathroom alone was breathtaking, which isn't a word I'd use to describe a bathroom but sincerely it's the coolest room in the house. Bring a bath bomb. The bedroom was comfy and the kitchen was clean and organized. The dining/working space has bright daytime light and is a really great space to be in. It's charming, safe, and warm. 10/10."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean organized and set up to perfect detail! This home was sooo much more than the pictures and description.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My 4-yo son and I loved our short overnight stay at Jessica’s. Everything about check-in was easy when we arrived, and we loved that frozen pizza and breakfast items were made available. I loved that the place didn’t have too much stuff that my son could get into but was definitely cozy, with lots of room inside and in the backyard for him to run around and without much chance of him damaging anything. If we come again with the rest of the family, we’ll know that we can use the giant walk-in closet as the perfect place to sleep our twins in their pack and play."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was great to deal with! While I did not stay there personally, my husband said the place was very nice and clean."
2021-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The listing and other guests' comments are very accurate. When I stayed, Jessica had just put in a new sidewalk and driveway. There was a pile of dirt covered with a tarp right outside the bedroom and living room windows. It was an extremely windy weekend and the tarp made such a loud noise in the wind that I couldn't sleep. I also found some of the artwork a little bit creepy, but I do have an overactive imagination. I ended up leaving two nights early because it wasn't the relaxing solo retreat I had wanted it to be.
If I had been with my husband or a friend, this house would have been fine. By myself it was not the vibe I needed for a relaxing retreat. But please do not let my experience deter you from staying here. I'm sure I'm an outlier in this situation!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful experience, a an upscale home away from home escape!! Jessica has combined an environment that brings cleanliness and the homey comfy feel to a new level."

The walk-in closet connecting the bedroom to the bathroom, including a full-length mirror, was a bonus. The kitchen was very well-stocked for an AirBnB, with real breakfast items provided to boot!

Jessica was very responsive, and when we had an issue the first night (blown circuit, could've happened to anyone) Jessica went above and beyond to communicate with us and make sure the issue was resolved before she got off the phone with us. The chocolate milk and breakfast items in the fridge were a VERY pleasant surprise and it just added to the charm of the home and it's host! We will DEFINITELY stay here again on our next visit.

I ran 3 miles in the surrounding streets and hit up a local coffee spot I HIGHLY recommend-Mokaska Coffee in downtown off Edmond street-SO GOOD! I also LOVED the little touches Ashley left, like toothpaste and toothbrush, lotion, bath salts. Kitchen is FULLY stocked, even though I did not do any cooking as I was just passing through on my way to Nebraska-you could definitely get your cook on in this kitchen. 10/10!!"

I spent hours scouring bnbs trying to find a place for a staycation with my best friends and when we walked into this home I felt so sure I picked the right place. It’s beautiful and modern and so clean — and has such wonderful windows that let in natural light all throughout the house. There are nice beds and a cozy living area. It’s very clear that Ashley has thought through every detail from dishes to bottle openers to bath salts, extra towels, a bath robe, chocolates, tooth brush, tooth paste, a night fancy candle to light.
Anything we needed it was already there and in a logical, easy to locate spot. Ashley was extremely responsive in giving restaurant recommendations in the area. Overall it was a great stay in a well curated pristine and clean space."

The design of the house itself to the decor was so lovely and full of character and was done just so tastefully and felt so homey. She truly had anything we could think of that we needed, from candles to a steamer to robes to candy canes for coffee to toothbrush and toothpaste and everything in between. We loved turning on the electric fireplace each night. Each room had its own floor fan which was so thoughtful. Really just can’t say enough good things about this house and how great of a host Ashley is. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place. Clean, fresh and feels like a home away from home. Personally not a fan of corner lots, but the curtains give you tons of privacy. The host is the perfect balance of helpful but not pushy. Can feel a little dry when the heat is running. Overall a five star stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s home is a beautifully decorated, conveniently located place to stay! She was super helpful and responsive! We really appreciated her kindness and help while we were her guests. I highly recommend Ashley’s home if you are looking for a place to stay in the area."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Ashley's place. Everything was new and completely spotless, and Ashley clearly has an amazing eye for decoration. The neighborhood is quiet and reasonably convenient to various spots around St. Joseph. We even had a pleasant walk along a nearby greenway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Thanks!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful place! The owners were so accommodating, and the space was clean and comfortable. It was cozy, and I’m so glad we opted to stay here rather than bringing an infant with us to a hotel.
We made the comment that whoever made the interior design choices and decorated this house should do our next home for us.
Would highly recommend staying here if you’re in the St. Joseph area!"

Perfect location for our needs.
Host was spot-on with responses and help."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The place was spotless.
The place is centrally located in St Joseph.
The beds are very high and were difficult for my husband to get into and out of.
The living area is arranged for conversation and TV watching but 4 of us could not watch TV comfortably because of the arrangement of the furniture. Also the living room got stuffy when the air was not circulating. A fan in the living room would of kept the air moving. Fans in the bedroom were great."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this home away from home! Can’t wait to come back!

It was extremely comfortable and very well decorated! If you’re ever in St. Joe, this is the place to stay!! For the same price we could have all squeezed into a single small hotel room. No thanks!! Airbnb is the way to go when traveling with little ones! Thanks Ashley!!!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host and property. Unlike many rehab properties, the owners here didn't share any expense. Great finishes and appliances. I wish more hosts took this approach. Host also seems very responsive. I sent her a note mentioning the need for some blinds in one window, she said the last guest had mentioned it and they were already ordered and on the way."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean throughout the entire house. Decorated very nicely. Felt like home. Host checked with us via emails/app numerous times to make sure everything was to our liking. Good location regardless of where you may be going around St.Joseph.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Zach's place was absolutely beautiful. We had an incredible time. He had a fun game room, snacks for the first night and was very responsive! Our event was just as close as he said and there was tons to eat nearby which made it very easy to find food. Appreciate the place being very clean upon arrival and having ample towels and blankets for guests. There were also spices available for cooking and there was more than salt and pepper and that was super appreciated. I would definitely stay again if it would be available for my event next year."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Zach’s house was perfect for our two families who attended a Benedictine graduation. It was very clean and child friendly with a very cute arcade room. We highly recommend it.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We came in town for a graduation and Zach’s place was perfect for our family and our grandparent/ aunt helpers. Everyone had their own space and the beds were VERY comfortable. We were traveling with a baby and having the pack n play was such a nice perk. I also loved that they had a sound baby monitor we could use just in case. The room darkening curtains and the sound machines in every room were amazing! We really enjoyed our stay and felt right at home. We would definitely stay again.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,My family and I enjoyed our stay at Zach's house. He was very friendly and responsive. The house was nice and clean.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great house comfy beds
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, super clean and comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you head down a few blocks, the neighborhood changes but right where Zach & Rachel’s listing is located, the area is quiet, calm & clean. Instructions were clear & the listing provided very practical amenities like a small hamper for laundry, poop bags by the back door & a selection of snacks and coffee. I felt right at home & enjoyed the common area after work. I even spent some time feeling a kid playing in the game room. The backyard was clean & pretty. The house was an easy drive and made my work trip convenient. I was able to keep my mind at ease knowing my pup was comfortable. I would return again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Zach was very responsive and friendly. The house was very clean, spacious, and comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enought about the experience we had! This was our first AirBNB experience and Zack and family definitely set the bar high. They had so many details thought out as to what a guest would need, spices, baggies, cooking spray, toiletries, video games, board games, all of the luxeries of home mixed with the luxuries of going on vacation! They were so sweet to leave us snacks as those were perfect as we got in so late we didn't get a chance to stop for food. The kids loved the backyard space and the game room, plus we found the kids playing board games together! Even the neighbor's kids were friendly and loved to play with our kids outside! We look forward to coming back next year when he go back to visit family again! Amazong experience and amazing hosts!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Zach was very helpful and responds quickly to messages. We’ll absolutely be looking to book here again on our next trip to St. Joe.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would absolutely stay again. Zach was very helpful & quick to respond.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful home. The neighborhood wasn't exactly what we expected. However, no one bothered us and it was only a few minute drive to anywhere we wanted to go. Very conveniently located in the city. Everything from the bedrooms to bathrooms, were easily accessible. It was the perfect place to make us feel at home. Great interactions with the host. Easy to follow instructions to get checked in and out. Would stay again. Highly recommend.
Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I was just there for one evening on business but this place was perfect. Looked to be freshly remodeled and super clean! Would definitely stay again if I'm in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was perfect for our family of four with two elementary schoolers - the family/game room was a big hit!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was incredibly responsive and attentive. The house was clean and had a ton of space and activities. The game room is an especially nice touch. No doubt we would stay here again if we get the chance! Great house!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had my 1st damage at this property in 10+ years(my dog chewed a blind; my own fault due to not kenneling) but host was amazingly kind & understanding. Process to correct situation was incredibly easy and painless on my end.
Home was very cozy and spacious rooms!! 10 of 10 would recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome Host. Love the NBA Jam!! Boomshakalaka
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Zach’s Air Bnb is one of a kind. It is very clean. Plenty of space for the kiddos to play out back. The bedrooms were plenty spacious and came with plenty of extra pillows and bedding(something that I feel is a nice touch.) There were plenty of games for everyone to play. The kitchen and restrooms were stocked well. We were able to cook a couple really nice meals in the kitchen and dining room area. There was a really fun bar and grill about two blocks away called pappys that we throughly enjoyed and I would recommend. For anyone considering booking, I would definitely stay here again! The host is very responsive as well and friendly. We will be back Zach."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in great condition, and very comfortable. Zach was responsive to every question we had. I would highly recommend this host and location!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Zach and Rachel were great host. They responded quickly and had the house in great shape, they even had someone come out and re-shovel the snow on the sidewalk for us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great clean house and easily fit our large family of 9. The kids had a great time with the games, and the house had great places to chill if you needed some quiet. We would recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect, family-friendly home to stay in. You can clearly tell that Zach and Rachel spent lots of time figuring out exactly what you need while staying. The cherry on top was definitely the fact that there were sound machines in every bedroom! Cute, quaint and pristinely clean! Will most definitely be booking to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was immaculate. Lots to do just inside with the family. Board game, video game…Although you will need to sign in to your own streaming service accounts during your stay which probably works out for the best. The beds are probably the most comfortable furniture in the house. But what makes this place the best is the host. They care so much about making your stay pleasant as possible. They get infinite stars if you ask me."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good communication and nice house and very nice people
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charity is an amazing host! The apartment was beyond anything I expected!! Thank you so much!! We will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a pleasant surprise it was to stay in an Airbnb in Stewartsville, MO! The apartment was located in an old building that has been refurbished and very nicely redecorated with period-correct furnishings and was also equipped with all the modern appliances and technology. The town is very small and not a lot to do but there is a really good restaurant right across the street - Goldie's.
The fact that there isn't much to do in Stewartsville was of no consequence for me as I was there to visit family; another special touch was the fact that Charity's family and my extended family have known each other for decades!
So if you find yourself looking for an excellent place to stay in Northwest MO, choose Charity's AirBNB, you won't be disappointed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had another reservation in neighboring town. Host canceled on Thursday night as they were supposed to be blocked out until May. I found Charity's place as an alternative, sent a message late Thursday night and she was able to accommodate us.
Great communication. Stewartsville is a very small today and the place is in an old building that's been beautifully restored.
a previous guest hadn't signed out of their YouTubeTV, so I was able to watch NCAA tournament.
in our 10 years of using Airbnb services, this is one of the best places we have ever stayed.
everything was squeaky clean, comfy couch and bed. hot water in the shower.
the only thing that would have made it better is if Goldies across the street was open so we could have gotten a fresh cinnamon roll.
If opportunity exists, we will definitely book with Charity again.
Have a great Easter all!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful. Charity made it feel like home away from home. It was clean and had everything you would want or need. We will be looking forward to staying again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying in about a week as an overnight to break up a long drive. Not too far the main highway. Will stay again when coming through this area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful apartment!! Bigger than I expected. Was able to park right out front. Unless you have a big truck you can unload with car doors open and not worry about traffic as the parking is off set from the road some. Between the lights outside of the apartment and a street light out back there’s plenty of light for taking dogs out at night. One of the cleanest places I’ve stayed. I appreciate not needing to take out garbage, start laundry, etc before leaving."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was one of the best we’ve ever stayed. Many thoughtful details, lots of amenities, cool design with high ceilings, and even had sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We genuinely loved our stay here! This place is absolutely beautiful, and Charity is a great host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a relaxing stay away from the city. Clean and had everything you could ever need!! One of the very best airbnb stays we’ve ever had.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I love Charity's place!!! Highly recommend and plan on returning for another visit!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay here! The special touches really stand out. Kuerig coffee selection, beverages stocked, tissue available in every room - things like this make this place feel like home immediately. The Soul Soup bakery next door and Goldie's Restsurant across the street were both delightful and their owners so kind. Charity responded quickly to our special needs that we encountered because we were crafting during our week long stay. She went above and beyond for us. Could not have been any better."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I try to always stay here when I visit family nearby. I think this was my 5th stay. The location is perfect, the unit is very serene, well set up for both a quiet evening after a day of family adventures and for a day of working before meeting the family!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing. Very clean and well equipped. Beautifully decorated with plenty of room. We would definitely stay here again if in the area. This is the best Airbnb we have stayed at.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charity’s apartment is amazing…..everything is exactly as mentioned on the listing plus extra special touches. The apartment is modern and quite spacious, , a well-stocked kitchen with small appliances as well as large….many and varied Keurig coffees, teas and hot chocolates……a welcome bottle of wine…..and the bathroom has a great shower, plush towels and all the necessary niceties as well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay here and it was great as always. Place is very nice, comfortable, and pet friendly (which is a must for us). Our go-to place when we are in the area. Charity left a bottle of wine from a local vineyard which was a nice touch (I always enjoy local flavor). Area is quiet and Stewartsville seems like a nice friendly community."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great for us! So great that we booked many more trips in advance!! Charity was super helpful and kind! Thank you for making us feel at home !!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Charity’s AirBnB. It was comfortable and quiet. We enjoyed everything about it!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Charity is always so sweet and helpful. We always enjoy this place and will continue to go back! It's a home away from home. 💗
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay. Definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, clean, and well kept. This place is everything as described. I will be back!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was honestly my best Airbnb experience so far. Charity was incredible & went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great and that we had everything we needed.
The unit was actually a lot bigger in person than we expected & everything was better than pictured.
The town itself is super cute & we loved being in a small town while still being central to St Joseph, Cameron, and less than an hour from KC. The town may be small, but it has everything you need for your stay if you didn’t want to get out or need something in a hurry. The bakery next door is incredible, there is a dollar general just up the road, and everyone we interacted with in town was absolutely fantastic.
Check in & checkout were both really easy which made our stay that much more convenient.
We are already planning to come back next year!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charity's place is beautiful. It was close to where we needed to be.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a remarkable property! Everything was outstanding!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the rustic look and was just what we needed! Will stay here again when visiting relatives if it’s available! Great response from host and just all around positive vibe! It have everything we needed to feel at home. Loved the photo album idea of past guest and journal!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot between St. Joseph and Hamilton aka Quiltown! We enjoyed a great break during our cross-country drive at Charity’s. A very comfortable and cozy home with great artwork and vintage touches. Charity has thought of everything that might be needed - one of the best stocked AirBnB’s we’ve stayed at.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay at Charity's place (visiting family in the area) and likely not our last. The place is beautifully finished, tastefully decorated, uncluttered, clean, and pet friendly (which is important to us since we always travel with our 3 furry family members). Charity made some good local recommendations that we followed and were very pleased, and was very proactive with communication, and left us a bottle of wine as well as various Kuerig drink options.
Stewartsville is a very peaceful and has a strong sense of community (events going on in the city park both times we were there). Even though the apartment is on Main street, there was very little traffic and almost every driver that passed greeted us with a wave while we were out walking our dogs. Everyone we ran into was very friendly. A cute little Bistro right next door was celebrating their grand opening the first morning we were there.
All in all a great stay that remains at the top of our list. Thanks!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,It’s beautiful house and clean as I feel at home!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay! It’s our second stay here as it allows us a great location close to family in the area. Because we spend most of our time with family we aren’t there a lot.
We love the decor, always spotlessly clean and Charity is very easy to work with. Love it gives us a quiet place to regroup and share a bottle of wine to unwind from the day. Great selection of K-Cups for breakfast beverages.
Will definitely return! Thank you, Charity!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I'm here for work, and I wanted something outside downtown St Joseph. That is exactly what I got. Lots of room with the open concept with living and kitchen. has everything you would need. The upstairs people can be loud sometimes (during day time) with TV, talking, and walking. it scared me when I heard the noises the first time. I thought it was getting broken into. 😏 otherwise great place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice lofty one bedroom space with lovely small touches. We came in late and left early, but being not far down from the main stretch of road while still being distant enough for a quiet walk around the block for the pups was perfect for our needs. For a one bedroom it was a great amount of space and is very well kept. Definitely recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Charity was an excellent host and the accommodations were some of the best we've seen in 20 yrs of booking rentals and at an excellent rate. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and welcoming. Would definitely recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed here several times now and it’s always a pleasure! The location is great; the apartment itself is lovely and cozy. It’s just perfect and always feels like home away from home!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a hidden gem! Beautiful place with amenities galore. Great stop driving cross country as we needed a comfy place with washer/dryer. Place is newly renovated and they spared no expense. Just be sure to grab food before arriving as there aren’t too many things open late for dinner. Charity gave us great recommendations instead though! Beautiful and quiet, couldn’t ask for a better place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place that is spacious, clean, newly remodeled and allows pets! Host is very friendly and responds quickly!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charity’s place was great, so welcoming and adorable. We 💜 that our furbaby was welcome too."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place far exceeded expectations. Much more spacious than pictures showed. Very comfortable, well stocked place. Will definitely return should I find myself in the area again"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super quaint getaway! This property has been very well thought-out. Finishes are beautiful and clean, decor is modern and attractive, location is quiet and easy to access. Parking is literally 10 feet out the front door. The owners have thought of EVERYTHING throughout the property and have spared no expense. From the plush towels and rugs to the beautiful stocked kitchen, EVERYTHING is present to have a wonderful stay. We chose this location for the solitude, remoteness, and quiet. We were not disappointed. We would recommend it in a heartbeat."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved your air bnb! It is beautiful and very spacious! I wouldn't change one thing! We will definitely be back! Thanks for everything! It was the best!
Jason and Kim Mcmillen ❤️"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charity was such an incredible host! This place was perfect for my mother and I on our visit to the area. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We so enjoyed this lovely place! The hosts were amazing and provided the extra touches to make it feel just like home. We will definitely be returning in the coming months!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Charity’s place is great. We found it to be just as described. It was very clean with comfortable furnishings. The space is really cute. For people who want to be in the center of things there is not much around. But we wanted a quiet place for the night with a kitchen and it was perfect for that. Check in was seamless and communication was great.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! Probably one of my favorite Airbnb’s to date. The place was clean, large, modern, and the many extra’s Charity provided really put it over the top! The town was super cute and the place was right off the end of the Main Street. The place was very “industrial” but cozy at the same time. It was a nice change from the city and I’m glad we stayed here! If I come back that way, I will definitely be staying here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charity’s home is the perfect getaway if you find yourself near Kansas City! Zero complaints and 12/10 would recommend staying here!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was more spacious than the pictures captured. A perfect space to rest while seeing family in the area. I'm excited to come back back and stay there again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loft was wonderful! I loved the decor and amenities were top notch.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous blend of rustic and modern decor, very cute and I love the hardwood floors. Comfortable and not crowded. Whole unit was very clean (which is important to me). Good location in a quiet town. Felt at home (only cleaner and less cluttered) the moment my wife and I walked through the door. Charity did a great job with communication and left a nice bottle of wine for us from a nearby vineyard (which sadly I understand has closed). Our 3 dogs are a large part of our family and go everywhere with us, so we really appreciated that this place was pet friendly. Great stay and will definitely keep this on the list the next time we need to stay in the area.
Stewartsville was having its annual celebration while we were in town. I took the opportunity to get some food from the vendors for dinner and a great cappuccino for my morning jump start. The locals were very friendly."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charity's place is the perfect get-away - clean, quiet, and in a perfect middle America town. She also goes above and beyond in making sure you not only have all needed amenities, but some cold water/drinks to beat the heat and warm drinks in the morning to jump start the day. Fantastic find, we'll be back for sure!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this Airbnb! The inside decor was beautiful and filled with things to do for my kids. Great service and great place that met all our needs on our cross country trip. Appreciate the experience!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful, clean and convenient place. would definitely come back if i’m in the area"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Spaciousness, clean. Everything needed to keep house. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnB experiences we've had. Incredibly well done remodel of the space. The town is quiet and sleepy, which was just what we were looking for. Travel into St Joseph, Kansas City, and Jamesport was super easy."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The downtown loft of Stewartsville is such a beautiful place! We definitely will want to stay here again next time we are in the area visiting family.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, and private place to stay. If you’re expecting the bright lights of the city this isn’t the place. But, if you want a slice of of small town America, this is it. The apartment was spacious, clean and well appointed for your stay. The town doesn’t have a grocery store, so bring your snacks, etc. There is a Dollar General which has limited supplies. St. Jo isn’t far away, so you can visit the city easily for sightseeing and come back to a relaxing place. The host is very responsive, polite and accommodating. Enjoy your stay, I did!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here. Awesome place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My dog and I had such a lovely experience! I've stayed in quite a few Airbnb's all over the country (and quite a few internationally), and I never thought the best one I'd stay in is in Stewartsville, MO! There were just so many thoughtful touches to the space and comfort was never lacking! I booked my stay for 4 nights for the purpose of a getaway and escaping loud fireworks (still some noise here, but way better than Lincoln, Nebraska) and I was definitely a 'home dweller'. The kitchen was fully equipped for all my basic cooking needs (with really nice fixtures and appliances to boot). I had such a quiet and comfortable stay and will definitely consider this space for next year if available!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is one of the better Airbnb’s I have stayed in. Everything was clean and ready for our arrival. Charity was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. I will most definitely stay here again when I am back in the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely love this place. Second time to stay! Cute! Clean! Comfortable! We love is so much we will stay again soon!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charity was an amazing host. Thank you!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was absolutely breathtaking! I only gave the location 2 stars because there wasn’t much close-by in terms of food, but that isn’t Charity’s fault. Charity was an outstanding host, incredibly communicative and helpful. She made the process so easy and providing us with everything we needed to have an enjoyable stay! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect, just like it looks in the pictures, clean and with all services. We recommend this house to everyone that wants to spend time in stewertsville"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was perfect for our stay! Decorated very nicely, comfortable and very clean. Super quiet.
While we didn’t really cook while there the kitchen has everything you would need.
We really enjoyed our stay. It made a very comfy home away from home while visiting family in the area.
We will be back! Thank you!
Pam"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you are visiting Stewartsville or other areas nearby. Such a nicely done unit with a great mix of finishes and keeping the historic feel. Charity is a great communicator and makes everything nice and easy for your visit.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute, clean, easy to find and easy check in!! So nice and quiet. Spacious, lovely space!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great comfy, clean and quiet spot in Missouri . we appreciaate all the wonderful upgrades they have done in their beautiful renovation. :)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charity’s space is truly a gem. This was the perfect stop for a night! The unit was beautiful, and very well stocked with games and other lovely touches. Thank you, Charity!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was AMAZING! The space was beautiful, clean, organized, quiet, and we had the best experience with Charity. I would highly recommend. probably one of my best stays with Air BnB.
I accidentally left my pants and Charity reached out immediately and sent them to me! People, that is true hospitality!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! You will not be disappointed. The attention to details and understanding of travelers was outstanding. Very well kept and a fantastic value. WIFI was very solid and fast! Very quiet!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay in the heart of downtown Stewartsville. A renovated loft with a spacious interior and a lot of extra small touches. Very clean and well decorated.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Charity is a wonderful host. The place is amazing. It has a warm and cozy atmosphere. Love it!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was easily the best Airbnb in which I have ever stayed. The remodeled building is absolutely lovely, and Charity decorated the space beautifully. The mattress was incredibly comfortable, the water pressure in the shower was great, the kitchen was easy to cook in, and the living space was cozy and open! Charity has anticipated everything you might need or want for a comfortable stay! My partner and I are moving and suddenly needed a dog-friendly place for a few nights. Charity was quick to respond and very flexible and helpful as we were making our plans. When we needed to extend our stay, Charity was once again responsive and available to help! I can’t imagine a more wonderful hostess! I am so grateful to have found this Airbnb and if I am ever remotely close to Stewartsville again I will stay here!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great option if you are staying in the Stewartsville area! Historic building renovated to showcase the original style but nicely updated for the present! Good internet if you are working from anywhere, much better water pressure than I was expecting in an older building. Loved the mix of cozy and period looking pieces (mostly the use of metal fixture and Edison lights) and loved the nice touches of a “where to visit”, welcome bottle of local wine and being a tea drinker the kettle along with the Keurig. I’ve already booked for my next stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a wonderful stay. We will most definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. It was the perfect place to relax. I stayed with my two kids and we had everything we needed and more. I appreciated the fresh eggs, wine, bottled water, board games, and other little touches. I’d recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very well appointed, spacious, and clean apartment in small town reasonably close to Kansas City. Charity also included some very nice personal touches. Only downside was that since it is a lower apartment, and the tenets above were noisy at times at night. Otherwise, this was a fantastic place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home! Not much else in the area, but if you’re looking for a clean, relaxing getaway this is the place!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great beautiful place to stay. Close to Saint Joseph. Host was very responsive when had questions and provided necessary info prior to arrival to get settled in. I would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Seriously, this was probably one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. Charity has thought of everything possible, and there was even beer and a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived. Shower was great and the bed was so comfy. Will be staying again if in the area!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Perfect place to stay at such a great value. We went to visit MSQC and it was only a 30 minute drive. We were able to visit Shatto dairy farm and a winery within 10 minutes of the loft!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice loft. Beautiful quiet area, just what I like. It is located on Main street, but very little traffic and all of the locals were super friendly. The niceties provided by the host were very thoughtful. Clean and nicely decorated, very comfortable. I do wish the lighting was a little better in the kitchen area. Seemed really dim and a little difficult to see when preparing food, at least for me. You could dim the lights, and I adjusted them all the way up, but still a little dim for me. I generally like dim lights, as bright lights do not work well with my type A personalty, but I do like the ability to turn on brighter lights if needed. Don't get me wrong, the lighting is beautiful, and sets a nice calm, cozy romantic atmosphere, I would just like the ability in the kitchen to have maybe some canned lights to turn on when more light is needed. Overall it was a great place to stay and the host was great to work with. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place with everything you need and more!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at this lovely apartment. We were in town for a wedding and having this gorgeous retreat to relax at the end of the day was wonderful. Everything was clean with thoughtful touches of extra items a guest may need. I would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in the area.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! The apartment is in incredible condition.It's a very cool space. So much attention to detail. The host is even better. They obviously really care about the guest. I highly recommended this place!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charity is Great Host! The loft is beautifully remodeled and was already stocked with coffee & cold beverages. She even gave us a bottle of wine & farm fresh eggs to enjoy. The local farm community makes for a very scenic drive. If you are in the area and need a place to stay, choose Charity's loft. You will feel like one of the family...."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was clean and pretty large - just traveling with my girlfriend and we had more than enough space. We were also working remotely and wifi was reliable.
The town is very simple and there isn't much open/available during the week which requires you to go out to some neighboring towns. We enjoyed the tranquility but just something to consider!.
Everyone in town is very friendly!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an AMAZING place to stay. The owner thought of so many details to make your stay feel like a home away from home. Very relaxing and very clean. We will definitely be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a blessing to have this place in Stewartsville,Mo.
Very accommodating! We just loved the place!! Definitely a hidden treasure!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A mix of modern and rustic decor settled in a quaint small town. The host was amazing not only offering things to do around the area but provided a complimentary bottle of wine from a local winery and fresh farm eggs for breakfast. Cute and friendly coffee shop on the corner with homemade goods topped the morning coffee off while we sat on front porch and waved at local residents while we watched the sun come up. Great place to get away from the busy city
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay! Very comfortable, clean, safe, quiet, and it’s two doors down from a yummy bakery! Lots of great extra touches in the loft! I would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The loft is well cleaned and stocked. It has been remodeled recently so everything is new. It is super cute and plenty big for a family of 5. The only thing we had to buy was food to cook. All the kitchen supplies we needed were there. Plenty of bathroom supplies as well. The neighbors we nice and helpful. Also within walking distance of the park. Be sure try the bakery next door on Saturday.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a gem of a place to stay! Charity went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for. The loft was clean, spacious, and well equipped with everything we needed!
We would definitely stay here again if we are in the same area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not too far off the interstate, easy to find, super super clean, and a very comfortable bed. And fresh eggs to boot! Would definitely return."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay at Charity’s loft. It is the best equipped Airbnb I’ve stayed in. She was very quick to respond to questions and has many special touches for her guests. I wanted a comfortable place for my husband and dog to relax while I shopped at the quilt stores In Hamilton and it was perfect. Everyone was happy!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our quick getaway in Stewartsville. The loft was super comfortable and so clean. There were many board games, books and a giant TV to keep you entertained. We will definitely be back again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"EXCEPTIONAL!! Charity's place is so unique, definitely a hidden gem! Beautifully renovated with so many thoughtful little details. We were only there for one night and REALLY wish we could have stayed longer!
10/10 would recommend!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Such a cool little tow, if you like staying off the beaten path then this is the spot! Every amenity you need to enjoy a little get away."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of our favorite airbnb stays ever! We wish we could have stayed longer. The space is beautiful and sparkling clean. The town is quaint and charming. A great place to unplug and unwind. Thanks, Charity for sharing your space and the extra goodies! We’ll be back."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will not be disappointed with staying here. They really made this place super nice and clean to stay in.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charity has gone above and beyond with this rental. Everything was very clean and orderly.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a really cool small town escape, this is the place! It is a brand new loft style apartment on the main level of a historical building. It’s quiet, the bed is very comfy and there is plenty of room to hang out.
Charity is super friendly and a great host. She made sure our stay was great. She also has some good suggestions for things to do in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was beautiful and easy to follow directions from Zion. Really loved the experience
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Airbnb was nothing less than as listed, being a historical home it was a great experience and would recommend to anyone traveling to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent a wonderful night at Zion and Donna’s place. Friendly communication throughout and prompt responses. Great, surprisingly peaceful, location and only a couple blocks from our favorite downtown restaurant. Can’t wait to come back with a group of friends to fill the beds!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zion's property served as our last pilgrimage stop (wife & I, + her two sisters). As Catholics, we visited Benedictines of May - Queen of Apostles abbey located in Gower, MO to view the incorrupted body of Sister Wilhelmina and to experience the beauty and reverence of the abbey. Very rewarding. The property is very conveniently located near downtown St Joseph. You can walk to many great restaurants, shops, coffee shops, and more! It is a large home built in the 1920's as a parsonage. More space than needed for our travel party. The home has so much history and charm; and is furnished as such for the most part. If you are looking for new and modern - this is not the property for you. We however, thoroughly enjoyed it. There will be no sneaking around due to creaky floors, but the wood floors are beautiful. We were very pleased with our stay, and Donna (our host) was very gracious."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Home was beautiful and church was amazing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’re a large family of 9 and needed a place to accommodate us. The photos of this 97 year old home to not do it justice. It was immaculate from top to bottom. The ambiance was peaceful and calm. They even left us a plate of cookies! My normally apathetic teens thought mom hit the jackpot. Everyone had room, space and privacy. I was able to cook meals, do laundry and come and go. I think we turned on the tv once for the toddlers. I should have left behind our pack n play for future guests. Donna was a gem to work with. I would highly recommend this Airbnb. What a great experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful charming home and a wonderful place to stay. The house was very cozy and full of old world charm. Zion, the host was very kind and commicacted well. Looking forward to visiting again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It's a wonderful old house that's been well maintained. Really enjoyed our stay while seeing a concert at the Missouri Theater which is only 4 blocks away.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful and peaceful place to sleep following a late flight. The hosts were very responsive and kind. They left us a delicious cinnamon bread in the morning that my kids loved. The beds were comfortable and the place was very clean. It was a great experience and we would stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This is our groups second stay here, and it does not disappoint. It is a beautiful spacious home close to several restaurants. The house is very clean and nicely decorated. There were lots of extras, and we even had a plate of cookies waiting for us. We greatly enjoyed staying at Zions place and will plan to stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This was such a beautiful historic property. We loved how spacious it was and would highly recommend for families or larger groups.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,good visit nice house
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I stayed at Zion’s place for just one night after we attended a wedding nearby. It was the perfect place to crash after a long day and was so cozy in person- the photos really don’t do it justice. It’s clear that they really love the property and have kept it nicely updated while keeping the original charm. We were happy to see that it was still decked out for Christmas and there were even some treats for us to enjoy. We unexpectedly needed to use the laundry services but it was a breeze and had all we needed. Donna co-hosted and she was very proactive in communicating and ensuring an easy checkin. We cant thank Zion or Donna enough for such a nice weekend and we’d hope they’d have us again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and warm home!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Super cute house with plenty of room for friends and family! Overnight girls get together was perfect!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Had the lights on for us when we arrived and just a beautiful place to stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m so curious about this house! It’s so cool! Well preserved and maintained, super clean and lots of fun exploring. Beds were great, super soft sheets and blankets and perfect pillows. Decorated cute too. Hosts were fantastic, friendly and flexible. I highly recommend this house if you’re in St. Joe!"
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"This was a beautiful, spacious home to share with family!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay, great home and great hosts."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Home was nice and cozy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed overnight on a cross-country road trip. The place is gorgeous and historic and was very clean upon arrival! Check in is super simple and was flexible - we ended up arriving later than planned, but that caused us no issues. Overall our stay was excellent and we wished that we had more time to enjoy the home and the surrounding neighborhood. Thank you for having us!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay at Zion's place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place! We stayed here with 3 kids under 9, and they all loved exploring the house and learning about its history. They particularly enjoyed the backyard, the dining room, the children's sitting area, and looking at the pictures of the original family. The bathrooms are great. Nice neighborhood. We hope to stay here again. Thank you."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a group of 8 (4 couples) staying in this historic home. Plenty of room for us all—lots of spaces to gather as a group. We had a question and our host responded immediately. It was an enjoyable weekend getaway and we would recommend this home to families or friends who are looking for a nice home to gather in St Joe.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We just stayed one night on our way home and arrived late, but they were very easy to deal with and gave clear instructions so we could get in after dark. It was a very comfortable stay. They made sure we had plenty of goodies, including cookies, which were quite a hit, and made us feel right at home. It was a very well-maintained, clean home. If we're in the area, we'll definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful home, pristine very well kept the host was friendly and responsive. We truly enjoyed our stay, and will definitely book again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"St Joe…what an amazing town! The place we stayed was well maintained and very clean. The air conditioner didn’t seem to perform efficiently. It was quite warm in our bedrooms, but thankfully we brought our own fan. Water pressure in the shower was great! Check in was not the best, but we lost the other set of keys somewhere :( it all evened out ;) The cookies were delicious!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were great, even made sure we would have lights on when arriving late and had fresh cookies on the counter for us. If staying here, I’d make sure you have a sound machine if you’re not used to some city noise like myself. Great space for a large group or bigger family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,the house was beautiful. it was clean and the hosts were responsive within minutes. they answered any and all questions I had. We were visiting from out of town so they were flexible with our check in so me and my kids didn't have to wait for hours at the airport until it was ready.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"awesome airbnb!! Clean and very well stocked, even had cookies out for us when we arrived🙂 Also very accommodating, we asked if we could arrive a bit early, and it was no problem! Lots of room for our family of 5, would definitely stay here again🙂"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went on a girls trip to Weston then on to St Joseph. The weather was a bit of an issue with plans we made, so we were at the house more than we planned. Zion made the home so inviting and comfortable that we still had a blast just hanging out and talking. The sun room was perfect for watching DVDs."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very charming home! So much character and history. My family of five truly enjoyed the stay. It was very clean and comfortable, and the host was very responsive in a timely manner. We stayed here en route to Yellowstone/ Glacier and would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Donna and Zion have created a great place for a group to stay in St. Joseph.
Our family was in town for a family wedding and our plans changed multiple times prior to our stay and they pleasantly adapted to our modifications. The additional bed in the first-floor den provided the perfect room for my elderly mom.
They responded promptly and politely to our questions. The check in and check out instructions were a very clear 1 page set of instructions. We will stay here again if we are back in St. Joseph."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very clean!! The beds were very comfy; large dining table for conversation and board games; kitchen had ""fun"" extras; bathrooms were clean; Just a great overall place to stay. Downtown was a very easy walk!! 10+"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Was a great stay! Very walkable to downtown shops.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,thank you for the great stay. it was a great place for our church ladies to stay for our retreat!

This is an old house, but we loved that. The creaky upstairs floors added to the uniqueness of this airbnb. There is a room upstairs with games and DVD's for the kids and we found the dining room table perfect for our Yahtzee game.
The chocolate chip cookies, chocolates, breakfast bars and the coffee and tea selection were unexpected and appreciated.

My kids also loved the puzzles and books found in one of the sitting rooms.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stay here!!! We’ve stayed in a lot of AirBnbs, and this one floats to the top of the list as a favorite. Our accommodations had fallen through in Kansas City, so we had to find something quick! These are the little adventures that make traveling such so memorable. This historic home is 100 years old, but refurbished beautifully down to the last detail. The glass doorknobs, the oak floors. Just gorgeous! It’s also a huge space for families to spread out. We have 4 kids and didn’t even use one of the bedrooms! Donna was so sweet to let us in and show us the closest pizza place, Geneo’s, which was delicious and within a 5 minute walk.
I had no idea there was so much history in this town, but I wish we had a day or 2 to explore the museums and the city. It looks so great! Little gems like this are what make AirBnbs so awesome!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Great host. Loved the layout of this old house and even with one full bathroom 10 of us managed to get ready in time. Grandkids loved having their own room to play and the puzzles in it. I will book it again the next time I'm in town.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Donna met us at the house to give us a key and a thorough tour of the house. This is a great space to accommodate a large group. Our family had plenty of room to spread out. The rooms were good size and the beds were comfortable. Although there was only one full bath, we were able to make it work. Even with all daughters getting ready to attend a wedding! There were plenty of towels, washcloths, and toiletries. The main floor living space was large and comfortable. Plenty of seating in the living room and dining room. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking essentials, and the coffee is provided!! There is a half bath on the main floor as well. Although the house is located in the older part of town, we felt safe walking to nearby amenities. There is a great little market just a few blocks away. We would recommend this place to others and and would likely stay here again, if we are back in the area. It would be a great place to host a family reunion or celebrate a holiday. Thank you Donna for thinking of the little things!"

Side by side refrigerator. Gas stove, did not use. Used microwave to heat water for tea, 2-3x/ day. Stayed 4 nights, 3 days. Visited many museums, saw mighty Missouri River. Highways made it easy to navigate the City .
Great place to visit, lots of 1900 history there. Get a St. Joseph,MO brochure with a map of City, at a Missouri rest area.
Had a electric heater and gas fireplace. Once sun went down, turned on electric heater shaped like a radiator. Kept us warm like 71 degrees.
Thanks Caroline, for a great visit. Lowell & Chery Jones"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoy staying in historical properties. This carriage house was charming and unique. I enjoyed walking around the property imagining what it might have been like a hundred years ago which is a favorite time period for me. It was very peaceful and relaxing.
I heated water for a hot drink, and enjoyed her lovely teapot and beautiful gas stove. Had we stayed longer and made meals for ourselves, we would have had everything we needed.
I appreciated the historical book about St. Joseph. It was very interesting to learn about the historic district, architecture, and fun facts about the city.
Photography is a favorite hobby, and I loved all the photo ops surrounding the carriage house.
I'm grateful this property was available. Thank you Caroline for sharing your home and being very gracious."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,I loved having the kitchen in the Airbnb. Saved me tons on cash on meals. Good place if you need calm surroundings and a place to relax on a work trip.

2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for 2 nights. Location is great next to Krug Park and trails nearby. Did hear quite a lot of honking from cars going through the tunnel leading into the park, but wasn’t too bad. I stayed when it was very hot and the window a/c had a hard time keeping the place cool, especially the bedroom. The place was very clean except for minor cob webs. Kitchen was great and supplies for cooking were provided. Bed was okay; could use updated pillows and comforter. Smelled a little musty inside. Stairs leading up to the carriage could use some lighting and maybe a porch light as it was very dark and sometimes difficult to make my way up the stairs. Overall it’s a good value for the price and host was very kind and clearly communicated."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures on the website matched the place itself, and everything was clean and comfortable! Also a very cool, historic place and town. Caroline put together a neat little book that gave the history of St. Joseph, and places to go. A very enjoyable stay, would definitely recommend!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mrs Caroline was very kind. She let us have our peace and quite but made it clear that she was there for all our needs.
We travel a lot and we stay in a lot of Airbnb’s but we try to at nice and beautiful places at a reasonable price and this was definitely one of those places and if I’m ever in St Joseph’s again I would definitely stay there again!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Spot, quiet"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Carriage house. I was there for a couple of days and unfortunatley was pretty busy while i was there so i did not get to enjoy the grounds much. But the grounds are beautiful and rustic. They extend very far back into the woods and are right next to the historic Krugg park. The place was nice and clean. It is really old so dont expect top tier luxury and a new asthetic. But it is very put together and cozy.
One thing to note which is not a big deal is that the park next door has an ampitheater. During my first night, I was pretty sure some teens were trying to have a rave there. It was noticeable but the house is old and blocks out sound pretty well so it didnt really interupt my sleep but be aware that it is there."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great weekend stay in a historic and peaceful setting. I met Caroline upon arrival and she was so friendly and her instructions were very easy to follow.

Everything was very clean and stocked for our stay; having the extra portable heater in the January cold was so helpful too! Caroline is an excellent communicator and every response was kind and prompt. We would definitely love to stay here again the next time we come to town…thank you so much Caroline for taking such good care of us!

My mom and I had a great time exploring the grounds of the home, and the nearby park. It dipped below freezing at night and the fireplace kept the place warm and cozy. We can't wait to come back in the springtime when things are blooming in the park!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline was extremely accommodating and willing to work with me on last-minute, unexpected changes! It was a pleasure staying at the carriage house and would definitely do it again/recommend the experience to others!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice quiet place to stay. Full fridge and stove, which was helpful because we arrived late and needed to fix something to eat. Just note this is an 1800 carriage house, so yes it is older, but clean and quaint. There are steps up to the apartment. Great communication with host!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and very accommodating hosts. They went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This carriage house is lovely, and the host really great. It's quiet and private in a lovely setting. It was so nice to have a kitchen and a comfortable bed. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed the tucked away remote feeling and the chance to get some fresh air in the garden while able to access conveniences within a couple of miles. Leaving a list of suggested places to eat, get coffee was perfect for us and was very helpful. The host had excellent response time with any correspondence."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a great host. Always available and very nice person
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great location for a weekend stay. Secluded and beautiful. We will definitely stay here again if possible!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, nice and private guesthouse with great AC! I would recommend, way better then a hotel"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very unique place to stay with wonderful host built in the late 1800s surrounded by beautiful gardens. We loved staying there. Fully modern bathroom, full size fridge and stove, small dinning room table, and comfortable couch and bed. Plenty of room for a comfortable extended stay. Be aware there is no TV as well as stairs to climb to get the guest house and there is no central heat and air. Staying in the middle of July ment the window air conditioner unit was a bit loud trying to keep up with the heat. I'm greatfull it was there and considered it a small price to pay for the comfortable and interesting experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house, such a beautiful place to stay while in town. Everything was as advertised, such great hosts. a++++"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet and surrounded by large mature trees on the property.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stunningly beautiful location with a fascinating history. Getting up early and walking the grounds if this amazing estate was one of the highlights of our entire trip. The carriage house itself is lovely and very clean. It was just the escape we needed! Can’t recommend out enough!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline’s space is clean, well stocked, and secluded. It had everything we needed for our stay. The property is beautiful as well - you don’t really feel like you’re in St. Joe."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline's instructions were precise and on point.
The historic carriage house is a unique home. Antique, beautiful, and well-maintained architecture.
The atmosphere is calm and relaxing.
The house is entirely private from the main house. I enjoyed the total privacy.
The drive from the main street to the house is delightful; makes the house feel secluded and a hidden gem in the middle of St Joseph.
Comfortable bed and clean bathroom."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing scenery and ambiance to the property. really enjoyed my stay plan to stay again !
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"We appreciated Caroline's allowing us to check in early, so we had plenty of time to see the Pony Express Museum -- which was outstanding. The cottage is clean and beautifully located, and the description is accurate.
Our one major concern stemmed from a sensitivity to odors that other tenants might not share. The cottage -- because of age and having been closed during the unseasonably hot weather that we experienced -- had a musty smell (like many older houses) that we couldn't shake. The window air conditioning unit helped, and we left the door and windows open until the bugs discovered us."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique place! I enjoyed my experience and will definitely be staying again.
Very clean, organized, simple check in, great communication. Secluded and secure."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous Air BNB on beautiful grounds. Caroline is a wonderful host who helped us so much when we had some problems, she was very responsive to us. I hope to return someday, and I highly recommend the Carriage House Airbnb."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline was a perfect host. The setting was amazing. Made you want to stay for weeks.
This is a special historical place that has everything you need for a comfortable stay."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Caroline was great at communicating and the carriage house was a nice change of pace. Beautiful area wonderful host. Will definitely be staying here again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was by far, one of the coolest Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at. It had so much character and it was super cool learning about all the cool history! Thanks again for all your hospitality, highly recommended."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Carriage House. Caroline and family are great hosts and everything was so clean. The location was perfect for us. Hearing the ducks/geese on the lagoon next door was wonderful and the occasional beep beep as folks drove through the tunnel in the park made it so neat for a former St Joe resident. Thanks.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend staying here. Very comfortable and beautiful place. Caroline was very helpful. Can't wait to stay here again
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely place located on the grounds of a beautiful historic home. The carriage house is spacious, comfortable, well-appointed, and so welcoming. Highly recommend and can't wait to return!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Caroline was a VERY accommodating hostess! There were things we needed/wanted and she provided them. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay in St. Joseph. St. Joseph MO has such a rich history and there are so many historical things to do and learn about the area. Growing up in St. Joe, I was familiar with Krug Park and it holds so many great memories. I never imagined I would get an opportunity to get a more up close experience. If you visit at Christmas time you will be mesmerized by holiday park and enjoy the wonderful grounds for a spring walk or summer picnic or evening of chasing fireflies.
The rental was everything described and the hosts were attentive and courteous to few local products (Shatto milk and Mokaska coffee) for me to try."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend for a cozy getaway!!!
2022-02-01,3,Stayed one night,Beautiful home behind a beautiful home everything was great except for there was no heat a tiny space heater but It didn’t keep the room warm it was about 55° which might be OK for some but my daughter played softball all day so having her muscles clenched up all night after that was pretty rough everything else is great however. Hopefully they can do something about the heat for you future stays brrrr
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful carriage house and property. Loved the fact that there was not a television in the house. Definitely a must stay for guests that love and appreciate the history of cities past.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space, Caroline paid attention to the details and I felt right at home. She was accommodating to my needs and I look forward to staying again in the future."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a delightful place to stay! We stayed in the cold month of January but did not lack for heat. Between the oil heater in the sleeping area and the lovely gas fireplace in the living area, we kept toasty warm. There was also a very high quality air cleaner and a dehumidifier to keep the air just right. The fridge and stove were very nice and amply sized and the original sink with the drainboards were very practical but also a bit plush feeling for an Airbnb rental. We LOVED lookikng out at the huge estate grounds and having a little snowball fight all to ourselves without anyone around. We'd love to return when we have more time, perhaps to work and rest as we work remotely or perhaps just to play. We'd love to come back in the summer too to use the sports options on the estate. The history of the state is somewhat summarized by a fascinating decoupaged door with news clippings and photos from the 1800's and on, detailing the Krug history in St. Joseph.
We highly recommend Caroline's place to anyone coming through town or as a destination in itself! Caroline, by the way, was delightfully helpful yet gave us full privacy and peace. Just felt so at home there.
Try it!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely recommend a winter stay in the lovely carriage house at the Krug estate. Caroline was warm, thoughtful, and considerate, and the carriage house itself was very comfortable and felt safe and private."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't imagine a season where the carriage house wouldn't be a beautiful place to stay, but December was particularly magical. It was cozy, quiet, and festive. Tips for local attractions and restaurants were very helpful. Checking in and out was painless. Don't pass up this gem!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,You will love staying here!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"First off, just the drive up the driveway was awesome. Then to see the huge main house and pull around behind it to get to the cottage was an experience in itself!! It’s such a cool and unique little place to stay. Caroline was very flexible with my schedule and responded very quickly to any questions I had. I’d highly recommend this place and I’ll probably be staying again in the future."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don’t think there is much more I can add to previous reviews. :) The carriage house was a wonderful stay!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as good the second time as the first! Will stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A secluded drive past a couple of pillars and onto a romanesque driveway and you have arrived at the carriage house.
Remember your first apartment? That's how much counter space the kitchen has. But next to it is a gorgeous highly functional stove and refrigerator.
Continue in (watch your step) and a wide open space with very old polished wood floor and furnishings.
Off to the right is a bedroom area with plenty of space and an auxilliary bedroom off to the side.
This was our first visit to St. Joseph and we picked excellent accomodation to augment and wind down a lengthy vacation."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described! Sweet owner with fast friendly communication. This little gem was a peaceful get away.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful atmosphere. Love the location and the grounds.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Carriage House at the Krug Estate was phenomenal. It was beautifully decorated and equipped with everything you’d need for a stay. It also included games and books relevant to the area as decor and we really enjoyed using these. The location was perfect for visiting the town and really taking advantage of visiting Krug Park. The building and surrounding out buildings on the estate made for a gorgeous and serene view. I would highly recommend this place to anyone interested. It gives you a modern experience and modern amenities with all of the beauty of a century ago. A must book!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful place to stay and we will stay again! Highly recommend staying. Would have loved to have had an extra day of just relaxing there. So peaceful!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely grounds- though make sure to turn on the AC in the summer! We didn’t think about it until we were already roasting.

2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The space is very charming and unique. The drive up the to the Main house and carriage house was like you were driving away from civilization and into a stately estate. We didn’t have time to explore the grounds, unfortunately. Our stay was short but the ease of check in was appreciated as we got in after dark."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint plaice to stay not far from Krug Park and museums. Caroline was very responsive as well. Thanks!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With so many descriptive reviews already posted, I'm not sure there is much for me to add, except to confirm that the accommodations and amenities are exactly as described. Whether you're there to work or vacation, there's plenty of space and comfortable furniture to spread out or cuddle up. My boyfriend and I had to work part of the time, so we did both, and were very comfortable!
Caroline is very friendly and helpful, a wonderful hostess! Even with Covid social restrictions in place, she still managed to make us feel welcome and comfortable."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is so so beautiful! The grounds are beautiful to walk around, especially with everything blooming in spring when we were there. Caroline was responsive, and very descriptive on the location and accessibilities."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very adorable get away. This private nook gives a relaxing and comfortable stay surrounded by lush grounds and historic buildings. We made sure the back door was locked and the air conditioning was on - it was really humid when we visited. We had no noise pollution. There is a pubic park nearby that people were being loud at, but the landscaping provided a visual barrier and we couldn’t hear the park noise once we were inside. We wish we could have stayed longer. Definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! I would recommend it!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was absolutely wonderful. The property is beautiful.

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quaint little getaway."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is wonderful!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW - this place is simply amazing! The inside is impeccably clean and very stylish - seemingly from another century - comfortable, and spacious. All the amenities including a gorgeous shower; but what really floored me were the surrounding grounds - so lush with trees and gardens, filled with the serenade of crickets, dotted with historic buildings and sculptures... I could happily live there! The hosts are very friendly and helpful too. Finally, it's right next to a large, historic city park just waiting to be explored, and all the info you need is in a nice little binder when you arrive."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous little gem, attention to details made our stay cozy and welcoming. Hosts were quick to respond to questions and we couldn't have been happier."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Carriage House has a lot of charm and nostalgia. Having Krug Park next door makes for a great way to enjoy the outside. Caroline is great communicator and hostess.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for 4 nights and the entire stay was wonderful! The host was fantastic. She even contacted us to let us know our interior light in our car had been left on and offered to shut it off for us. The place is very quaint and the history surrounding the estate and the park was quite fun to discover. We had such a lovely time we plan to make it an annual trip. Oh and the wifi is amazing!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy bed! Love the beautiful wood floors! My husband wanted to take the swivel chair home!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline has a special place on an old estate with this historical carriage house. We had a great stay and would visit again. Comfortable, clean, and a good stop in St. Joseph."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and beautiful place to relax and explore. Unique place to space.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Caroline's place is more spacious and beautiful than the pictures let on. The Carriage House is very roomy, comfortable, and quiet. I wish I could have stayed longer. The views from the Carriage House windows of the 19th century mansion and the garden like grounds are just magnificent. Historic Krug Park is literally on the other side of the fence. It was easy to get to downtown St. Jo, and Caroline has conveniently placed info and pamphlets on places to go for food, drink, shopping, and sightseeing. I recommend River Bluff Brewing for a craft beer and retro pinball, and Jake's Steakhouse for a good meal and live music. The Pony Express Museum is a must see, as is the Jesse James House."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was very quaint and comfortable. The grounds were amazingly beautiful! Good value as well!
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The host and her family were great. For anyone who doesn’t get up early, though, there are children playing somewhat early. Also, it almost feels like you’re in the country, which is great, but be prepared for lots of bugs - at least in summer. The area is very green and pretty. The house is small, but I had everything that I needed, except Internet got interrupted a few times. Also, for deliveries, it’s hard for anyone to find. Last, you will have to park on a steep hill with lots of trees around (bird poop). But, overall, it was a pleasant place to stay."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Another amazing stay!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I love staying in the Carriage House! It is a perfect escape for me to get lots of paper work done or a great book read!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice space adjacent to a beautiful park! Very private yet easy access to restaurants, hiking/running trails and park."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy upstairs Carriage House. It is an older place as the name implies. Modern amenities you need. Bathroom is small - again it is a carriage house attached to an old estate. That is what was fun about it. Good amenities. Comfortable bed. Lots tucked into a small space. Great promotional materials. The family is updating their whole space which takes time. Good historic feel.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. We loved having our own little space. It was a great hideaway. Very cute little B&B. The fireplace was great too!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A spacious two-bedroom carriage house on the North end of town.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you appreciate something different than a ho-hum hotel stay. This is your spot in a very historic setting and town. We will be back!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean peaceful area. Will love to stay again for sure.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was unique, clean, and in a great location. Caroline was very attentive in keeping us up-to-date with weather conditions as we arrived on a day with winter conditions. The bed was comfortable and check-in was a breeze. The fireplace was probably our favorite part. We would definitely come back!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful, historical and comfortable place to stay. Caroline was a very gracious host providing all the amenities we could possibly expect and responding promptly to our reservation request. We enjoyed being adjacent to and being able to see Krug Park."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an extremely wonderful place just for the fact that right night door it had a light display for Christmas at the Park. Everything was accommodating, hospitable, and more than was we had anticipated."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The carriage house is so charming and in a great location. I love that it’s a historic building and next to Krug Park- especially great in the winter with the holiday lights. The local wine and coffee were thoughtful touches. We actually missed the first night of our stay due to car troubles and Caroline was kind about refunding a portion of the total. Would stay again!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great private Carriage House adjacent to the historic Krug Mansion. Spacious and quiet and clean. We enjoyed the nice touches , especially the warm gas stove for a cozy winter night."

To walk the grounds is also a special thing to do. Caroline provided several pamphlets on things to do and place to go and eat. She has thought of everything."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely LOVED staying here. Its so unique and the grounds are so beautiful. I really enjoyed the special touches I saw upon arrival - some wine, chocolate, and a note to let Caroline know if I needed help with the fireplace.
The antique decor is charming and will take you back in time, but with all the modern comforts you are used to.

There are horses in the pasture up on the hill, so majestic to wake up and look out the kitchen window and see them.
The grounds are beautiful. There are plenty of areas to walk and take in nature. Birding is also a great activity so bring your binoculars!
St. Joe is an interesting town with museums and a lot of history, but you won't want to leave the farm!

The hot tub is amazing and all of the animals and nature are awesome as well. always clean and such a beautiful little farm house. We cannot recommend her place enough. 5 stars but if we could give it 10 or 20 we would.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruby’s carriage house was exactly what we needed. We were looking for a quiet peaceful getaway and the carriage house is just that. Ruby went above and beyond in helping us when a little situation occurred. We would recommend the carriage house to anyone and we will most definitely be back for another stay at some point!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second stay. I brought my grandson and my daughter this time. We love Ruby's Farm. She is such a fantastic and thoughtful host. It is truly like a home away from home. Very clean, everything you need. The sweetest people and we love the farm and animals. Thank you Ruby!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruby is the definition of an exceptional host! She is warm, welcoming and responsive.

Our family especially enjoyed watching and getting to know all of Ruby's critters!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ruby’s farm was a dream for my little family. She and her Great Pyrenees Della are in a league of their own as Superhosts. The space was comfy, quiet and super clean. If you have a little one, this place can’t be missed. Fun was had and the best memories were made - looking forward to the next visit of this charming farm."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at Ruby’s was PHENOMENAL! She is such a kind person and she was extremely hospitable. Her property is beautiful and very cozy.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous time…this space was private and let us totally unplug. Loved that we could walk the property and connect with nature. We loved watching and interacting with the animals. Me and my bestie will be back for sure. Thank you Ruby for offering your space. ❤️
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome. Peaceful getaway. Great place to watch a football game under the stars in the hotub. This place is 10 stars out of 5.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! Thanks, Ruby. Mickey and I really enjoy visiting the Carriage House. I think it was our third trip. We love having the chickens, goats, ducks, pigs, the dogs, and the horses around. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the bed couldn't have been more comfortable. The hot tub was remarkable! We hope to be back soon,"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby was everything anyone could need in a host. She was so hospitable in every way you could imagine. Her home is beautiful and was perfect for a quiet get away on our 5 year anniversary. The animals were the best touch and the whole property has a lot to offer. Overall we would give Ruby a 6 out of 5 stars for exceeding our expectations.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Found the cottage house to be very neat, clean, and tidy. Walking paths and trails were easy to hike and scenic. The cake take we ordered was very good. One of the best triple chocolate cakes that we have ever had. Had a very wonderful time!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's beautiful carriage house was serine and peaceful to stay in. The animals were a blast to be able to pet and feed. The views were gorgeous! We ordered a delicious cake from her sister and it did not disappoint! The house was very comfy and cozy and made us feel right at home. I loved waking up to the roosters and all of the animals each morning! We already can't wait to go back and enjoy another stay!
Thank you 💛"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A relaxing stay at Ruby's Carriage House! It was an easy drive from Kansas City with a stop off at Atchison, KS for lunch. Ruby had suggestions for restaurants in the area but we had taken food which we popped in the oven. There was an antique store close where we found a couple of treasurers. Was celebrating a birthday so ordered one of the tasty cakes - you won't be sorry. Be ready to enjoy the farm animals. Just a note, the bedroom and bathroom are upstairs (this is noted in the description). The Spa/Hot tub area is located a short walk up the drive. While there, take a hike. Lovely woods. I think it would be amazing in the Fall. Thanks Ruby for your hospitality."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy atmosphere, reminded us of Pride & Prejudice!😍"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruby was a phenomenal host. She went above and beyond to make me and my 6 year old daughter very comfortable. The place was very clean, interesting, and had so many amenities. I would definitely without a doubt stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely a fantastic place to get away! Was a awesome place to watch all the different animals interact and strive. Also asked for a carrot cake and with out a doubt it was the hands down best carrot cake We ever had!! We will return.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's home was very cute and cozy, and she went out of her way in many ways to make us welcome, from her great communication to letting my family meet her many adorable farm animals. She was the perfect host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby was a fantastic host who went above and beyond. Upon arrival you are met with a friendly fluffy dog who comes and greets you. Ruby also made us cinnamon rolls and I cannot stress this enough! They are the best I’ve ever had. I would highly recommend requesting a dessert from Ruby!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruby is a great host friendly and attentive ..but gives you privacy. Great little peaceful getaway
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second trip to Ruby's. We visited last year and had such a wonderful time, we wanted to come back. We have two young boys who absolutely loved the animals and my 5 year old also loved the trail to explore. Although we were busy parenting, I love the added workout room and hot tub. Ruby is super friendly and pleasant, VERY responsive, and will do what it takes to make you feel at home and have what you need. This is the second summer we also leaned on her for babysitter recommendations and coordination, so we could have an adult night out with friends. We definitely have Ruby's place as one of our favorites to visit and look forward to a future trip. You can't beat it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked for my fiancés birthday, and it was perfect! So peaceful and private!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruby’s property is beautiful and peaceful. Ruby was helpful and friendly!! We enjoyed the hot tub, nature/farm animals, and the air bnb space ♥️ I would recommend Ruby’s air bnb and would love to go back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a must visit Airbnb. Your front yard is the barn. There are ducks, chickens, and all kinds of animals. The hiking is the best part though. Isaiah’s waterfall is a beautiful spot and on a hot summer it is a perfect place to cool off. On top of all that there is a hot tub that is huge and it has a tv right beside it so you can chill after a long day in the woods and watch your favorite show. 10/10 would Recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was a very peaceful & relaxing place to stay. We enjoyed having the animals nearby. Ruby & her family were very nice.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! Would stay here again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Ruby’s place! She was so kind and easy to work with. Would recommend to anyone!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great little getaway from visiting with family. this was our first time in Missouri and loved being able to stay in such a beautiful place. Our daughter enjoyed getting to meet all the animals and spend time watching everyone. The space itself was perfect for what we needed, as we only stayed one night. We ordered a cake that was absolutely phenomenal, the chocolate covered strawberries were a big hit! Games stocked in the living room helped us pass the time and we even watched a little bit of Disney+ in the morning. Inside the house you could hear the dogs and rooster but they're not loud enough to become annoying or keep anyone awake. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby went out of her way to make us feel welcome and at home from the moment we arrived and went above and beyond to remedy a small hiccup with the A/C units. We had a wonderful stay and definitely will return again in the future. I *highly* recommend ordering one the cakes. We got a Black Forest cake custom made and it is quite possibly the best cake/dessert we ever tasted. The farm and jacuzzi and spa on site make it a very relaxing and fun experience. Thank you for everything!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful getaway. The carriage house is adorable and comfortable. We loved meeting all of the farm family and taking a great hike through the woods. Ruby is so friendly and made us feel right at home and my nine-year-old granddaughter became instant friends with Ruby’s daughter. We will definitely visit again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We decided to take a spur of the moment trip for the weekend and we found Ruby’s little gem luckily! What a time! Great location, Ruby is very friendly and knowledgeable along with being very accommodating with reservation issues. The pool and cute farm dogs were a highlight as well as getting a tour of the grounds from Ruby.
We will be back for sure!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Ruby was so helpful and kind. Her home was so relaxing and peaceful and we had the best night of rest and relaxation there. Highly recommend booking here! Ruby was the best host as well.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Ruby’s place for our short vacation to Saint Joseph, Mo! Her cottage was cozy, comfortable, and provided all the amenities we needed for our stay. As true “midwestern-nice” introverts, we were a bit nervous that our presence would be intrusive with the host’s personal home being so close to the cottage. However, the cottage was secluded enough to feel private and comfortable. Our host was attentive to our needs and provided great recommendations. We loved waking up to ducks and chickens in the yard, and being able to snuggle a very sweet doodle dog every day. The hike to the waterfall is a must!! The homestead offers much to explore, and we wished we would have asked about the pillars and stonewalls that align the front of the house. I’m confident the history behind those is very interesting!
We can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Carriage House was such a joy - a perfect little getaway. Highly recommend the mini hike to the waterfall, requesting a cake, and spending time in the spa. Peaceful and recharging!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a welcoming and cozy place to visit! My son wanted a farm stay and appreciated the opportunity to help with chores. The cake we ordered was impressively decorated and quite delicious! Ruby is a great host :)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby was GREAT. She made sure everything was ready. The atmosphere was amazing. She was very responsive of my request. I'll be back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at. My friends and I wished we could stay longer! Hopefully we can come next time and stay longer. It was very comfortable and we felt safe there. Ruby is a wonderful host and communicated with us about how to get to her house. Loved our stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can't say enough good things about our stay! The bed was comfortable, there were plenty of amenities to make it feel like home, the trail was incredibly fun, the animals were friendly, and we had a great time chatting with Ruby and her family. We opted for the hot tub and did NOT regret it. Ruby showed our boys how to feed the animals, gave suggestions for local things to do, and was always quick to respond to any messages. We can't wait to go back :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ruby's place is more beautiful in person than what the pictures can show! Ruby works hard to make the carriage house welcoming, comfortable, and very clean for her guests and it shows in all the little details. You get to feel what it is like to be on a small farm complete with baby goats, chickens, horses, friendly dogs, and even a pig. Having lived on a farm, I appreciated all the care and hard work that Ruby puts in each day to caring for her animals as well as the guests that she welcomes onto her home. Thank you so much, Ruby, for offering a rural paradise oasis to us for a day."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super amazing, five star, country getaway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby is an amazing host. From my first inquiry through to the end of the stay she was helpful and responsive. The house comfortable and clean and exactly as described and as was represented in the pics. The farm itself is beautiful and peaceful and filled with lots animals to keep the kids occupied and happy. It’s a great place and will definitely stay there again. Great for kids and/or adults.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect rural getaway in a lovely setting with a quaintly decorated cottage. Animals were a fun addition! Very friendly host and accommodating. Would absolutely recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite Airbnbs so far! The baby goats right outside the stay and a nice little walk behind the houses. That swim spa was super clean and relaxing especially at night while looking up at the stars. We also had the privilege of meeting Ruby and had a little chat, she's super helpful!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay. We really enjoyed our time here and would love to come back sometime. It was fun to see all the animals and the waterfall was beautiful.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rubys place was such a peaceful escape from the city. Our experience was great. Place is legit, has everything you’ll need.
Loved it and we will b back!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our third time coming to Ruby's place, and Everytime she goes above and beyond. We can't wait until our next trip."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our favorite place to stay yet. Everything was beautiful and peaceful, Ruby was kind and knowledgeable of the land history. A wonderful host and stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Would definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Makes you feel instantly welcomed. Wish could have stayed longer. First place ever to have blankets avail in the closet!! 6 stars
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We picked Ruby's place to celebrate our 50th anniversary and had a great time. I wish we had taken more time to visit with Ruby and her family. She is a joy! She answered any questions immediately. Her recommendations for grocery store, restaurant and sights were spot on. The apple pie that was waiting for us was out of this world good!! The carriage house was clean, and so well stocked.,. probably the best that we've ever had. The hot tub was so nice after a day of traveling and sightseeing. The weather was not the best, but we plan to go back when it's warmer so we can find the waterfall and do some exploring. I would definitely recommend Ruby's place."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Secluded location away from busy city to escape the noise. Quiet and peaceful stay, even with the animals right outside! Would recommend to anyone coming to the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed everything about this stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay has been so nice - it was like a wonderland driving onto the beautiful property and being greeted by the most adorable dogs and farm animals. We are from the city so don’t get to see all this cuteness up close. Ruby was very communicative and we found it easy to find the place and check in was a breeze. The home was very comfortable and clean. We wish we had longer to stay because she has the best variety of books - we could stay just to read through them! There was nothing that we missed or felt like we forgot because this air bnb has everything we needed. Thanks!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We are absolutely in LOVE with this air bnb! Photos are really accurate and the nature is so charming! Ruby was responsive and I loved all the details (including the cake!). We will be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby is a spectacular host and very accommodating in ways that made our stay one we want to repeat.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely fantastic stay at Ruby's place. We were looking for a place off the beaten path for a relaxing, peaceful get-away without our kids and Ruby's place delivered. The carriage house was the perfect size and is super clean and cozy. Sitting in the hot tub under the stars at night was one of the highlights. Ruby is a fantastic host. She is responsive to messages, and so friendly and helpful. We would definitely return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice escape into private property. Calming being close to all of Ruby’s animals and quiet land. Kitchen was well equipped and the home had everything we needed. Thank you Ruby!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Myself, and three young sons stayed in the cottage house for a few days over Spring break. The four of us love hiking and exploring so Ruby’s farm, trails, and woodland area was great! My three minis loved the barnyard area, animals, and pastures. We also had some leisurely swim time in the outdoor heated swim spa. I recommend Ruby’s place if you’re looking to unplug, and unwind! Thanks, Ruby!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful location and very peaceful, wonderful stay! The animals were all super cute and well behaved, which was a nice treat on our stay! Everything indoors was clean. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a little dinner and tidy up afterwards!
The walking paths were gorgeous and easy to follow—very much worth taking advantage of if you stay here. The property is gorgeous in general! We were also able to use the hot tub which was an amazing experience. The stars were clear, and everything was clean, well functioning, and very worth it :) there were even robes available for use.
Ruby was extremely responsive to any questions or needs we came across. Extremely friendly and helpful with regard to making recommendations nearby. Overall an absolutely amazing stay! Highly recommend, and would definitely stay again!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place for a personal retreat, or like what we enjoyed- a father/son getaway. Plenty of trails to “get lost” on, but the farm animals always called you home when you weren’t quite sure which direction you were going :) The workout room was on point, and the hot tub was a perfect way to end each day."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful spot. We loved our stay. Cutest animals, nicest family, amazing amenities & the perfect trail for walking! The place was very homey & very comfortable. We loved it. Perfect private getaway. Will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ruby's. We were specifically looking for a place with a hot tub and this fit the bill perfectly! I don't think we could have asked for a better setup! It was a short walk from the carriage house, but nothing too difficult (it was even icy when we went). She also allows you access to the yoga studio that we only used to dry off, but it was nice to get out of the freezing rain when doing so. You are near a highway, but traffic dies down quite a bit when it gets dark...we didn't even notice it after awhile. We'd definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely spot for a relaxing getaway. The carriage house is quaint and charming. I loved my walk to the waterfall and the fitness center was an added bonus. I had everything I needed to rest and recharge.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great place very beautiful and clean had a good time with peace and quite.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed this low key & homey gem! Great for a quiet getaway! We felt right at home in this charming carriage house & loved the property & animals. Not far from places to eat & things to do! We stayed here for our visit to Snow Creek (about 20 mins away) and will definitely book again in the future!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's place is just as described. She makes sure you have everything you need and is super nice and informative. If you want to shop or find a place to eat she has suggestions for you. My sister, niece and I stayed 2 nights for a girls weekend and it was so relaxing. We had everything we needed and then some. I had a great night's sleep on a super comfortable mattress. Great Coffee/Tea bar. And all we had to bring in the kitchen was food. We went hiking and found the MUST SEE waterfall. It was all iced over and so beautiful. The animals were a lot of fun too. And the workout room and swim spa were awesome. We are all talking about going back. Ruby is a super host!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here one night on a long journey between Florida and South Dakota. This place was so peaceful, perfectly clean, and Ruby fed me both dinner and breakfast. She’s an awesome host and chef. The horse, the dog and all the chickens make a great welcome committee! I highly recommend this place. 🙏🏽🎉"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Me and my husband had an AMAZING time. Ruby was so thoughtful and caring to our needs. Helped us find breakfast places, good restaurants etc. The house was clean, smelled so good, the bathtub water was so nice and hot. Would recommend it and plan on going again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby’s place was just as beautiful as it looked online. The animals were adorable, the carriage house was filled with everything you could possibly need. We enjoyed a buckeye cake from her pastry chef sister. We enjoyed going to Westin which is nearby where there were lots of cute bars and antique shops. 10 out of 10 would recommend and hope to go again in the warmer months."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Wilver Dell Farm! Really enjoyed the trails on the property that led down to the creek. Beautiful place and comfy carriage house.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little getaway weekend, lovely shopping and dining nearby. The animals were all friendly and Ruby gave me an apple for Percy!! 🤩 I definitely want to return later when the weather is warmer to explore the trails and find the waterfall."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our peaceful stay at Ruby’s. The view of the farm was pleasant, the walks in the woods restful, and the house arranged in a very comfortable and livable way. The hot tub was a treat! It was great to get away from the noise of town and the stress of daily life at this peaceful farm house, and super fun to see how they had organized the space of the Carriage House. I hope to be back some time."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ruby’s place was a wonderful treat. A tranquil and relaxing setting. Wonderful woods and beautiful sunsets.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I loved this place! It was a great getaway. The house was adorable and the animals were really cool. The hot tub is pretty far from the house, so not super practical in winter months. We had a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby’s place was beautiful and very cozy I would love to visit it again and for longer!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great trip at Ruby’s we cannot wait to go back
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t wait to come back! Love staying here.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love staying here. Can’t wait to come back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We LOVED staying at the Carriage House! Unfortunately we only stayed for one night, but it was so worth it! The house is so cozy and has everything you could possibly need. The property is beautiful and peaceful, and the animals are amazing. We are excited to visit again! Definitely suggest taking a hike to the waterfall no matter the season!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn't believe we were staying in such a beautiful place for the price. The animals were gorgeous, from the roosters to Stella the big white fluffy dog. The entire home is decorated with books and knickknacks that give you a glimse into the hosts spectacular personality. The host was cheerful and friendly, busy doing farmwork as we packed our truck to get back on the road. We wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This rental was exactly what my family and I were looking for. We wanted peace and quiet. We wanted nature and to disconnect from the outside world. We put down our phones and just enjoyed life.
The animals there were great, very friendly. My daughter who wants to be a veterinarian was in heaven. She was invited one morning to feed the animals, she couldnt have had a better trip.
The amenities were great, hot tub and work out facility were all utilized.
The host, Ruby was nothing but exemplary. Very responsive to all my questions in a timely manner and was very accommodating.
all in all we had an amazing time. Would definitely go again which im positive we will and would highly recommend this beautiful AirBnB."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s very peaceful. Ruby has a beautiful carriage home and she had lots of extra touches such as a flashlight by the door, candles and lighters, a Brita water pitcher in the fridge, extra blankets, and lots of books. I liked having such a large house with several places to work and play, a desk, a romantic table for two, the living room with a comfortable couch.
We loved the beautiful animals. It was fun to watch them in their home whether it was the sleeping pot bellied pig - they make the most interesting snoring noises!, the chickens wandering around and taking dust baths or the roosters crowing, the ducks shaking their tail feathers. We got lucky and were able to watch the horse roll around nearly upside down and then snake himself off. The dogs are beautiful and so loving. The cats are fun to pet. I really enjoyed my little spot in the universe seeing them all in theirs and knowing they are well cared for and loved.
Ruby has an amazing house and it is all a breath of fresh air."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful. You have all the amenities you need in the house, which is adorable, spacious, homey and clean. But the true showstopper is the property. Such a cute barnyard with friendly animals. A property with an amazing history. And hiking trails that lead to two different waterfalls. We were accompanied on our hike by the resident dog and cat. 😂 I highly recommend the fitness studio and hot tub. Ruby was so friendly. I can’t wait to go back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very sweet animals in a very relaxing environment
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, and it was just what i was looking for. So refreshing and restorative for my soul—pastures, animals, wooded hikes, plus a super comfortable place to stay and curl up with a book.
Ruby is such a fun, hard-working person and responds quickly if anything comes up. I utilized the exercise room and LOVED it too… the hot tub under the stars was awesome.
I was concerned about possible noise, as I’m a light sleeper, but I really didn’t hear much (with the sound machine like i use at home, too) and it wasn’t a big deal. There was a night that Ruby had brought two new calves that were kinda unhappy about being separated from their moms, and their mooing was loud. But, it didn’t bother me much, and kinda added to the experience (and plus i think it was an exception as they will be put out to pasture normally).
The only problem is that now i want to move to the country. Haha.
I will definitely be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house at Ruby’s is the perfect serene getaway in the hills, with all of the comforts necessary to effortlessly enjoy your peace. Sitting outside my first morning for breakfast, I was joined by the most hospitable grey cat, a symphony of roosters & hens, & a collection of horses, dogs, ducks & a leisurely pig. Day two brought the rain, & with the heater up & movies streaming, it was all the cozy vibes.
Ruby is so very kind, & was wonderfully helpful with any questions—from nearby grocery stores to how to keep the house warm when the weather turned. I absolutely recommend a stay at Ruby’s, & look forward to a return visit should I pass through again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The amenities are immense. Love the soft sheets and WIFI connection was very fast. Anything I needed, I found. It was like you thought of everything. The grounds and trail were breathtaking."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was probably my favorite AirBNB that I've stayed at so far! Loved being around the horses, chickens, and the pig. The dogs and barn cats were super sweet and friendly. Ruby was an excellent, communicative host that made us very comfortable during our stay. I can't think of a single negative thing to say. The trails nearby are beautiful as well."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's carriage house is a charming, clean, well-kept-up slice of farm life, petting zoo, hiking trails, yoga/exercise studio and gourmet restaurant all rolled up in one! My friend and I spent 2 very relaxing days there recently. The farm animals were friendly and very comfortable around the 2 of us. Ruby, the hostess and owner, is fun and friendly, and very ready to share the interesting information about the historic property and home that she and her family live in, and the carriage house we were in. Ruby is also a master chef! We had her outstanding Indian meal option for dinner one night, delivered to us by her very gracious husband and adorable young daughter. Ruby brought over a delicious breakfast frittata and fruit for breakfast the next day. Service with a smile, both times. Lovely hosts and really great hospitality. Great coffee/tea bar. The bathroom has a great shower/tub stocked with shampoos and body wash and bubble bath. The hiking trails were lovely, especially with the fall colors, though due to drought, we were only able to see a trickle at the waterfall.
Our only complaint was that although the queen sized bed in the bedroom was very comfortable, the two alternate sleeping accommodations were not! One was a very hard twin sized futon and the other was a blow up mattress that lost air throughout the night, resulting in one of us tossing and turning half the night and not getting a good night's sleep. So, if there are only two people in your party, we'd suggest sleeping together in the bed. We'd also recommend bringing along ear plugs (we had a heads up to do so from someone who'd stayed there previously) because those very handsome roosters start crowing quite early!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby goes above and beyond for her guest! Her kindness is felt, and she made us a delicious anniversary cake!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ruby is a wonderful host. The farm is real and working so expect animal noises and activity. But it’s worth the stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Just a few minutes from town and trails to walk, animals to love on."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay, the home is beautiful, the trails are great, and Ruby is really kind and helpful! Would love to come again!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Ruby’s sweet farm. The house was cozy and well stocked! The bed was very comfortable. We were in town for a wedding at Matthews Century Farm and this was the ideal location!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rubys place was adorable and super clean lots of books everything that it said it was. I would recommend her place to anyone.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ruby is the best host! She makes you feel so at home and my family was so grateful for the peaceful space. We will definitely be returning!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to relax!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely time on Ruby's farm! The accommodations were excellent, her advice on walking trails and places to watch the sunset were great, and we had a blast seeing all the animals going about their day. My wife and I can't wait to come back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful. Excellent book selection, very tastefully decorated, and so comfortable. The animals were great! My daughter loved seeing the little horse! Will be coming back for a longer stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, enjoyable Carriage house and working farm! Location as described in listing. Ruby very friendly and helpful. Would stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to get away from home, relax and recharge. Ruby was wonderful and the carriage house was a perfect place to get away."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, definitely worth if you are passing through Kansas City / St Joseph area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful getaway. Ruby has a beautiful property. Really enjoyed hiking around her property and seeing the waterfall, rock bridge, and the animals. Felt extremely comfortable staying here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay if you're looking for a country getaway!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm heartbroken we were only there for 2 nights! We were just in town for the weekend for a wedding and we were so busy running around we didn't get nearly enough time to explore and enjoy this beautiful little home. So sweet, so quaint and comfy. I love the reclaimed doors and all the hidden bonuses (there's a cabinet full of games). Beautiful little kitchen I would have loved to use with plenty of dishware, coffee pods ready to go, and we very much appreciated the ice in the freezer and Brita pitcher in the fridge. Lovely shower gels and plenty of towels, the tub is a little small but still comfy for a bath and the shower has a range of good pressures with different settings (depending on what you prefer from hard to gentle but consistent). There's even a washer and dryer, this little place is literally a full home that I could have happily stayed in for a week or longer!
We did hear the animals, the chickens (crowing roosters) and ducks (chatting in honks as they waddle along) wander through the yard, but I heard them more from the bathroom and they didn't bother me from the bedroom. We met two cats who were very friendly once they knew we wanted to say hi and give them pets.
GO SLOW on the driveway because the birds and cats might be out there! Use g.maps or something to give you directions because it is out in the country and would have been easy to drive past without g.maps tracking/directing us.
Ruby was super on top of communication and her little carriage house is a wonderful little home away from home.
My co-adventurer said ""a great, relaxing little haven in our travels."""
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby has a little piece of paradise. If you like being in the country, close to animals, away from the city traffic, this is the place for you. Everything you could need is available in the carriage house. We very much enjoyed our stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruby's place was really cute! I loved the walking trails and waking up to the rooster!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sheer perfection!! My husband and I absolutely loved Ruby's Carriage House with our two sons; 4 and 8 months. We are from the suburbs of Chicago and it was just the change of scenery we needed for our vacation. We enjoy all of the farm animals, and my son absolutely loved greeting Percy, the horse, each morning and before bedtime. He's still talking about him too. We didn't have the best weather and had to compete with rain and clouds the majority of our visit, so we enjoyed going downtown to Kansas City one day to Science City and then enjoyed picking peaches and blackberries at the Weston Orchard. If you are going to Weston, we fell in love with the BBQ at Tin Kitchen and highly recommend it.
If you're looking to go into town in St. Joseph, it's the most beautiful drive through the country and not that bad of a drive. The house is very well-equipped with everything and anything you will need. I feel that Ruby has been thoughtful in thinking through the little details. It was our first experience with Airbnb and we realized also how beneficial having a washer and dryer on vacation with little kids...that was a life saver! If you're staying at Ruby's we highly recommend getting something delicious to enjoy. Although she wasn't catering the week we were there, she still supplied us with delicious cinnamon rolls and a wonderful cake that was divine. We can't wait to return for her other meals. We had such a positive experience that my husband and I have already talked if we take a kid free weekend in the fall in the future to enjoy ourselves and when our next trip back will be. Ruby's place will be #1 on our list. We also shared our positive experience with others we know in St. Joseph and they were intrigued to even consider a weekend getaway locally too. We can't say enough good things about Ruby's and highly recommend you do yourself a favor and check it out if you're considering it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing weekend at the carriage house. We scheduled meals and a cake ahead of time with Ruby and everything was so healthy, wholesome and wonderful! The cake wasn’t healthy - lol, but it was the most perfect y cake I have been had in my life! We enjoyed the animals, the grounds, a hike, feeding Percy apples and getting to know him ❤️ the stars on a clear night are spectacular! The carriage house is well equipped, clean and cozy. We enjoyed reading together and playing cards. Such a wonderful place to get away from the city to relax and unwind. Ruby was the most amazing host and everyone, including all of the animals were so friendly and loving! We want to go back in a cooler season. ❤️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is cool and cosy. A full kitchen is available. At night you can see the stars clearly. Next to the cottage is a small working farm. Dogs,cats, chickens, roosters and a pony plus bats and fireflies at night. A perfect escape from the city. I highly recommend. And St Joe is only eight minutes away."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruby is the most wonderful host! She made us feel right at home.
The horses were amazing as well as the expansive property with many fun surprises!
We hope to return just as soon as we can! My daughter is 8 and she still, hours later now, has not stopped talking about it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely adorable. Both Ruby and the lovely animals made us feel very welcome. It was clean, homey, and made for the perfect honeymoon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely, very welcoming and comfortable little house, with everything in good working order. Super clean, lots of neat little personal touches. The property was peaceful and fun. We could barely hear the roosters from the bedroom, it seemed quiet to us all night. We knew that the host Ruby was on site but we never actually saw her (our choice.) She responded right away to questions and was very helpful."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place! Wonderfully quiet time on the farm.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience and peaceful setting! The house was clean and exactly like it was described. Would definitely recommend!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely place to stay with such peace and kindness. It was so helpful for my soul.
I will say please read the description for the sound. It is a small working farm and with that comes sounds. There is a sound machine in the bedroom that was helpful.
It was a nice place to rest and if you are a runner a nearby dirt road offers some challenging hills.
The kitchen is well equipped with pans and even a blender that works fabulously. The porch is shaded for the first part of the day, allowing for an easy rising with a lovely cup of coffee or tea."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean, comfortable and well stocked! The bathroom is upstairs, as is the bedroom. The stairs turn at the top and the railing doesn't start until the 6th step from the top. I learned the hard way on the slippery wood steps not to do it in socks. Ruby is very good at communicating in timely fashion. We were prepared for roosters and farm noises, but the dogs barked all night, and are close by, in the pen. We had ear plugs and used the white noise machine (which is a thoughtful touch!) but we didn't sleep well and ended up leaving a day early so we could get a good night's sleep before going back to work. If you can sleep though barking you'll be fine. We didn't see any goats and only saw one horse and the pig, lots of chickens and the dogs. The animals we saw are friendly and fun to visit. Parking is close and entry is easy. It's a very nice place to stay! Ruby recommended we visit the town of Weston, which we did, and enjoyed it very much! There are a lot of cool historical things to do nearby."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic getaway. The Carriage House is the perfect place for a vacationing couple who would prefer something off the beaten path. It's wonderfully comfortable and just the right size. Having chickens wandering around crowing is a benefit! And of course there's the pony and pig to feed some apples and carrots to. I can't recommend the Carriage House enough. Ruby and her husband are a delight.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an exceptional experience during our short family trip. Our 5 year old loved seeing and interacting with the horses, pig, chickens, ducks, turkeys, cats and dogs. The Carriage House was perfect for our stay with our 2 children (5 and 1). It is very well maintained, clean, and comfortable. Ruby's hospitality was beyond expectations. The location is a short drive from easy trails for kids to walk in addition to a very short walk to a little waterfall on a creek and plenty of room to roam in the fields. I would recommend this rental to anyone! Note: this a farm with a lot of grass. There are bugs! But, wearing the provided bug spray, we had no problems."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ruby was extremely helpful and has just a beautiful spot in the country, felt right at home!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second time staying here because I absolutely love it! I hope to be back for a third visit!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was more of a business trip for me, but was hoping to enjoy some country living. Unfortunately, I got food poisoning (not from here), and had to stay put for our stay. Ruby went out of her way to help us so I could be ready for my work event. The carriage house had all we needed and more. The property is a real working farm so there is some animal noises, but we got used to the roosters and barking dogs quicker than we thought. We wished we had time to take in the whole property, but that will be for another visit."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hidden little gem! Be aware that you will hear their farm dog barking to keep away anything that may try to get close to the chickens and other fan animals at night, but she is the sweetest thing ever."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and awesome accommodations. Conveniently located to a number of communities and activities. Ruby is such a friendly host and made sure our stay was fun and comfortable. Had a great time and hope to return someday.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loves staying at Ruby’s and hanging out on her farm. She is very accommodating and welcoming. She truly makes you feel at home. And all of the animals are so friendly! This was our second time there, and we’ll be back again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely stay. So glad our friends recommended it to us. We'll definitely be suggesting it to more friends. It was the perfect short getaway for our family of four. Our toddler loved meeting all the animals. We enjoyed the easy hike to the waterfall. Ruby was super accomodating and cooked us a delicious dinner. Homemade pasta, what a treat! The location was quiet and peaceful and a great jumping off point for day trips to St. Joseph and Weston. We wouldn't hesitate to book again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay. Wonderful, relaxing as usual. Ruby is a fabulous host, very accommodating. The farm is beautiful, the animals friendly. Definitely going back. This place is comfortable and safe. I would feel very safe traveling there alone. Perfect for a retreat and getting your mind calm."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint country home nestled in the rolling hills near Weston and Saint Joseph. Everything we needed was available. Horses and active roosters added to the country charm. Enjoyed exploring the property and the hiking trails behind the home.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If I had more start to rate I would give more. Ruby is the nicest person I have ever booked with. She makes you feel at home. This place is amazing. Recommend 1000%
Thank you again Ruby ❤️"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby’s place was exactly what my husband and I need for a quick weekend get away. The animals are amazing and roaming around, the hiking trail was great and she made us dinner our first night there that was very delicious. If you’re looking to get out of town and detach from your phone and computer, I highly recommend this place."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Hidden Gem!! Historic farmhouse on a 40 acre farm surrounded by nature and farm animals!! Ruby was great with communication and everything was perfect for stay!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time and Ruby could not have been more gracious! This farm is steeped in history and a magical place. We’ll be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotlessly clean, tidy, and comfortable. A fantastic place to get away for a few days. The barnyard animals were delightful. I will miss hearing roosters crowing outside my windows tonight! Highly recommended place to stay."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and lovely property for a peaceful get away! Close and convenient to st. Joseph and the host is very responsive and kind!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying and we had a wonderful time! It is our favorite get away!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is AMAZING! It was the perfect weekend vacation ...but we could have stayed longer for sure! The food was great with hotel like service. My littles throughly enjoyed the animals and getting out of city life for a little bit. We will be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby is an amazing host! Her property is beautiful and her attention to detail is impeccable. Everything I needed, she provided. I loved playing with the farm animals and walking the beautiful trails. I highly recommend staying at her AirBnB, you won’t regret it!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was super clean and cute! The farm animals were delightful and the dogs and goats greeted our car with great joy. Ruby was super easy to get ahold of and really accommodating, even when we had to leave early. 12/10 wonderful stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful! So peaceful, relaxing. Pet the animals, walk in the woods, watch the birds and just breathe! The place is so comfortable and Ruby has everything you need. Just a short drive to town for seeing the sights. Museums, history, cemeteries. The Missouri river and it's history are very close. Lewis and Clark history and early fur trapper trade in the US was a hub in St. Joe.
Love Love Love this place, going back soon! Already booked! Highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Animals were super fun and the waterfall was a nice walk.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here. A beautiful place with a lot of character! The sweetest animals and Ruby was awesome!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristen was sweet and responsive. We appreciated the stay. Roomy & cozy. Very cute inside.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I was there for a long term project. It was nice to come back and relax in a quiet little park
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun, cheap, and easy. Would love to revisit!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a very pleasant stay. close to where we were going and several great places to eat.
very responsive when I had a question.
I would highly recommend this airbnb."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a good stay!
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen was a great host. A few things about the unit. The odor hit me in the face when I walked in and permeated the entire place. It was not a bad smell, but so overwhelming, I wanted to wash all the towels and bedding. I was sure it was a plug -in of some sort, but never found one. It may have been the Gaine detergent but was so overwhelming that after a while, it was sickening. Took out the trash after a couple days and NO more trash bags for kitchen. I had asked ahead of time if there was a washer and dryer. There was, but the washer did not work. After several attempts to use the drain and spin cycle, I had to ring all the clothes out by hand. Finally went to the laundry mat and that cost about $15. I rented the unit for 2 adults for 6 nights. We found 1 wash cloth and had to put it on the shower floor to keep from slipping. No local TV, could not get weather for traveling or watch the Chief's game. And the sheets were polyester. I prefer cotton."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i didn’t know it was in a trailer park but the neighbors were very nice and i saw a kitty!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Rented this place for my elderly parents and their dog. It was handicapped assessable which was nice. Host even brought a shower chair. We didn’t realize it was a trailer park. No true yard, neighbors dog’s poop all over and, when leashed, on a long leash that extends into the “yard” of this rental. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone with dogs.
Overall very quiet and cute, clean interior. Served the purpose of the stay. Just not convenient overall with an animal."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and a super friendly host! I would definitely recommend it!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and a great value. Will definitely stay again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nicely decorated and felt very homey. Perfect size for our family. Everyone loved it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kristen is a great host. when she had blocked dates from another reservation, she went out of her way to accommodate us at another one of her properties."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristen has been an amazing host. The place was completely spotless and very well organized. Right when you walk in you feeI at home. If you needed something, she already has it. We brought our two dogs with us, and they also loved how spacious everything was and to have access to a yard while on vacation. The location was nice as well being so close to restaurants and tons of beautiful St. Joseph homes. We would love to stay again on another trip!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristen's rental was extremely clean and had everything I needed and more. Kristen was very helpful and very quick to respond to all of my questions. She was a great host.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristen is super sweet. This place is so cute! She has a great sense of style. The place is comfy and very well stocked. She had pretty much everything you need. Beds were very comfortable. The area is nice and seemed quiet. Very happy with our stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristen’s place was a nice and close to everything I needed in St. Joe. I enjoyed being able to walk out the front door and go for a run around the hospital or Missouri Western University. The space was comfortable and Kristen included lots of extra items that made it feel like home. She was responsive and easy to communicate with. Will stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen was beyond nice and quickly responds. The house was easy to find, quiet, and close to some really good restaurants. We travel all over the world, and I can honestly say that the beds were by far the most comfortable place I have ever laid down other than my own bed. Everything was clean, well organized, properly stocked, and it was just an overall comfortable place to be. We will definitely stay at this place again without hesitation. I highly recommend this place to anyone needing to stay in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,My husband and I stayed here for 3 months while I worked at the hospital down the road. It was perfect! It was super close to the hospital and everything else. We felt like we were home and had everything we needed for our long term stay. Kristen was very responsive and went above and beyond to get us what we needed. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay if you need a nice clean place for a great deal!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristen is a wonderful host. She’s new to this and wants everything to be great for her guests. She achieved that with great decor and amenities. Highly recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much better than staying at a hotel. Nice, quiet & clean location made our stay very pleasant."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Kristen promptly responds to concerns and the place is a nice spot to stay
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome place to stay! Really enjoyed our time while down from NY. A lot of things to do in the area very close to the Airbnb. Kristen was so nice and kept amazing communication with us. I will be back here when I come back to town.
