2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked this spot for a quick overnight while doing a road trip and it was perfect. Loved the porch for coffee in the morning. The apartment was very clean and the kitchen was decently stocked. Loved the area and all of the trees in the neighborhood. Would recommend for sure!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great stay at BJ‚Äôs place. It was in a great location, brightly lit, and close to many restaurants and stores. The space was clean and spacious, would recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! I would highly recommend staying at BJ‚Äôs. Outstanding location (a few minutes to the Truckee Main Street and very close to beautiful hiking‚Ä¶and, of course, Lake Tahoe). The place is really nicely appointed, so you‚Äôll feel right at home. Enjoy your stay :-)"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the first time I rented an air b&b - was a little nervous but the air b&b was perfect! So happy that it matched the picture! Very clean and comfortable! It was located in a very beautiful and safe area! Felt very safe staying there by my self!
The one thing I would recommend is that the heat be turned on before the guest arrive - I checked in at 1 am and the temp was at 50 degrees - it was very cold ü•∂
Apart from that I would definitely rent this air b&b the next time I am in California!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We‚Äôve stayed multiples times and it is always consistently great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bj's place was the perfect HQ for skiing at Palisades. It is inside a neighborhood, so very quiet. It had all the amenities one could need/want for a ski trip for two."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"met all our needs , was great for a ski trip ."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for my 9 year old and I for a couple of days skiing. We love Truckee and the location was perfect. Bed was super comfortable too. The one thing keeping this from being a 5 star review were the overhead lights made me feel like I was under fluorescent lighting. Wish the light bulbs were warmer instead of cold white.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here felt so comfortable, thoughtful, and cozy! The bed was very comfortable and the layers of fleece and comforter kept us warm. The fireplace got the room toasty quickly and we enjoyed some board games as well. The shower was amazing - hot water immediately and the water pressure is perfect.
My partner and I both agree this is one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed in. We would definitely book this place again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has everything you need! The unit was well furnished and had a large patio. Full size range, microwave, and fridge! Bj helped us out when our rental car‚Äôs battery died, he is awesome. This place is a gem for couples looking to ski Palisades!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,second time staying - this place is so perfect for 2 people. just the right size and nothing missed on interior design or on tech. just right!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay here. It‚Äôs a perfect little getaway. We had a little ski/snowboarding trip and just the location was wonderful. Close to everything. Definitely would love to stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"excellent little spot, exactly as described."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb is a great option in Truckee. It's about 1 mile from the nearest restaurant/brewery (Fifty Fifty - with killer dark beers in particular) - so walkable-ish, but certainly close to town and Northstar if you're here to ski.
The unit was pristinely clean and comfortable and attractive. It is small, but more than enough for a couple. The bed was very comfortable, but the sheets are a terrycloth material that while very warm, may or may not be to everyone's liking.
Shower has good water pressure and get plenty hot enough quickly.
We cook several meals in during our vacations. The kitchen is equipped with what looked like bran- new Cuisinart nonstick cookware. Be aware however it is not stocked with certain basics you'll want if you're gonna cook much such as cooking oil, tin foil or ziplock bags, or more than a handful of coffee filters.
all in all, this is a fantastic option for a stay in the North Tahoe area - highly recommend"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you BJ! It was a great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed here for an extended ski weekend and had a great time. The location is very close to downtown Truckee, and the space itself was very clean. I think it was honestly one of the nicest Airbnbs I've stayed in the Tahoe area!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is great - description and photos are spot on. Perfect space for 1 or 2 people. Super spacious and extremely centrally located.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place for a few days around Tahoe. Easy access to all Tahoe has to offer, skiing, hiking and the lake! Super nice, respectful and helpful host. Will come back again!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place and super close to the ski resorts. Only comment was the night we stayed the shower couldn‚Äôt get any hotter than luke warm. This was a bummer because there is nothing better than a nice hot shower after skiing all day. I mentioned this to the owner so hopefully they will get it fixed for the next guest. I still gave her a good rating since the place was still clean and check in was seamless. Would stay here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bj's place was super easy to find and conveniently located near town to grab food, groceries, and gas. I just stayed overnight after a quick trip to Boreal for the weekend and it was great. Super clean and the space was perfect for 2. Solid stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a well equipped, clean upstairs apartment just a couple miles from historic downtown Truckee. Good for one or two people. Note, if you have heavy bags, there quite a few steps up to the front door. My timing wasn't ideal as my arrival was in the middle of a heat wave. I opened all the windows and used the fan provided to cool the apartment off."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay in Truckee! Bj's spot was convenient to activities we'd planned for Lake Tahoe. We loved walking to a neighborhood restaurant for dinner, too. The space was clean, quiet, and just what we'd hoped for. Highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a wedding! Really pleasant apartment in beautiful surroundings! Within easy driving/biking distance or semi-ambitious walking distance to all that downtown Truckee has to offer. The front porch is such a nice feature for getting a bit of fresh air. Blinds on all the windows were perfect for that necessary nap between the ceremony and reception! Also appreciate separate thermostats for living room versus bedroom. Water heater was good quality: can withstand a back-to-back shower and bath.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was extremely clean except some dirty dishes. It's a fantastic place to stay for couples! The balcony is amazing as long as it's not too cold! It's also very private and peaceful, with pretty surroundings. There's a grocery store really close by if you're planning on cooking. Definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Within manageable driving distance of Tahoe. Comfortable and clean with a great outdoor awning. Good space to cook. Enjoyed the rustic yet homey vibes of the space and the area, versus the artificial feeling of a place like South Lake Tahoe. Also saw a bear walk through the neighborhood, but it didn‚Äôt cause problems. Was fun. One of the best overall Airbnb experiences thus far."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fully stocked kitchen. They provided coffee. The bed linens were high quality and the bed was nice and firm. Great shower head. The deck would have been great to hang out on but it was a little cold during our visit.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a beautiful little gem! My first time in Truckee and I scoured Airbnb locations for days! I finally chose BJ‚Äôs place, and boy did I get lucky! Amazing location, beautiful outdoor deck where we enjoyed our morning coffee. Just so peaceful and exactly what I needed for a two day escape! The house is located on the second floor, with privacy. The house was beautiful and spotless and very spacious for a one bedroom. BJ was responsive yet let us have our privacy for our time there. I‚Äôm a seasoned Airbnb host myself and I actually took some pointers after staying in this beautiful home! Thank you BJ, I will be back soon!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very cozy and clean. The host was very responsive and friendly. Great location to Truckee and ski options. Due to road closures we were unable to get there on our scheduled day and he was very accommodating.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We made a very quick decision to stay here for one night when 80 closed during the snowstorms. Her place is close to Truckee and the freeway and it felt better than driving back to Tahoe City where we still had our original place for a day. We were very grateful to find this spot. BJ was communicative and they plowed the driveway for our arrival. That said, they did not let us use their somewhat covered driveway and insisted we park where our car got covered with snow overnight and took a long time to clean in the morning. We had a baby with us and were stuck in a storm of the century and they showed no grace in a more extended checkout time (no one was getting anywhere) either. Also their bedroom was frigid. She claimed it never happens. They have three fans but no space heater. Her suggestion was turn up the fireplace and direct fans at the room. we had to put blankets on our infant and stay up all night making sure she didn‚Äôt suffocate. There is also no dishwasher."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, great location near Northstar & downtown Truckee. Located in a quieter than expected neighborhood. Was great for a dad/son mid-week ski getaway!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! I would definitely stay here again. The bed is really firm, which I don‚Äôt mind, but some people might. Great, cute place and the heating works really well!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, traffic to Northstar was insane. 1 hour drive for 4 miles. Place was clean and cozy. Perfect for 2. If you have a big car parking is a little tricky."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bj‚Äôs place was great - clean, spacious and cozy with a very well stocked kitchen. Bj was fast to respond and helped us out by letting us book and check in within a few hours when we had a last minute cancellation with our original booking. We would definitely stay here again!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was very comfortable for our visit. I don't remember seeing on the listing that there is a very step set of stairs to access the home. This wasn't a problem for us but it could be for some folks. The home is conveniently located about a 5 min drive from a very nice hiking trail. There is a Safeway close to the house and the kitchen is well equipped so you can make your own meals. We were allowed a late check out which was really helpful.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place really embodies the Truckee atmosphere and vibe. We enjoyed relaxing and eating on the large deck as well as the clean and spacious interior. There were two of us and couldn‚Äôt have picked a better spot. Super clean and enjoyable. It was the highlight of our vacation in Truckee.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for Truckee. It's only about 2 miles to the main part of town, where all the shops and restaurants are. And there's a Tesla Super Charging station right down the road, which is super convenient. It's also only about 15 minutes from the Ritz-Carlton, if you happen to be in town for a wedding there, which I was. The apartment is clean and comfortable. The deck is nice, but there is a surprising number of cars driving by, so it's not the quietest place to relax. Would definitely stay here again if I have to come back to Truckee/North Lake Tahoe."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and layout for visiting family in Truckee. Friendly hosts and quiet space.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for having us! It was a beautiful clean place, definitely felt cozy the moment we arrived! Will book for future stays!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Bj's place was a delight. I enjoyed the relaxed neighborhood location close to great hiking trails and to town.
There are a couple of restaurants in walking distance but the kitchen is also very well-equipped, so is the rest of the apartment. The large balcony sure is cool and the sofa is nice to enjoy the first and last sun beams.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Eric's place was perfect for my week long solo snowboarding trip in Tahoe. The place was clean and updated and has all the essentials. Tahoe Donner was closed so the area was very quiet and peaceful, and it was very easy to get to Palisades. Eric was also very responsive and generous, even offered to let me check in a day earlier for free (I wish I could!) I would 100% come back!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,On the ski hill.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for your ski trip as a couple or family with small kids.
Just enough kitchen to cook what you need but my only issue was the lack of microwavable dishes and mugs.
Otherwise it had everything we needed and was very clean and comfortable. A short walk to ski lodge and a great location to take a break for lunch or nap with younger kids learning to ski at Tahoe donner.
Short drive into Truckee for restaurants and summer activities as well."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything that other reviews described. Is perfect for beginner skiing at Tahoe Donner. My visit was 2 nights on the 3rd floor. Title says condos, but it‚Äôs more like a studio apartment/hotel building with multiple units.
Here are a list of my pros and cons:
Pro‚Äôs
Nice view of lift
Competitive pricing
Quiet/warm/comfy (we stayed tues/weds)
Exit stairway made shorter access to lifts.
Kitchen: Hotplate, pan utensils, dish soap, replacement trash bags.
No weird smells, very clean!
Bathroom towels and bed sheets smelled very clean; huge square shower-head; hot/icy showers!
Comfy memory foam queen bed, feather down pillows but there are regular pillows in closet
Blackout drapes
Ice machine
Cons
No one at reception desk (although host Eric was very responsive)
GPS leaves you on the road, had trouble finding the lodge.
Grocery store is about 11 mins away
Toilet flushing weak, at one point had to plunge and refrain from flushing TP
Previous guests left food in freezer"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Eric made check in so easy. The condo is perfect for 2. The view from the condo is beautiful.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This condo is at walkable distance from ski lifts. Condo building has a small area where you can relax. There is a place to keep your ski overnight so that you don't have to keep either in your car or inside the room.
This place is ideal for 2 people. Sofa bed can accommodate may be an adult and a small child. 4 adults is bit of stretch."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great studio! thanks
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Eric! We really enjoyed staying at your place. Eric is a very friendly and thoughtful owner."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was very clean and bigger than I expected for two people! The host was very friendly/responsive and made great recommendations for places to eat! The view was amazing and the location was a short drive to stores, restaurants, and gas stations. He even has guest passes to a rec center that had nice amenities for a discounted price. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice getaway!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Right next the Tahoe-Donner lift.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Eric was great with his communication. The place was clean and for those who love skiing/snowboarding, the location is perfect! It's right by the base of the Tahoe Donner ski resort.
The room is great for 2 or max 3 people. We had a 2 night stay, and 3 of us - so it was quick but at the same time - comfortable. There's a fridge, microwave and a coffee -maker (make sure you carry your own coffee and filters) and a sink. Although there are lots of pots and pans - you can't cook anything as there is no cooking range or a hot plate for cooking.
The bathroom was clean, had good products. The bathtub is slightly tall to get in for short people (like me :) Plenty of towels, blankets and bedsheets and pillows.
We went here in winter - so there is a space heater and wall heater - not too sure if there is an air conditioner as well.
Overall a great find for a quick short stay!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quick stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric was prompt to respond & provided clear check-in information. I had a beautiful & relaxing time there. I liked that I was able to prepare my own meals, rather than going out to restaurants. I enjoyed the view from the floor to ceiling windows/balcony. It was a relaxing time but I'm sure it'll be a prime spot during ski season."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sweet condo right at the ski resort would be perfect in the winter time to do some skiing/snowboarding
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric's AirBnB was great! Check-in was very straightforward, and the accommodations were very modern and clean. The location is about a 8-10min drive off of I80, and there are many parts of Truckee and Tahoe that are easily accessible from the AirBnB."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about the place exceeded our expectations. The room was exceptionally clean and smelt fresh when we walked in. We enjoyed our stay, thanks you Eric!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric was a fantastic host! We ran into some issues with noise due to construction and Eric quickly solved it by speaking with the workers over the phone. Beautiful airbnb with a great view! One thing I would like to mention is that the TV has all main streaming platforms which wasn‚Äôt listed in the amenities, a nice surprise when we arrived."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, cleaner than most AirBnbs I have stayed in which is really nice. Very nice bathroom and kitchen amenities. Bed is comfy"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great studio condo in a small complex with lots of parking. We went in July and were about to visit an aerial tram and the lake within a day since it‚Äôs so central. It‚Äôs at the base of a ski slope too, which is probably pretty sweet during the winter."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Eric‚Äôs place was great and I would definitely stay here again. He was very responsive when I had questions and the soaking tub was amazing after long days hiking the nearby trails.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy check-in. Place was clean and Eric gave clear information with regards to the apartment.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, only heat was small electric heater"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very beautiful, modern, and clean. Location is very close to Tahoe donner downhill ski resort, but it was closed when we were there. Eric was very generous and gave us a free night because he had a personal situation and wasn‚Äôt able to be responsive during our stay. He communicated well and reassured us the place would be easy to find and check in and it was indeed. We would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband stayed on his own for the weekend and loved it! Eric was responsive and helpful.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eric‚Äôs place is right off the lift and would be a perfect place for anyone skiing there. We used it for a night to extend our ski weekend and found it comfortable for that.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, perfect for two people. The place was very clean and comfortable."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Eric‚Äôs condo! It was a great location for a weekend filled with skiing and snow shoeing. The place itself was super cute, clean, and quiet. Eric was also very responsive, and we appreciated his proactive communication when we had a question. Overall, we felt very comfy and at home for our night away, and would definitely stay there again in the future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Eric's place is wonderfully located at the base of Tahoe Donner Ski Resort. No need to take the car to get to the lift in the morning. Eric's flat has recently been remodeled and is very clean. I had not properly noted down the wifi password and Eric was immediately available to help us out with the correct one. Great place, great host and we had a wonderful week-end."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for a playing-hooky-from-work-and-school ski trip. There was one clear day between storms and we were able to drive up the night before, get a good night's rest and be the first people in line at the lifts. It's a stone's throw to the resort lodge.
Eric was awesome. We had actually booked with him the week before and he proactively reached out and had us check the weather and worked with us. All his directions and tips were super easy to follow. What a great spot!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place to stay, and a beautiful location. The place was very clean and nice, with comfortable furniture and nice kitchen with everything you need."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I ended up having to cancel my stay with Eric, due to inclement weather, but he was extremely responsive and great to work with throughout."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the location and community atmosphere! Only downside was there was no coffee. And if you need coffee in the AM, you know what this is like! So pick some grounds up on the way in. Other than that, my daughter and I loved the spot and will definitely be back with the rest of our family. Thanks, Eric!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eric was very communicative and the condo was very clean. Loved our stay!

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Eric's response to my inquiries was quick and good. The place was quiet and peaceful with a great view from the room that was perfect for working remotely for a few weeks. Excellent location to get on decent mountain bike trails without driving around. I would come back next summer!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,couldn't get better. we hope to come back soon.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Great location close to Donner. The unit is small and in so-so condition. For summer stays, there is no AC and no screens on the porch and given the location by a creek, you need to choose between mosquitos or being hot."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Decent location at the base of Tahoe donner ski hill. Eric‚Äôs communication and response time were fantastic. Wifi was a bit rough, it cut in and out. That may be outside of Eric‚Äôs control as it may be the condo buildings instead of his personal hardware."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,best value we could find in Truckee
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wowie! What a nice place!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed and worked from here for a couple weeks - the place is nice, clean, and as described. The Wi-Fi is good enough for stable video calls and the desk is nice for working on a laptop. Communication is good and check-in was easy. The view from the balcony is excellent. Though this won't be the case all year around, there was a glacial melt creek flowing just outside and audible from the studio which was nice."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and clean as described. Wonderful view from inside the room.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and comfortable home. Plenty of space and amenities. Would definitely stay here again. We especially appreciated the app for the garage door and the setup in the garage for getting ski gear on.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We were 4 adults and 3 kids (5-8yo). This place was perfect for our group, and we had an excellent stay - great location, great layout, very comfortable home. Enjoyed the days skiing or exploring the area, evenings in Truckee or just cooking at home. We had some minor issues during our stay, but Aaron was super easy to work with it to get those resolved. Would def stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time staying here. It‚Äôs close to town and ski resorts, with plenty of rooms in a modern mountain vibe if you‚Äôre looking to have a group ski together. We would come back in the future!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay at the Powhaus. It was easy to find and easy to get in, the mobile app for the garage door was great. I enjoyed the fact that the garage was tall enough to fit my SUV with my Yakima roof rack on top. The place was very clean, and well designed, with a nice open living room and kitchen, great for hanging out with friends and family. The house was not too far from downtown Truckee, walkable for sure in the summer, but probably best to drive during the winter. The master bathroom had a wonderful soaking tub, perfect for after skiing. Easy to get to Northstar, which is where we skied this visit. Would come again!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Aaron was very communicative and easy to coordinate with. Check in was easy and the place was modern and well equipped. Also great location, very close to downtown truckee. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Aaron was a great host and always very responsive. The house itself is beautiful, well appointed, and very comfortable. There was plenty of space for our party of five.
The only downside for winter is that the location is a little further from downtown Truckee than we thought - probably quite walkable in spring or summer, but in the cold and dark of winter, walking home up the hill would not be fun.
I would definitely return and recommend Aaron and his property."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was just as described/pictured. Check-in and check-out were both very easy and smooth. Aaron is a very communicative host. 10/10 would stay here again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had a great weekend with my children at this Airbnb in Truckee. The property was exactly as described, stylish, spotlessly clean, and conveniently located just a 3-minute drive from the supermarket. What truly made our stay exceptional was the incredibly comfortable beds ‚Äì the best we've ever slept in during our Airbnb experiences. The host's attention to detail and comfort really stood out. I definitely will return.
Five stars all the wayüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very comfortable and great location. We really enjoyed our stay.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aaron‚Äôs place was everything I expected from previous reviews and fellow superhost! Clean, new and a kitchen that makes it feel so easy combined with clear communication. Loved sitting on the back deck in the evening in the grove of trees. Easy drive in with the garage and a location that is close to the main drag. We will return on our next stay in Truckee!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great spot - we stayed for a month and look forward to coming back.

The place is everything we look for, clean, modern, great location, garage (able to charge our car), and friendly and responsive host :) We've stayed once in the summer (6 of us) and now a winter trip and it is a fantastic location for anytime of the year. There are great restaurants in downtown Truckee (walking distance when weather permits) and also a very short drive to Northstar and other resorts. It is spacious enough for our family of 4 or 6 (when grandparents joined). I also like the layout of the kids room with the bunk beds being downstairs and the kitchen and master bedroom upstairs. We look forward to staying again soon!!!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What else can I say about the PowHaus that hasn‚Äôt been said?? My husband and I took our 4 & 2 yr old to Tahoe for 4 days/3 nights after two years of no vacays due to the pandemic. The PowHaus was one of the best decisions for our trip as it provided more than what we needed for our enjoyment with small children. After a full day of ski lessons, we were more than happy to come back to the Airbnb for home cooked meals. Everything was convenient and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more comfortable stay. We‚Äôll be in touch for our next trip! Thanks Aaron!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As AirBnb hosts we can appreciate the work that goes into making a house great. The Powhaus was great. If you‚Äôre looking at it, look no further. They thought of all the details and it was excellent in all aspects."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Palisades PowHaus was AMAZING to say the least. Aaron's home is thoughtfully designed and carefully curated for all travelers. First off all the home is almost brand new, in the guest book we only saw a few entries before us. Secondly, the place was SPARKLING clean - My friend and I are complete OCD Clean freaks and we didn't even feel the need to double clean when we arrived! We were 2 families traveling together with 3 kids (under 5) and we had a ton of fun and wished we had booked more nights. The home is equipped with all the latest technology and Aaron sends a full e-handbook about the home and location before your trip so you know what to expect. My fave is there is a thermostat for both the first and second floors so you can control the temp wherever you are. We spent time playing in the side-yard area where there was plenty of snow for the kids to enjoy. Many other resorts are and sledding areas are close by within 30minutes of driving as well. We happened to meet a few neighbors in the small townhome community and everyone was wonderful and kind to us as well. There are a few board games in the closet, the TV is equipped with all major video apps + surround sound for movie nights, and kitchen had everything we needed to cook multiple delicious meals and the dining table sat all of us and more. The master bath is to DIE for - the design in the home is so beautiful and modern. Shampoo, Conditioner, body wash, and lotion were all provided in small personal bottles like a hotel. Aaron was also super responsive and helpful throughout our stay and we had absolutely no issues at all. We will DEFINITELY be returning for another trip in the near future. Thank you so much Aaron!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location close to North Star and Squaw. The house is fantastic and set up beautifully with a fully stocked kitchen. Everything was nicely thought out. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay at PowHaus! Aaron's place was beautiful with many amenities including a few necessities in the fridge and bathrooms.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed with this stay. The location, the quality of the house, the communication with Aaron, all top notch. I highly recommend staying here. We will be back!!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay here. Townhome is clean, comfortable and had everything we needed.

Thank you Aaron!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Aaron is a wonderful host, if you‚Äôre looking to stay in Truckee look no further!

Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Aaron's place is one of the best. It has everything you need. Perfect for a group of four or five. I like the stylish design and extremely clean rooms. Highly recommended.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We‚Äôve rented and ski leased in North Tahoe for ten years. Aaron‚Äôs place is fantastic. It‚Äôs perfect for a family of four or five, or two families with smaller children. There was plenty of space for our two teenagers, each with their own bathrooms and we loved the master bed and bath suite. The place is modern, stylish, comfortable and clean. Aaron‚Äôs communications were prompt and accurate. We will book Aaron‚Äôs place again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect Truckee / Tahoe experience!! We had the best time in this incredible home and unbelievable location. Aaron‚Äôs house is so tastefully done - feels/looks fresh in every corner & incredibly clean. We didn‚Äôt want to leave.
We picked it for its quick access to all the ski resorts (which was amazing), but realized another star of the show is Truckee itself, and loved how we could walk down to town - please check out Moody‚Äôs for drinks / dinner!
Aaron‚Äôs townhouse is in a very beautiful (seemingly brand new) small collection of homes and the drive was plowed & the surroundings are beautiful - remote feeling yet close to town.
We are particularly picky on beds, and the POW HAUS didn‚Äôt disappoint - we slept great! Also loved the very well appointed kitchen & wonderfully helpful guidebook + the smart tech making check in & out a breeze.
This house is as comfortable/cozy as it is instgram-amable/stylish - highly recommend it for a group of friends or a family. Don‚Äôt‚Äô miss the awesome deck & BBQ!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aarons home was so thoughtfully decorated to have a mountain modern but still cozy cabin feel! It‚Äôs spacious not only in the rooms but has a beautiful family table to play games and eat around which is ideal for any family trip.
The location is easy to get to resorts in North Lake and it‚Äôs walkable! There is a paved path that takes you right from the condo to the truckee river path and to a path to get downtown. There was snow but it was plowed which was a huge bonus. I cannot wait to come back during summer to rude our bikes!
Communication was great, kitchen has everything needed and the beds were comfortable. I travel a lot and would highly recommend this place.
Oh and I can‚Äôt forget my favorite part of the entire place... there was a really cool neon sign in the garage that says ‚ÄúPOW HAUS‚Äù above the ski rack. Perfect Instagram for my ski trip if I‚Äôm being honest!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible place in Tahoe!
Amazing location and incredible vibe in this ski house. Super close to the resorts and an easy walk to central Truckee. Highly responsive host and the welcome packet was very helpful. Getting in and out of the garage with the app is also very easy and convenient. Would highly recommend this spot and I look forward to staying again in the future."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Cozy, thoughtful accommodations, new and clean, great location. Hope to stay there again in the future."
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Aaron's space was one of our favorite Airbnb's ever! Close enough to walk to downtown (which is basically impossible in Truckee) and 15 minutes from 3 of the best ski resorts. The space itself was stylishly modern without losing that cabin/Tahoe feel, and the kitchen had everything we needed to make our meals at home. A really special place - we will definitely be back!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time at Palisades PowHaus. The location is ideal for both frequent Tahoe travelers and visitors from afar since it's really easy to get to off the highway and its close proximity to all that Tahoe has to offer: top notch ski resorts, downtown Truckee, hiking trails, parks, golf courses, and more. The check-in process was seamless and Aaron is very responsive and communicative, though we didn't really have to contact him as everything worked great!
The house itself is even better than the photos! Plenty of room for a large group or family but still feels cozy enough that it give you an authentic Tahoe cabin feel. It felt much more like a home than your typical Airbnb listing with comfortable furnishing and all the modern amenities you would want. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you need since we cooked all our meals during our stay there. The garage can fit two cars and has an outlet for EV charging and space to store your gear. All the bedrooms have large windows and a lot of privacy with views into the woods. There's also a generous amount of outdoor space with room to grill and hang out.
If you're looking at this listing and thinking about booking, rest assured you'll make the right decision! It was one of the best weekends I've had in a while!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was worth every penny. Aaron was super responsive to all questions and his description was 100% accurate. I‚Äôd highly recommend his place to anyone looking in Truckee.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine's place is a beautiful little escape. We love it up in Truckee, with the small town atmosphere, the river natural surrounding is a wonderful place to visit. The Bike house is perfectly located for a little get-a-way, My wife was 32 weeks pregnant and was able to walk to downtown where all the shops, and restaurants are. The place is very well maintained and clean. it would be 5 stars if not for the sleeping situation. Its a pull out couch that is not comfortable. There is a loft with 2 twin mattress that are adequate however as mentioned my pregnant wife didn't like going down the ladder at 3am to pee. Once again Great Place just needs a better mattress for the pullout"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine's place is lovely and comfortable. We enjoyed the view of the river, the simplicity and cleanliness, the wonderful shower and comfortable beds. Old downtown Truckee is within walking distance and access to I-80 is easy. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another wonderful stay on the river! Comfortable and convenient little gem!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christine‚Äôs place was cozy and comfortable! I went t for two nights with a friend. It was girls weekend and we had fun. Loved the patio as well. Thanks for a wonderful stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay in this lovely space and it will now be my go to spot in Truckee. During this stay I slept in the upstairs loft and the bed was very comfortable. I prefer it over the pull out bed only because it allowed for more space in the living room. I had a friend with me during this stay it was nice to sit on the sofa during the day and look out at the beautiful view. I highly recommend this place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This time I brought my twins along. I had a little hesitation as to whether the space was large enough for three. The studio does have enough beds, but I wondered how we‚Äôd fare with the small kitchen. Happy to report that it worked out great! We had a wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was pretty nice. It had beautiful views and was what we expected. The kitchen was well stocked with nice little extras.
Unfortunately, for us, there were some cleanliness issues in the bathroom. The worst was the moldy shower curtain, top of the tub and hairs on the shower walls. I have a mold sensitivity, and thankfully I didn't become ill. The floors were also cold accept near the bathroom. Guessing all the cracks in the floor is a sign the floor heating needs repair? The place was warm overall though.
The check out instructions were contradictory between the book vs wall sign. The book was more lax, but the wall sign gave instructions to basically clean the place. We were expected to remove bedding and towels and put them in a pile, take out trash/recycling and open all windows. Worst of all was the expectation for us to wash our dishes by hand and put them away. These expectations would have been acceptable had it not been for the $150 cleaning fee."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at this Airbnb! The place itself is amazing, with floor heating that we absolutely loved. The cleanliness of the space was also impeccable.
The location is extremely convenient, just a 5-minute walk from a variety of great restaurants and a mart.
What made our stay truly special was our host Christine. We faced a bit of a hiccup when we lost our key on the first day, which made us quite worried. However, Christine's response and support was amazing. She was very responsive and kind, providing us with a new key early the next morning, allowing us to continue enjoying our vacation without stress.
We will definitely stay in this place the next time we visit Truckee, highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cozy spot ‚Äî great setting (right on the river) and conveniently located (walkable to old town Truckee shops and restaurants). The place was spotless and modern, and we felt very comfortable in the loft; it was easy to put the beds together for one large bed. We hope to be back!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was probably my favorite airbnb experience of all time. The place felt extremely cozy and inviting. We stayed for thanksgiving and were able to make really nice meals using the bbq outside. The view of the river was amazing. The place was absolutley charming and pristine. We had peace and quiet and well-deserved rest after hiking around Tahoe. We particularly appreciated the heating system coming through the floor, thus making the place warm but not blown dry. The instructions were very clear and to the point. We had some interesting books about the town and Tahoe trails that we fully enjoyed reading. It was trully wonderful and I fully recommend this to everyone."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot on the river! 2nd time staying here! Hosts are wonderful, location couldn‚Äôt be better and place is so clean and modern in this historic town üå≤üêæ

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing especially when the bear walked across the patio into the river.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful, cozy and comfortable. I loved the patio overlooking the Truckee River and even slept with the sliding door partially open so I could hear the river at night. The unit is very well designed and has everything you need for preparing simple meals. Plus there are lots of restaurants in Truckee. Some guests have complained about the sofa bed, and while I did not find it very comfortable for side sleeping, it was fine if I was sleeping on my back or stomach. I slept soundly and did not wake up with hip or back pain as I sometimes do at home, so I give it a thumbs up! You do hear the trains, but I did not find them intrusive.
Christine and Paul were so friendly and helpful. I thank them for a wonderful stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for a couple days of biking in the area! Cute, cozy, walking distance to lots of great food and shopping, and I loved being next to the river. Chris was very helpful and responsive throughout my visit. Extremely sweet and friendly neighbor dogs were an added bonus :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place 10/10. My family and I really enjoyed the room and specially the surroundings. Downtown was very close and a great place to visit. Overall excellent experience and will book again when we are back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What an amazing space! This little studio on the river was by far one of my favorite Airbnbs. It was incredibly clean and provided everything I needed for a getaway to decompress. I didn't even mind the intermittent construction noise down the street as the river bed provided beautiful background noise. My favorite was being able to relax in bed and still have the views of the trees and water. It felt very private despite being attached to he hosts home. The space is beautifully thought out and even the tiny kitchen had more amenities than some of the bigger Airbnbs I have stayed in . Christine was a very thoughtful host and easy to communicate with. I definitely plan on coming back whenever I need to getaway for a relaxing vacation.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot on the river.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for the weekend!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"place was great, exactly as described. the only problem was trying to get any amount of meaningful sleep with the constant freight trains 50' from the window about every 30 minutes. the bikes were locked and all had flat tires, doesnt look like anyone has cared or maintained them even though this is listed as the ""bike house""."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place by the river, well supplied and set up. Perfect as a base for day hikes and climbs such as Mount Rose and Mount Judah. River sights and sound were lovely from this guest house!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stop scrolling and just book. I searched for weeks trying to find a place for hubby and I to stay that was a great value, on the water, charming and clean and close to Lake Tahoe, not to mention walkable to downtown Truckee. The place is well situated on the picturesque Truckee River. We stayed in mid September so it was a nice surprise to find the heated floors on as the mornings can be a little chilly. The sofa bed was too firm for us (which I knew based on the reviews) so we decided to put the two twin size beds found in the loft together and make one large comfy bed. The entire neighborhood is very peaceful never say the owner but one friendly neighbor and his adorable dogs. My only drawback was the trains at night, the 1st night (Thursday) I heard it 5 times, seconds night 3 times and by the night 3rd time I didn‚Äôt hear it at all, I guess you just get used to the noise. Even with that being said I would definitely stay here again and highly recommended."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very walkable! the pull out bed was a little bit hard. I loved watching nature right out the back door and the decor was beautiful and simple. Very cozy!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and enjoyed the scenery. The shopping and restaurants were great. The only drawback we found was that the pullout couch was not to comfortable. Everything else was great!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect location. Peaceful river and walking distance to restaurants. The house is a small, cozy, cottage type setting. Everything you need for a get-a-way was provided. Christine gave us clear instructions, in advance, on how to get in & where to park. Everything was seemless. Thank you Christine for helping us get some much needed down town."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy & clean small space next to the river, that is peaceful & nature beautiful. Christine is a great host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a model Airbnb in every way. Well designed. Clean, simple and well done. Christine was responsive and thoughtful and gracious. Easily a top 5 Airbnb experience and I highly recommend this for a stay in Truckee."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little bnb. Absolutely adore the loft bed set up and the river view is stunning. great walking distance to downtown and coffee. There is construction right now so it's a little noisy on weekdays but quieted down a lot on Saturday.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very close to downtown Truckee and only a 30 minute drive to Lake Tahoe. The hosts were very communicative and friendly. They noticed we weren‚Äôt at the house to check-in before the sun went down so they turned on the cute outdoor lights for us. The view of the river is gorgeous. We enjoyed listening to the sound of the water. Everything was clean!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts! Super helpful and welcoming. The house is beautiful and the river running right behind the house made for peaceful sleeping. Super clean and comfy. This was my first time to the area. Truckee is a fun town with lots of things to do and great restaurants and shops. I highly recommend staying here versus the crowds down right on Lake Tahoe. Would love to come back for skiing in the winter and stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was wonderful being so close to the river.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a gem of a place! Had early morning coffee down by the river and Chris was incredibly kind. Hope to come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view of the River! I love love loved it there! Historic Truckee was a short walk away and during the summer they have Truckee Thursday‚Äôs so we got to see a lot of local vendors and do some shopping! Food in the area was great as well! Christine was so helpful, and the neighbors were quiet! Definitely would come again!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we enjoyed our visit to this very clean, small studio near downtown Truckee. Being near the river is delightful, as is walking to nice shops and restaurants‚Ä¶if you enjoy walking! The only drawback for us was the pull-out sofa bed‚Ä¶needed a layer of memory foam to mellow out the firmness of the mattress. We really enjoyed the adventure!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, beautiful, unique home, excellent location. Peaceful & relaxing. We loved our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful places we've stayed. Wonderful location right on the river.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very enjoyable stay by the river! The view is soothing and the sound of the rushing water is gorgeous. The unit is small but very thoughtfully designed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Chris and Paul‚Äôs apartment in Truckee. The place was exactly as described and pictured, located right on the Truckee river and walking distance to downtown. The apartment was beautifully furnished with a comfortable bed and couch and a thoughtful assortment of kitchen amenities. The view from the back porch is amazing and the sound of the river very peaceful. The apartment was neat and tidy and it‚Äôs clear that cleanliness was prioritized. Chris provided clear instructions for check in/out and was very responsive both before and during our stay. We would happily come back for our next visit to Truckee and would recommend Chris and Paul‚Äôs place to our family and friends."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend! The place we exactly as described. Great location within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and trails.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sweet hosts and neat little pad.
Very close proximity but beautiful views and local."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is just what I needed before a two week work assignment. I was able to really relax whether it was sitting out on the back porch or looking at the river through the window. My partner said it was like living in a screensaver image with one of those beautiful pictures of nature.
The place was really modern and was fine for two people. We were really impressed by the kitchen appliances. There is a high quality induction stove and toaster oven that I don't remember mentioned in the description. It allowed us to cook food when we wanted.
This is the kind of place you can leave the car parked during your entire stay and walk everywhere, including a nice park across the river. We also saw lots of wildlife like beaver, coyote, and lots of birds.
I hope to make this a longer term stay on our next visit!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location on the Truckee river, not a far drive to Palisades. The beds on the bunk are much more comfortable than the couch. Would love to come back soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The cabin was beautiful and cozy and we really enjoyed the view of the river. We will be back for sure :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine's place on the river was one of my favorite places I have stayed in recent memory. Sitting on the porch and listening to the river while tons of wildlife (birds, chipmunks) dart around was relaxing and fun to watch. The place was also a very close walk to downtown Truckee and just across the river from some walking trails through a park. Of course just note the ladder to the loft can be tricky for some- and use the mat for the bathtub floor--it was slippery! Note that you are attached to the owner's home and porch is by their bedroom window, but I never heard anything and barely ran into anyone while I stayed. I would stay here again without hesitation if I was in the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"May second stay, and I‚Äôll return time and time again. Wonderfully cute and styled studio. This time I got to meet Christine, and she‚Äôs just s nice s as Paul."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome mountain retreat. Clean and modern interior with a view of Truckee river from the sliding rear doors/patio you have to see to believe. Christine is responsive to questions and requests and keeps the place in great shape. Best choice for a ski weekend or summer retreat.
Truckee historic downtown is a literal stone's throw away. Will be booking again for next time we come through town."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a very nice place and they provided a few tools that were helpful with snow removal making it much easier to go in and out.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great experience staying here. Thank you again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was a must stay. Great location in walkable distance to a beautiful little town. The space was comfortable and Christine was so easy to communicate with. We would definitely recommend here as well as plan on staying again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, charming spot in a perfect location. Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Truckee!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot, great little town, quick access to Northstar and Lake Tahoe. Nice and warm in the winter, very cozy."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Wish it had a better bigger bed somehow.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little home was a perfect home base for our small group ski weekend! Very intimate, for close friends/partners/family for sure, but the radiant heat floors were sooo cozy as was the loft sleep space. So close to town and the river view was stunning. The hosts were quite friendly in the moments we crossed paths out front! Would recommend."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed the stay. The small touches such as the great assortment of tea and offer to set up the pullout bed before I arrived were amazing. Also fantastic communication. Will definitely try to stay here again next time I'm in town.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve been to. The view, town, location, and host were all outstanding."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Farmhouse elegance meets rustic mountain cabin! The space is private, lovely, clean, and bright, with radiant heating. My late November stay was between snows, and it was cozy and comfy inside, despite below freezing temps outside. A river walk in the brusque air was special. The place is accessorized with carefully chosen selections of bedding, kitchenware, and art in just the right places. Fantastic bathroom with everything you need. Walked to ‚Äútown‚Äù and enjoyed early Christmas shopping in delightful, uncrowded shops with super friendly staff, full of unique gifts. Watched the candy shop ‚ÄúSweets‚Äù make cashew brittle. Met knowledgeable lady at the Chamber office who provided maps and info about the area. Met hosts Chris and Paul and enjoyed our brief chat about their busy lives and love of the area. Can‚Äôt wait for another visit!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was cute and we loved the radiant heat floors.
It was quiet and bigger than I expected it to be.
DO NOT plan on sleeping on the pull out sofa unless you bring a mattress topper yourself. The ""sofa bed"" is just 2 inches of foam on top of a board. Kind of like sleeping on a thin pad on the ground when camping.
The twin beds in the loft were comfortable, according to my kids."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cozy place. Walking distance to downtown.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the greatest location and perfect place to stay while enjoying the outdoors and everything downtown Truckee has to offer.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay! The place was super clean, cozy and just what we needed. Thank you for all the good communication as well. We would love to stay here again in the future."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thus was perfect for me, exactly what I was looking for in a rental. Traveling alone, it was nice to know the owners were close but, with that being said, they gave me all privacy I wanted. Very clean!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was great! Comfy beds, beautiful views, walking distance to downtown, quiet. Everything we could have wanted and more!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a clean, well stocked studio right on the Truckee River, this is it. Picturesque, close to shops and eateries, this is a real find. I loved my stay here."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this place right on the Truckee River and that it‚Äôs walking distance to plenty of restaurants and coffee shops.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"perfect weekend getaway, right in town and close to our favorite activities. loved the place, we‚Äôll be back!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Christine‚Äôs place! You can‚Äôt beat the location in Truckee- only 2 minutes from so many great restaurants and shops. The best part for us was the proximity to the river, we loved taking in the beautiful views in the morning and hearing the water at night! The place itself was easy to check-in/check-out (we are independent travelers and appreciated this!), super clean & had lots of thoughtful touches & amenities (nice shampoo/conditioner, tea, etc). The pull-out bed ended up being too firm for our liking but we slept great on the mattresses in the loft area! Thanks for a great stay Christine, we hope to come again soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a sweet spot for a couple or small group. It had everything we needed including enough of a kitchen to do breakfasts and make lunches in the unit. The location is great for walking up into truckee (10-15min walk) for dinner or drinks and a short drive to the Tahoe area.
One word of advice to light sleepers, the house is right on the train tracks so that may be a bother to some. It surprised us the first night (should have observed our surroundings better lol) but luckily we sleep like rocks so it wasn‚Äôt an issue. Helped to keep all track-side windows closed.
Otherwise, we loved the porch looking over the river, the loft twin beds were fun and comfy, and we appreciated the well-stocked kitchenette."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Easy to get to downtown Truckee and Lake Tahoe. Beautiful place and perfect for just the two of us! Appreciated the coffee left!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very cute place for a weekend :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay and a great price. If you're wanting to stay in truckee look no further.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine‚Äôs place was awesome. Just as pictured and lovely to be right on the river which was the perfect place to hang out! Beds were comfortable!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot on the river, right in the middle of town. You can walk to shops and restaurants and take a dip in the river all within a few minutes.
The place is perfect for 2, or maybe 2 + small kids.
We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean, private, and had a great view. We love the shower pressure. The sofa sleeper (bed) takes a little getting use to. Overall, we would love to rent this place again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. Clean, peaceful, downtown, riverside and hosts are great."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is the perfect oasis during a busy stay near Lake Tahoe. It is less than a 5 minute walk to historic downtown Truckee which is full of cute shops and restaurants.
We loved picking up coffee in the morning, bringing it back to the house and sitting down by the river in peace before our busy day began. It's also only a 25 minute drive from the North Side of Lake Tahoe. An easy ride and the perfect distance away from the hustle and bustle you can find near the lake with all the tourists.
I highly recommend this home to anyone who is looking for a relaxing place to recharge during the exploration of the Lake Tahoe area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christine‚Äôs place is a great little getaway for anyone looking to enjoy the local scene and easily get to Tahoe.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine was so sweet and her place is amazing. So clean and comfortable and the location is fantastic! ... I slept really well, drifting off to the sound of the river. I‚Äôve already booked another stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful tiny space, which doesn't feel tiny at all thanks to the beautiful view of the river. The location is perfect - right on the river and within easy walking distance of both downtown Truckee and the Truckee Millennium trail. There is a patio where you can sit and watch the river flow, as well as comfortable chairs right at the river's edge. Incredibly beautiful and relaxing! The space itself is small, but super well thought out and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is tiny but has everything you might need for two people. We didn't try to climb to the loft, but we found the sofa bed to be very comfortable, although quite firm. We barely saw the hosts, who live in the main house, but they were kind and helpful when we needed them. Overall a wonderful stay, and we hope to be back soon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very sweet place on the river! Loved it here. Loft beds were very comfy and the space had everything we needed. Hosts were responsive and very friendly. Would love to stay here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place, river front, great hosts!
Relaxing and wonderful on all counts!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is superb! You can tube down the Truckee River from the backyard, bike along the Truckee legacy trail, get coffee, food, and shop all without needing to use your car. The place is clean, comfortable, and private. Would definitely book here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very clean, organized, and amazing views of the river."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had so much fun at Christine‚Äôs place so near town this apartment is amazing
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second trip to the Truckee River Bike House and it did not disappoint! This adorable apartment is well located, well equipped, and perfect for one or two travelers. The riverside location can't be beat. Hope to return again and again! Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot. Beautiful, right on the river.
Tranquil space.
We were so happy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location!
Super cute space, perfect for a couple or romantic getaway. Within walking distance to downtown (coffee, food, stores etc.) and the legacy trail.. perfect for biking or taking an evening stroll.
The deck was an amazing place to have our dinners as we watched the river flow on by. Thanks for sharing üòäüå≤"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the loveliest space and I am so grateful to have found it. It's thoughtfully designed, in an incredible setting, and has kind hosts. I was able to fully relax and feel at home, and get the work done that I needed to. This place is such a gem!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location- could walk everywhere!! Loved the chairs by the river!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Excellent location and very well appointed. I‚Äôd stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Truckee River! The easy walk to downtown. The place was very cozy. The hospitality of Chris and Paul is wonderful! Very recommended
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best night of sleep I‚Äôve had in 10 years listening to the river. Really wonderful location to town and biking trails. Highly recommend for the solo traveler looking for some reading and R&R time.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here! So tranquil being right on the river!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I couldn't imagine a lovelier setting. The room looks out over the Truckee River, and it's so close that one is lulled to sleep by the sound of the river. Our hosts had set up chairs on the patio outside the room, and there were chairs on the banks of the river for our use as well. As others have mentioned, the sofa bed is very uncomfortable, so I climbed up to the loft and slept on one of the plush twin mattresses. I wish we had brought our mattress topper. That would have been a big help. The room is full of windows and bright in the morning sun. I would suggest bringing an eye mask if you wake up with the sun because the shades do not make the room dark.
Our hosts had the kitchen and bathroom stocked with anything we might need, and Christine was available if we needed anything. It truly was a pleasure staying there!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine was very friendly and helped with questions about the area and restaurants. The home was very clean and the river is beautiful. We would stay again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Bike House was so relaxing and the views of the river were phenomenal. Perfect for a weekend getaway for my hubby and I. Christine made sure to include everything we would need to be comfortable. Falling asleep to the sound of the river and the cool breeze was awesome!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay in this lovely self-contained studio unit. Christine and Paul were excellent communicators and wonderful hosts. The well-equipped studio was immaculately clean and has a spectacular view of the Truckee river from the unit‚Äôs back porch. Short walk to restaurants and shops. I hope to stay there again in the future!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely and relaxing time at Christine‚Äòs place. The patio and the sound of the River made this home exceptional. Excellent location and an easy to walk to restaurants.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing porch view and really nice place to stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome view, clean, comfy and cozy, all amenities supplied, walk to downtown and close to trails. There had been complaints about the beds. We brought our 3‚Äù king foam topper and placed over the quality twin beds in the loft and was very comfortable with plenty of room to ‚Äúmaneuver‚Äù ; ) We will be staying over again and I recommend you do too!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and scenic! Great amenities as well
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can expect a fantastic cute Little River cottage Very clean with fantastic views of the rushing river We will definitely be back
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool spot right on the river. Has everything you need. Check in was a breeze and floor induction heating is amazing in the cold.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 2nd time here and will stay again. I love the cute beautiful layout, the river outside the large glass doors, the light, sunshine. Great value. My only qualm in writing this is it may be available less often when I want to stay again. Dan"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space! Great location and extremely peaceful and clean. The proximity to the river and walking distance to down, makes this space a MUST. The hosts were extremely pleasant to talk to as well.
Look forward to visiting again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, modern, and comfortable.
House is on the river and near downtown restaurants, bars, etc.
Hosts are kind and responsive. We hope to stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was absolutely perfect for out needs. Excellent location, beautiful views, easy access to the town. The pull out couch was very convenient and comfortable, and the room was stocked with all the conveniences of home."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"So many wonderful aspects about this place! Location and walkability to downtown, the river, very clean and tidy, tastefully done build right in keeping with the style of Truckee and a nice focus on recycled/repurposed woodwork! The hydronic floors are lovely heat!
The bed is as difficult or possibly worse than I had imagined! I could not sleep without getting sore every so often! If you are a flat back or stomach sleeper and spread the weight of your body out you may be ok. I like to sleep on my sides too and that was like sleeping on a concrete slab with a few layers of cardboard and a blanket! No give, no cushion, and for us, little good shuteye!
If you, as we did, prioritize other aspects of a worthwhile stay ( location, style, price etc) maybe consider bringing a mattress topper to make the bed more comfy? Seems crazy to pay so much and not get at least a somewhat comfortable bed!
The upstairs twin beds are comfy but tight on headroom, and you need to climb a ladder to ascend or descend. And they are twins!
Also, no stovetop in the house! Microwave and BBQ outside only! These two things alone (bed and no cooking) make this choice a tough one to consider again!
A simple mattress topper would make it a strong contender though!
My take is that they are doing everything to discourage couples from enjoying any cuddle time! And yup, it worked!
This was also my first ever Airbnb where the price breakdown ended up costing more for the cleaning portion of the rental than the actual rental!! So many great things about it but, unfortunately, some critically unappealing features as well!
Don‚Äôt skim past the bed reviews!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A compact well designed space overlooking the river. Spotless and neat. Great for access to the mountains or walking into town. Everything you need for a comfy escape!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We got this place for a vacation for our parents. They said it was a great place to visit; however, the pull out bed is not comfortable."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice rental! Would stay again. The construction was very high end and the details were very nice. I love a well built space and this was it. The finishings were high end and it left it feeling very comfortable and worth every penny of what they‚Äôre charging. The back patio is such an amazing place to hang out and watch the river flow. The only con, which only applies to certain people is that it‚Äôs attached to the main house and the owners bedroom is directly on the other side of the wall so don‚Äôt make ANY noise after 9, which is very early for some people."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great neat and stylish little place. Attention to d√©tails is amazing. From the quality of furniture to the kitchen ustensiles to the cabinetry and even the Xmas light at night so we don't miss the house. Repeat stay for us. We love it.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay! We‚Äôre so glad we chose to stay here. Great location and walking distance to the downtown.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a charming location. A nice welcoming place with a wonderful view. It‚Äôs cozy and perfect for the cold snowy nights.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a sweet unit right down by the Truckee River and you can walk to town. Try the Squeeze Inn for a locals' special breakfast spot !
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine‚Äôs studio by the creek is such a great spot. We came during the ski season and loved warming ourselves up on the deck with a cup of coffee in the late afternoon sun. It‚Äôs such a special spot with the creek on one side and the train tracks on the other. We enjoyed watching the trains go by, but we‚Äôre never woken up by them during the night. The space is very bright, clean, and peaceful with an unbeatable proximity to town. With parking in Truckee being difficult it was so nice to be able to walk to dinner or to our favorite coffee shop, Dark Horse. This is a perfect place if you want to be close to town but feel like you‚Äôre in a unique home with an amazing view."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location‚Ä¶ walking distance to everything!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bike House house is a true gem.
The interior is modern and impressively stylish. The high ceilings and the huge glass doors to the back make the place feel much bigger than just a studio . My daughters loved sleeping in the loft and the sofa bed was really comfortable. Immaculately clean and well appointed with everything you need for an enjoyable stay.
The location could not be more ideal.
The beautiful Truckee River is right out your back door and the property is walking distance to town. Christine was an excellent host . Her instructions and communication made our stay go smoothly from start to finish.
I can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is gorgeous and the house is well stocked and well decorated. Sitting on the patio by the river surrounded by snow was heaven. The heated floors keep you comfy. We tried the sofa bed downstairs but it was super uncomfortable. So we braved the ladder to the loft and the beds were very comfortable and we slept soundly with plenty of blankets and pillows. The stairs to the loft looked daunting but were not bad as there are lots of places to hold onto at the top. The house is a three minute walk to downtown Truckee and a lovely paved trail is even closer. We had a great time!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with a beautiful view
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Christine‚Äôs place very much. We visited for 5 days and absolutely loved the location of the home. It‚Äôs very small (think studio apartment size) but it‚Äôs perfect for only two people. There is a kitchenette (not a full kitchen) but we opted to eat out for every meal (Tahoe has some of the best food!!!). The apartment is walking distance to downtown Truckee and sits right on the river. The weather was perfect so we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio listening to the river in the afternoons. The pull out sofa bed is not super comfortable so I much preferred the twin mattress in the loft however just FYI if you are one who has to wake up in the night to use the restroom you are not going to want to climb down the ladder when you‚Äôre half asleep (it‚Äôs pretty steep). The owners of the home are very sweet and made us feel very welcome. Overall we loved our stay and highly recommend to other couples looking for a relaxing stay at a home away from home.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A real gem.
Perfect location"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, balcony with amazing view! that you can enjoy from the bathtub too.
Host was very responsive & accommodating.
helped with early checkin & late checkout that made our stay more fulfilling"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Olga‚Äôs place is one of the most beautiful houses near northern lake tahoe. I visited with my wife, in laws and my parents. They were mesmerized by the surroundings. House is super clean and well maintained. I had trouble finding the AC controller and messaged Olga. She responded swiftly. Good luck to her for the future!
I will recommend this house for party of 6 and more. TV works and I watched the FA cup final here. We made memories for life time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Olga‚Äôs place was the perfect place to rest our heads for our group of 7 after a wedding. Checkin was a breeze, sooo much space, and everything was clean and spotless! The hot tub was hot and ready to go. Olga was proactive and sent checkin details well ahead of time. Only regret is we couldn‚Äôt stay longer. Thank you Olga for hosting!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for letting us stay! We had a great time and so did our dogs. There isn't a backyard but the back space was useful in letting the dogs play/manage their business.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot. Really convenient and comfortably fit a lot of people. Hot tub was excellent. We loved our experience there as a group of 8!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This beautiful house is spacious and the kitchen has everything you need to make a great meal. My family loved the hot tub overlooking the snowy trees and there was even a sweet water bowl out for our dog! Olga responded quickly to our messages and we felt right at home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We went there as three families and everyone loved the location. The place is quiet with full of nature surroundings (exactly what you would expect from Truckee). Due to our long commute, we kindly requested 2-hrs of early check-in and Olga (the host) was able to be flexible and work with us on the schedule (much appreciated!!!). All and all, we loved the place a lot and looking forward to returning for our next visit in the area."
2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"I overall thought that the place was nice, but there were two things I was not particularly happy with.
For starters, the hot tub needs to be warmed up prior to your arrival as they take a long time to heat up in Truckee. That was not done yet the advertisement ensures you know about the tub.
Second, the refrigerator did not work so we had to improvise for all of our food & drinks. It overall did not feel worth the price, but it was still a nice stay with some hiccups as to be expected."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Came to Olga‚Äôs place for a family get away and everyone including myself had an amazing time! We didn‚Äôt want to leave! We will definitely be coming back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very accurately described, great access to freeway and beautiful clean home. As pictured. Host was very helpful and responsive."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My friends and I had a fantastic stay at Olga's cabin! The house was actually bigger than I had expected from photos. The kitchen was fully stocked with any kind of equipment you might need. The bunk beds in the master bedroom and separate room were large enough to fit adults. The hot tub was of course a huge plus. Perfect location for quick drives to coffee shops, the grocery store, and Palisades only 18 minutes away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was great! Very spacious and great amenities! Location is also fantastic if you‚Äôre going to Palisades
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a good stay! Kids love the place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Olga‚Äôs home and hope to stay again. It was spacious, organized, clean and well-stocked."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is great. Beautiful surroundings.
House was well maintained.
Hot tub was perfect and great for that weather.
Restaurants are very close."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Olga‚Äôs place was super cozy and spacious. We were a group of 9 adults renting for the weekend ski trip and there was plenty of space to sleep and hangout. The kitchen was also well stocked with cutlery and pans for making food. We also enjoyed the hot tub and board games available in the home. Olga is very communicative and I highly recommend her cabin. Note that upstairs easily runs super hot while downstairs is fairly chilly in the winter.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great space. Perfect for our stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! It was perfect for our family/friend winter vacation with a combination of adults, kids ages 2-11 and a pup. The bedrooms were a perfect set up, we loved having laundry access and the kitchen was well stocked. Oh and who doesn‚Äôt love a jacuzzi in the snow?? Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was perfect, a great place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed staying here. Home is very cozy and open space, great for bonding with friends a family. Conveniently close to stores and Northstar! There was some miscommunication when we checked in, but everything worked out! 10/10 would recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Good location! And clean space!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"this place was a beautiful hone awake from home, had everything and more than the necessity. my family felt comfortable and happy staying here very spacious. and fully equipped, really enjoyed the jacuzzi. thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice house, really clean with amazing views. Home felt very private from other houses and was really peaceful. Let us check in earlier than what the check in time was. Highly recommend this Airbnb would come back for sure!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It felt like what you want a family cabin experience to be. The layout of the home was made for making family memories with the heart of everything on the first floor. It's so close to the lake that the cabin really makes you enjoy your trip and surrounding that much more. We got to see a baby bear from the balcony the last day. Core memory for our family!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Olga‚Äôs cabin. She was very responsive and made the whole process super smooth. Very well stocked kitchen, great layout for a multi-family trip, and an amazing hot tub!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean and had a lot of things that we need. Highly recommended and would book it again if ever. Only downside is the address listed is wrong on the actual address, but Olga‚Äôs communications were excellent so we didn‚Äôt have problem. Also one more important thing I would add is that they accommodated our early arrival and was able to let us in 2 hrs early,which is amazing! Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful vacation at Olga‚Äôs house. She was so responsive to our questions as we were preparing to go & was equally responsive to our questions while we were at her home. The house is very comfortable & has a spacious living area for all to gather in. Also a lovely deck & table to enjoy dinners outside. The bedrooms are nice with comfortable mattresses & linens. It‚Äôs worth noting that the house is located very close to the highway & that there is significant background noise from the highway during the summer when most windows are open. Hiking trails are readily accessible from the house & Donner Lake is just a short car ride away. Overall, Olga & her house, despite the noise, made for a terrific annual family vacation."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the first time I‚Äôve ever given less than 5 stars. Why? Bugs in house, filthy hot tub, no WiFi and no reasonable response.
When we arrived, two doors were wide open ‚Äî not even the screens were closed. This led to all of us being bitten by mosquitoes while inside the house for the rest of the stay. 2 people in our party had giant moths fly onto their faces while trying to fall asleep, and there were a number of large ants wandering near the doors that had been left open.
WiFi only worked for an hour out of our entire stay. Host did not offer assistance in fixing it. Right before we left we fixed it for her. (More complicated than simple reboot, used our time/energy.)
Hot tub was unusable, slimy and sludgy. Host didn‚Äôt let us know maintenance would be performed while we were there, surprising us and the hot tub maintenance worker. We couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom for hours because it was used to fill the hot tub. Felt bad for the worker; it took him a long time to scrub the tub out."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything Was great. Quite neighborhood
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga's house is VERY well stocked. Linens (towels, sheets, pillows, blankets) and household items (shampoo, shower gel, toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning products, laundry products, etc). You don't have to bring anything.
Some additional instructions (garbage day, recycling, hot tub) would have been nice, but since COVID we don't see paper instructions in rentals much anymore.
Very nice neighborhood.
House is large and can accommodate a big group."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend staying at Olga‚Äôs place! Close to Donner Lake and downtown Truckee. House was well maintained and kitchen was well stocked. Really enjoyed having the hot tub. Great Wifi and easy check in / check out process. There was a little freeway noise, but that was expected. Thank you so much!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place in the mountains and only a few minutes away from Donner Lake
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is super nice - clean, new, comfortable and well maintained! It feels like Olga takes care of the house as if they live in there! Location is great too! Definitely would like to come back again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga‚Äôs place was great stay - we were in Truckee for spring skiing at Palisades and it was such an easy drive to the resort. The home was spacious, the hot tub was really nice, and I appreciated that there weren‚Äôt extensive checkout instructions like some other places have. Plus pet friendly without an extra fee which is amazing!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga‚Äôs place was perfect for our group, with a spacious living area and enough individual rooms with a mix of queen beds and bunk beds for a combination of couples and friends. Although not shown in the pictures, there is a second bunk bed in the en-suite bedroom so it could easily sleep 10 if needed. The separate bunk bed room bed was long enough for our 6‚Äô friend to comfortably fit in it too (not kid size).
The location was convenient to Palisades, downtown Truckee, and Donner State Park. We loved that it was pet and kid friendly too. As others have mentioned, it‚Äôs on a very steep hillside though, so no access to outdoor space for the dog, which wasn‚Äôt a problem for us since we took her hiking most of the day, but good to be aware of."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and spacious. The living area felt homey with lots of seating and games. Great location close to shops & downtown Truckee. Nice hot tub with a beautiful view nestled in the trees. As other reviews mentioned, the temp between the upstairs & downstairs was hard to balance (very warm upstairs & cool downstairs) but we were really only downstairs for sleeping so we were warm in the blankets. The beds had clean & warm linens."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga‚Äôs place was great for our group of 8 adults. As other reviews mentioned, we did have to toggle with the heat a bit, to ensure it wasn‚Äôt too warm upstairs and/or too cold downstairs.
Favorite parts were the close location to downtown Truckee and open living room floor plan, with all the bedrooms downstairs. Would recommend staying here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing getaway. The cabin was nicely decorated, clean, and equipped with all the amenities we needed.
The location was also perfect for us, as it was just a short drive away from some of the best ski resorts in the area. The cabin was also close to downtown Truckee, where we enjoyed exploring the local shops and restaurants.
One of our favorite things about the cabin was that we could bring our pups, which made our stay that much better. There was also a hot tub which was a perfect place to relax after a long day on the slopes. The views from the cabin were also good.
The host was also incredibly friendly and accommodating, providing us with all the information we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay in Olga‚Äôs home. The location was perfect - very close to the highway, which made getting to the ski slopes a breeze even with all the snow! We also enjoyed the hot tub and beautiful open floor plan on the main level."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Olga's house was perfect for our winter family get away - plenty of space, really well stocked with shampoo, kitchen essentials, towels and extra blankets, and in a great location. We were there during an history-making snow storm and Olga was super communicative and flexible with us needing to stay an extra night (we got snowed in).
The only minor feedback I have is that the master bedroom downstairs was really cold (we had to buy a little space heater to keep our kids - who were sharing the room - from getting too cold). The rest of the house was nice and toasty warm.
We really had a wonderful time regardless and would highly recommend this rental."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. The upstairs has a huge open space for hanging out and the bedrooms are downstairs so it‚Äôs quiet for those that need to rest. We stayed here with our kids (1 and 3 yr olds) and they loved it! Downtown Truckee is very close too which is awesome. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Lots of space for two families with kids.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We came up for a ski weekend and the house exceeded our expectations. The check in and out we‚Äôre flexible and easy. The location is perfect close to groceries, the highway, and the ski mountain. The hot tub was right off the kitchen through the sliding door for easy access with great outdoor string lighting for a great nighttime vibe. The kitchen was well stocked and made for easy dinning. The beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were stocked with great products. There were many towels to use.
The host was kind enough to extend our check out so that we could stay late Sunday to watch the Super Bowl- just so so nice of them! Their communication was great and friendly. This house is a great value for the price.
I thought the highway would be noisier and an issue for sleeping so close to the house but it was fine. Very peaceful neighborhood.
Highly recommend, would love to stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic place, very conveniently located for skiing and Olga was so easy to communicate with"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our trip to Olga's place and found the house suited our group well. The kitchen was incredibly well-stocked, and we enjoyed the space to lounge upstairs."

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful stay during the snow! wonderful house and just over all an amazing experience!! Downtown is only about 6-10 minute drive and there is lots to do there!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean. Great location.
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thought this place was just okay. Our biggest issue was the heat. When we arrived, the temperate was 58. It took several hours for the downstairs bedrooms to be comfortable to sleep in which was unfortunate with young children. When we did adjust the temperature for the bedrooms (all downstairs) to be at a comfortable temperature (65-69), the upstairs became extremely hot and uncomfortable."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Olga's place is amazing. nice location, lots of space and bedrooms. we went around Christmas time and the house even has a Christmas tree. Olga was very responsive too all my questions as well, super helpful! highly recommend Olga's place to both summer and winter times!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is an clean and warm place and very convenient. Olga is a super nice host.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga is a very responsive owner, she responded to our inquiries within half an hour. The house was clean, everything worked very well.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a very convenient location- has all the modern luxuries and comforts to really relax on vacation. Clean, and plenty of space. One of the very best Air BnB stays! Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Great location! 5 minutes from Donner Lake which has lots of things to do. Everything was as described. Easy access for check in and great service. The host was very accommodating! Definitely recommend booking for a quick vacay!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was very clean and roomy. Kitchen had everything you need. It‚Äôs a great place for large family gatherings.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga was a fair host who communicated quickly. Less than 24 hours before our stay, we ran into an unexpected issue with the property being double booked, even though we had booked it months in advance and the host confirmed our reservation and communicated with me on multiple occasions before our stay.
This caused us great stress before our stay, but Olga resolved the issue efficiently and fairly, which we appreciated. Olga went above and beyond to sort everything out. The impact on our plans ended up minimal and the resolution fulfilled our needs in the end, so we‚Äôre thankful to have had her as a host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was amazing!!!! We love the place! And Olga is very responsive and helpful. 5 stars for everything!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing and clean stay! Only wish the fans worked.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay at Olga's home just above Donner Lake. There was more than enough space for our group of 8 and the new hot tub on the back deck was an amazing surprise. Beds were very comfortable and it was great to have access to the washer/dryer. I would definitely stay here again !
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I enjoyed our stay! The abundance of the amenities came in very handy. The kite um has everything you need and the hot tub was a great plus! Definitely will be staying here again and I would recommend this stay to everyone staying in Truckee!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Olga's place is perfect for venturing out! It is right in the middle of what Donner Lake has to offer! We, two families with 4 kids, had a wonderful and very relaxing stay. The house comes fully equipped with amenities and is very clean. Will definitely come back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice location, very clean.
Fast check in, no hustle.
Really nice place and I would definitely recommend"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed at Olga's for a day, but it was positively lovely. Cozy couches, comfortable beds, games, modern appliances,all we needed and more. Olga was very responsive and accommodating of our requests. The only downside is that our stay was so short, definitely the kind of place you can bring your family to for a week of barbecuing, games and adventure. Hopefully we can come back some day."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was clean, comfortable and and conveniently located. Check-in was very easy. Kitchen was well stocked. We had lots of family fun playing the board games that came with the house. Kids did not ask for screen once. We were also able to bring our dogs up with us which was huge! This house was perfect for our needs."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Exactly what we needed! Beautiful place to enjoy our weekend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful and spacious cabin. We especially liked the clean living areas, the well-equipped kitchen, and the outdoor patios with forest views. The location was perfect for us as it is close to I-80, coffee shops, and Safeway. Finally, Olga was such a great host and was easy to communicate with. We can't wait to go back again soon!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Definitely want to come back soon!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you for sharing your beautiful home Olga! Everything was perfect!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here. The house is huge! Very open and spacious! Although you can hear the freeway (even with windows closed) the view was very nice! Kitchen was very well equipped and there were cooking oils, spices, condiments plus any cooking tool or utensil you might need. Bathrooms each had nice shampoo, conditioner and body wash. You‚Äôll need to bring your own q-tips, lotion, Kleenex. Also, be sure to seek out the correct address. There are 2 listed and 1 is incorrect.
The couch and bed were beyond comfortable! The location was wonderful. Plenty of places to walk to for food and coffee. We really enjoyed staying here."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was very clean, in a great location and has everything you need!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great house, location, and host!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely perfect! It is so clean and the open floor plan is a huge plus. It is stocked with everything you need and the location is perfect. It is close to everything and easily accessible. The Wifi wasn't working but Olga suggested a nearby cafe with wifi access and that worked out fine. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. My children did not want to go home! We will return. Highly recommended.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really nice stay here. Only drawback was spotty wifi, which made it necessary to find a cafe with internet in Truckee to do some zoom meetings and work. (Olga recommended Wild Cherries but it closes mid-afternoon, so we went to Dark Horse Coffee Roasters, which had wifi as well as a really good latte.) Upstairs is spacious and the kitchen is well stocked, and the bedrooms downstairs are comfortable. The kids enjoyed the selection of games, especially the awesome chess set. Location is just off the 80, so it's convenient but there is some freeway noise. We appreciated the generous stock of paper towels, toilet paper, and bath towels."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was clean and spacious. Will defiantly return again. Olga has been a great host and very responsive as well. Thank you for letting us stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at Olga‚Äôs AirBnB! It was very spacious and had everything we needed for our overnight stay.

Definitely would go back to Olga‚Äôs."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome spot. My extended family stayed here for a few days of fun in the snow. The house was spotlessly clean, very comfortable, mostly well-stocked, and well-located. The open layout was great. We enjoyed our stay very much- it fit our needs nicely."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Olga was very responsive. Had a great weekend!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host - Olga is very responsive, you get an email back within the same day, if not by the hour. She's taken special care to furnish the house with nice touches and brand name items, and all the essential household items you'll need.
The house - very clean, cozy with super comfy beddings & linens, great open space layout on the main floor and kitchen is well equipped too. Nice toiletries are provided like you would get at an upscale hotel. Wifi is great, and house is conveniently located; 2min from Tahoe's Dave, 5min from Safeway and Tesla Supercharger, 15min drive from Sugarbowl, Boreal and Palisades (Squaw) ski resorts. Garage fits 1 SUV and 2 can park in the driveway. Easy access to the 80 and 89, but do bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.
We had a wonderful time staying at the house."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Olga‚Äôs place was so warm and welcoming! The space was perfect for our group and was conveniently nearby everything.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Olga‚Äôs place is great!
We had a wonderful time here. The place is very spacious, very clean and at such a great location to ski resorts.
Hi he internet speed is very good. All 8 of us are working here and on zoom call from time to time and doesn‚Äôt feel any slowness.
Highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Olga's place is crystal clean and matches exactly to its description. We cancelled the trip last Thanksgiving because there was no snow at that time and the reason we go to Tahoe is to go snowboarding. Olga allowed us to reschedule without charging us extra fees.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were able to get a last minute reservation for this lovely home for a quick trip to Donner. It was very clean and comfortable.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Very lovely place to stay! Less than 3 miles to old town Truckee & nestled in the trees. Great kitchen with a gas stove and everything you need to cook up some good grub. We made pasta and ate it out on the back deck and as a bonus, there was a great view of the moon through the trees. Everything we needed was there, from shampoo to games, to throw blankets. The bedrooms & bathrooms were immaculate. Olga was a great host! I would book this place again in a heartbeat!"

2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Olga‚Äôs property is a wonderful home base to explore Tahoe Donner and all the outdoor activities in the area. Very spacious, organized/clean, and a beautiful air bnb. Only thing was the privacy. Olga showed up unannounced as we checked in, and 4 mins before check out time as we packed the car and watched us, which felt a tad invasive. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs just trying to make sure the property is taken care of but I have never experienced a host like her."

We only wish we had stayed for longer!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Olga was easy to talk to and responded quickly! Parking fits 2 sedans comfortably but a truck may be a slightly tighter fit. Other than that, the home is very spacious and rooms are cool for summer time and gives me will come back and book for the winter!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Olga's wonderful cabin in Truckee! Checking in and out was a breeze! The home was just as pictured, extremely clean, and perfectly located just minutes from both downtown Truckee and Donner Lake. Inside you'll find all the comforts of home. Our family appreciated the large table perfect for a family dinner or game night, as well as the spacious bedrooms with very comfortable beds. We found the cabin peaceful and relaxing and enjoyed the beautiful views from every window. We just wished we cold have stayed longer!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Olga‚Äôs place was just as described and very clean. Olga was very responsive to any questions I had during our stay. Our group of 7 had more than enough room for our weekend stay! I would definitely recommend!

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Olga‚Äôs cabin was extremely clean and well equipped. Loved the little details with makeup removal pads in the master bedroom.

Looking forward to staying here again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Olga is a gracious host -- so many thoughtful touches. Her home is sparkling clean, the kitchen is well stocked, the bedrooms cozy.

Not overdone or cluttered with junk utensils or dish ware. Perfect. Will definitely come back. This is by far our favorite house we have rented and we have rented about 10 houses in the area. Even for a dog-friendly house it was clean! (Although we didn‚Äôt bring our dogs this time.) Host was great, awesome location - near everything. Thank you Olga!!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean house and overall great experience! Close to town and amazing views!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,SUPER CLEAN- and beautiful! Cleaner than any Airbnb or hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed at. Lots of room for large families!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Beautiful set up, easy access to Squaw and Sugar Bowl. Really lovely set up for a group of skiers or just a couple on a getaway."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,5 stars for everything. Specially the house is sparkling clean. With the kitchen is fully stocked. The owner is very thoughtful in many details. Good bedding.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Olga's cabin was absolutely fantastic. The entire family enjoyed our stay and Olga was a terrific host. The cabin was very clean, spacious and very comfortable to relax. The location could not be better. Everything is close including groceries stores all the ski resorts. When we return to Truckee, we will certainly like to stay at Olga's cabin again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic cabin for a group with a great location and well-stocked kitchen. Olga and Heather were so helpful and responsive. Would come back!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super spacious, peaceful location and very close to town, very clean. Host was very responsive on any questions."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was just what our family needed. Space, trees, thoughtful amenities and a perfect location!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Olga's place. The kitchen is stocked with great cookware and cooking tools, and we appreciated that when preparing meals. Olga responded immediately with any questions or concerns and dropped off a few cables for the TV so we could watch movies. There is no satellite or cable service, but the internet works well for streaming. We had kids with us and thought there would be yard space out back for snowplay and dogs to meander, but it's on a huge hill so that wasn't possible. The whole place looked and smelled sparkling clean when we arrived and the beds are pretty comfy. Overall, a pleasant experience and quality time spent with family. :)"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a comfy stay. There is no cable TV which we take as a good thing. If you need, bring an HDMI cable to connect to your laptop or iPad.
Internet worked well. The only problem we had was when the power went out for a couple hours the morning we were checking out. Thankfully we were able to manually pull the garage door open to get the truck out.
There was still coffee grinds in the coffee maker and not fully cleaned dishes in the cabinets, so just be sure to give your dishes a good wash before you use them.
Most of the outlets in the master bedroom don‚Äôt work, I think one does and the light switch doesn‚Äôt work.
The overall layout upstairs was nice and open. We had a 17 mos old and 2.5 year old running all over the place.
Coffee and spices are provided with cooking oil. The cookware is great.
Location is stellar and the drive in and drive way isn‚Äôt steep so no worries when there is snow.
Loved the chess set. Random I know but it brought back some childhood memories of play.
Check in was a bit on the late side at 4pm. Checkout was 11am which was better than most early checkouts, definitely appreciated that."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group was looking for a spacious and pet-friendly house that was conveniently located to be able to ski at Northstar. We couldn't have asked for a better set-up for what we needed. The location is so convenient and right next to the highway entrance (seems minor but some parts of Tahoe can be soul crushing getting in/out in the snow - this avoids that hassle). The house was clean and welcoming. Olga was quick to respond to any questions and was a great host for us. Would definitely recommend this house to others.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Space, located close to all the shops in Truckee and both a 20 minute drive to Sugar bowl and Olympic/Squaw Valley. It was great to bring our furry family member along. Upstairs has a open feel/spacious.
There are two sets of bunkbeds so property can sleep 10 comfortably. Beds were super comfortable. Olga is very responsive and check in and check out were easy. Place was clean and as described."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great (clean, great amenities, convenient location, lots of space), our host Olga was very responsive and we would definitely stay there again. The kitchen was fully stocked with new appliances and cookware which was nice. Plenty of extra towels and blankets and she even had people come and clear the driveway of snow. It was the perfect location for our long weekend getaway."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Conveniently located. So clean and spacious.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was was perfect for a mountain getaway. Amazing open floor plan and spacious kitchen and dining space. Very clean! We will definitely be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet little cabin, old but in a good way, really loved the Vibe. The cabin is clean, Bedding and mattress is very comfortable."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about this place! It was super cozy and really close to palisades!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome older cabin in prime skiing location. If you want something newer it might not be the option for you but we loved the old rustic vibes of the cabin and it was so fun to play games at night. It‚Äôs about a 9 min drive from palisades and in a perfect and quiet location.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our family had a great time together at this cozy cabin. We had everything we needed to relax and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Yasmina has great taste, and we enjoyed the house decoration. The location is fantastic, close to the Palisades. We would definitely stay there again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin on the river, was perfect for our ski trip!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location that was really close to Palisades and Truckee. I would stay there again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful place! We stayed here for a ski weekend as a family of four. The kids played in the snow out front and loved it!
It is a wonderful quiet and protected cabin, despite a raging snowstorm and the highway being not too far away.
The fireplace and stove are so cozy! The sheets are crisp and super new. The beds are so comfortable! This is a well appointed and fun place!
Nicely curated games and books too."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a good place to stay, great location and near Palisades and Alpine. However, we should have more closely paid attention to the rustic condition description - rustic indeed and perhaps not for everyone. Great hosts!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place with lots of activities. Would definitely recommend checking it out.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed this cabin. I thought the price was fair, the location was beautiful, and everything was thoughtfully arranged.
I would recommend snow/mud tires, 4 wheel drive, and/or chains if coming up in the winter, as the last stretch of road was unpaved and a little icy.
Overall, I had a great trip and would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yasmin‚Äôs place was super convenient for our recent ski trip to Palisades. It‚Äôs ideally located and the views around are beautiful. Yasmin was also very easy to communicate with and respond quickly with photos on any questions about driveway, checkin that I had. We were a family of 4 and the sleeping situation was absolutely perfect with comfortable beds. The kitchen has pretty much everything you need to make a meal. Yes the heater makes a loud sound in the middle of the night but since it‚Äôs an older home it‚Äôs understandable, we weren‚Äôt really bothered by it. I would absolutely stay at Yasmin‚Äôs place again and am looking forward to coming back this season or next."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was great and located conveniently about 7 min from palisades. The cabin was clean and had most amenities. Family enjoyed the projector and ps5. Would definitely stay here again the future.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This spot was perfect for a ski weekend with two couples. It's very close to Alpine & Palisades and comfortable/cute for hanging out. We'll look forward to staying here again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I brought our 2 school-aged children to this cabin for a getaway in the snow. It was wonderful. The property was large and private, allowing our kids to be kids without disturbing anyone. The cabin had a nice, rustic feel to it while also having an updated kitchen. The space was perfect for our family of 4, and we definitely intend on coming back for another visit in the future."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute, cozy little cabin. Close enough to the highway to head into downtown truckee but set back enough off the road to still feel tucked away. Not super easy to find the turn off the highway in the dark but otherwise super conveniently located. My kids loved romping around in the snow around the property we almost didn't have any reason to leave during our whole stay. The projector made it super fun to cuddle up and watch movies at night. Family voted and we want to come back every year!!"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The knives are very dangerous. Once we tried to put back one of the knives, another knife dropped down to the kitchen table, which almost hurt us.
The kettle is not clean. We planned to wash the clothes but the dryer was already occupied.
The location is pretty good, around 6 mins drive to Alpine. The house is quiet and warm."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice stay everything as expected overall
As mentioned in other reviews a microwave would have been a nice
Addition
We almost missed this note and made us feel way safer after we read the full listing there is one room down stairs that‚Äôs locked as this is their primary residence and they keep a few things locked away in there
It was a nice quiet cabin we enjoyed it
And would definitely consider booking again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice house, beautiful place. Very good owner. Recommend it"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described.
Would have liked a microwave. There was a toaster oven, but would have prefered microwave for quick reheating of resturant foods and making popcorn.
Overall a great place. Would stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what I needed to get away from the city life. Discreet and comfortable

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Well kept old cabin/house in a wooded area near the river but keep in mind it‚Äôs also near a busy road. The kitchen is well equipped with all you need. There is no dishwasher and no tv. We were there for only one night so not an issue for us. Very friendly hosts.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming cabin easily accessible from Truckee or North Lake Tahoe area that is right on the river. Beautiful, wooded lot. Comfortable bed, clean living spaces, and tidy decor. Solid feeling and pleasant. I got 95 mbps from the network, so I could not take conference calls but dial-in worked fine. Hosts were gracious and accommodated our early check-in request. Even left my wife a bottle of wine for her birthday. It is rustic, not a resort but that is what made it feel so cozy and intimate."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place and nice host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was private and really cool location. Right by the river. Very quiet at night. The stars looked incredible.

Loved Truckee and will be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabin and excellent location. Robert was very responsive and made check in and check out seamless. 10/10

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a great get away home. Would stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert‚Äôs cabin was cozy, clean, and in a great location.
I booked the cabin during the winter and did not have any issues accessing it. The central heat keeps the home really warm.
The cabin is an 8 minute drive to downtown and a 5 minute walk to Donner Lake.
Robert was responsive and proactive.
I would love to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robert went above and beyond to make sure we were safe and comfortable with an unprecedented blizzard baring down on Truckee. Without a doubt, I would book this place again. Cozy, clean with a really excellent location off I-80, and perfect launching point to so much of what the area has to offer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed here for a weekend to complete an avalanche education training. Really well located near many popular backcountry routes. House was cozy and clean. Robert was very responsive and friendly. I‚Äôd recommend this place to anyone.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"A cozy cabin very near Donner Lake. My family of four plus small dog were comfortable throughout our stay (four nights). Fun art on the walls and a nice, quiet location.
Note, there is no dishwasher (and that's fine, it's not listed on the amenities). Dedicated street parking. Cozy beds and ample blankets provided meant we all slept well. The loft stairs are narrow and steep."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I would highly recommend staying at Robert‚Äôs cabin. The location is fantastic and the cabin is perfect for two couples. I also really appreciated Robert‚Äôs responsiveness. He‚Äôs a great host and I‚Äôd love to stay here again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a great host
Great communication. Very clean cabin. Great area and not far from down town and not far from Donner National Park.
Very nice place. It was great for my wife and I."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice little cabin in Truckee with everything we needed. Robert had great communication
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cozy cabin that suited our needs for a ski weekend! The amenities were all as described and everything we needed. It was great to have an abundance of blankets and towels as well. We enjoyed relaxing on the big comfy couch after a day of skiing to watch football, and it fit our group of 6 perfectly. Robert was very communicative and nearly immediately responsive when I had a question."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin was cozy, well-equipped and spacious. We appreciated that access and parking were easy in winter and that Robert leaves lights on the staircase at night. It was not an issue for us, but going to the sleeping area on the second floor is via a pretty steep and narrow staircase that some guests may find scary. Overall very satisfied with our stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at the Donner Lake Family Cabin. The cabin is in a great location near the Lake and a three minute drive to the Donner Memorial State Park which is where we went snowshoeing with our dogs. A quick 10 minute drive to central Truckee for nightlife.
The cabin is relatively small, but has everything we needed for indoor time. Good kitchen, bedroom on the first floor and a very comfortable loft bedroom. Wonderful views of the snow falling. Robert had it cleaned and ready. We‚Äôd definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a functional cabin in a beautiful place near lots to do in the outdoors.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at Robert‚Äôs cabin. He was extremely communicable, and the place was just perfect for our party of 5. We loved the area too. It‚Äôs a very short drive to Boreal where we spent our time. Also close to Tahoe Donner and main shopping and dining area in Truckee. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin right outside Donner Lake park and a short easy drive to downtown Truckee and other winter destinations. Quiet, spacious, and clean, we would definitely stay there again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, comfortable place and well located. Robert was very responsive and helpful. He made our stay very easy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really great stay! We especially appreciated the board games available to guests. Very cozy cabin! My family of four had a great time. I read this on other reviews and want to emphasize: there is a very steep staircase with shallow stairs up to the loft area. If you are bringing an older person or someone who isn‚Äôt stable on their feet, make sure they stay in the full bed bottom bunk (there are just two bedrooms) and that you have people in your party who are nimble on their feet and can climb the stairs to sleep in the other bed, I would absolutely stay here again with my husband and 2 kids."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great communication!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, clean and nice walkable access to lake, near downtown and great food, Robert is very friendly and flexible, I will definitely come back soon."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved our stay at this little gem!! Close to the lake, quiet space to sit outside and read, very cute inside, and the service Robert provided was excellent! I hope to go back again when it‚Äôs snowing."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place for me and the kids for a long weekend. Will definitely be back. Thank you Robert.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was close to Donner Lake and Truckee. It is a nice cabin and clean. Most everything you need is there. Robert was responsive and friendly. There are a few things to be aware of. The entry point to the two bottom bunk beds is limited but good for small children. The stairs to the loft are narrow and steep. You need to be sure footed and spry. We took our two dogs and there were baskets with some dog essentials too.
Overall an affordable and great place to stay!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, and Robert was so responsive when I had some questions about the bathroom. TAKE NOTE: the listing says that there are two floor mattresses in addition to the queen and three singles. Those two mattresses were NOT present during our stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a couple of nights at Robert's house. It was located very close to Donner Lake and not hard to find. The neighbors were quiet and parking was available right at the stairs leading down to the house. The downstairs was comfortable and it had good amenities in the kitchen. Robert was friendly very easy to reach.
The freeway noise from outside the home or on the deck was louder than we expected. Getting down from the loft area is a bit treacherous at night. The bathroom is downstairs. The stair case is very step and the steps are shallow. I'm a sure footed person but it's not fun having to take the steps down. The only proper adult bed is in the loft. Three bunks that fit small children are downstairs."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robert was an awesome host and the cabin was a great choice for a short stay in Tahoe. Would absolutely come again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brilliant location for exploring Donner lake and Donner pass along with lake Tahoe. Very quick responses from Robert we really enjoyed our stay. Great scrabble board and the family of chipmunk in the treehouse were great fun to watch. thank you, Nick and Lynette"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful place to stay, great location if you wish to relax"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was such an awesome location, you‚Äôre just minutes from Donner lake (with public docs just walking distance from you) and maybe 10 minutes from downtown Truckee. The cabin was super nice and cozy, had everything you would need with a nice deck that I used to do some WFH stuff! Robert was super responsive and a overall really great host, I would definitely use this Airbnb again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Robert's cabin. The space was comfy and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. Not a cookie cutter spot and we loved that about it! Super easy access to the 80, Truckee and Northstar. Took the dogs on a lovely walk around Donner Lake. Robert was super easy to communicate with and made check in / check out a breeze. Will definitely be coming back here in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,perfect spot in Truckee. close to donner lake and lots of trails within driving distance. super quiet neighborhood and the best part was being able to bring our dog. pet friendly spots are hard to find so let's keep being good customers and clean up after our pets!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in Robert's home was wonderfully relaxing. The new deck is fantastic.....in fact, that's where we spent all of our time, except for when we were out and about. The location, so close to the lake, was very fun and so convenient for recreation without having to drive any distance at all. The home was clean and fairly well stocked."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"great location, responsive and friendly host and perfect cabin from a getaway!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely cabin, wonderfully located near all things Donner Lake and just a five min drive to downtown Truckee. Classic older cabin with nice updating, stayed cool inside during the heat and has a lovely deck for hanging out in the mornings/evenings.
Robert was proactive in outreach and very responsive.
Great stay and would recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. The cabin has all the necessary accommodations, dog friendly and very quaint, beautiful location. Robert was a wonderful host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for our family of four and dog
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute cabin about a block and a half from Donner Lake. Easy to walk to Donner Lake Kitchen and Sticks Market. Very comfortable house with a nice deck to relax on. Great for our family of 3 but has triple bunks in the downstairs bedroom so a larger family would be comfortable too. Will definitely be coming back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay here and I was amazed by how responsive Robert was! He provided helpful information about the area and answered questions almost instantaneously. We loved being so close to the lake.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Sweet cabin and home base for a Truckee visit. Not fancy and very comfortable - just right!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautiful organized and clean, it had everything we need it, Robert was always available to answer questions , we had a good time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Robert was a great host and the house was as advertised. Great location next to the Sticks Market and a nice breakfast place. 5 star experience all around. The only negative (very small inconvenience) was that the stairs to the loft were very narrow and steep so you just need to be careful going up and down. Price is great for the space and we had no issues. Robert even had the house ready prior to 3 so we were able to check in early! Great house for kids. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Al in all very positive! Location is good. Homey. Robert was super responsive. A bit small for the price but not a deal breaker. The stairs to the loft are a bit sketchy and very loud (I wouldn't have an elderly person climb them and a solid railing would be helpful). No paper towels/napkins in kitchen (I couldn't find them). I'd totally stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great few days staying at the cabin - really well equipped and comfortable. Perfect for exploring the surrounding area. Robert was extremely helpful in answering any questions we had. Would love to stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay at Robert's place. It's a short walk to the lake and a quick drive to many outdoor activities. Thank you for sharing your home with us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It‚Äôs a short walk to Donner Lake, a quick drive into town for dinner, and great access to Palisades! The deck is gorgeous, and we would have loved to utilize it more if we hadn‚Äôt been so busy taking in the town and playing in the mountains.
Robert was super responsive, and really accommodating - during a period of extreme weather this season, Robert allowed us to reschedule our stay after thoughtfully talking through our options. We were really grateful to have a helpful host, and to stay in such an amazing location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was great, nothing was especially fancy but it was clean and had everything our family needed. The solar lights and deck were nice and the kitchen was well equipped.
A few things to note, the stairs to the loft are quite steep and not child friendly and the thermostat was a bit tricky to find a comfortable temperature. Our kids were old enough (5 & 8) that we weren't concerned but I wouldn't expect to have young kids sleep up there."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Robert was extremely flexible and available to answer questions. The cabin is lovely and very well organized. I would stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was simple and cosy in a beautiful setting near Donner Lake, close to skiing and downtown Truckee, but peaceful and quiet. Great deck!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute & cozy cabin in a beautiful neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay here and Robert was super helpful and had the walkway shoveled for us, which was so nice! Close to great restaurants and ski resorts."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and was comfortable for myself and my 16 year old. Kitchen is small but well equipped. Furnace works great. Note this is an old cabin so you will wake up at night if anyone walks around due to creaking sound. Also note there are no drawers available to put your belongings. Overall good value.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a good weekend at Robert‚Äôs cabin. It was a bit tricky balancing the temperature in the loft and downstairs, but after the first night we figured it out. Our kids liked the bunks and the games that were in their room. The cabin is cozy, yet plenty big enough for our family of 4 and our dog. I imagine the deck functions as another room in the summer, and it‚Äôs pretty big! The location of the cabin is great - close to Truckee, but quiet and it felt more neighborhood-like. We really appreciated the shoveled parking spot and steps to the cabin upon arrival. Thanks"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was awesome since the beginning. Great communication and easy going. He was flexible about check in and check out times which I really appreciate.
I would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert is an excellent host, he helped me with all the questions I had, he was super friendly and patient! The place is super cute and comfortable, me and my friends we had a great time over there! The views are awesome and you have everything you need close by!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great cozy cabin for a family getaway!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great time and would recommend to future guests. Close to Truckee and the slopes.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Host is very nice and response quickly for questions. The place is clean and warm.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great quiet cabin with everything needed for a quick 2 night stay. Robert was a generous and gracious host, working through the snow to have everything we needed ready for an easy check-in and stay. We love the character this cabin has and highly recommend this place!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a great place to stay to enjoy time with friends or family with games to play with a good view.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to a number of ski resorts and restaurants in town. Would definitely stay here again! Robert was very timely with responses when needed and made check in and check out very simple."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a lovely stay at Robert's house. Easy and fast communication, everything was perfect!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here. It was the perfect cozy place to take a mental break from the crazy busy city life. Robert was very quick answering all emails/messages. Instructions getting there were pretty clear. We did have trouble trying to find the key lock, but I missed checking messages with updated instructions. The minute we entered it smelled a bit like Clorox, definitely was clean. The boys got very comfortable on the couch where we had movie nights. Kitchen had mostly what it needs. Pots were great but pans need to be replace. Stove is functional yet the oven needed a huge cleaning so we couldn‚Äôt bake anything/frozen pizza or bread. The bunk room was perfect for the kids. Loft stairs are a bit steep, but the loft looked perfect. It was a bit dusty and some dog hair but honestly I didn‚Äôt mind. It does get toasty. The thermostat was a bit comfusing even with instructions but after we figured it out and opened the windows it was fine. Boys enjoyed playing outside in the snow."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Robert‚Äôs place was fantastic for our MLK weekend stay at Donner Lake. The kitchen had all the amenities needed to cook and the house was warm and inviting. Great location for exploring Truckee or skiing nearby ski fields. Robert was a great host and went out if his way to ensure we were ok. Would highly recommend
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great experience with Robert. you can tell he cares about his tenants. we got caught in the blizzard which shutdown the highway into Truckee. Robert was open to adjusting the cost of our stay and flexible check-in. he also shoveled the walkway and parking spot for us before checkin. but be prepared to shovel yourself if you're expecting snowfall during your stay. place is dog friendly which we love! but have to take a flight of stairs to get to the cabin. the stairs to the sleeping space upstairs is also very steep ( fine for sober adults, but proceed with caution for children or not sober adults)."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! The kids liked the bunk bed, and the host was very helpful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is perfect. It‚Äôs comfortable, a great location and well priced. We feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to stay here. Thank you!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location, winter storm complicated check-in but everything worked out. Cabin had everything we needed."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place - short drive into Truckee and only took us 20min to get to Palisades for skiing.
Cabin was cozy and in a quiet neighbourhood near the lake. Well setup place and Robert left great notes. Top room does, get a bit toasty when the heater is running, takes a little practice to dial it in and the bottom bunk of the three tier bunk is definitely low overhead, probably okay for a kid.
Overall great place, would recommend for a weekend getaway in the area or if in town for skiing."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Well stocked. Quiet and safe!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Location is key! The cabin is right between Boreal and good food in Truckee. If you don't want to eat out you have a fully stocked kitchen with oven to make meals. Everything worked perfectly. Tankless water heater was a huge plus when it's 15 degrees out and you are 4th in line for a shower. Plus, Robert was always easy to get in contact with if we had any questions. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Robert was very kind, helpful, and accomadating to us during the snow storm. The house as perfect for our little mountin trip."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worth the price, very cozy. accommodating to terrible weather"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! Beautiful little cabin feels super cozy great for families.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robert is great!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Rob! I appreciate the flex check-in and your kindness, wish you all the best and have a great holiday!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute cozy little place! Super large couch comfortable for a family of 4, plenty of entertainment options. Kitchen is small but perfectly functional, and spices and teas were appreciated. Located 1 block away from a little market and a WONDERFUL diner (breakfast/lunch). We were lucky enough to catch early-season snow, and there is a fun little sledding hill directly across the road. The place was newly remodeled and clean and functional. Only difficulty was the thermostat is old and the arrow that indicates temperature set had broken off, so you couldn't tell what temp it was set to, and the on/off switch was also kind of broken. It gets very hot up in the loft if the heat is too high, so that was a bit tricky to deal with. Robert's communication was great and he obviously cares about the home and guests a lot, so I imagine that little glitch will be remedied soon. Overall delightful and cozy cabin."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay, Robert was great, we stayed in the middle of a snow storm and had to stay an extra couple of nights, he was so accommodating. The cabin is adorable, great location! walk to the lake, coffee, a market. SHORT drive to safeway, shops and the historic downtown. you definitely get the feel he loves this place, it shows. He even came and shoveled snow for us! Our granddaughter went sledding right out back! Amazing stay! Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Cabin!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location! We stayed during the summer and it is just a short walk from the public docks on the lake, a nearby grocery store and a great breakfast spot! Has all the things you need inside and is dog friendly. Loved our stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy little cabin walking distance to the lake. It was very clean and dog friendly, which I so greatly appreciate. We had a lovely time! And the host was a quick/great communicator."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We'll definitely come back to Roberts place whenever we come back to Lake Donner. This is a lovely lake and this is a great location, an affodable cabin, well located and easy to get to the lake, a good price, overall just a very doable trip."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was perfect. So comfortable. Location was so easy to find. Kitchen was big. Deck was nice and relaxing. Bunk beds were easy to sleep in!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place and very clean and cozy. The only reason for 4 stars is because I am pregnant and didn't feel safe climbing up and down the steep steps to the upstairs bed at night to use the bathroom, so I ended up sleeping on the sofa. Other than that, the place had everything we needed and was very cute. My daughter enjoyed the bunkbed room :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time in Truckee with the family definitely returning
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little cabin that is conviently located, walking distance to market. Very clean and well equipped. Easy check-in and good communication."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a great host, and check in/out were super easy.
The place was clean and looked like the pictures.
Things I didn‚Äôt enjoy so much‚Ä¶
Mattress is memory foam, you might like them, my back hates them.
House locks but all the knobs are loose so not super secure if you have valuables, but it‚Äôs a great neighborhood, so grains of salt etc.
The stairs from the road and the deck used to access the house or crazy old and have a lot of dry rot, so step carefully.
Lighting inside is super dim."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a great host! Responded very quickly, and was very accommodating to our needs/requests. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful. The location was very clean and well stocked. We could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, easy process, friendly host :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This little cabin is a true gem. It was so cozy and fit all our needs. The host Robert was super responsive and very easy to communicate with. The location was good with a large parking space. There was even a market within walking distance. We loved the charm of the cabin that has seen so many memories over the years. and the renovations to the bathroom and kitchen etc. we‚Äôre nice too. This was a good value for the area and we hope to return!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome location, great amenities, super comfortable and best of all, pet friendly, so the whole family can stay together!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I (and our three dogs) loved staying here. Robert was very communicative and flexible. The cabin was just a couple blocks from the lake and Donner Kitchen and was adorable and made great use of the space.
We will definitely look into staying here in the future."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had a really nice stay at Robert's Donner Lake cabin. It is clean and well stocked and a great location -- just a short walk to the lake. Take note of the stairs to the loft. We stayed in the bunk room -- mattress super comfy!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Check in and check out was easy. Robert was very communicative throughout. Cabin was very clean and cozy with lots of amenities. Great location close to Lake and downtown Truckee.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was superb, the cabin is very clean and has everything you would need. We enjoyed our stay immensely and hope to be back soon.
Joanne"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robert's place was perfect for us. The location is great for restaurants in downtown Truckee and not far from the ski resorts. It is also right down the road from Donner Lake, which would be very convenient in the warmer months. The cabin was cozy and had everything we needed during our stay. It snowed a couple of feet the first night and there were 2 shovels available to help get the car out. Robert was very communicative about check in and check out. Would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a great host, the house is clean, check in was simple. Beautiful location. One thing to note, the driveway fits one car. We would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful views, clean and cozy- the cabin is a good value overall. Be prepared for steep steps to the sleeping loft."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great, cozy spot to sleep! The location is great for Donner lake & truckee. Pretty close to the highway and easy to get around."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay here! Triple bunk bed in one room and cute little loft upstairs. Tankless water heater was really nice because It was freezing during our stay...This place is awesome. Thank you Robert :)
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days and had a wonderful time checking out the surrounding area. Absolutely amazing location and a perfect cabin in the woods vibe. This place has a very simple, laid back, feel to it and that's exactly what we wanted. The loft was really cool too!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a positive experience staying here. It was very comfortable and clean.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome cabin right next to the lake. Had a great time I would come back again. Super close to the mountains for snowboarding or anything you wanna do great getaway.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect location. The cabin was clean and had everything we needed including a well stocked kitchen. We found ourselves very comfortable and Robert was a great host - very communicative and helpful. We also appreciated the ROKU TV set up for watching Klay‚Äôs return to basketball. GO WARRIORS!! Good to note that although the cabin can sleep up to 7 people (man that would be VERY cozy) there‚Äôs only a plowed parking space for one car.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here with our family of four for a ski trip to sugar bowl. It was perfect.
Our trip overlapped with a snowstorm that dropped 10ft of snow on Truckee, and the cabin had no problems staying warm.
We played Sorry and checkers as a family every night. We jammed / danced in the living room with the provided Bose speaker and cooked family dinner on the little stove.
Finally, Robert was really responsive and helpful for anything we needed."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! A cozy cabin in a fabulous neighborhood. Would highly recommend!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and great location! Less than 20 minutes away from donner ski resort. The only downside is how hot it gets upstairs. I recommend turning the heater off or down a few hours before you get to sleep so that your not burning up upstairs. There are also stairs to get to the house and very steep stairs inside. If you have issues with getting up and down stairs i walking I do not recommend staying here. 4 of us stayed for 4 days and cooked all our meals. WiFi was good. Everything was super clean. I would come again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little Truckee gem. Perfect for a small family. We will keep an eye on this one for future visits.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall a great stay!!! Robert was easy to communicate with. The cabin is very spot on to the description & pictures. The stairs upstairs to the loft are indeed steep with no actual handrail. It gets very HOT upstairs during the Winter with the furnace going. The furnace grate in located on the floor between the kitchen/ hallway. This was scary with a little running around. But we walked away unharmed. There is everything you need for cooking, you'll just need to bring your own storage containers if you want to take your leftovers home. The upgrades made around the cabin are very nice! You do have to park on the road and walk down a stairway to get to the cabin, so be mindful about how much you pack Overall this was a great cabin for our little weekend get away!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin! It was clean, warm, and cozy. On top of that next to lake. Great host highly recommend üëç"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further, you‚Äôre getting not only an excellent cabin (holy starry night!) but also just as wonderful a host. Robert was communicative right through to the end of our stay. Super helpful and just a solid, laid back dude. The location is nestled above the lake only a short walk away. Quiet neighborhood (a tiny bit of highway noise but nothing to detour ya). There are a few stairs down to the cabin so get there before sunset if you can. There‚Äôs also a convenient store close by down towards the lake for any last minute needs or drinks for the hikes (check out the state park!) A+"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Robert‚Äôs place is very good in communicating, he responded right away with every questions we had. His place is greatly recommendable."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and value. Robert was accommodating and communicative. Thank you, Robert!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Simple, clean, and great location. Robert was super communicative and great host."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Enjoyed the stay. Stairs are a bit small but other than that it‚Äôs a wonderful place to stay! :)
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt really enjoy our stay too much, the loft where the queen bed is up the stairs, the stairs are very squeaky and narrow, that is in the description though. There is a window from the view of the loft that the neighbors lights shined in all night long, not allowing us to sleep whatsoever. And I don‚Äôt just mean a little dull light, the entire 3rd story of that house was fully lit and it was literally like we had lights on in the loft (which we didn‚Äôt)
I think the cleaning fee is a little high as there were cobwebs all in the loft and on the wood which you can see from the stairs.
The owner was nice and did offer us a discount if we would ever consider using one of his other units in future, I wish it would have been a partial refund since we only stayed one night, although booked for two. But no way we would have been able to attempt to sleep there again if the neighbors light was on all night again.
We also weren‚Äôt able to get the heater working so we were pretty cold all night long.
The owner did have great communication and was prompt with responding."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in a cozy cabin. Super close to Donner lake, just a short walk away! Host is prompt with communication! We would stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this cabin - very cozy, clean, and a great location"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place we‚Äôll be back here again soon
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can't say enough good things about this cabin. Robert was such a great host and was so responsive. I would very highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had the most wonderful stay. We appreciate the clean feel. Everything was perfect. It had a ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù feel. The host is amazing and has the best communication skills!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience in a quiet cabin 2 blocks from Donner Lake. Recommend and would book again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Roberts very cute cabin. I will tell you that it was absolutely immaculate which I really appreciated.
We loved sitting on the patio looking at all the beautiful trees and enjoying a little time away.
We had fun driving to the beach which was very close by, while the water was cold for us (we did get knee deep in the water) it was fun watching the children having a blast and paddle boarders having equally as much fun.
We loved walking through the neighborhood. One morning we walked to the Donner Lake Kitchen for breakfast, we can not recommend them highly enough, YUM!
Thank you Robert, you are a wonderful host, gave us all the information we needed and more about check-in and out and the sites to see, as well as the information about the cabin. We will definitely visit again. Warmly, Julie and Stephen"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin was a perfect getaway from the smoke for us. Robert was a great host and made himself very available for questions, etc. He was generous with our time at the cabin The price was really good although the cleaning fee felt a little steep but we knew that going in. Comfortable living room area, nice TV (Roku availability) and a good strong Wifi signal. We slept well in the bunk beds downstairs as the stairs leading to the master bedroom were a little treacherous‚Ä¶.they were narrow and could have used a handrail for gripping more comfortably. Bathroom was really clean and has been renovated nicely. Great place if you have a dog with room to roam and close to the lake. Again, really appreciated Robert‚Äôs attentiveness‚Ä¶felt lucky to find this by Donner Lake."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lots of fun near the cabin, lake, out door wilderness and good food . Owner really committed to service you for a great stay ."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great deal! Exactly what is advertised. Cozy cabin near Donner Lake. We were evacuated from Meyers due to the Caldor fire and I was able to book and check in on the same day. Close to town and shops. Great spot for kids and dogs.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Robert is a great host; very accommodating. This is a cozy cabin with comfortable beds and relaxing living space. very close to Donner lake makes it a great location.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved this place so much and hope to stay again
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great simple spot near the lake, attentive and accommodating host. Would stay here anytime."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the best bang for our buck and you can‚Äôt beat the location, close to the lake, Donner kitchen, Truckee and 20 minutes from Tahoe city. We love coming to stay in Donner and will be back again. Roberts home was lovely. All around exceeded our expectations and was the perfect place to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday week. It was exceeding clean, Updated and the deck was perfect. The neighbors were so friendly and treated us like locals. STAY HERE!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend and the house was nice. Close to the public piers.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit was great! no AC during a heat wave was challenging. Overall, great locatation!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly simple little cabin! It's very comfortable, clean and has cute little updates. Robert was very helpful, and I hope to return soon."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice quaint cabin located a few streets back from the lake. Check in and out was easy. Our kids loved the triple bunk beds and basket of toys and games. Just a heads up, the upstairs loft steps are a little steep and best for adults. Overall a nice stay in a convenient location to the lake, to town and the interstate."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Robert‚Äôs house is a dream! So cozy and comfortable. Came up for a few days with my family and we had a blast! Comfortable beds and a beautifully updated bathroom and kitchen. They have everything you need to enjoy yourself and cook and clean up too! Will definitely recommend to friends and would love to come back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a good place to stay with our two dogs and Robert responded immediately as we had questions. We were also happy to discover the best breakfast place in Donner (and maybe greater Truckee) a very short walk away - the Donner Lake Kitchen.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun, rustic and great location."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin in a beautiful area. Short walk to a neighborhood market for any last-minute supply runs. Robert was helpful with any questions we had and was very responsive.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robert is incredible. He was very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. He gave us some superb recommendations on where to eat and sights to see. He is also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful-especially with 3 small children. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for our family getaway. Most importantly, the cabin was in a great location, quiet and peaceful and provided the perfect space for our my husband & I to relax, reconnect and renew our spirits. We are already looking forward to our next trip."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place is wonderful! The home was spotless, cute and very roomy for two people and a dog. We especially loved having our meals on the deck and enjoying the weather and trees on the property.
Convenience was hard to beat - most of our bike rides were within 10 minutes of the house, with the farthest one we chose being a 23 minute drive. Town is easily accessible, as well."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very clean...good shower and kitchen sink. The French press available always makes the best coffee. Not much more to say. We missed our dog.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin with really fun art! Great to be able to walk to Donner Lake. Not a good choice for older folks who might need to get up throughout the night, but perfect for several guests otherwise."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our recent 5-night stay at Robert‚Äôs place. We brought our two dogs (60lbs-ish) and never felt like we were cramped or anything. Robert asks for the dogs to stay off the couch (understandably), so we brought a large blanket and covered the couch as we knew that would be difficult. Worked like a charm!
Kitchen is stocked with all the cooking necessities. There are plenty of boardgames to play! Along with free Netflix.
Donner lake is beautiful and within a short walk. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Roberts place was very cozy and clean. Such a beautiful place to stay. Robert was able to get us in a little early before actual check in time. When we first walked in you could tell they cleaned it very well he even went out of his way to get shampoo and conditioner cause there wasn‚Äôt any in there! Definitely would stay again! Thank you again Robert
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a great getaway for you and your family. All amenities are provided, which made it even better! One thing to keep in mind are the stairs inside the cabin. They are a bit too steep, so if you plan on bringing a dog, there is a probability that they will not be able to climb up to the second floor. Possibly might have to carry your dog upstairs. In addition, There are no curtains in the living room and there is only one heater in the entire house, which is compatible. 24 hour store is just 6 minutes away from the cabin and there is a very nice hike over at Donner Memorial State Park. Overall, this cabin was very clean and the environment was super quiet! Robert was an amazing host! For sure, looking forward to coming back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a very responsive, friendly and accommodating host.
The house itself offers good value: It‚Äôs a cute little house on a pretty spacious property that was more than enough for my wife and I and our small dog. Would def still be comfortable with a blowup bed for a second couple downstairs (we saw it said a floor mattress in the common area but didn‚Äôt see one). Theres a really nice deck around the house that I sat on and read in the mornings and relaxed in the evenings‚Äîand despite being next to the freeway it was pretty peaceful and quiet. And plus, you‚Äôre a 15-25 minute walk to a ton of great trails around Donner if you really want to get away away. The beach at Donner Lake is a 2 minute drive away. There‚Äôs a nice big backyard down below with a great picnic table we ate breakfasts at (a neighbors dogs even came over to say hi!).
Amenities inside were updated. Nice kitchen with enough cooking tools and essentials. Updated bathroom. Comfortable living room and a nice sized TV.
Compared to a lot of other options i looked at in the area, I liked that there‚Äôs a nice two car parking space up front that can fit a car and a boat. We‚Äôd def consider coming back here with our boat.
As an aside, stairs were steeper and narrower than they looked, just a consideration for people with knee issues. Our small dog could not go up and down those stairs. But not a problem, we just carried her!
Overall a really good value and would recommend to others."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a little cabin in the woods, and Robert‚Äôs place was exactly what I hoped it would be. Clean, super quiet, and just a few minutes from the lake and my favorite little breakfast place. My pup and I had a great time, and would definitely come back again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little cabin for a couple or small family. Small market for easy last minute items. Great location, easy to get to downtown Truckee, Squaw for winter and close to the lake for the summer. Everything you need for a great time in Tahoe!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this cute little cabin! The location is great and we would definitely like to return for another visit in the future. The kitchen and bathroom updates are nice, the room with the bunk beds is great for kids, and the upstairs loft is cozy. Note: the stairs up to the loft are narrow and steep, but manageable. Overall, the cabin was very clean and comfortable. Robert was a fantastic host and easy to connect with when we had questions."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Robert‚Äôs place was great. It was a great location and easy to get to. Robert was very quick to respond to any questions we had. It was a nice quick getaway for my family and I.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy place very close by the lake and conveniente access to Sugar Bowl. The kids loved the bunk beds. :)
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cute cabin, with a very nice living room, is at walking distance from the beautiful Donner lake. At Sunset, a walk or a drink at the lake is a must."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location between Donner Pass ski resorts and Truckee. Very convenient and cute, quiet neighborhood. Robert was very quick to respond to my questions. The cabin was very clean, well-maintained, cozy and a great value. I would highly recommend to anyone."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was perfect for us! It was both dog and kid friendly and had everything we needed. The place was clean and easy to check in, and Robert was quick to respond to us if we had any questions. We will definitely be back."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Close to Donner lake and local market. Every thing was clean and accessible. Had books and toys for little ones which was a big plus for my 2 yr old son.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This lovely family cottage is so homey, cozy and comfortable. So much better than staying at a sterile hotel. It was snowing while we were there and it was incredibly beautiful. Awesome park just steps away and a really sweet neighborhood to walk around in. The cabin was incredibly clean.
Also response time from Robert was lightning fast. We hope to stay again soon."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second time at Robert‚Äôs spot. Our kids love the triple bunk bed and it‚Äôs a great use of space for a small family or a couple.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Robert was so kind and helpful. Definitely already miss the cozy little cabin in the woods!
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent host who aswered our phone call past midnight and was very nice. My kids had a lot of fun in the backyard. I loved my daily walk with our puppy to the lake and the state park. We could not figure out how to read the thermostat though. It was either too hot or too cold, but no big deal there. The stairs to the loft are challenging going down especially with little ones. Overall, very good clean cabin and outstanding communication."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time in Robert‚Äôs cabin in the past week. Robert maintained strong communication with me and always responded to me shortly when I need help. Highly recommend this cabin. We are looking to come back to this location later.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So cozy & comfortable. It's obvious that Robert takes pride in sharing his cabin & is on top of it. The quality of everything from the towels, blankets & couch were top notch.
Wonderful spot, can't wait to come back!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robert's place was completely charming. It was well appointed with everything we needed, making for a really relaxing weekend. Between the big hang-out couch and the classic Playstation, we enjoyed an abundance of engaging family time. The triple bunk bed was a hit with the kids. The loft is adorable and really comfortable. There were more than enough blankets, pillows, towels, etc in the cabin for everyone to be comfortable. We were really close to everything we wanted to be close to. We would stay here again without hesitation."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert‚Äôs cabin was absolutely charming, sparkling clean and oh so cozy! (We have a six month old so we particularly appreciated the collection of children‚Äôs books). The location is perfect - just a few blocks from the lake with a tasty breakfast spot nearby. Check-in was seamless and Robert was a great communicator before and during our stay. A perfect little getaway by Donner Lake!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks Robert for great hosting. Love the new sectional!
2021-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"In stark contrast to many previous travelers reviews, we found this place rather unwelcoming. The proximity to I-80 is remarkable with constant background noise and some view of passing trucks above while cooking.
There is no privacy (no blinds and shutters) in the main living area and the furniture could use an upgrade. Lights are dim making it difficult to read a book after sunset.
Some basic kitchen supplies mentioned on the website could not be found. Some descriptions on the web did not match reality including triple bunk bed size that is way smaller, so be aware when coming with kids.
In our case, there were no instructions (!) on how to operate the place, let alone recommendations on what to do in the neighborhood, town and resorts.
The sleeping area on the balcony is comfortable and the shower is clean and relaxing. After figuring out how to do it, the heating warms the place pretty well.
In summary, this basic hut maybe best for avid skiers who leave early and come back at night to sleep and watch a movie.
However, if your vacation includes an idea of being able to move freely, relax, and spending time to read and cook, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's tiny cabin is the perfect escape in Truckee. I typically ski over at Sugarbowl, so staying in Truckee is a nice short trip in the morning up to the mountain.
Robert has done an amazing job renovating this old little cabin and adding in nice new amenities with a highly functional kitchen and bathroom. He had a french press, pots and pans, cast iron skillets, and everything you need to cook meals. The hot water tank was a new, energy efficient model, which means you can do dishes and take a shower without running out (I've lived in places without that!). It was absolutely spotless and very very clean when we came in, easing my mind about our stay during COVID-19.
I'll definitely be back again soon!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute and cozy! It was the perfect location, just a quick drive to town and Robert was so helpful and had excellent communication for any questions we had. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little cabin just a short walk from Donner Lake. Everything Robert states about the cabin is accurate. He was a great host and responded to all of my questions very quickly. There are stairs leading down to The cabin and also steep stairs up to the loft. He was willing to keep the outdoor stairs shoveled to ensure access to the cabin. There are two parking spots up top which he also was willing to keep shoveled. The kitchen is small and clean. There is a double bed upstairs and three bunks downstairs. Plenty of space for an air bed in the downstairs bedroom. It‚Äôs a great space for a small group.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin is in a great location and comes equipped with everything needed for a great stay. It is very comfortable while maintaining the cabin personality. Robert is very helpful and very responsive. Thanks again for the matts on the icy parking space!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean cozy space. Full kitchen amenities. Nearby Donner State park for easy and affordable snow fun. We would stay again.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed Robert‚Äôs cozy cabin and especially loved the extra amenities for our young children including books, games and video games. We definitely plan to return soon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay! It was as described and had everything we needed. Martin was very communicative and clear. We would definitely love to come back sometime!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot express how nice of a stay we had at Martin's property. Everything was easy and convenient, the skiing was amazing and having such a nice place to come back to made the trip all the better. If you have the chance to stay at Martin's, don't miss out!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Martin house make us feeling like ours owns house .
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Martin's place was great for our ski trip. He was very helpful and communicative. The house had everything we needed, including in the kitchen to make our own meals. We had plenty of space for parking. The house was well located close to many ski resorts. We felt like we got great value and would love to stay again next time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, toddler, and I had an amazing time at Martin‚Äôs place. It was a cozy place for us to hole up during one of the biggest snow storms of the season. This is a unique neighborhood with mostly full-time residents that really make you feel at home. It was fun to be outside while everyone was digging out. The downstairs neighbor is really nice and helpful if you have a chance to run into him. Martin is super responsive and accommodating. Would highly recommend his place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Martin‚Äôs home was lovely, and had everything needed for a weekend stay. It was a comfortable home with a large primary, and two additional, smaller bedrooms. The kitchen was well supplied with pans and dishes, as well as plenty of spices. The home was spacious and had a large living area. The garage was tall enough for my SUV to fit easily with its roof box attached to the top. Overall it was a very nice stay in a quieter area of Truckee, and I would stay there again happily."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, relatively convenient location. Friendly / communicative host."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place and quiet neighborhood. Pretty close to some ski resorts and a little market down the street. There was only 2 things i wasnt sure about when staying here and it was a downstairs neighbor and some siding that was missing in the master bathroom (couldve been in the middle of being replaced).
The neighbor wasnt a problem we just had to keep in mind being quiet as to not disturb them. The host was great and offered late check out and an additional night due to a winter storm on our check out day. Very responsive and understanding."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice and clean, we had a good time staying there"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and the landlord is nice and the transportation is convenient . He took the initiative to help and gave timely advice. I will definitely choose to stay here again .
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Overall a great stay! Convenient location for skiing at Northstar and a very clean space.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean place. Martin is available to answer and assist any questions. When it‚Äôs 16 degrees outside it‚Äôs cozy inside. It‚Äôs our second time and will continue to stay here. I would recommend this place for anyone. Mark
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"By far, the cleanest home we stayed in. Everything was squeaky clean including the bathroom and kitchen. House was well furnished with plenty of cooking utensils. Tesla charger in the garage is also great if you have a Tesla. The views were pretty and there was plenty to do. The balcony with the fireplace was remarkable. I highly recommend this place, especially with how friendly and responsive Martin was. I hope to be back for the winter!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Enjoyed our stay, had everything we needed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a lovely time staying here. The house was clean and organized. The atmosphere was warm, and some of our favorite moments of the trip were spent at the cabin. 10/10."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was great place for our family to stay: quiet, clean, every bed is comfortable and we all had best sleep after hiking and kayaking.
Thank you Martin for hosting us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was very beautiful, just 30 mins away from Lake Tahoe and Reno. Would definitely come back again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It' s a Beautiful House
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great overall and I would recommend. The two decks are awesome and we had a great time sitting there at night to watch the stars. It was quite hot during the day since there is no AC, but according to the host it‚Äôs common for no AC in Truckee. We couldn‚Äôt get the fan working in the main room and many windows were missing screens so that made it a little tough to keep them open and avoid bugs. But those were minor issues since it cools down at night.
Location is convenient and near beach access and downtown Truckee.
Only thing that wasn‚Äôt clear originally in the listing but we learned as we were arriving is that there someone living in the basement. That entrance is completely separate so not a major issue, but if you need to access the washer/dryer it‚Äôs in the garage so you may bump into them since they access their unit from the garage."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My parents and I really enjoyed staying at this peaceful and relaxing home. It‚Äôs such a great neighborhood and the host is the best. We look forward to our next visit:)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Martin‚Äôs place in this beautiful area - we enjoyed trips to the lake and to Truckee. Martin was a really responsive host and his comms were always friendly.
The bedrooms and bathrooms were great as was the kitchen.
Really good to have a back and front balcony so we could avoid the sun ( it was extremely hot when we stayed). The lack of aircon was fine at night as the bedrooms had fans and it was much cooler over night. The only time we could have done with was if trying to cook in the evening however it truly was unexpectedly hot due to the heatwave.
In the evenings we sat on the front deck on the lovely furniture and watched for stars and the occasional deer that walked down the street.
We would recommend this place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! We enjoyed our vacation where we had a comfortable place to hangout, eat, and sleep."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Martin is a great host. Very responsive and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable.
The house had all the amenities and was in a quiet, beautiful area. We even saw deer walking around in the mornings.
The place is perfect for 6 people. Would love to stay again at the place next time we visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Martin's place was perfect for our family of 6 visiting lake Tahoe in summer. The house has everything we needed from pots and pans in the kitchen to linens and towels. The house was in a quiet neighborhood and we did spot a few deers running around which our kids enjoyed watching. The time we visited was quite hot and the house did get warm in the afternoon since there is no AC. But by evening it would cool down. Martin had some portable fans available for hot days, which was very useful. Martin was very responsive when we had issues with turning on the ceiling fan and the TV. Access to Netflix and Hulu was great for us to watch some shows during the stay. The location is 15 mins from Truckee and 30 mins from King's beach which was ideal. Overall we had a great time at Martin's place and will definitely visit again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Martin‚Äôs place is very clean and very comfortable!! Great location. Our second time there and it was as great as the first!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Very comfortable, lots of common areas and the deck is lovely."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. From the time we pulled up until the time we left. Wish we had more time at this place. I am Definitely staying here again the next time i visit tahoe.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very very very clean and spacious. The bed is the best we‚Äôve ever had. Great host. Mark and Gail
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, spacious, well designed and appointed.
Fabulous great room.
Martin was most responsive throughout our visit."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is spacious and comfortable. Beds were comfortable. Everything was squeaky clean. Close to the ski resort we were visiting for the weekend. Martin was a communicative and helpful host, who was really kind in helping us to rebook at his property after we cancelled our initial visit due to a major winter storm. Would book again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Firstly, Martin was a great host. From the time I booked, till the day we checked out, he was very easy to communicate with, very quick to respond, and very accommodating. He even let us check in early because the property was ready earlier than expected.
The property was exactly as listed. Easy to find, check in, and felt exactly like our own place when we got home every night. The area and neighborhood was very friendly, quiet, and beautiful.
Above everything, Martin was an amazing host!
Thank you Martin!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spacious and clean, with clear instructions both through app messages and posted on the refrigerator. The Tesla wall charger worked perfectly. It's a bit far from Palisades Tahoe (30 minute drive), probably a better choice for Northstar."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a very nice stay at Martin's home for a ski trip!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Martin is a great host and is very accommodating and incredibly responsive.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Martin's place was spacious and beautiful! It was close to Reno airport and within driving distance to the major ski resorts. Our host was also responsive and helpful! would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is our second time staying at this nice place. Clean and convenient as usual. Martin communicated with us about the travel restrictions during snow storm promptly.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Martin was a very communicative, gracious & generous host. He helped us being at ease when we did not know if we got stuck in Truckee or not due to the weather conditions. Very accommodating!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay if you plan to go skiing to nearby resorts. Open kitchen/ living / dining room makes it great place to have quality time with the family.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Martin was a fantastic and responsive host. House was cozy. Will hopefully be back!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as described. Instructions for checking in and out were clear and Martin was responsive with online messages as well as by phone. He was nice enough to offer another night due to weather conditions. We didn't have to worry about clearing the snow from the driveway as his neighbor across the street cleared the driveway for us not once, but twice in the morning due to heavy snow fall. Nothing was broken and everything was in working order.
To find something to improve on, I'd have to say the kitchen didn't have some items we were expecting it to have (baking sheet for the oven, large mixing bowl, steak knives, etc), but not too big of a deal as we made do and needing these items depends on what you're cooking. We had 5 children with us and some board games would have been nice, but again not a big deal as the TV had plenty of options for things to watch and outdoor play during the heavy snow fall was fun for them.
Overall, our stay was good."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice location! Clean rooms with full kitchen. We enjoyed the stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing value! Good for a group, lots of space."

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Martin is a wonderful host. He went out of his way to accommodate our request for a small Christmas tree as this was the first Christmas together with our 2 sons in 8 years. He responded immediately to our questions, and he met us on site to respond to one of our questions. Martin is a very nice man, and I highly recommend his home"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with a very convenient location. Martin is great to work with.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Martin is a lovely host and he is very quick to respond! We are lucky to have such an awesome Airbnb just around the corner from our own home. We were hosting an anniversary party so our family stayed in Matin's home which was just a quick 5 min walk from us. It was like a home away from home.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great size kitchen and large decks. Fantastic
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Martin is the best host, he makes us feel so welcome and comfortable in his beautiful home! I love how clean his place is and the incredible breeze you get being on the 2nd floor:) My parents and I can‚Äôt wait for our next visit to this great home!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice house & great host
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Got this place for a quick getaway trip with my husband brother in laws and kids. Martin not only was kind enough to let us check in early but the house was clean organized and spacious! Will definitely book with Martin in the future.
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Had a great time and the location was good for activities near Truckee. Nice drive to the lake as well. Beautiful area and would stay there again if we were back in that area.

2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Martin is the best airbnb host I have ever had met! He is great at responding very fast and was very kind to let us check out a few hours later. Overall we had a fantastic experience and would definitely stay again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Martin's place was a wonderful house to spend a ski weekend with our family! We loved the rustic feel of the house and it was fun to hang out with everyone in the kitchen/living room. There was really nice, bright natural light during the day and it was helpful to have the bedrooms further down the hall so people didnt get woken up later at night and early in the morning, since we werent all on the same schedule. Heat worked really well. House was convenient to both cross country and downhill skiing (~30 min or less). Truckee has a cute town center and dining options--the downtown is several miles from the house."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is extremely comfortable and clean. It‚Äôs located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. It has very nice wood floors and high ceilings. It is well heated during the winter and has a beautiful view from its 2nd store location. This host is the absolute nicest and most organized person! He has really made us feel welcome in his home:) I love the classy ski and wood decor. We can not wait for our next visit and have already booked 2 more vacations to this home. I highly recommend renting this property:)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mart√≠n‚Äôs home was perfect for our family‚Äôs snowy getaway! Very spacious and inviting with terrific communication from Mart√≠n.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was so happy to find Martin‚Äôs place in my neighborhood when I had to vacate my house for a remodel. Was comfortable, convenient, and Martin was so helpful and flexible. Will definitely consider renting again if I have family in town. Thanks Martin!"

The bedroomsare spacious and the large Living space and kitchen were perfect for our group to hang out and socialize. All Martin's instructions were very clear and he has all the essentials conveniently on hand. Definitely will book with Martn fir future stays in the Truckee area.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, nice decor and patio on top floor overlooking the street and neighborhood is great for outdoor seating and entertainment. We enjoyed the stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our time at Martin's place and we would stay here again in a heartbeat. The unit is fairly spacious so it's great for families and groups of friends, and the house is located in a very quiet neighborhood. Martin was extremely responsive and a great communicator. His adorable and uber friendly Siberian Husky, Hondo, made our stay that much better."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is very quiet, neat and conveniently located. We went to Truckee River Rafting, which was so much fun. The communication with the owner was easy and he responded very quickly. He lives downstairs in an independent unit, so it is super easy to reach him. The weather has been very warm, but there are fans in the house to cool it down. Overall, our stay was pleasant."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and Martin and his dog Hondo were very friendly.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We made a reservation in advance to attend a local triathlon. In between the time of booking and arriving we had some changes to our schedule among other issues. Martin was very helpful and understanding. He responded quickly when needed. He was in the other unit when we were there and was friendly and kind.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Plenty of room for my family of 5. Martin is an incredible host and very accommodating. The TV and internet were easy to use. Great views and sunsets off of the front porch. We ate at the Glenshire Pizza Company twice. We highly recommend it. We would stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place is great to stay for 8 people.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Martin is a great communicator and his place met all of our needs. It happened to be quite hot for Truckee and there was no air conditioning in the condo. However, we were gone most of the day and the nights were cool. We enjoyed our stay because there is much to do in the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Good communication, home was very clean and comfortable. We would stay again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Martin was a fantastic and super accommodating and hospitable host. The house has beautiful artwork and wood design all throughout the house. We wish we could have stayed with Martin longer as he was such a great host!

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My stay was wonderful! The home was furnished with everything I needed to enjoy my stay. The location was great, 30 minutes from North Lake Tahoe and 15 minutes from downtown Truckee. I would definitely stay here again if I headed back towards Tahoe."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a good trip staying at Martin‚Äôs place. Martin is a great host and graciously welcomed us to stay at his home. Excellent communication before, during, and after the stay: Martin responded to all our questions right away. The place is close enough to Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake to serve as a base for visiting those attractions. The listing accurately described it as a good option for WFH away from the big city. It is in a quite residential neighborhood and we liked it The place is large and clean. It has the essentials for cooking a good meal, though some cookware, dinnerware, utensils, and sitting furniture can use some updates. Unlike a hotel room or an AirBnB place that is exclusively used for rentals, someone actually lives in this as home when it isn‚Äôt rented. It comes with the feel of a home and the big and small things come with a regular home. For that, we appreciate Martin‚Äôs hospitality."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a super comfortable place to stay close to historic Truckee and adventures in the surrounding area.

2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We booked this place for 2 weeks to work remotely and ski/snowboard. It was a great place to stay and very comfortable. Wifi worked well for 3 people during the week, taking video meetings and streaming shows/movies no problem. We appreciated having Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and probably more as options on the living room tv. Never checked what was on the TV in the master bedroom. Martin was very responsive if an issue came up; Truckee was unfortunately hit with a power outage for a few hours one day. It affected the resorts too. But Martin was quick to respond and give me an update. I‚Äôd love to stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. Communicating with Martin was really easy, he answered questions right away. The house was just what my family and I needed for a weekend getaway! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Martin is a great host! Speedy responces, very nice place to stay. I gave 4 stars only because there are people leaving downstairs in the independent unit, but every time they cook, all the smell and smoke comes right upstairs. It was pretty cold and we had to keep the windows open. Otherwise it was a very nice stay."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It‚Äôs a great place in a convenient location. The place has everything you need to feel at home and is kid and pet friendly. We plan to visit again!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Truckee at Martin's amazing home. He was an outstanding host from start to finish and was always just a text away. The house was comfortable for five of us, and super dog friendly (Martin's dog Hondo was a ten/ten in friendliness and cuteness). The house was well maintained and VERY clean upon our arrival and check in was easy as Martin sent all the instructions ahead of time. Location itself is close enough to Lake Tahoe and downtown is less than ten minutes away. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely plan on coming back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Martin is a great host. My family had a wonderful time staying in Truckee.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay; as a family with two teenagers, the house was just the right size. As others have pointed out, Martin is a great host, and the house is well appointed and comfortable. The house gets fairly warm during the day, but it cools off nicely in the evenings. Overall, we had a really nice visit and recommend it to anyone visiting the Truckee area."

2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is just beautiful and in perfect location to go skiing. I was specially impressed by the living room. It is an open kitchen space with very new amenities and huge windows.
Also, the snow shoes and sledges that are available in the house are perfect if someone in the group does not ski, but still wants to join the trip and have some fun in the snow."

2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great space and location. Martin's home was more than enough room for our group of 6, and well equipped with amenities. Kitchen was open to the living room, so it was nice to all be able to hang out in that area together. Location is about 15-20 min drive from Northstar, and would definitely recommend staying at Martin's place for anyone visiting the resort"
2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Martin was just the greatest. I have stayed in several Airbnb's but he was by far the most accommodating and thorough host. Also, the bed in the master bedroom has made me not want to sleep in any other bed again. My back has never felt better!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location; 15 minute drive to downtown Truckee and 20 minutes from Northstar. Very cozy and warm in the wintertime. Spacious living room and kitchen area. Comfortable and clean bedrooms. Overall we had a great stay and enjoyed the proximity to downtown Truckee and the ski resorts.

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's home was clean, spacious and well located. Communication was excellent and thorough which made the check in and check out process very easy. I would recommend Martin's home for anyone visiting Truckee or the Reno/Tahoe area."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My expectations were pretty high to start, and those expectations were met and exceeded! The home is in a quiet neighborhood, good parking and access. Lovely decks on both sides of the house, all the comforts of home! Easy access to the freeway, and a relatively quick drive to Lake Tahoe. Martin has made many improvements to the interior, and it shows. Really nice layout, comfortable living spaces, and room to spread out. Martin is a great host, accommodating on check-in and check-out, knowledgeable on the area, genuinely cares that his guests have a good experience. Our time there was amazing. If we can, we'll be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was perfect. We were escaping the heat from the bay and was surprised to see so much snow still! There was plenty of room for my husband and I and our four children (7 and under). They loved the bunk beds and the reading nook. While my only daughter enjoyed the double bed for herself :)
The home had everything we needed and with four Littles and a beach trip, the washer and dryer was a God send!
The host was very responsive and helpful."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The AirBnB was great for a weekend trip for 3 families (6 adults 6 young kids) from the Bay Area. Short drive to Donner Ski Ranch which was our main destination for tubing and skiing.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very convenient to Tahoe Donner Ski resort. Its a bit hilly so take heed of the tire chain warnings listed on the website in case of snowfall, but roads were cleared in a timely fashion and with a Rivian we didn't have any problems at all getting around. Jacuzzi was in good condition and the grill worked fine. House was appropriately stocked. TV was all streaming services so come prepared with your netflix/youtube tv/hulu/paramount plus passwords. No complaints."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, everything was great at this Airbnb. Well decorated and clean. Toiletries provided were high quality. Hot tub was perfect and clean towels by the patio door was a nice touch.
My only complaint is upon leaving we checked the house book to make sure we turned the thermostat down to whatever the owners preferred and in the house book there was a list of checkout instructions, 3 of which included:
‚Ä¢ Load all dirty dishes into dishwasher (START THEM)
‚Ä¢ Bag and remove all trash from the home and place them in the bear box.
‚Ä¢ Put dirty towels in the washer (start the washer)
I specifically do not book Airbnbs that include in their listing that I will need to do housework. I also wouldn‚Äôt expect an Airbnb that charged me a $325 cleaning fee to include these rules to be discovered right as we are leaving.
I hope Airbnb owners will get away from this practice of surprising their renters with housework. Just charge the appropriate cleaning fee and let your cleaning crew handle it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly as described. I lived in the Tahoe Donner area years ago and you never know what you'll get up there as some of the houses haven't been kept up. This house was beautiful and cozy. Two couples and a 10 year old felt right at home - there was plenty of space.
We taught our niece how to ski at Tahoe Donner - such a great little hill for beginners.
We celebrated St Patrick's Day in the house and brought corned beef from home but completely forgot the slow cooker we had planned to pack. I was ready to run into town to buy one but the house had the perfect sized in the cupboard! All in all, it was an awesome little escape! :) Definitely would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home was great! Met our needs and was well equipped with what we needed. Would recommend to stay!
Jason was responsive and communicative. Process was easy!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely stay! The location was so quiet and peaceful, and the home was spacious and comfortable for our family of three (and certainly had room for more). The kitchen was large and easy to cook in, and we liked the open area for dining and visiting in the living room and adjoining dining room. We'd definitely come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. We were 3 families on our ski vacation and we all loved the place. The kitchen is super well equipped. The living room and dinning room space are great and very open. The location is perfect!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place! Fit 5 adults pretty comfortably. It was clean and nicely stocked with essentials.
We managed to get a little bit of a sledding run in the backyard and enjoyed the large hottub. We brought our own sleds, but it looked like they provided quite a few in the garage. Also, nice bonus of being able to park our SUV in the garage. Check-in/out was easy. Overall, it was a great place and a nice quiet location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you guys for hosting a memorable weekend. Everything was as described and you were very responsive with any questions we had. Thanks again

Zero complaints! I would absolutely stay here again!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, well equipped, and chic place to stay. Our family enjoyed the house for weekend. The kids played in the backyard with snow. The gaming console was a big hit. And of course so was the hot tub. It had everything we needed. Fully loaded chef‚Äôs kitchen. Totally recommend this place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous property. Everything was well thought out. The kitchen was beautiful and well appointed.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was wonderful! I HIGHLY recommend It! They provided everything we needed and more. The host Jason was amazing! Very friendly and responsive.
Airbnb was clean, newly remodeled and in a great location. Close to grocery stores restaurants and Donner Lake.
Our daughters loved it the kids room. (5 & 2) It was perfect for entertaining them all weekend.
We will definitely come back. Thanks again Jason!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, well-organized, beautifully decorated, and space efficient place. All much-nicer-than-my-own-place details! Both kids and adults enjoyed the place a lot. Jason (the host) was so responsive and proactive to make sure that we enjoy the stay. Sure we did!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Positively amazing. Best Home away from home in the greatest setting possible!
House was perfectly clean. Perfectly set up. And wonderful all around!!!
Will be back many many more times!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay in a beautiful remodeled home. Check in was super easy, kitchen well stocked, lots of clean towels and nice amenities. Only feedback is that the placemats they have and request you to use on the dining table are pretty dirty from prior guests (they aren‚Äôt the fabric washable kind). Overall a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nicely decorated- extensive range of appliances and excellent cooking facilities- easy to communicate with host- great overall experience.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was beautiful and as described. Only complaints were we had to wait almost an hour to check-in and the house had an odor probably from last guest. Besides those 2 things, property was beautiful and very neat. Host was very proactive in their communications. Would recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the house works well. the space is comfortable and functional. The kitchen is well equipped, better than most airbnbs! the oven has some issues that require tinkering but everything else is great. It has things like sharp knives and coffee grinder and ample supply of plates and silverware and cooking implements. It not in the city of truckee but in donner so a few extra minutes of driving to olympic valley."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place that looked just like the photos. Very well stocked. Clean.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home ! We had 5 adults and 4 kids and with one sleeping on a couch and one up in the loft, this house worked great for us! We do think the pull out sofa should be in the living room but that is just our personal preference.
The garage was great to back our truck into and two other cars fit in the driveway.
Everything was immaculate and the decor aesthetically pleasing .
The 5pm check in time was a little late for us but we made it work and there is absolutely zero heat in the master bedroom and only a teeny sliver of heat in the master bathroom . The rest of the house was fine as far as heat and we ended up finding some space heaters in the house so we had those running in the master bedroom which worked great.
We loved how we could see the snow all around us like the house was in its own snow globe! The location is fantastic!
We never used the hot tub and gym that‚Äôs included as it‚Äôs 2 miles away and $17 per person per day per the gym when I called ."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Home was clean and had all the amenities we needed. Host was flexible with our checkout date when we got snowed in
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great home! Good for two multi-children families or three smaller families. The kitchen was one of the better-stocked ones we've stayed at. Drawers were all labeled and things were generally easy to find. The reading nook in the kid's room was a hit. No complaints all around. The house was clean and there was a lot of room to play and interact with our four under 9yr old girls.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family enjoyed a fresh snow fall during our stay. The house was beautiful with thoughtful decor and perfectly suited for young children. My kids enjoyed the reading loft and the arcade machine. We mostly stayed at the home the entire weekend and sledded over the small hill next to the home. I highly recommend and will look forward to staying here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had an awesome stay for a ski trip- the location is perfect. Close to Truckee downtown, so there are plenty of restaurants, breweries, and shops nearby. There is also a Safeway for groceries down the street. We had two groups going to two different ski resorts (Palisades and North Star), which were both 20 min. away without traffic. The host, Jason, was very responsive, provided local recommendations for us, and was happy to accommodate us when we made some requests. The place looked like the pics, everything was remodeled and working perfectly. Thank you VRA & Jason for an awesome weekend."
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Value: for the reduced $451 a night compared to $600ish was a good deal given how modern the renovations make the property and its location and the time in season.
Home: nice place, renovations have made it very appealing. Some examples of its age linger like few PowerPoints in rooms and large glass windows that allow in cold mainly in the master bedroom. Overall would stay there again.
VRA: Person using Airbnb chat was friendly at first and easy to talk to but over time discussions became uncomfortable. VRA 24/7 hotline was pointless and likely is more intended to give owners peace of mind then to give tenants quality service. Overall would not stay with VRA again.
Warning: property has large glass windows in the master bedroom which offer great views during the daylight but allow cold to transfer in at night. I have photo evidence of the temps up to 10F difference even with the furnace running, space heater and a electric fireplace running. We had a baby and were forced to leave"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house with very clean modern interior, a departure from the regular cozy Tahoe cabin vibe. Felt like a more sophisticated rental you might find elsewhere.
Home was very clean. Driveway was cleaned while we were skiing which was a plus to come home to.
TV had plenty of streaming services which was a plus. The kids also enjoyed playing pac man on the arcade game. They also really enjoyed the kids loft in the kids bedroom."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As described!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here. The house was so pretty my boyfriend and I kept talking about how we want our future home to look like this place. They had shampoo/conditioner/soap just like a hotel. The distance to northstar was about 20-30 min away because of snow which is not bad and Snowplay (tubing) was like 5 min away! I highly recommend this Airbnb!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Communication was extremely easy. Hosts are vey accommodating and allowed us late check-out since we have little kids.
I think the only thing is that the central heating in bedrooms are not as strong as the living room. You'd need to set the heating pretty high to warm the bedrooms, especially the master bedroom."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, very clean, easy to find. Beds and pillows were super comfy. My kids loved the little reading loft in the kids‚Äô room. Overall we loved it and definitely would stay again!"

The neighborhood is quiet, and there is a trail on the property through the neighborhood. There are lots of recreational activities very close, as well as access to stores and dining. The house is very clean and modern. The kids room is very accommodating and fun for toddlers thru middle schoolers. The video game console has hundreds of old school Atari type games which was a draw for all adults. The sofas and beds are comfortable. We would absolutely return."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The arcade games were so fun and it was a relaxing place to spend time indoors and is only around a 10 minute drive to downtown Truckee. Everything was really clear with Caleb and the team. We‚Äôd definitely stay again.

The house is great shape, everything was super clean, organized, and thought through. It's not everyday that you get an Airbnb rental equipped and prepped like a nice hotel. Kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed, although we did not necessarily do much cooking. We also really appreciated how everything was labeled which made it very easy to find what we were looking for.
Overall we felt very comfortable during our stay. Also the hosts were very responsive and communicated at every step. We would love to go back."

We were able to cook and bake in her kitchen, and comfortably fit 4 adults and 2 young children.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and exactly how it was described.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The location couldn't have been better, especially for avid skiers like us. The house was close Sugarbowl and Northstar ski resorts. The garage was also tall and could fit an SUV with ski racks.
The layout of the house was great, with the bedrooms located upstairs. This was perfect for our group, as some of us are early risers and could easily prepare breakfast or chat downstairs without disturbing those still upstairs.
The only downside was the noise from the nearby train that passed through the city of Truckee. It's something to consider if you're a light sleeper or have young children (we didn't have a problem)."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was relatively good, I didn't like the host asking me to pick up 2 large boxes from outside and put them inside the house,and we were 8 and only bed for 6 and uncomfortable sofa bed for 2 people."

Conveniently located to downtown Truckee, Northstar and Palisades Ski Resorts, Angela's home is very clean, comfortable, nicely furnished, well equipped and perfectly accommodated our group of 5 on our recent 2-day ski trip. We wished we could stay longer, both for the wonderful skiing conditions and for the great place to stay.
Angela is a very responsive host and communicator. Had we needed anything more for our stay, we have no doubt Angela would have been on top of it to ensure our continued comfort and enjoyment!
We hope to stay again someday!"

The home was VERY clean, well stocked kitchen, comfortable beds with nice linens. The air purifier was a nice touch, especially with the smoke still in the air from local fires.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tahoe Paradise. Angela was a great host and was very responsive. House was newly updated and had all the amenities you need and want. Especially appreciated plenty of white towels and the large bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Location was easily accessible to downtown Truckee and Lake Tahoe. We would definitely book here again. Neighborhood was very quiet and the grassy field with soccer goals a stone's throw from the front door, was an extra highlight for my 12 year old."

The house had everything we needed, plenty of kitchen appliances and pans. Wi-Fi worked great.

The home was very clean and stocked with all the essential supplies. Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is cozy with plenty of space. The view of the river is magical. Restaurants and coffee are walkable. Truckee is a great town.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Yvette's place exceeded our expectations. A really unique historic home in the historic part of Truckee. Comfortable. Easy commute to Tahoe Palisades. Plenty of room. I'd definitely return.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stay here twice a year summer/winter. We love being able to walk into town for coffee and food! The home is immaculately clean and well supplied.
Yvette responds immediately to messages and is a great communicator.
We are looking forward to our next truckee vacation here, we‚Äôll be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Downtown Truckee is one of my favorite places and being just a 2 minute walk away is unbeatable. Conversely, you're a 5 minute walk from the gorgeous Legacy Trail. The best of everything ""Truckee"".
The house itself is spotless and organized with stunning views of the Truckee river. I don't have one negative thing to say about it.
Yvette was an amazing host. I will most definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can't beat the location! Very clean and recently remodeled. Yvette does a great job at describing the place.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place! My wife and I went here to explore Truckee and relax, play board games, do some cooking, and read. It was just what we needed for this, right near downtown Truckee, a lovely kitchen and a nice cabin feel. We recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time staying here! Everyone had their own space, the living room was comfy and even had blankets. It was picturesque with the snow falling in the river and being able to walk downtown was a big plus! Would definitely stay again in the future, thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this space for a couple and young adultas a base for skiing. Kitchen is well stocked and place is spacious. We all loved the train sound and being close to town. Snow was cleaned up before we got up in the morning, easy steps to car."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful historic house which has been nicely remodeled, in a convenient location right next to downtown."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and beautiful space. Easy to walk into town historic downtown Truckee. Well - stocked kitchen. We‚Äôve stayed at Yvette‚Äôs other listing previously and both are top-notch.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs like you have your own private river in your backyard. The house was gorgeous with great lighting in all of the rooms. Wake up to the river in the morning from the master bedroom and it doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. 100%. We will be going back again very soon.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Yvette‚Äôs home which was perfectly located in the heart of Truckee. Close to shopping and restaurants - there was always something to see or do.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house in a beautiful area. The train is loud at night, but Yvette provided a heads up and ear plugs to help with the horn noise. The house is walking distance to downtown Truckee. We particularly loved having the river in our backyard."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd started to lose faith in Air BnB places and then we stayed here. It is, by far, the nicest place we‚Äôve ever rented. Ever. Not only is the description on point, even when describing the potential negatives, like noise from the train, the photos are actually accurate and do it justice. It was genuinely spotless, and we felt very at home because of thoughtful details like throw blankets in the living room, Qtips in the bathroom, and 100% cotton sheets. After a long day of travel, I could have cried when I slipped in to bed and felt not only a heavy down-filled duvet, but silky soft cotton sheets. No slippery, sweat-producing polyester. The decor was tasteful and unique, not like an IKEA display room, but like something I‚Äôd like to see in my own home. Truly, the only thing I think that needs to be added to the home is a hammock on the grassy backyard so you can nap and listen to the Truckee River. A wonderful place to stay, indeed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely love this home! It‚Äôs like home away from home! The beds are very comfortable and the home has everything you need. Love the sound of being by the river. There is a train that goes through but it comes with the ambiance!üòä
Yvette is friendly and easy to work with!
Love how close it is to downtown and you can walk so many places.
I would highly recommend this place and we will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm finally writing a review for our favorite place to stay in Tahoe. We stay here every summer now.
The place is spotless and the linens luxurious (which matters to me). With the river in our backyard, I can lay on the grass and leisurely read a book or plan an adventurous float down the river on tubes, which we rented right down the street!
We were within walking distance to great shops, coffee and restaurants.
Yvette is so helpful and quick to respond. We have never needed to meet in person, although I am sure she would be lovely.
From check-in to check-out our stay was seamless."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Yvette's place was outstanding. If you want to stay on the river near downtown, this is the perfect setting. The house if pristine--very well maintained and very tastefully decorated. Can't beat the location! Yvette is a responsible host who will clearly communicates important information and offers lots of helpful tips/information. We would love to stay here again for a future trip!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful Truckee home was a slice of paradise for my husband‚Äôs first visit to the area! Not only is the house beautifully decorated and the beds so comfortable, the location is perfectly situated on the river and a block from downtown Truckee. We would love to come back and stay here with our larger family someday. Yvette was very proactive in sharing her recommendations (which we loved) and a fantastic host! Thank you for a wonderful trip."
2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,The home is spectacular however we felt monitored and policed by our host. The first night we got a call regarding noise (we are all in our 50‚Äôs and this was a first fir me) The next afternoon our hosts showed up next door stating they were ‚Äúchecking on the new Gardner‚Äù she started cleaning the towels empty drinks and sunscreen from the lake area while my friends were still in the lake .. We of course had everyone intention of cleaning when we went back inside but the vibe we got made us feel as though we were not trusted. I have a perfect rating as a guest in the 10+ years I have been using Airbnb so this was very disappointing. Also we were required to strip the beds start laundry and dishes with a 10am checkout.. So a very late checkin and to me an early checkout. Again the place is gorgeous but would not stay again due to the host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Yvette's riverside cabin so much and we came back again.
It's immaculate and well-stocked with everything you need for a comfy stay. And this time of the year in July, the weather is so lovely for us to walk along the Truckee River right outside of the house. Will keep coming back to visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Yvette‚Äôs house! It was so easy to find, very clean and comfortable, a beautiful view from the backyard, and really close to hiking trails and the town. We will definitely return in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, nice inside, and a great location! The only downside is some train noise early in the morning but overall absolutely worth staying at."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very lovely home and would definitely stay here again! The beds and pillows were very comfortable and felt like home away from home! Loved the location on the River and being walking distance to downtown!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this house! It was as advertised and more. The location is fantastic for access to downtown Truckee as well as biking/hiking trails and parks. The Truckee River runs right behind the property and it was fun relaxing on the balcony or on the porch and watching the river with occasional kayakers going by. The place is very comfortable and well furnished. We hope to return for another visit in the future.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location right on the Truckee river.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My wife and I stayed here for a week for spring skiing. The house was spectacular- one of the best airbnbs weve stayed int
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed Yvette‚Äôs place. We travel to Tahoe a few times a year during summers and winters. Throughout the years, we‚Äôve stayed at Air BnB homes near Northwoods, Tahoe City, Alpine Meadows, Incline Village and Alpine Meadows. By far, our favorite home has been Yvette‚Äôs because of of several factors:
‚Ä¢ Walking distance to downtown Truckee
‚Ä¢ View of Truckee River
‚Ä¢ Access to Palisades & Sugar Bowl
‚Ä¢ Cleanliness (loved that)
I just wished we had booked 1 extra night but would recommend to stay minimum (3) nights.
I look forward to staying their again during the summer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Yvette and Jeff are wonderful hosts. They were very quick to respond to our questions and made us feel right at home. They also made sure that we were well taken care of during record-breaking storms by promptly clearing the driveway and checking in with us. The house is lovely, comfortable, very clean and had thoughtful touches throughout. The location is terrific for dining, exploring downtown Truckee, grocery shopping, skiing and snowshoeing. Our month-long stay flew by. We would highly recommend staying at this wonderful house."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful cabin. There are three different bedrooms that sleep six people total. Our family of five very comfortably stayed the weekend. With the oncoming, unpredictable weather, Yvette worked with us, trying to get other guests to take our days. The weather cleared for us to make it up the mountains and we had a great time. This is definitely walkable to so many different restaurants. The cabin backs up to the Truckee River. It‚Äôs very peaceful and beautiful. Yvette was extremely responsive to all of my messages."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful and spotless house. We loved our stay. Well stocked-we could‚Äôve stayed a week without running out of TP, towels, coffee, etc. Well stocked kitchen.
Host was responsive and friendly. Overall, a great experience and we highly recommend this property!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Walking distance to so many wonderful restaurants and coffee shops. There is a great walking trail close by and the view of the river behind the house is amazing. The house is very charming and spacious. Yvette responded quickly to questions and so friendly. Looking forward to staying again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yvette's cabin by the Truckee river is a little slice of heaven! Seriously! This is a historic and recently completely updated house only a block from the downtown main street. A mile the other way is an entrance to the Truckee River trail which is a great place to walk at any time of year. The house was so cozy and really really perfect. Specifically- There is a 2 person bedroom (one bed) and bath on the main floor, so it is easy for those of us at a certain age. A large bed downstairs worked well for my 6' 5"" adult son. The kitchen has everything we needed and we cooked at home most nights. I love to cook and was happy that there are measuring cups, cheese graters, and really everything I needed. The living room is cozy with a great deck and view of the river. The TV is huge which my hubby liked. In addition, the whole home was super clean! There was absolutely nothing lacking, and I really appreciate Yvette and her husband for making this such a treat! A+++++++++++++++"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Yvette and Jeff‚Äôs place was beautifully decorated and the amenities were great. Coffee pods, laundry pods and very comfortable beds were highly appreciated.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed in Truckee for my girlfriends birthday and this home was perfect for a little getaway. The location is top notch - we walked everywhere. It was pretty cold but the walk to our dinners and shopping were less than 5 minutes. The setting was fantastic with the river out back. We truly loved this house and location and would love to stay here again.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Yvette and Jeff‚Äôs house over the weekend for a round of golf and Barracuda championship in beautiful Truckee city. The house is clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated, same or even better than the photos on Airbnb site. The house is at the front of crystal clear Truckee river and conveniently located within walking distance of Truckee downtown.
Yvette and Jeff are the super hosts in deed. When we arrived at Friday evening, we found that we could not start the air conditioner. We called Yvette, she immediately sent someone over to look into the issue and sent 4 fans. When it became apparent that the issue can‚Äôt be fixed over the weekend, Jeff came over and installed two brand new portable air conditioner and sent us reasonable refund. We enjoyed our stay at this house and really appreciated Yvette and Jeff‚Äôs effort to make our stay comfortable."

We are lucky to be the first guests staying at Yvette's Truckee riverfront house.
The place is immaculate, and it has everything you need for a comfortable stay. We loved the direct access to the Truckee river right in the backyard. The house is also just a few minutes from the Old Town area, with some of the best restaurants and coffee shops in the Tahoe area.
Yvette is a very caring and thoughtful host. We can't wait to come back again."
