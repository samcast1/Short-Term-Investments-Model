2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was clean and in a safe location. Joseph was responsive and had clear instructions for check in and check out. We will return in the future!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, uncluttered, brand new. Everything worked well."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Joseph’s place with another couple. There was plenty of space. We were comfortable in our stay, and it met all of our needs!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the neighborhood is rough around the edges, the house itself is absolutely lovely! It is clean, cozy and comfortable. It had everything we needed for a weekend getaway to Hannibal. Outdoor space is very small and limited, but we made it work. We had no issues with the street parking and always found a spot close to the house. We would stay here again!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice clean place. I stayed here 2 days for my wedding. It was super difficult to find parking and the neighbors were a little rude but that's no fault of the owner. My bridesmaids came over for 2 hours to get ready for my wedding and got messaged about "" not allowing a party"" so I think there was a bit of a miscommunication with the owner. HOWEVER if you're looking for a nice place to stay without any event to worry about I had no other issues."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little house, great alternative to a hotel, it's very modern and clean but has no outside spaces. If you're coming for a festival and need a place that feels like home after a long day out, this would be a great place to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joseph's home is beautiful! From the moment we got there we felt at home. It was extremely easy to get in. Everything was so clean and well taken care of. The area was quiet. Joseph's home is in a great location and you have access to many things within minutes. We enjoyed our stay and would love to come back and visit the area again.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,Very clean and up to date home. Would stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice property. clean and very nice.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved this home! It was nice & clean ! Fully stocked! Appliances were really nice ! Tubs were so clean & big and comfortable!!!! This is probably one of the best places I’ve stayed ! I can’t wait to come back !

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Wife wasn't to keen on the parking but everything else she loved.she said like walking into a newly remodeled house very clean l. Would recommend to any one
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Joseph’s place! It was nice and clean and comfortable.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was very nice. Owner will give check in codes just before your check in time. Otherwise the entire stay was perfect in every way. House is well appointed and recently updated.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This AirBnB was excellent! It is newly remodeled with top of the line appliances. The beds were comfortable. The entire house was super clean. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. It was located in a flat part of town. Hannibal is very hilly and one Christmas we got iced in and couldn’t get up and down the the hill at a different Air BnB. This would not be a problem with this property. This is something real to consider if staying during the winter. The water was hot and plentiful. We had everything we needed. I highly recommend this airbnb and we will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place but lock things up in trucks, someone stole tools off my flatbed"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great, not too far to downtown Hannibal by car. The house is exactly like the pictures! If I had any questions, they were answered quickly. The only drawback (if you want to call it that) was the street parking. You can only park on 1 side of the street & it's not the side the house is on. I'd love to stay here again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice stay as we were there for work. The host was friendly
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our trip to Hannibal and our stay at Lamb's Quater's. The place was beautiful inside, very modern, and yet cozy! I was a bit sceptic of the neighborhood at first, but it was peaceful. We were not far away from anything we visited. Spent time sight-seeing in Hannibal. Great trip on the Tom Sawyer River Boat Cruise for our anniversary! Cave was OK, downtown was full of activities. Home was big enough that we could have had another couple with us to enjoy the trip as well. Perhaps next time. Thanks, Joseph, for sharing your place with us. God's blessings!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great. The place was clean, everything we needed and plenty of space for us. Joseph was quick to answer any questions and very accommodating. He put a lot of thought and work into this home! Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little house in Hannibal was perfect! We stayed the weekend because my son was getting married near Hannibal and this house was absolutely perfect for us. Clean. Comfy beds. Highly, highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We appreciaterd the quiet privacy and nice accommodations.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Gordon’s place! Everything was very clean, and we loved the decor and all of the plants."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Gordon’s space! So clean, neat and quaint. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fabulous, A-plus stay. Spiffy clean. Easy parking. Convenient to load and unload. Comfy beds. Great temperature control. Gorgeous, gorgeous decor. The town of Hannibal is both walkable and plenty of free parking. A fun 2 days. Thank you for such a special stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, remodeled 1800’s home. It’s very close to the river and the neighborhood is full of restored old homes. It was perfect for a couples get away."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was charming and very spacious. We loved the character, antiques and artwork. The central location was another benefit, allowing us to stroll in the downtown area after a long day of driving."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Had to get a bit creative to charge the car off 120V. Wonderful house and great access to historic areas.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house and the Art work is so nice and calming. The house is really close to the main strip of town and there is so much to do in Hannibal the whole family loved it!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We came to Hannibal for the history, so staying in a house built in the 1830’s really added to the character of the trip. The improvements to the house add modern convenience without sacrificing character. The period furniture was the finishing touch. We enjoyed all of the large format paintings and live plants!
The place was cleaned well, but they had forgotten to take out the kitchen trash. Oops! Given the attention to detail the owners clearly give this gem of a place I’m sure that kind of mistake doesn’t happen often."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Gordon and Ashley's place last weekend. The home was impeccably decorated with antiques and great Hannibal details. The AirBnb was easy to access and was exactly as described. They communicated seamlessly, worked with us for a special request, and were just wonderful. If you plan to stay in Hannibal, you will notice that many homes in the area are undergoing restoration projects. Just two blocks away, there's a great spot for dinner (LaBinnah Bistro) that is sure to please! We also highly recommend Java Jive for breakfast, the Mark Twain cave (of course), and Sodalis Nature Preserve for a great morning run/hike. This spot allowed easy access to all of these things and more. We will absolutely request to stay there again in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely restoration of a unique, historic house. It was very clean and the beds were quite comfortable. We loved all of the original art in the house. Kitchen was adequate for what we needed. The backyard area needs to be spiffed up with some nice plants and the fencing repaired, but overall we really enjoyed our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place in Hannibal within easy walking distance of shops, restaurants, and the river"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautifulhistory home within walking distance to downtown shops, bars, and restaurants."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a very cute home to stay in. Don't forget to bring your favorite bubble bath.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s WAY bigger inside than it looks from the outside and we loved the vintage furniture and settings. Will stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Close to everything and exactly as described. We felt so comfortable and cozy... beautiful home 💜
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Overall very cozy but a little cold in the morning.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the venue and even could have walked down to the FolkLifeFestival. We felt right at home during our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I ended up staying a second time, a few days later as I passed back through Hannibal, and my second stay was just as charming as my first."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was very brief (just overnight as I passed through Hannibal) but I seriously considered pausing my travels for a few days to better enjoy Gordon's home. The decor is well done and tasteful, looking something like a hypothetical collaboration between Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. The high ceilings made the home feel spacious, and the plant room created a relaxing atmosphere."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great historical home - beautifully decorated and very cozy !
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Really enjoyed our time in Hannibal.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed staying at this fantastically restored 1800's house - thank you Gordon for a wonderful stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for the great stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Do not waste your time staying anywhere else. This house had everything you could desire. Awesome location just a short walk to downtown. Nice restaurants and bars near by. The period decor was quaint and very well thought out and planned. Like staying in an art museum with all the beautiful pictures through out. Comfy bed and pillows. Spotless clean through out. Nice and quiet and cool on a hot weekend. It was just my husband and I but perfect for 2 couples. Loved sitting in the sunroom with my morning coffee. Gordon’s house made our Hannibal stay memorable and enjoyable. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay! Thank you for your hospitality.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home within walking distance to every attraction. We even enjoyed the farmers market on Saturday morning that was only two blocks away.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The accommodations and a great location in Hannibal.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We feel so fortunate to have been able to stay at Genevieve’s Federal House, and what a wonderful treat on a multi-state road trip! We had the entire 2-bedroom home, complete with a full kitchen, dining room and living room to ourselves - my only disappointment was that we were only staying one night. The bathroom was beautifully appointed with a large claw-foot tub which was an unexpected delight. We would most assuredly stay here again, and recommend it to anyone traveling in the Hannibal, MO area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Gordon and Family were Great!! I was late getting to town and he and his family went and made the beds at 10:30pm to make sure I was comfortable. Great Hosts! Will definitely look them up next time I’m in town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great, clean place. So neat! Would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We took a risk because there were no reviews but we should not have worried. It was like staying in a roomy and uncluttered antique shop. Looks exactly like the pictures. Every painting and piece of furniture was unique and interesting. And the house itself was extremely romantic. The house will charm you to pieces. It was one of those Airbnb’s that you wish was your own home. Gordon was ultra responsive to messages. Literally getting back to us in seconds. It was a wonderful experience and we will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute house! Beds and pillows were very comfortable! Thanks for a great stay!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The is a nice house, good neighborhood and nice outdoor area. The drive held one car, but the street parking was excellent. The house was well stocked and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable with cozy linens. I would not recommend people who have issues with stairs. They are a little bit difficult. Overall, it was perfect for my sister and I."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool place thank you
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house with more space than I expected, clean, well done. The couch is deceivingly comfortable. Firm but comfortable mattresses. The pillows are all heavier memory foam blends, so if you like lighter and fluffier, bring your favorite with you. Kitchen is well stocked with pans and utensils and general spices. Bring your own olive oil and ingredients, the range is full size and everything you need to prepare a meal is there. The space is well thought out and comfortable, I would definitely stay again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved our stay. The house was beautiful and clean inside.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 1st time going to Hannibal. It was a lovely trip, and we loved Rob's guesthouse on Grand St. It was a clean house in a quiet neighborhood. The parking was great and accommodated our SUV with an extra trailer piece. Rob was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"excellent host, we were working nights and Rob accommodated us with an early check in . His place was clean and quiet , I'd stay here in his location without a doubt if working in the area again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I normally travel for work in the palmyra area multiple times a year. Normally just settle in a hotel and call it a trip.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super comfy space. bed was great. Would definitely stay here again. Some street noise but nothing crazy.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was super comfy and clean. Great little patio out back where we sipped a glass of wine and snacked. We have family in Hannibal and will definitely look up this place again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, clean home that’s smack dab in the middle of Hannibal. Convenient location — you can get anywhere within 5 minutes. If you have any issues/questions, just message Rob and he’ll get back to you with in minutes! We wanted a cookie sheet and couldn’t find one and we had one delivered to the front porch within 10min! wasn’t necessary at all, but WOW! what customer service!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rob was very interactive and keep us up to date on everything.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house on Grand was so perfect! Rob is a great host! Not only did he respond to all the questions I had through texts quiet promptly, but also had a binder with info about the area. Including but not limited to grocery tips, which as an apprentice chef in a way, I greatly appreciated; also one of the best stocked kitchens I have been lucky enough to use available at the house. Overall the community is sweet with interesting shops down on the main strip but the house just made it the perfect getaway. I will definitely return!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our entire experience was excellent--front the moment we booked till we left. Rob responded to our request for a booking within minutes and stayed in touch throughout. Any time we wrote to him, we got a reply literally within minutes.
The house is newly redone and excellently so. The beds are very comfortable. The kitchen is fully equipped with pots, pans, dishes, tableware, even a dishwasher. Everything is done with a taste. The rustic theme consistently shows throughout the house. The little hallway-turned-breakfast-nook with the slanted ceiling and siding on the wall was my favourite.
The property is a 5-minute walk from one of the major attractions in Hannibal--Rockcliffe Mansion. The Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum, the Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse, the historic Hannibal downtown, etc., etc. are all exactly a mile away--easily walkable even with little kids.
We spent two nights at this property with a toddler and a five-year-old. We highly recommend this property! Rob, the owner, was a pleasure to deal with, too!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fun, historic place to stay in Hannibal! The decor was well done. The bathroom was very high end. It was great having the bed in a separate room. We could see the paddle wheeler on the Mississippi from our window. A nice quiet change from hotel chains. We will recommend to our friends and family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Best place in Hannibal
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aswin is a great host! We did have a hiccup on our first night (internet went out, and we could hear the neighbor in the next room snoring) but when I reached out to Aswin, he was extremely helpful and willing to work with us. Aswin went out of his way, in our opinion to make sure our stay was a great experience.
If you get the chance, you must stay at the second location, the Lighthouse Suites...beautifully done rooms, very clean, great location, we plan to be back and stay again in the future.
Thank you Aswin for all you did for us!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Hannibal. Clean and comfortable.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying here, and it was every bit as wonderful as the first. The price seems a touch on the high side until you factor in the OUTSTANDING in-suite jacuzzi and the killer location. The rooms have been immaculately clean both times, with fluffy towels too! Communication is always fast and very helpful. We will be back, for sure."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Aswin, your place was perfect for our stay in Hannibal. We enjoyed the walkable neighborhood and found it very safe and friendly. We liked the view of the Mississippi River from our room. The whirlpool tub was great, and so was the walk in shower. Everything was clean and orderly. Thank you! Amber"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean nicely furnished and everything we needed for our stay. There was a variety of restaurants and shops easily in walking distance. We hope to visit again in the future.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was great, with the hot tub and everything. My husband loved watching the trains and walking to the park with the Riverboat. It is close to downtown and restaurants ( though none served any fish dishes, except catfish!).
Gully ( the host) was so nice to respond to all my texts with questions about hot tub. We would go there again if in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place located as close to the river as you can get. The place was very clean and just as described. One downside is that the walls are thin so we heard the neighbors talking very early in the morning.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed the quiet jacuzzi!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Aswin’s place is great. Other reviews mentioned train noise. We did notice any of that in our stay there. I’d definitely stay there again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a getaway in Hannibal Mo
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Close to everything downtown.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely stay here again! Other reviews I read mentioned the train waking them or keeping them awake! I did hear it a time or two but it didn't keep me awake! It definitely isn't a game changer!
The jacuzzi tub was amazing and very clean! The bed and couch were very comfortable!
There were plenty of towels and washcloths!
There was coffee for the kurig with plenty of creamer! There were 2 bottles of water in the fridge and they had a few snacks in the room as well!
The host left a bouquet of flowers for us because we were celebrating our anniversary! I thought that was very nice and was appreciated ! He also sent a text message letting us know the room was ready and told us happy anniversary!
There were a lot of places within walking distance but we didn't do that because it was so cold!
I loved the view of the river and enjoyed seeing a few boats on the river!
I highly recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"stay here!!! The jacuzzi tub, the view of the river, the comfy bed, and the Smart TVs were such a solace to me! I'm from Hannibal and staying made me love Hannibal ! The fact that there's a baller Mexican restaurant downstairs is amazing as well!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic stay! Would stay again for sure!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is likely the cleanest place I have ever stayed - no heavy air fresheners or chemical smells - just clean and spotless. We came for my husbands birthday and the host went the extra mile with giant balloons and delicious chocolates waiting - great personal touch! The view is beautiful, perfect location, wonderful accommodations, great recommendations, quiet and safe. I would recommend to the best of my friends!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with a river view. Loved the stay in the quaint town of Hannibal with a luxury apartment feel.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful river view from room. Enjoyed seeing the trains and riverboat. Easy dining around the corner in downtown. E-Biked the Bear River Trail and around the hilly town. Hannibal is a very friendly town.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect getaway for us to relax and reset! The tub was amazing and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and very clean!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The host kindly took care of our things when there was a mix up (app user error on our end) and helped us find alternate lodging bc we had needed two nights but only booked one.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Riverside Inn. Our stay was nice and we would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Had an amazing stay!! Also we’re very helpful when we forgot something valuable they called me and let me come back to pick it up !
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent! Clean: even the corners of the bathroom floor were dust-free. The jetted tub inspired confidence with just a hint of the scent of sanitizing bleach. Linens - including bedspread - were all white and washable (no grody permanent bedspread). Views: The river view is better than its photo suggests. There's usually something going on. There in early August, we watched - on consecutive days - the dockings of the huge American Queen, American Symphony, and one of the Viking line cruise boats. I walked over to watch - up close - the American Queen play its calliope and cast off. Location: Most of what you want to visit in Hannibal is within two blocks - museums, restaurants, shopping. Plenty of parking, and you probably won't need to drive.
It was what we were hoping it might be, only better. Thanks for providing a clean, interesting, and convenient place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place! Thank you!!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Room reflected the pictures and description and was nicely done. Gully was attentive and answered any questions we had. The walls are a bit thin as we could hear the neighbor snoring but everything else was very accommodating and a nice place to stay. Just know that when you book here to remember the train tracks are right there so you will hear trains throughout the day (early to late)!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was bigger than I expected, very clean, very comfortable mattress. Fun bars to pop in within walking distance. Walls are a little thin as we could hear our neighbor snoring. But overall a very nice place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great trip! The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Everything was within walking distance, which is definitely an added bonus. We would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Riverside Inn has been converted nicely with upper-middle hotel-like decor. The large jacuzzi tub was a big plus for a relaxing soak and the bathroom was clean and nicely done. The downtown location makes it walkable to restaurants, a few bars, and boutique shops. The history behind the inn is very interesting being originally built in approximately 1917 as a brothel."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We arrived pretty late, so did not have an opportunity to communicate much with Aswin, but the little we did was clear, friendly, and responsive. The place was really nice, and we would stay there again. The town is full of small boutiques, restaurants, and bars. My kind of place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time during our stay at Hannibal. The location is perfect for walking around the historic downtown area. The room was beautiful and immaculate! We would definitely stay here again!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancée and I have stayed here a few times, and we always enjoy ourselves. The place is clean, quiet, and feels cozy. It’s right downtown, and we love being close to all the shops, restaurants, and bars."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"As advertised, walls are a bit thin, but nicely appointed. Even with the bedroom on the hall side away from the river, you still hear the trains, but not too loud. Great location for downtown restaurants, shops, and the museum."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent room and suite. Walking distance to river walk and downtown historic shops and restaurants. Clean and comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Riverside Inn's location can't be beat. You are right there by The Mississippi River/overlook park and the charming town of Hannibal. After exploring the nearby attractions, you get to enjoy your comfortable room. Where else can you sit in that jetted bath and watch The Mississippi? We will be back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, quiet place to stay.
Great communication from host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is definitely the most convenient location to stay if you are visiting Hannibal’s Main Street! Just a short walk to fun shops, dining, cocktails and the Mark Twain Riverboat. The bed was very comfortable and the separate living room has a great view overlooking the Mississippi River. Very stylish decor and clean 😊"

Amenities were plentiful and appreciated."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won’t be able to beat the location! Great access to the heart of downtown Hannibal. Beautiful renovation!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Aswin and Gully’s lodging was wonderful!
We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night in early June 2022. As others noted, the trains do pass by often but we didn’t find it disturbed our sleep at all. We weren’t even sure if any trains came through at night!
The room was very clean, well equipped and as advertised. We’d give 5+ stars if possible for the ease of use of the Jacuzzi tub! Location and parking were awesome - right off Hannibal’s Main Street.
Our main criticism was the thinness of the walls between our room and the other suites. This is to be expected in traditional hotel-style lodging, but it is worth noting because the antics of other guests is significantly more noticeable when one room makes up 25% of the guests per night at an establishment. We were kept up both nights and woken up early in the morning by other guests (both those speaking at normal volumes in their rooms, and those speaking at slightly above polite volumes in the hallway). Obviously the behavior of individual guests is unpredictable and totally out of the owners’ purview, and this does not impact our overall rating."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great choice! Excellent location and very comfy beds. Cleanliness was 10/10.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This room is modern amenities and a whirlpool with a riverfront view. Wonderful location in downtown Hannibal for anyone looking for relaxation.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"clean , comfortable bed , great location"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great room. One of tvs did not work, but there's were two so that's ok. The real issue we had was that we had no idea how to get into the room. we had to call then we had 3 people giving us conflicting information about what room we were in. they sorted it out pretty quickly, i think they will do better in the future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Check in was a breeze, the room was spacious and clean. We especially enjoyed the jacuzzi tub! We would definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great service, Room was Great!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice room! Clean and comfortable.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our third time staying here and it's always great. Clean, comfortable, and in the heart of historic Hannibal so it's the perfect place to walk from to all the shops and sites. We love it here and will be back next year!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very comfortable stay. I only wish we had more time to relax and enjoy the amazing view.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I love going to Hannibal 3 to 4 times a year for a weekend getaway, and we always stay at Ted and Carol's. It never disappoints! From the privacy, the quietness, the amenities, and the view, you truly can't ask for anything else. The house is spotless. All the furniture is comfortable. The beds are comfortable and the linens soft. Everything you need is included in the kitchen, including a full size refrigerator,. The house has a large bathroom, a coffee maker with a carafe and a single cup maker, microwave, etc. Complimentary snacks and water, too! We always plan our stay in Hannibal based on the availability of this house. They are perfect hosts, and we highly recommend them!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ted’s place is wonderful, really private with a splendid view of the Mississippi River from top of the bluff. Ted had everything extremely well organized to address all our needs. We recommend Ted’s place to anyone who stays near Hannibal."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is one of the most beautiful I've ever stayed at. It looks like the photos, but the photos don't do it justice. Comfy bed and furniture. Responsive but not intrusive hosts. Gorgeous views of the Mississippi River from the wall of windows on one side of the house. Plenty of room to walk the dogs in lush green grass, or along a short gravel road. The distant clickety-clack of a train below the bluff in the evening and birdsong in the morning. Perfection. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Maybe one the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Quiet and that view of the Mississippi River is absolutely priceless.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient to all there is to do and see. Beautiful view from the deck. Great place to relax and unwind. Loved it!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was so perfect for us! Lots of room, the bed in living room also gets a good privacy with the curtain. Amazing view!

Place overlooking with no obstructions of the glorious Mississippi River! Beautiful deck to sit on! Eagles flying everywhere! Pets allowed. Great price!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ted's place was the perfect stop on a long driving trip from Florida. It was on the way, easy to access, as well as peaceful and homey after a long day on the road. We appreciated that he welcomed our dog and aslso understood and respected his pet rules for the property. As a fellow host, I got lots of little ideas for improving stays at my own place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The guesthouse is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay. Everything about it is perfect! Its one of my favorite places and I'm always a little sad to leave. It's spacious but still cozy. The amenities are very high quality and there are personal touches throughout the house. It's obvious that Ted and Carol really want guests to enjoy their stay - and I always do!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rocky Top was exactly what we were looking for. Peaceful, yet not far from great restaurants. The view was beautiful. We were very surprised at how well-fitted the kitchen was, there was even a slow cooker and a blender! The bed was very comfortable and so was the living room furniture.
We have stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s and this was one of our favorites!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ted's place is great! Spectactular view of the river and fit our needs perfectly. Nicely furnished and equipped, comfy beds, clean as a whistle... what more could you want!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd visit and hope to come back someday. Really love the comfy accommodations and outstanding river view.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love Hannibal and all it has to offer! Great dining, beautiful views and friendly people! We were excited to find Ted’s Guesthouse as we love being able to enjoy our dinner and breakfast when we want to make it. His place is so peaceful and the view is stunning!! Hopefully we’ll get back there on our travels!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One word- PERFECTION! The Guesthouse was immaculate, and included so many amenities that are above and beyond. Ted was incredibly responsive and so easy to work with. It is evident that he truly appreciates everyone who books a stay there and will do anything he can to ensure a wonderful experience. From the time we entered the guesthouse to the moment we left we felt so ""at home"" and nothing but peace. The location, overlooking the river is amazing! This was our 2nd stay in the Guesthouse and we look forward to so many future visits. We highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an outstanding location. The river view is AMAZING, with a big deck with a long wooden bench and big table. The view from inside is almost as good, with 3 different glass doors opening onto the deck. Even on a chilly November morning, I was eager to bundle up and enjoy my coffee on the deck watching the dawn sky over the river. Clean, inviting space with comfy beds, cute kitchen, and good explanation of everything (sometimes Airbnbs can be like a puzzle -- I truly appreciated the ""handbook"" along with the little notes/signs around the house explaining things) and the special Hannibal touches. I just stayed one night, but headed back for 2 more nights soon, and already fantasizing about someday being able to bring a friend and stay for relaxing week of watching the river, the boats and barges, the birds -- and listening to the trains going by below the bluff."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place. Has little notes throughout which were fun to read. Booklet of things to do around the area! Awesome owners as well! View was amazing
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a peaceful place to relax and Ted's place fit the bill perfectly. The view was amazing, there was a beautiful little path through the woods to walk our little dog and although Ted's house is right next door, we had total privacy. The house was comfy, spotless and just a very short drive to everything. Would definitely recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Both the location and the guesthouse were beautiful. Ted was very friendly, bed was big and comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom were equipped with everything we needed, and the tv channels were plentiful. The area also had fun/interesting things to do. Will definitely stay here again if when we’re back in the area."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable nicely equipped kitchen. Good location.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Words are not sufficient to describe how wonderful Ted's place is. Very clean, easy to find, beautiful view, etc. The floorplan is perfect. All the essentials plus tons more are provided. You want for nothing except to stay longer. I love it here!! 💕"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our favorite Airbnb we've ever stayed in and hope to come back! Was very clean and comfortable. Especially enjoyed the deck and the view. Located conveniently to the wonderful little town of Hannibal.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the sunrises and watching the hawks and eagles.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and roomy cottage! We enjoyed the panoramic views of the river in the evening and in the morning at sunrise. A serene and quiet retreat after a busy weekend. : )
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I always love staying at the Rocky Top Guesthouse! The house is beautiful and so well maintained. Ted and Carol have provided everything you could possibly need for an amazingly comfortable stay. The view of the Mississippi is spectacular - probably one of the best in Hannibal!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic place to stay. The view is wonderful. The cabin is immaculate and well-equipped. Owners live nearby. Definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second visit to Ted and carol's guesthouse. We love the space, the deck and the view of the Mississippi River! It is a lovely home with local touches. We enjoyed watching (and hearing) the river traffic and the trains passing below the house did not bother us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and picturesque location with everything we needed. I would love to return and stay longer.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a BEAUTIFUL guesthouse right on the river. Everything about it was perfect and it was hard for me to get up and leave it this morning! Thank you so much for sharing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We felt at home immediately! Helpful notes, the view was amazing, so quiet and relaxing. The home was immaculate, perfect in every way. They provided coffee, and to enjoy a cup of coffee watching the Mississippi was blissful. I cannot recommend Ted & Carol's place enough. Don't hesitate, if you are staying in Hannibal, you must stay here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an overnight stay on our summer trip. Wish we would have booked an extra night to enjoy the history. Perfect view and location. A beautiful home with great amenities. A must stop.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a quick but lovely stay! Everything was as described. The location was gorgeous and Ted and Carol have been so thorough in thinking through every detail and creating a welcoming space for their guests. We had trouble lighting the grill (user error) and they responded to help within minutes. We enjoyed meals and a game of Sequence (one of several options provided) on the deck overlooking the river. Wish it would have worked with our travel plans to stay longer. Highly recommend as your top choice for lodging if you’re in the Hannibal area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay! Awesome view of the river!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and a million dollar view on to the Mississippi.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ted's place is situated in the most beautiful surroundings overviewing the Mississippi. Just the porch would justify staying here.
Everything inside is just as described though, too.
We gladly recommend Ted's guest house."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our 20th anniversary weekend. Our expectations were exceeded! Excellent communication from our hosts, and very cute notes inside the guesthouse that explained the amenities and where to find things. Ted and Carol thought of EVERYTHING !! They were both so sweet! We've spent time in a lot of Airbnb's and this is one that really stands out for us! We already booked our next stay there! So grateful for all our hosts did to make this a very special weekend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything we expected. I’d come back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The accommodations were excellent. The guest house was exceptionally clean with a lot of amenities. The surrounding area was beautiful and very private. The views of the river were awesome, and the sunrise was amazing from the large deck. Our host was also very accommodating and communicated with us to check and see if our needs were met. We will definitely book the Rocky Top Guesthouse on our next trip to Hannibal."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My 14 year old great niece and I visited Hannibal and spent 2 nights in the cabin. It was the most comfortable stay of a 10 day trip - having a full kitchen and 2 separate sleeping spaces was so great. We both like our ""space"" and had plenty of it. We would recommend and would return happily!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to Stay Great Views from the Deck ! You will Love it , Can see for miles .. The river view is Awesome !! Everything is so clean ! We had a Great Time !"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I were thrilled with how beautiful this location is.
Fantastic view over the Mississippi River."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I really enjoyed this nice quiet cozy home for my educational seminar at Levering Health. I stayed Mon-Fri and had everything I needed as if I were at home. I utilized instacart and DoorDash for any needs that I didn’t feel like driving for. It was about 12 minutes from Hannibal. The only thing that would have made it better was a TV on the bedroom. But I was too busy working and taking notes to care for this particular trip.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay!! Beautiful watching the Mississippi. Ken pointed out the eagles, Perfect for the dogs. It was hard to leave!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed staying here for a weekend in Hannibal! Spotlessly clean, very comfortable, quiet, and with a great view of the Mississippi that you'll have a difficult time finding elsewhere. My son (11) had a great time watching the barge traffic and was almost beside himself that he could see trains at the bottom of the bluff. Liked that it was just outside of town but still within five minutes of everything. Very relaxing and secluded. The pictures are accurate but I'd have to say the stay was better than expected and Ted was always very responsive. If you're considering this listing, just go ahead and book - you won't regret it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our visit -- the privacy, the clear instructions, the clean house, plus coffee and snacks :). The view from the deck of the river was really special. Would definitely seek out to stay here again next time we are in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Was in a pinch with a dirty hotel and Ted responded quickly and had the place ready within an hour for me to stay somewhere safe and clean for the night
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very welcoming place to stay! Wish we were able to have stayed longer!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful place! The view was great and it was very close and convenient to town and all the sites, shopping and restaurants. Ted provided just the right amenities in the kitchen, and the little photo albums were fun to look at and learn from. Check-in and check-out were both easy. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to any one looking for a place while in Hannibal."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The guest house was fantastic. Great location close to downtown Hannibal and perched on cliff overlooking the Mississippi River. Clean, tastefully furnished and well equipped. I wish my travel plans allowed us to stay longer. Highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We can’t say enough good things about this place. We stayed for just over 2 weeks and enjoyed every morning to the sun coming up over the Mississippi River plus daily Bald Eagle sightings! Ted and Carol greeted us the first day and kept in touch with us regularly throughout our stay; very friendly down-to-earth folks.
The apartment is clean and comfortable, light and airy and even though it is located next to the main house it still felt private.
Outdoors on the deck and down the stairs are well-lit at night.
You won’t regret staying here. It’s very refreshing and good for the soul to get out of the hustle and bustle of city life."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This a remarkable, beautiful getaway overlooking the Mississippi River. The hosts were very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make us feel at home and ensuring that everything was perfect. I wish we could have stayed longer, and will definitely return at the first opportunity. Hannibal is a lovely, historic town with so many great places to visit and shop."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Rocky Top. Once again we enjoyed a relaxing weekend in a very nice place with a gorgeous view on a cliff above the Mississippi River. On the first night it snowed. By the time we were ready to take our fur baby out, the stairs had been completely cleaned off. I have no doubt that we will be back again next year."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second stay here and it was wonderful!!!!
Can’t wait to come back !"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our travel was along the Great River Road routes and this location was a highlight with its amazing views of river traffic and nature - binocs are provided! Such a spacious guest house and deck area. Appreciated the many thoughtful amenities and notes. It was very private and a perfect retreat for exploring the area - many ideas of where to go and what to see! For our November trip, heating was very quiet, comfortable and easy to adjust."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved our stay here! They have everything you would want in an airbnb and were very accommodating. The check in was very easy and the view of the river is gorgeous. We highly recommend staying at this location! :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This stay is what I always envision for an airbnb and rarely have the pleasure of actually having. It was exceptionally clean, comfortable, and easy to navigate. We will certainly stay with our little family again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. So close to downtown Hannibal and the caves with a beautiful bluff view of the river. Ted and Carol are awesome hosts. The Guesthouse is perfect for an individual or a small group. We have used it as a base for day tips or shopping sprees and also as a quiet retreat from the world to get refreshed and renewed. My friends and I try to get there at least once or twice a year.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the setting of this ideal house. Super clean, and beautiful. Teds are nice to work with."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful quiet river view. Quick drive to downtown and great food. Excellent communication. We will stay here again if we come back to Hannibal.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed very much
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We always stay here when visiting Hannibal and consider this place to be part of our vacation. The relaxing feel of this beautiful home combined with the amazing view make this place so special and perfect. The beds are top quality and I could go on for way too long about the fabulous choice of sheets and pillows (so good I bought the same brand for my home). Just can't say enough good things about this house! 💜💜
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The atmosphere was so peaceful. The patio looks like an amazing place to sit and read. The furniture was very comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a delightful stay at Rocky Top! The view of the Mississippi River is wonderful and the slow river pace adds to the tranquil setting. Ted and Carol are great hosts and their property is clean and well maintained. We loved being able to bring our dog, and we’re planning to return so we can step away from life and relax again! Thank you for a great experience!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had another great stay at Rocky Top. Nice weather to sit on the deck and enjoy the great view of the Mississippi River!
As usual, the place was impeccably clean, and the bed comfortable."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, cozy, and what a view! Took care of the little extras, too. Great pet friendly place!! Hope we can get back there someday."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely perfect! Gorgeous view of the Mississippi. Quiet, private and just minutes from downtown Hannibal. Immaculately clean, personal touches, the whole 9 yards!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super place to stay. The view is fabulous. Very clean.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the guest house; very comfortable and the view is so wonderful. We spent a lot of time on the deck, listening to the birds, the trains and watching the river for barges. It's convenient to downtown and we found the Mark Twain museum tour worthwhile."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I wondered why no one complained about anything. Well, now I know. There is nothing to complain about! The Guesthouse is spacious, clean, comfortable, and well appointed.
There are three doors that open onto the deck. I never tired of looking at the river. Sunsets are amazing ... so are sun rises! We ate every meal on the deck. I had my morning coffee there as well as my evening wine. Sitting there was so peaceful and soul nurturing. I really didn't want to leave.
Both our dog and cat were welcomed. Plenty of room for the dog to run outdoors (but no fenced enclosure) and the cat hung out happily in the deck's sunshine.
Tourist attractions are just a few minutes away by car, as were a couple of well stocked grocery stores. Plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as some good salmon that we grilled on the convenient gas grill located just off the deck.
Hosts were friendly and helpful. Communication was clear and easy.
Only one recommendation to future visitors: Use the insect repellant so generously provided by the hosts prior to exploring the grounds. I didn't notice anything so didn't use it. I ended up with LOTS of Chigger Bites. I mean LOTS! They are microscopic mites that hang out in the grass. Lesson learned by this former Midwesterner. Should have known better!
This rental is perfect for a solitary retreat, for couples, and for families. It is a GREAT value.
You will need to carry bags, etc. up a flight of stairs. Not a good place if you can't climb stairs.
Plenty of parking, and everything felt very safe. It's a secluded setting but just off the highway so totally convenient. (There is highway noise and an occasional train. So not super quiet on the deck. Indoors. however, was quiet, and we slept very well.)
One of the best places I've stayed. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a clean and comfortable stay with a spectacular view over the Mississippi River, this guest house is perfect for you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The view is terrific and Ted is a very friendly host and very helpful. We booked another stay before we left.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were only able to stay for one night, but would have LOVED to stay for more. Everything was so organized and clean. We were traveling across the country so the prompt and clear communication from Ted and Carol was SO helpful and eased my travel anxiety. The view in the morning is breathtaking and they went above and beyond with the amenities they provided. I would highly recommend this stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing house. I honestly can’t say enough to describe how beautiful the views are from this home.
We had very peaceful and relaxing stay. The location is easy to get in and out of, and close to town.
Can’t say enough good things about this house and host and would recommend to anyone."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the guest house, it is a gem of a find with a fantastic view. It is extremely comfortable and so nice to have a little home from home when travelling. It is really well presented, soft carpets and lovely furnishings. Would recommend highly."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rocky Top Airbnb is a great place to stay, just outside of Hannibal, MO. The place, located on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, is close enough to town to take in all it has to offer, but private enough to feel like you’re miles and miles from anyone or anything else!
The space inside is very comfortable and welcoming and Ted & Carol have left several helpful notes all around to help you to navigate and find anything you need.
For us, the highlight of Rocky Top has got to be the large deck out back that looks out over the Mississippi River. It’s a beautiful view, not to be missed!
Whenever our visit to Rocky Top ends, we’re already looking ahead to a time when we can book again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The guest house is in a great location overlooking the river, and has a very nice deck on which you can relax and watch the river traffic and wildlife. Ken has great information posted throughout the dwelling. Very clean and comfortable!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and well maintained guesthouse. Ted and Carol were easy to communicate with and check in/check out was easy and straightforward. You can't beat the view from the deck. We saw an eagle fly by right in front of the deck, and we had fun just watching the tug boats juggle all the barge traffic. It is also incredibly quick and easy to get into town from their house. Would 100% recommend their airbnb anyone."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! Your guest house is amazing! SO perfect! So spacious! Everything was so clean and decorated so cute. I loved all the little chalkboard signs everywhere....they were VERY helpful! It was a wonderful place with a spectacular view...And Oh MY...the deck was SO joyous! The view is amazing! And the location of this house is so close to everything. Just minutes away from everywhere we wanted to go. Your house made my vacation with my grandson PERFECT!!! We truly enjoyed Mark Twain and all of our Hannibal sights, but coming back to the house was just as fun because this place was so comfortable and relaxing! We have great memories because of your wonderful home! I will be coming back to this perfect place again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,You will not find a more picturesque place to relax on the Mississippi. Clean and comfortable and plenty of room.

Owner is kind and took the time to greet us when we arrived. Very impressed with everything and definitely plan to return for a longer stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is well worth the stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb gets a “10” from us! Beautiful location; just a few minutes from historic downtown Hannibal. Quiet, clean with a fantastic view of the Mississippi! Ted and Carol not only provide a place to stay but provide the little “extras” that really make staying there a pleasure. We have already made our next reservation and look forward to returning to Rocky Top again soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,If you are ever in Hannibal you have to stay at Rocky Top. The guest house is perfect and the views of the Mississippi and sunsets and sunrises on the deck are the best anywhere
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the deck! The view from the stairs of the lunar eclipse was spectacular, given how quiet it is in this cabin, and how dark. The place is exceptionally clean, well-stocked, with helpful little notes everywhere and notebooks of information about the area, menus from restaurants, photos of the river, and binoculars! It is super private and views of the river are worth every penny of this rental. Easy to find. Very comfortable king bed in the main bedroom; lots of extra pillows and blankets. Ted and Carol were also exceptional in responding to queries quickly. There's a little path for a short walk in the woods, a huge lawn with truly beautiful peonies and irises in bloom while were were there in mid-May. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had (of at least a dozen places around the world between us!)."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely the perfect place to start our Mississippi River Road trip!
Huge deck with plenty of seating overlooking the river. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Good shower pressure.
More spacious than the photos! Great communication from the hosts. Only 1 mile from town, so location was perfect & it was nice & quiet.
Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Rocky Top Guest House on the River, was even better than described. The view overlooking the Mississippi River from the spacious deck was astounding.

It is one of the best rentals we have done. You can’t go wrong renting from Ted & Carol. The location, cleanliness, & view is awesome.
They quickly respond if you need anything. We would go back. Thanks again for a wonderful experience. The Walker’s.
We drove to Ilasco 3 miles south of rental. They have little monuments there that is worth checking out. It won’t take long. We found a brochure in Hannibal Visitor Center to tell us about it."

The hosts have thought of every amenity for your stay and were very thoughtful to provide notes to locate things in the Guesthouse plus included a handful of brochures for the area's activities and some board games!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay and it was even better than the first time because I knew that everything would exceed my expectations. The day before we arrived, it snowed 8+ inches. We were worried about the driveway since it's on a hill, but it was cleared and no ice visible. The stairs had been cleared and salted as well. One of my favorite features of this Airbnb is that they provide a tower fan in the bedroom, which I use for white noise. The ambience is also so peaceful and relaxing. I love opening the curtains in the window to watch the sunrise while drinking my coffee. It's a place I look forward to visiting again!"

It’s so relaxing.
The little notes left around the house were charming and the decor is very homey. When we walked in we were impressed at the cleanliness. If you’re on the fence about booking, book it!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to relax, this is the place. Sit on the patio overlooking the Mississippi River and watch the boats going up and down the river. Keep your eyes out for the eagle."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location and views that come with this place hard to beat! Lovely view of the river, quiet, and very comfortable. Carol and Ted are such sweet hosts. Due to storms, there were some power outages and not only did they inform us of this while we were aware while we were our sight- seeing but they also brought us candles & made sure we had what we needed. Definitely recommend this spot, we will be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, close to restaurants, host very responsive. We will definitely stay again when we visit."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Rocky Top for the wonderful vista and Ted and Carol’s hospitality. The guest house is very clean and well organized. We left Hannibal feeling we’d had a unique experience watching how humans and wild creatures are drawn to the Mississippi River.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing, beautiful, pristine, and so exceptional. The view, the gigantic deck, the comfortable bed, the huge bathroom. The extra personal notes and guidebooks. The kitchen and the spotless, vacuumed home… Amazing… and Hannibal itself is fun to explore, historic and friendly. Dog loved the outdoors around the guesthouse, there’s a little trail leading to a big tree and that was fun. So much to see from the deck. The river is fascinating, the barges and all the maneuvering…"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and great location. View is wonderful from the bluff
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This guest house is fantastic! Just the right size for our family of four. We only stayed one night but it was great. It’s close to downtown Hannibal and has a great view of the Mississippi. We will definitely stay again if we have the chance.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Chloe was an excellent host for our long weekend trip. We arrived later than expected and Chloe stayed up to receive us and made sure we got in safely.
Throughout our trip, we had a few concerns and accommodations we had requested; Chloe was very responsive and helped to meet our needs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We cannot say enough about how beautiful the place was. It was very clean and organized which made our stay so comfortable. The stay was very peaceful which was relaxing. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Chloe is an amazing host! She is extremely accommodating and so helpful! Her place is lovely and was such a peaceful home away from home during my travel nursing contract at the local hospital.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed quiet nights by the fireplace and walkings the dogs to view the beautiful surroundings!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing comfortable weekend. Beautiful! thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Chloe’s place was on a quaint farm and had a nostalgic rustic cowboy feel to it. It was perfect for our single night stay and I will be returning next time I am making the drive from GA to MN!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chloe was the best host, Very informative, and prompt with responses, and had great information on things to do around the area. The space was adorable, and well kept. My daughter and I came out for the weekend and it fit us perfectly.
If you stay here and Chloe suggests a place for dinner because her band is playing, go. You won’t regret it.
Thanks again Chloe, we will be back for sure!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing stay. Chloe responded immediately with any needs we had, especially when we locked ourselves out😄"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chloe’s stable is just the kind of private getaway that you may need! We were hosting a family reunion and blocked off rooms at a hotel, even though we had a block of rooms I was told by the manager of the hotel that local family would not be able to attend our meet and greet since they did not have reservations at the hotel and we were trying to host it at the pool. I reached out to Chloe immediately and she said ""I could definitely have the family come to the Stables! Chloe is an excellent host, with excellent communication with her guest. The Stables are located in a secluded area, we enjoyed a private pool, and the farm animals on property! The ranch styled decor is the perfect addition to such a cozy environment. Definitely a 5 star all around the board! I will be booking again and several members of my family have also stated they would be interested in renting from Chloe in the near future."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice little Airbnb, Great host quiet peaceful place for relaxing a few days. Kids enjoyed the pool and the animals"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chloe was so kind and so friendly and made us feel comfortable and welcome. She was so sweet with our kids and they enjoyed talking to her and getting to feed the animals. It was a nice place to just get away and relax for a few days. We would definitely go back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family enjoyed our stay. We loved the animals and having access to the pool. It's a short drive to historic Hannibal, which was fun to walk around. Chloe was very kind and helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying at Stonehill! This was the 3rd time we’ve been and we plan to go back again. The animals were so fun to play with and the pool was refreshing. A peaceful getaway with plenty to keep you busy.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Vey peaceful and loved the country setting…cute cabin and nice pool and poolside surroundings. Very friendly donkey and cats.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place to stay. Great location, very clean, peaceful, and a bonus of some adorable critters. If we’re ever back in this area, it will be my first choice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED staying at Chloe’s! It was hard to pull ourselves away from the beautiful property to explore Hannibal. The pool, fire pit, and animals kept us entertained our entire visit.
Chloe was very responsive to any questions we had, and respected our privacy throughout! We will definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area, and will visit again! Thank you for a wonderful experience Chloe!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this was our first time staying at an air bnb and it was so simple and this place did not disappoint ! chloe was absolutely wonderful to work with and extremely helpful, always quick to respond to my newbie questions and just all around sweet! 110% recommend her to anyone!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Chloe’s place is amazing! The decor and thoughtful touches Chloe added to the place made it such a memorable stay. The pool and outdoor area was beautiful. It was spacious and the loft wasIt was so wonderful to see their animals around the place. It was very relaxing and our family enjoyed it. Chloe was a pleasure to communicate with and made us feel at home. I high recommend Chloe’s place to anyone looking for a place in Hannibal! We hope to come back one day.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 4th stay at this location, we obviously love it here. Chloe is everything a host should be and so much more. This place is as beautiful as the pics show it to be. We are very comfortable when we stay here. We come from Michigan to visit every year. As we have stayed in the Hannibal area for the past 6 years, we have pretty much seen all the nearby sights. Therefore, we don't leave Chloe's very often, other than to run to town when we need groceries. The landscaping is beautiful and the kids pretty much use the pool all day long. The pool is very clean and inviting. You will love staying here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just got back from our second trip to Stonehill Stables and I can’t say enough good thing about Chloe’s space! Chloe is extremely friendly, and makes you feel right at home. The pool and pool area are well kept, and it’s such a relaxing space to wind down after adventuring in Hannibal. The kittens were the icing on the cake for us this trip! Highly recommend a stay at Chloe’s if you’re looking for something off the beaten path and great for kids!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at this place! Chloe was very helpful and responsive. She does live on site but was respectful of privacy. She was very enjoyable to talk with and gave suggestions on the area. The place itself is just like the pictures. We greatly enjoyed the pool and just relaxing at night in the yard. My kids already want to go back! Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stoneville Stables is an outstanding stay, and Chloe is the host everyone should aspire to. She outlined what to expect, how to check in, and even etiquette tips for those who bring pets. Stoneville Stables is a hop, skip, and jump from Hannibal - a pretty sweet location for arts, music , crafts, and tourists. Stonehill Stables was a great spot for my family and I to play volleyball in the pool and games around the fireplace. After a good night's sleep on what can only be described as angel feathers, we enjoyed coffee on the covered porch each morning. We are already planning a winter trip to Stonehill Stables to visit our sweet host, Chloe, and see how the kittens have grown! If you're looking to stay in a beautiful cabin on a peaceful piece of property just a minute from great food and good entertainment , book your stay today!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host and beautiful property. Our kids loved the animals and we enjoyed the pool. The decor was beautiful and the host was very nice. We will be back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Chloe’s place is definitely the place to be if your going to stay around the area! My family (ages 27,21,2,1) absolutely loved it! It’s exactly like the picture maybe a little more. Chloe makes you feel like family when staying at her place, she gives you privacy but is still there if you need anything at all! It’s the great getaway not to far from the closest towns but far enough away where you don’t have to worry about the outside world. It’s very peaceful and there’s tons to do!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Chloe was very warm and welcoming, despite our Very short notice. Her place is very quiet and peaceful and all of her animals are friendly! Good birdwatching too!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you Chloe, we loved your place"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Chloe is an amazing host. Her place is spotless and she is very responsive to questions. My boys and I had the best time and would stay there again. They loved petting the horse and donkey and feeding them carrots. Chloe is by far the best host we’ve ever had:-)
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay! Chloe went over and beyond to make sure we were cozy for the night - fireplace with ample firewood, lots of blankets, and a couple of space heaters. We’d stay there again when we’re back in the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! The home is conveniently close to Hannibal. We loved Chloe's cabin. Such a cute, cozy place to stay. Our family loved the animals. Chloe was very accommodating, is a prompt communicator, and gave us a great weekend getaway!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chloe's place is wonderful, the location is the best not too far but far enough away to feel like you're at your own home. It's very clean and the animals are an amazing perk, so sweet. I can't wait to see what it's like in the summer with our kiddos!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t say enough about this place. I went to Quincy to visit my grandsons and there were no BNBs available there so I had to go a little farther away and boy am I glad I did! Our grands, ages from 1-5 and two others kids ages 7 & 9 all came to visit at Chloe’s place. The kids absolutely loved the animals and the playground equipment! Such a cool backyard! Loved the lights and all! The inside was perfect for us! Plenty of blankets and pillows for all of them. We loved it and will definitely be staying again in the future!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chloe has a fantastic place. We found the place very clean and quite as it is outside of town. The animals on the property are a plus. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful time. Beautiful place and so quiet. Just a quick overnight & peaceful time.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying here with the pool, animals, friendly host, and location. It wasn’t a problem for us but I do think it’s important to note that the host does live in the same house- just a separate part. It was our first time using an Air BnB and after this experience we would definitely do it again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best air B&B we’ve stayed in. Close enough to anything you would want to do. But far enough away to enjoy the country side. All the animals are fun to pet and talk to. Yes I talk to animals all the time lol. Pool was great also. We’ll definitely be going back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was an awesome little get away. Pictures do not do it justice and it exceeded our expectations. Chloe is an amazing host as well. We will definitely be back with our son as it is extremely family friendly.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stone Hill Stables was the perfect place for our little family of 3 to get away. Chloe was extremely welcoming, and wanted to make sure we would be comfortable during our stay, so I felt right at home! My kids enjoyed the pool, and probably wouldn’t have left it if it hadn’t been rainy and somewhat cooler during our trip. I enjoyed watching them from the deck, loving on a sweet kitty we decided we would call Taco during our stay. We went into Hannibal both days, and there was more to do than we had time for in our 2 night trip! We actually ran into Chloe the first evening in Hannibal and she was extremely helpful and gave us recommendations on where to visit. We had great food, lots of laughs, and made lots of memories. Chloe’s space is the perfect place to spend quality time with people you love. We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our 2nd time staying at Chloe’s place & we’ll be back again! Next time we’re going to stay longer, there’s never enough time. Between exploring the creek, loving on the animals, & relaxing by the pool - there’s plenty to do at Stone Hill Stables."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed every moment of our stay here. Great place for kids to play, swim, and explore."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place justice! When you first drive up, you'll be greeted by a beautiful view and peaceful countryside. The refreshing pool with cheerful landscaping and plenty of deck seating might make you want to forget about whatever other vacation plans you have. Inside is just as welcoming. The huge, gorgeous fireplace and homey decor make you feel immediately at home. You have plenty of room to relax. The shower is good size, the couches are cozy, and the master bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in on my travels. Chloe is a gracious and attentive host. She'll make sure you have everything you need for a relaxing stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charming place and extremely accommodating host. We love it here. This is our 3rd visit since last summer.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Stonehill was great! Chloe's place was spotless and beautifully laid out from inside to outside. It's in a very quite and peaceful place. Our son enjoyed a swim in the pool. We enjoyed supper in Palmyra. We just wish we could've stayed longer.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What a rural treasure! Our stay was excellent and our coincidental timing allowed us to take in a little of Twain on Main to boot. Our night was super peaceful and one of the kitties was thrilled to have us there to give some love and cuddles.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just loved this place. Could spend an hour just taking in all the details Chloe has put into this lovely place. We hope to be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is so nice and good for pets. Chloe also very nice. I left my glasses there and she mailed to me. I will live in the house again if I go to there again！

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Stone Hill Stables was amazing! Chloe was the perfect host and made everything easy for us. It was both a relaxing and fun weekend filled with excitement. The animals were super friendly and a lot of fun to interact with. While the creek was a bit of a trek through some woods and weeds, it was totally worth it and a lot of fun!! We look forward to visiting Stone Hill Stables again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Neat, stylishly appointed. Pleasant country setting. Our lab enjoyed playing with the goat."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to get away, unplug and relax!! Beautiful accommodations and grounds. Hostess was awesome!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Accommodations were exactly as described/ pictured. Will recommend to friends. Perfect place for a getaway with no reason to leave. Everything you need there and plenty to stay entertained.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We throughly enjoyed staying at this charming home for the second time this summer. We have previously seen most of of the tourist sites so spent most of our time in the pool. A cute county setting that only takes about 15 minutes to get to town for site seeing or restaurants. Chole is a wonderful host, making sure you have everything you need."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chloe’s place is super fun, & comfortable. From the comfy beds & couches, to the decor, the pool, & the sweet animals, we loved it all. Very clean, & Chloe is super hospitable. It was great to have family & friends over to enjoy the space too."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great....Very clean and organized. it's really awesome place to unplug and unwind. we loved the animals and Skunk ! we had a girls weekend and it was perfect for the 6 of us. Chloe goes the extra mile to be welcoming and make you feel like family. Cant wait to come back
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chloe's private rental is a cozy and relaxing place to spend your evenings while visiting the attractions in Hannibal. The rental is the cleanest we've ever stayed in - we never saw a speck of dust anywhere! And the pool is so clean!!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is incredible! From the cozy atmosphere to the beautiful decor and landscaping Stone Hill really has it all! Chloe was a wonderful host!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great property. It’s so fun to see the animals and the very friendly dog.
The house is beautifully decorated. This is clearly a property that Chloe takes a lot of pride in. Lots of attention to detail. I mean, even the shower was really nice.
We loved all the extras for families - games, a rocking horse, a toy corner, some baby toys, not to mention the swimming pool and outdoor play set.
Just a few things to note: the Airbnb has an open floor plan with loft. The bedroom is not a separate bedroom (it’s in the loft). And there’s no wifi/internet. However, you will have plenty of private space from the host. We never heard her, so sound is not an issue.
All in all, very accommodating host, beautiful property, great outdoor space."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect for a family getaway! We stayed with our three kids and everyone wishes that we had stayed longer. The house is incredibly clean, the pool is surrounded by beautiful country landscape, the house decor is so fun and comfortable and the hostess is very friendly and helpful! We will definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked Chloe’s place for my son’s 4th birthday and we had a blast! The already beautiful pictures do not do this wonderful place justice, the small touches not seen in the photos really do make it that much more beautiful. The host was very welcoming and helpful. Thank you Chloe!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cute little apartment attached to the host’s home. She is very friendly and willing to help with whatever you might need. My boys loved the pool and playground. Very beautiful area.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a weekend getaway that we would be able to drive to, that wasn’t too far away but not in our backyard, and that would allow us to bring our Jack Russell dog. Luckily, we found Stone Hill Stables situated between the towns of Hannibal and Palmyra, Missouri.
Stone Hill Stables is quiet, peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle of town, but close enough to both Hannibal and Palmyra that you are able to go to a restaurant, shop or visit the local sites if you should choose. But, it also has the amenities that make it so that you don’t have to go anywhere if you don’t want to.
Stone Hill Stables is a welcoming place. When you walk in the door you instantly feel at home with its rustic charm. The cabin is small and attached to the owner’s home, but it is well appointed with all the things you need to stay for a weekend or a week. Lest you be afraid of noise, we heard nothing on the other side of the walls. It is very family friendly even though we didn’t bring any children with us. The cabin was comfortable and everything worked! Have you ever walk into a place and you couldn’t figure out the tv or the microwave? Believe me, it has happened to us. Not here. The dish tv was very self-explanatory and worked from the start. Also, our hostess, Chloe, made sure it was nice and cool on a very hot day. The kitchen is not full sized, but you don’t really need one. Who goes away to bake a cake?? And, even if we had wanted to, Chloe offered her oven if we needed it. There is a gas grill for your use that we did take advantage of. A word of warning to those who have teenagers attached to their phones, there is no wi-fi. This is a great opportunity to come and unplug from the world!
Outside, there was a wonderful swimming pool and a beautiful deck that just calls to you on a hot day. There are horses and a donkey. We even had a small, gray kitten check us out. And, let’s not forget the friendliest dog ever. There is a swing set for children to play on. Believe us, everything was well thought out here for the full family experience.
You want to see the local sites or eat in town? Chloe left informational pamphlets to help make those decisions.
Chloe was a wonderful hostess. She was in contact with us and made sure to let us know she was always able to be reached should we need anything. She was very friendly and willing to get us anything that we felt we needed.
We had a great time at Stone Hill Stables and would have no problem returning."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An extremely charming and cozy home. A pool that keeps pre-teens busy all day and a short drive into Hannibal to go sight seeing or eating out. Chole is an extremely friendly host, very attentive and helpful when needed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at Stone Hill Stables. Chloe was so amazing and friendly And the place was very clean and cozy from the inside to outside.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place, very clean and decorated with beautiful, unique homey touches.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Outstanding hostess !
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to visit Hannibal and get the full experience, you should stay at Chloe's. We booked three nights for my son's birthday. The drive into Hannibal was short, and we were able to see everything we wanted to see and then come home to our country dwelling. The farm animals were a hit with my kids. The place is spotless, and you will feel right at home."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beyond amazing -- clean, quiet, and wait until you seed the charming appointments! Well done, Chloe!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was beautiful and had everything we needed for a few days away from home. The decor was unique and enjoyable. The yard and animals were great bonuses to our trip. Our family of six was very satisfied and will definitely return.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, exactly as pictured, but more with surprising detail everywhere you look. So enjoyed the stay, the fireplace in an ice storm was just what was needed."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peace, quiet, serenity and a sincere heart warming welcome it’s what you can expect from Chloe’s eclectic modern Stone Hill Stable. Sparkling clean with rustic touches that are completely in keeping with the richness of the Missouri countryside. It comes complete with swimming pool, a playground to exhaust and entertain the most rambunctious child, a couple of horses, two goats , a miniature donkey and six of the cutest little kittens you will ever see. Light filled and airy this is the perfect respite for any traveller."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures don't do this space and property justice. It was beautiful! The kittens running around, horses, goats and sweet dog were so fun to interact with. My daughter (and the whole family) had an absolute ball. The pool is well kept and clean (even though it was too chilly for us to swim), as were the living quarters. It is such a cozy, comfy space! Chloe was always readily available if we needed her. She was so kind and an excellent host. Lots of board games to play and everything we needed to cook meals/grill out. All the amenities you could possibly want/need in a relaxing getaway in the country. We wish we could have stayed longer and will be back for sure!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic host and place! Our family of three loved it and and will go there whenever we are in the area for sure. It's close to the city but there are no neighbors within sight. It's a great place to slow down, unwind, and enjoy the animals, stars, and nature. Thanks Chloe!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Chole is an amazing woman the place was beautiful she responds very quickly and helps with whatever she can I really enjoyed my time there and will be going back
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place! Chloe communicated quickly and accurately. Her farm is wonderful. Space is comfortable, clean and decorated great! She has thought of everything. When you are not boating on Mark Twain Lake or touring Hannibal.... you can rest on one of many seating areas.. On the porches, by the pool, along the horse pasture. We were able to pet her goats, horses, dog and play with a litter of baby kittens. Wonderful weekend of play and relaxing! Can't wait to go back. Thanks Chloe!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time! Chloe was absolutely wonderful to work with. She was very welcoming and easy to deal with. We would definitely go back! Thanks for being a great host! Our kids loved being able to see and learn about your animals too.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space. 5 minute walk from restaurants. Comfy bed. Good communication from host. Would stay again.
It is a restored old building, so floors are slanted in spots and there are different levels between rooms. Not a negative at all, but something to be situationally aware of in navigating the apt."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very darling portion of an early 1800s home. It has beautiful character and charm.
Anna's mother took me on a walking tour of the town.
The bedroom was simply lovely. The bathroom sparkling new.
Kitchen, dining room and living room were pristine. Loved it!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful and comfy place to stay! Would recommend to anyone!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Anna's place. Beautiful, very spacious apartment, spotlessly clean, lovely living area. Loved hanging on the couch and especially loved the comfortable king bed with soft linens and a luxurious amount of pillows. I slept great. Shower has excellent water pressure and SO nice offers both a rain showerhead and a handheld.
Palmyra is a quiet and mellow location. I arrived at night and Anna was so thoughtful to leave lights on for me and helped me out when I couldn't find the house in the dark. I would definitely come back.
PS great location for exploring Hannibal or Quincy, and don't overlook Palmyra itself, lots of historic architecture here too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Bigger and better than I even expected!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is an outstanding experience. Beautifully restored apartment in an old home.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfortable accommodations."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a great night stay. Wish we had arrived earlier to enjoy longer. What a beautiful conversion of an old building. As someone who lives in a basic newer rambler, it is cool to stay in a place that has character but redone to have all the amenities and cleanliness of a brand new place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna's place was wonderful. Extremely clean and comfortable. We will certainly stay here again if we are in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We were traveling through Missouri and this was a great place to stop and spend the night. Anna was a great host. She is friendly and was very responsive to any questions we had. Her place had everything we were looking for at a fair price. Thanks Anna. We will be back. 😊
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Historic house with all the character you would expect in a great neighborhood. Feels like home when you walk thru the door. Has everything you'd want for a quick stay or a completely stocked kitchen for a longer trip. I will certainly stay again.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place was lovely and peaceful, and the amenities were just as described. The space was aesthetically very nice and spacious, and it was a great value for the price! We were able to cook easily, the bed was very comfortable, and it was a quiet location. Anna was very responsive to questions and proactive with communication. The only thing that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars was that there was a slight musty smell in the living room, which got a little bothersome if you were in that room for a longer period of time. I’m guessing this was just due to the age of the house. Other than that, everything was great, and I would definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed this property so much, I stayed there twice. Anna does a great job communicating and the location is great."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was clean, comfortable and roomy. All the rooms were nicely decorated. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because there was a musty smell that seemed to irritate my allergies. I know that’s not uncommon in old buildings, so understandable."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great clean and nice apartment, with a separate entrance on the 1st floor. The owners live behind the wall, but I couldn't hear it. All the dishes and pans are available, I really liked it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Anna's place! It was clean, cozy, and relaxing. My husband and I immediately felt like we could rest when we walked into the bedroom and living room. We especially loved the furnace.
We were also pleasantly surprised by the town - it had a great diner and a really cute coffee shop. The swings in the coffee shop were an added bonus."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Met all of our expectations. Bed was comfortable. Will definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have been traveling for a period of time and stayed in five other Airbnb’s across the country and yours was miles above the rest in beauty, cleanliness, location, everything. If I could give more than five stars in every category, I would. I wish we had been staying there for more than one night. We will stay there again if we are back in this area."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kylee's place was far enough away from town that my husband was very happy. We loved the scenic view on the back way driving to Hannibal! With large rooms there was ample space for everyone to stay. This was our first Airbnb stay and we're so happy we chose Kylee's!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. Not only was the pricing the best we could find but the space exceeded our needs as a group with four adults and two children. It was very child friendly as she even had blocks and books set out for our kids and the kids loved seeing the animals. As someone who does not live in a city, I found it felt safe and comfortable to be outside of the city in a rural setting. It was a very pleasant drive each day to Hannibal. I highly recommend this place to others. as"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Met two friends here for a girls weekend getaway. King size bed was nice since two of us were sharing. Didn’t try the sofa bed, but I think the couch itself could have made a nice bed if needed! Kitchen was well-stocked. We even made muffins! Lots and lots of room. Washer and dryer were nice. Surroundings were gorgeous and so peaceful. The 15 to 20 minute drive to everything we wanted to do was scenic. We nearly managed to arrange horse lessons, but decided against it. Owners were kind and left lots of suggestions for food.
Beds were good, not great, pretty soft/bouncy. We slept well!"

WIFI was strong and perfect for steaming movies for family night! Kylee’s hospitality was inviting and kindhearted! Kylee even provided a portable crib, highchair for my baby; and various games/toys for my kids leisure. Her children were also very friendly and kind. They let my kids assist with feeding the animals on their farm and also gave my kids horse rides on their beautiful & well trained Mare, Birdie. The little tourist town of Hannibal, with the Mark Twain Caves is a short 10-15 minute drive away, making the location perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your homestead and contributing to the memories my family will cherish in their hearts forever!
Kindly, The Evans Family"

We had to get on the road right away and it was super helpful. The surroundings were incredibly peaceful.

Sure there are not too many in this area but it’s a historical town with a lot going on. It had a very warm home feeling to it. The beds were extra nice, I loved the wood work and the long tub to soak in. It had a Paris theme and it was onParis road.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We purposely chose to stay at one of Rob's properties in Hannibal, Mo., because we were in one of his houses last year, too. This time, just as before, we were very satisfied with the whole transaction: from the booking and confirmation, through the pre-arrival communications (Rob is so very much on top of his e-mails/messages--we usually get a response from him within just a few minutes' time), the place, the cleanliness, everything.
Both properties we have stayed at were clean and done/decorated with taste. If you are with little kids, though (or big but clumsy ones), I would recommend gathering up the decorative vases, figurines, etc., that are so artfully placed throughout the house, and putting them away because they are prime targets for the curious little hands.
During our second stay, a very minor maintenance issue arose. Rob had a handyman come over within half an hour of messaging him about the issue which was also fixed within minutes.
Great experience both times!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this last minute, and it was a positive experience. Great home, very clean, had everything we needed, and clear communication from the host. Would highly recommend staying here!"

The jack n Jill bathroom had locks on both doors to ensure privacy. We loved being able to sit as couples on two separate couches, and the kitchen and dining area were wonderfully set up as well.

There is a lot of space to spread out. There are family games and media options. We would definitely stay at this Airbnb again if we ever went back to Hannibal.
Note to self: bring my own food to cook next time, since Hannibal apparently doesn’t have good food options."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a month. Everything was great. Rob is very responsive and conscientious. The location is good, near downtown and the freeway. The home is older, but has many nice updates. There is another unit downstairs. Noise wasn't an issue. But, the units do share a thermostat. Overall, I would stay there again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay. The Rose Cottage was immaculate and had everything we needed. Enjoyed the back patio very much it was private and allowed some down time from our adventures. The communication before checking in and after we left the property was right on spot not to mention the bottle of wine and card they left us for our anniversary. We definitely recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location to walk everywhere downtown and riverside. Parking is easy and right out front of the home. We also loved the bonus of the movie theater being only a 10 minute walk with recliners.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a lovely time in Hannibal, MO and at the Rose Cottage. It does not have a full kitchen, but downtown is a short walk away. We particularly liked Java Jive - great coffee and ambiance. Loved the riverboat ride and tour. What was most outstanding were the people. From beginning to end they were kind, thoughtful, helpful and creatively and passionately vested in their community and in putting their best foot forward. I would happily return to the Rose Cottage and Hannibal."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mother and I had a great stay. John and Sharisse's place is just across the street from the Mark Twain's boyhood home museum and Main street, so everything was a VERY easy walk! The cottage was quaint and had a lot of amenities, though no full kitchen, which was not at all a problem given the variety of food around. They definitely know how to decorate on a theme and the cottage was very feminine!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place and right downtown in Hannibal - walkable to the whole historic district. Easy parking, comfortable beds, great shower, nice amenities, cute private back yard/patio, just a great property. Hosts were super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Rose Cottage was perfect. We were meeting my wife's sister and brother-in-law from Iowa. We're from SE Missouri. The home gave us both our privacy and great areas for visiting and catching up. The enclosed area behind the house with the fire table was perfect. They messaged us a few hours early to tell us that the home was ready whenever we were. We were within walking distance of Mark Twain's boyhood home, restaurants, and shops. The place had everything we needed and was very clean and well decorated. Very comfy. They left nothing to be desired. They left us some very thoughtful welcome gifts. We never had a need to reach out to them. Everything was great. Thank you!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great couple of days at the house. it’s located downtown within walking distance to all shops. John and Sharisse were very responsive to all my questions. We will definitely go back and stay at the house again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great visit to Hannibal. John and Sharisse were very helpful. The cottage is adorable and we loved being close to main street so we could go out and walk around, then come back for baby's nap time, and leave again after he woke up and had been fed. The cottage is full of cute little special touches. We thought the beds were comfortable. Loved the complimentary snacks and wine and the back patio is beautiful!
The one thing that we were concerned about was that the train tracks are close and there is traffic. We were worried our 8 month old would wake up a lot. We put him in the back bedroom and he slept like an angel! Definitely was worth it so that we could do more and didn't have to load him up in the car every time we wanted to go out.
Next time we find ourselves in Hannibal, we would love to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, amazing location, comfortable bed, thoughtful snacks and friendly restaurant recommendations. Plus heated toilet!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John and Sharrise are amazing hosts! They were friendly and quick to respond to any messages and questions I had leading up to our stay at the rose cottage. They even left some water, a nice variety of snacks, and a bottle of wine for us to enjoy during our stay!
The Rose Cottage itself is a beautiful, charming house located right at the end of the main drag in Hannibal. We were able to park outside the cottage and walk to just about anywhere in town we wanted to go. Bars, restaurants, tours, cute boutique stores, and (if you need to get your steps in 🤣) the steps leading to the Mark Twain Lighthouse. It was clean, private, and they supplied everything we may have needed for a weekend getaway, including a nice propane fire table which we used while drinking the wine they left for us to enjoy!
We're talking about a return trip this summer, and if we do, we'd definitely stay at the Rose Cottage again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice hosts with excellent communication. We appreciated the welcome treats. Perfectly located in downtown Hannibal, walkable to all restaurants and shops. You can’t beat the location. The home is very clean and we had a lovely stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a sweet and cozy little cottage. Very comfortable and so close to everything Main Street! Enjoyed sitting on the porch having coffee in the morning and on the back patio in the evening. It was a perfect home base for our adventures in Hannibal!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was clean, comfortable, and perfectly situated for exploring downtown. I watched boats and trains pass on the other side of the levee, did some people watching from the front porch, and climbed the hill to the Hannibal Lighthouse above the cottage. However busy the traffic downtown, we always found parking in front of the cottage. By evening, the cottage was quiet and peaceful, despite any passing trains or local traffic (which really was sparse at night). The back patio was charming and private, like a secret garden behind the house. The beds and the furniture were comfortable. We used and appreciated the Keurig coffee maker, the retro fridge, the icemaker, television, and especially the birthday balloons for my daughter and anniversary gift for me and my husband. I would absolutely stay here again. I have been to Hannibal many times, and never had as pleasant a lodging experience as this."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved how close it was to Main Street easy walk thank you
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm pretty sure you couldn't stay in any better place for exploring Hannibal than here. Practically every attraction is walkable with lots of restaurants and interesting shops just steps away. The generous hosts provided toiletries, lots of snacks, and helpful guides and were very communicative. I highly recommend visiting Hannibal (whether you're a big Mark Twain fan or not) and staying here when you do."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very cute cottage! had a great time!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was pristine and well decorated. It was walking distance to all of the downtown Hannibal restaurants, coffee cafes, shops, and museums. it was a 5 minute drive to Mark Twain caves and the winery. It was a 25 minute easy drive to Mark Twain Lake with park, trails, swimming beach, and marina. The cottage had 2 bedrooms, living room with large TV and games, comfortable queen beds, a nice private, outdoor patio with outdoor furniture and fire pit, washer/dryer, snacks, complimentary bottles of water and a complimentary bottle of wine, quality bath products and linens. Small kitchen has no stove/oven, but has a refrigerator, icemaker, microwave, and dishes. (When we travel, we avoid cooking!). Very responsive host. Excellent getaway for couples, family of 4, or girls getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house! Location was the best part, especially slower walkers."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barb and Pattee were generous, informative, and had great communication. The Travelers Rooming House has an excellent location and we greatly enjoyed our stay in the Woodsman. Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely going to stay again. Throughly enjoyed myself despite the circumstances of my trip.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Hannibal. There is a sign with the history of the building that was interesting. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.

Laurie and Roy"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barb’s place is great! Everything was as described and Barb was very communicative throughout our stay. Everything was clean and we loved the cozy feel of the place and the history behind it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room, with many high quality and interesting finishes. Great location to explore Hannibal for a few days. Hannibal was pretty quiet when we were there (very early Spring) but we had nice weather and had a great weekend trip."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just wanted to get away and we didn't want to drive for hours. We live near Hannibal, MO. I saw the room online and thought it would be worth it just to stay in that room, and the room did not diappoint. I cannot believe the attention to detail that was put into the room. The wood seems to have been from an old barn, which Barb cleverly displayed a picture of in the kitchen. The claw foot tub was a fun experience, and the ceilings were beautifully done. The locks were easy to use and required no key from us, which I appreciated a lot! We had a great time walking around downtown Hannibal and shopping. The local restaurants also did not disappoint. I would love to chat with Barb sometime and hear the stories of how she renovated the room (not to mention the other rooms in the building!)! Thank you for such a memorable stay! We loved it!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The room was lovely and well appointed with all the things one might need when traveling (water, snacks, coffee, toiletries). Barb even went out of her way to decorate for Valentine's and leave us a special treat! We really liked the room. The only downside was that multiple trains came through town and sounded their horns very close to our windows. This happened between 10-11 pm but then I never heard another train. Barb did provide ear plugs, so there is a potential remedy. I would still stay here again when I visit Hannibal."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Always love staying here going on 4 years making a tradition at this lovely historical space 😊
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay!! We will definitely be back again!! Barb has put alot of work into her airbnb. The entire building was clean and plenty of snacks and drinks available. The decore was beautiful cant wait to come back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW! Such a unique place, with LOTS of history. The host was responsive and helpful with recommendations to maximize ease of stay. We will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Snuggled in the heart of downtown Hannibal, quick access to coffee shop, restaurants, bars, shopping. Suite was comfortable and cozy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our room, the decor and the location was perfect. We can’t wait to come back for another visit! Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Woodsman was beautiful decorated and roomy. Probably the nicest Airbnb’s we have stayed at and there have been many. We visited the local shops, went to a movie and walked the Mississippi which was a very nice walk. Hannibal was a neat place to visit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable.
Nice location."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, centralized location!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful! What a gem!! Everything, the location, decor, communication, cleanliness were impeccable. Everything was within walking distance. You can gaze down at the busseling street or peak at the Mississippi. Coffee and food are within steps of the building. The coziness and asthetitic of the room create a comfortable, homey environment! Barb has thought of every detail. communication was great from start to finish! We will definitely return!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I visited Hannibal the first time for our anniversary. We stayed in the Woodmans Suite. Everything was perfect and looked exactly like the photos. We were worried it would be warm, staying on the third floor, but it was not at all. The temperature was perfect! The room was so detailed and clean. It was within walking distance to all kinds of fun activities and the history of Hannibal. Barb also had great recommendations for us. We would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The woodsman sweet was spectacular! Very good taste in lighting, color, theme, and comfort. The host is friendly, helpful, and responds quickly to messages and calls. If we stay in Hannibal again, we will definitely go back here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved everything about our stay in The Woodsman Suite! From the easy and well explained check-in process to all of the thoughtful extras, we couldn't have been more pleased. Perfectly located, a real boutique feel tucked in between store fronts, and opening up into two floors of rooms that display a host's creativity come to life. Although, we're excited to come back and check out The Royal Suite, we were pleased with our choice as the access to the lovely rooftop patio was just down the hallway.
If you're staying in Hannibal, there should be no other option!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rooming house has wonderful character and the furnishings were perfect for the different rooms. I was able to tour the other rooms because a very nice lady let me see them. We enjoyed our stay very much! The outside terrace was nice to go to when you wanted to sit and read, or get some sun. I will definitely stay here again when we come back through Hannibal.
Malynn"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came her for a birthday weekend getaway & this place was AWESOME. From the decor, the space, the cleanliness, the big bathtub. She even had small snacks provided & bathroom essentials available to us to use. I was very surprised. Just everything was so clean & open. I loved the space. The outdoor patio was nice to sit at. We even enjoyed hearing the train go by. You have view of the lighthouse! Walking distance to everything downtown! I liked how secure & locked the building was & our room. I like being able to use a code for entrance. The temperature was perfect & at our control. I was just impressed. High recommendation on our end!! Thanks again! She was a great host who sent wonderful instructions & checked in with us often to make sure all was going okay. I appreciate that. She felt close if we needed to contact her!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed in the Woodsman Suite and the room was wonderful. Very clean and very cool style. Lots of natural light during the day and amazing shutters which work wonderfully at night. We would certainly stay again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice stay!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful amazing suite!!! Loved all the little extras! Will definitely book again!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying in the Woodman Suite!! The room was so unique and gorgeous. It was cozy, but very roomy. Very comfortable, and so much detail! It was a great location, we walked everywhere. We’ve already decided to come back this summer!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway. All the little extras were amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a romantic getaway.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay, great location, we’ll be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Love staying always!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the design of the Woodsman Suite which you can see well in the pictures. And the unique window shades, or doors rather, were a unique touch (among other things) and effective at keeping the room dark. Be prepared to take your luggage up a couple long flights of stairs. Outside it's a very walkable area but we were there New Year's Day so most places were closed until the next morning. Shout to to Jet's Palace for being one of the only places open and an excellent take-out experience and to Barb for the bottles of prosecco for New Years! We only stayed the one night while passing through and the following morning was foggy, so we were limited in what we could see and do and kinda wished we were there longer."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our accommodations were beautiful and charming. I find the room so interesting. We were in awe of the craftsmanship. We loved being able to look out our windows and see all of Main St. and the beautiful Christmas Decorations and lights. We will definitely come again!!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,So comfy and cozy. Loved the place. And the bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in in a while! Felt at home and at ease the whole time.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I had a wonderful time. It was especially enhanced by The Woodsman Suite and Barb/Patti. All was exactly as described and how excited we were to have timed our visit with the Hannibal Winter Festival. What a very festive visit!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful place with a great view of downtown. We parked the car when we checked in and just walked everywhere we wanted to go. There were very nice touches provided by the host in the room that made it very fun and unique and gave information about the town. I would stay here again and hope to in the summer months to do some hiking in the area. If you want to stay in a unique older building that was been updated with all the amenities you could want this is the place to stay. There is an active train crossing nearby so if that noise bothers you the listing is accurate that this might not be your spot.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,this place is awesome
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying. The rooftop area was a wonderful surprise as last time it was in the middle of a snow storm. Amazing place. We will go back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely room with beautiful accents and little touches throughout.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good location…beautiful room with a nice mix of historical and industrial touches. The street music was very nice and there are plenty of eating places within walking distance. The big heavy windows could be open or shut to mute any outside street noise. A nice stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a fantastic long weekend at the Travelers Rooming House in the Woodsman Suite! Barb and Pattee were wonderful hosts—I messaged them with a few questions before booking, and they responded very quickly with tons of helpful information. Parking and check in was very easy, and once we saw our room we were blown away! Barb and Pattee have clearly put tons of love and care into every aspect of the room—the suite was incredibly comfortable, and there were so many thoughtful small touches that made our stay a delight. Just a few examples include: yummy snacks in the room, chilled wine glasses ready in the freezer, coupons for the delicious coffee shop next door, and umbrellas conveniently placed in the hallway in case of rain! In addition to the comfort and amenities, the location of the Travelers Rooming House really can’t be beat—it’s right in the middle of town within easy walking distance of all the main attractions. Our weekend flew by with all of the fun activities in Hannibal—we were hoping for a relaxing, fun, easygoing trip, and that’s exactly what we got! Thanks so much, Barb and Pattee, we hope to come back soon!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay. Within walking distance of several shops downtown.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This room is right in the middle of downtown. Absolutely beautiful room.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. We arrived to find snacks and some samples from area stores. Contactless check in. Everything we needed. The doors on the windows block out the light if you want to sleep in. Beautiful place with so many thoughtful touches.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice private studio apartment in a great location. We were able to walk to all of our destinations . The vouchers to the bakery next door is a great addition.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome location gorgeous place to stay in Hannibal!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place made for a perfect winter getaway. You'll feel like you're in a beautifully crafted wood cabin a million miles from anywhere, only there's a fascinating historic downtown area on your doorstep. The suite is very spacious and cozy, we had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. We booked at short notice and everything was easy, even the parking. Communication was excellent, the staff were kind and we felt very well accommodated."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in old downtown historic Hannibal. The room was greatly appointed with everything you would need for a weekend getaway. They even had vouchers for the coffee place downstairs. Our suite was on the top floor overlooking Main Street which was cool. The attention to detail on the remodel of the place is impeccable. The only downside I could see is the stairs are kinda narrow and steep. We will definitely be back to stay again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and unit. The place was exactly as described and in pictures. The rear roof top deck was terrific and should get more pictures and mention in the ads for the place! Check in and out was super easy and the owner was easy and quick with any communication. Great weekend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Barb’s place. She has thought of absolutely EVERYTHING. We would love to have the opportunity to come back and stay at her place. It is immaculate. We highly recommend it to anyone. She kindly gave us a tour of her other rooms in the house, she’s a creative genius. If you’re going to Hannibal this is the place to stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful weekend getaway! Super cute!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed in the woodsman suite for 5 days and it was fantastic! The detail in the room was amazing and I loved sitting by the window to watch the sun set. Definitely recommend staying here if you're wanting to visit Hannibal.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful suite located right on Main Street! This rental was very clean and beautifully decorated. The hostesses left us little extra surprises that were very much appreciated! This is a very cozy room, had everything we needed for our 2 day stay in Hannibal. The train a block over is no joke! :) If you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs! We would definitely stay here again and I would actually love to peek at the other rooms, because I'm sure they're all super nice! ...oh and that claw foot tub! I felt like a queen! :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, even better location and great accommodations!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVE the place and the history of the wood work. I’ll recommend it to any friends headed to Hannibal!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"You will be a better human after your stay in this place. It's both modern and connected to yesteryear. Very well designed and curated. One of our best Airbnb experiences.
If you're on the fence with another place, this suite is a no-brainer on which way to go."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay! The woodwork is intricate and so well done. Gorgeous view of Hannibal and the river. Loved our time here!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was absolutely perfect. If visiting Hannibal this is definitely the best!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"GORGEOUS accommodation with the perfect mix of modern niceties and historical charm. We just loved the place. The room was comfortably set up for two and had anything you might need and then some!
We loved it being on the main strip of Hannibal but that did add a little street noise and train whistle when it was time to sleep. However, THAT'S the experience that this little, quaint downtown Hannibal offers. You will enjoy this third floor apartment meant to be a step back in time. Lovely, lovely place. 👍"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful place! The pictures don’t do it justice!! Location is amazing and easy to get to! Shops, food, river walk, all right outside the door! I wish my daughter and I would have been able to stay more than one night!!
Super clean! High end bathroom products!! Just some things to be aware of: There are two flights of stairs to go up with your luggage. There is a train track along the river very close and the train came through during the night three times making its presence known!! Lol We weren’t bothered by either of those, but some people might be. Amazing host!! Definitely want to go back!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We recently stayed in Hannibal at Barb's Woodsman Suite and were blown away by both the extreme cleanliness and all of her extra personal touches! The bed, clawfoot tub and kitchen all exceeded our expectations. Barb also supplied us with many local ideas (and gift cards!) to enjoy our stay as safely as possible during COVID. Thank you A+++"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great spot. You will be in awe of the beautiful woodworking in this suite and the location is perfect. The suite was clean and attention was paid to every detail. Will stay here again!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Woodsman Suite. The room was decorated so nice and it was super cozy! There were tons of amenities available and the location was great! The only thing we noticed was the guest cannot control the temperature of the room and the noise level from outside traffic is kinda loud, neither of which bothered us but I figured it was note worthy. The bed was also very comfortable, we would highly recommend this room!!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This room is amazing, and overlooks downtown Main St!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really nice stay in Hannibal. Not only is Barb's place in a great part of town, it's very stylish and comfortable to stay in. We'd love to revisit again!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in a well done space on 3rd floor of a restored building on Main St. in downtown Hannibal.

We didn’t mind the railroad noise and loved the historic nature of the place. Would definitely stay there again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfection! Amazingly cool space. Super comfortable. Fantastic extras like gorgeous clawfoot tub (bath bomb included!!) Lots of snacks, water, coffee and tea, candles on the wall, fireplace, huge tv with every channel. SUPER sparkling clean. The only think we didnt like was that it was not available for our entire visit!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our rental was beautiful & unique! The location can’t be beat for shopping, dining, & tourist activities. The facility was sparking clean!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous! Loved all of the woodwork. Picture perfect!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Woodsman Suite was amazing! Such a nice place to come back to at the end of the day. The style and care put into the building was spectacular. You couldn’t ask for a better location. Right in the heart of this adorable town. We did an impromptu stop in Hannibal and Barb was quick to respond, had no problem letting us book a last minute reservation and sure the room was ready. The building is easy to find, ample parking on street and checking was simple. We would surely stay again. I really wanted to check out every room."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"More than just a place to stay, never wanted to leave the room!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, right downtown!!!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barb is without a doubt a stellar host. She has been in the hospitality business for several years and it shows.

The little touches and thoughtful amenities make this place an excellent place to relax and enjoy all that historic downtown Hannibal has to offer."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, charming, pampered. Staying here felt like a step back in time - we wanted time to freeze!"

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is great place to stay. Right on the main street of town and close to everything. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Really enjoyed being able to walk downstairs and get coffee in the morning. The room is very nice, clean, and well decorated. The shades are nice and dark so you can sleep in. You can hear the trains and some street noise. Parking was plentiful, and getting in and out of the building was very easy. Enjoyed our stay a lot!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we entered our key-code into the exterior door to our (sad) final trip down the front stairs, we felt like treasured guests on a visit through history. While every bit of this stay included modern day comforts - complete with high-end luxurious bedding, blankets we melted into, bath mats that made us want to dance our way out of the claw-foot tub, a three-tiered tray with a mix of snacks, local sodas and candy, a coffee maker with fresh beans from Java Jive next door, bath and hair products that were spa-worthy, a hair dryer and straightener in case we wanted to fancy up before the Mark Twain performance, and a giftwrapped toothbrush and toothpaste for each of us, our imaginations ran wild with all that must have happened in this beautiful building and our amazing room. The painstaking rehab that was done to bring this historic building to its modern day glory is so appreciated, and will be remembered long into our future."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kickback and relax with all you need for a great time in Hannibal

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked this room when looking for a place to stay for a night while traveling through Hannibal. We found it in the Hannibal website and gave it a try. The pictures were spot on. The kids loved it and it was very convenient for walking around downtown. Thanks for the experience!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about this place was super cute and home-y. We loved how convenient it was to just pop back up to our room to drop off our shopping wares and then come right back downstairs. The mattress was super comfortable, and the views of Main Street and the river were great. Check in and out and parking were super easy and convenient. If you’re thinking of staying here, do it!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna respilonded very quickly to my questions. Her home is very clean and is in a lovely small town. The linens & bedding are lovely! It is a close drive to the community nursing home where my Mother resides, which made it such an easy commute back & forth for visits. I felt very safe which was important to me."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Old but beautiful. And very nicely priced. Loved the look of the master bedroom. Anna was very responsive and a great host. The place was very clean and comfortable. Thank you for the awesome experience.

The upstairs was a bit warm when we arrived but there is a window ac and fans so we were able to cool the bedroom down. If you like a plush mattress, you will love the mattresses here."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time that I have stayed here. It had all the accommodations that were needed and also personal touches. Enjoyed sitting on the front porch. Palmyra is a healthy, striving small town and the location is accessible to all other activities. I will definitely stay here again. Anna was responsive and welcoming."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Anna was wonderful!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was amazing! Super cute and she even had it decorated for St. Patrick's Day when we visited. The whole place felt very clean and had everything we needed. It even had a few drawers of games and puzzles that we were able to use in the evening!
The only downside is that the bedrooms didn't really match the description. There is really only 1 bedroom that had two beds in it. The 2nd ""bedroom"" is just bed on the landing at the top of the stairs that you pass through to get to the actual bedroom. The 3rd ""bedroom"" is just a sofa that can be laid flat in the main living area/kitchen. This was perfect for our family as we didn't need the privacy, but if we were expecting private spaces it did not exist.
Overall, we still give this amazing place 5 stars. It felt cozy, clean, cute and very comfortable to stay in. We would love to stay there again if we are ever in the area!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely adorable!! My 14 year old went on and on about how cute it was!

I would recommend and would stay here again!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here two different nights at the 1/2 way point of our travels to Kansas City. The place is BEAUTIFUL, very inviting, clean and comfortable. Anna is awesome and a top notch host! We will definitely stay again in the future!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home at Anna’s! The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you’d need. It was very cozy and all the beds were SO comfortable!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most charming air bnb! On a minute’s notice Anna was ready for us. We booked last minute and what a joy it was to stay there. From the mattresses, to the coffee, to the clean cute environment, it was all perfect and close to the cutest shops! If I am ever in the area again, we will certainly be staying here!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna’s place was immaculate. Everything about our stay was fantastic. Thanks for having us!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I love old houses so this was a good experience. She represented things well in her description. It does have an ambitious amount of stairs to 2nd floor but was not hard for someone who has no problems with steps. I do caution people about the upstairs thresholds which are higher than what most people expect could be a tripping hazard. The kitchen was clean with dishes available to use full size stove and fridge. A nice table for dining right near kitchen. The bedroom was huge!! it gave it a historical feel. if you go thru this way again would stay here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Nice & clean !
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very short stay, but the place was immaculate, you could tell the host has put effort into every detail."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was cute as can be. Bed was very comfortable. It was like home away from home.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is in an old house, which is at least 100 years old. If you like 10 foot ceilings, and 8 foot tall floor to almost ceiling windows, then this is the place for you. Although the kitchen and bathrooms have been updated, it’s still an older home that Anna is working hard to maintain and update. There is some renovation and when we stayed in October 2023, there was some wallpaper being taken down so I hope that will be all done soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful, clean and spacious."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was an absolute pleasure to stay here, beautiful location with a quiet neighborhood. Went camping the night before and felt like I was in a 5 star hotel once I stepped in the door way, everything was clean, easy to find, and the beds were amazing. A great deal for the price!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home in a beautiful area!! Anna was very responsive to any of the questions we had. The check in process was super simple. It was very clean throughout and the style of the house is to die for!! Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay at the last minute, and Anna was so accommodating! I've stayed at a lot of airbnb's, and Anna was by far the most attentive host we've ever had! Plus, the rental was bigger than I expected, and the decor was lovely. You could tell that a lot of thoughtfulness, love, and care has gone into this airbnb."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna's home is an Excellent location between Hannibal, MO and Quincy, IL which we had plans in both cities."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful home and the bed was divinely comfortable. The kitchen was well appointed and had everything we needed to make our meals.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna’s place was charming and clean, and well situated for our travels between NE Iowa and central Missouri. We arrived during a heatwave, but the air conditioning was robust and effective, even on the second floor of this very old building. We enjoyed a nighttime walk around the surrounding area — so many lovely old houses! My only warning would be to folks who don’t do stairs well, as there are lots of them — and both toilets are on the ground floor, so if you need to use one at night, it’s a bit of a walk."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute house. Well equipt
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The two bathrooms on the main floor were new and spotless as was the newly remodeled kitchen. The house is a work in progress but nice.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. It is perfect for a group of 4 or less. We were in Palmyra for a family event and we’re happy to find this AirBNB! It is on Main St so walkable to 2 coffee shops, grocery store, and downtown restaurants. Great location!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was cool. I love older home. It was close to the job site and gas station. I will be recommending her place to other traveling union trades.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location in relation to coffee shops, ice cream, and restaurants! Very clean and spacious. Beds were also extremely comfortable!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very clean"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location. The town is super cute, safe, and an at home feel. Anna has decorated the space beautifully, and it was so clean. It's walking distance to Carter coffee and The Rebal Pig, both a huge must try. We would definitely stay again, but if you are a nighttime bathroom visitor, you will have a little travel back downstairs as this is an old house, and there is no plumbing upstairs."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is awesome! Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My kids and I were not in the apartment a lot over our weekend trip to Hannibal, but it was clean and spacious for our small group. Definitely with the short drive from Hannibal. Check out was very easy as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place and host comunicares really well
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Seriously one of the cutest places I’ve stayed. I was only in town for a two day workshop and wish I could have stayed longer! Lots of space and have done a great job with a historical place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Anna has a very charming place. Small town feel and vibe lent to easy walking to explore the town and visit local eateries. A short drive to Hannibal made for easy access to tourist sites.
If I visit the area again, I would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is fantastic! Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice alternative to staying in Hannibal just a few miles away. Came into town to participate in the annual Hannibal Cannibal race, and was pleased to find this amazing value. Both my kids felt right at home and the master bedroom is spacious. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a very spacious place. The bathroom was super clean and the shower was
quite nice. One of the twin beds is in the kitchen - so there is not a great deal of privacy.
Also, the person sleeping on that bed can hear all of the noise from the bathroom.
We enjoyed a visit to Riverside Park. We watched a barge go through an open bridge."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely perfect and Anna was an amazing host. Our daughter will be attending college in that area and we hope be able to stay again in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely space and so tastefully decorated. Squeaky clean.:). Anna was quick to respond to any communication. Quiet location and peaceful. We also recommend Carter’s Coffee Bar down the street. Would definitely stay there again if we were in the area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved the cozy entryway and to see the old architectural designs from the cool old wooden screen latch door to the transom over the door and big old shuttered windows and vaulted entryway ceiling and push button light switches…The place was beautifully updated below and very well air conditioned on a hot day. I slept downstairs- the bedroom upstairs is massive and could easily have another bed or couch. The bed was comfortable and the shower nice and warm. The town was neat to explore - and I enjoyed walking the nature areas down in Flower City Park.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Had a very nice stay-sweet spot and sweet front porch, easy instructions and getting in, the place was very clean and easy, check out.
Will stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna was very quick to respond to any inquiries. The house was very clean and well-stocked with towels. A very nice stay!!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great, very close to downtown, and perfect for our needs!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was beyond my expectation! Beautiful decor. Clean through out. Air conditioning worked well. Bathroom spotless and well supplied.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna’s place is lovely! Very clean and cute and in a great location. Easily walkable to shops and restaurants and within very short driving distance to other stores. We really liked Carter’s Coffee Bar that was just a couple blocks away. The beds were comfy and the kitchen had everything we needed.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully designed shabby chic farm house! Clean, tidy and plenty of space. We walked to a local pizza place right down the street for dinner. We enjoyed our short stay and breakfast on the porch."
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Pros:
~ Extremely clean, even though the home is over 100 years old
~ Bed in the bedroom was very comfortable
Cons:
~ The main bathroom is *in* the kitchen/dining room. It doesn't feel like a separate room because the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling. There is about a 2-foot gap above the bathroom dividing wall. This means that everyone at the table (6-8 feet away) can hear (and smell) everything that's happening in the bathroom. That was a bit disconcerting. The latch on the bathroom door hardly catches either, so if someone comes (like a small child) and leans on the door, it comes open.
~ The bedroom walls are in need of repair. I think they're going for a shabby/chic look, but it really just looks like they ran out of time to repair the old walls. My 1 ½ year old was pretty scared of the room."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I are repeat customers, and that says something about Anna & her place. We will book again if available when in the area"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We found the place clean & thought it to be very nice. The furnishings were quite comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely clean and cozy, comfy bed and day bed on main floor is a nice option with lots of pillows too! Shower is hot with good water pressure. Great communication for check in and any questions i had."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB is a lovely updated older home. Anna was an excellent host. She was very friendly and proactive in communicating with us, and she provided some great restaurant recommendations. The home was impeccably clean with comfortable furnishings. The home is located on Main Street, and it is very easy to walk to local restaurants and a new coffee shop called Carter’s Coffee - definitely a must-visit!
Side note for older or mobility-challenged visitors: the stairs to access the bedroom in the home are very steep, and the bathrooms are on the first floor, so going up and down the stairs might be a challenge for some individuals."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable day bed in main level perfect for my needs, ac and heat work well on main floor. Kitchen well stocked with dishes."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our girls trip! Very clean and comfortable. Anna is so kind and very quick to respond. We had the best time!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and quiet place and town to stay in. The rental space was put together very nicely and was squeaky clean! Would stay again for sure!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place worked out excellent for me as I was working nearby and helped me lessen my commute to my customer. The price was actually less than what most of the hotels I usually stay in charge per night for much less of of a room and space. This apartment is has a rustic appeal while also having very up to date features. Very cozy place for a couple, and maybe those with a young child or two.
The only complaint I personally could make is that I am getting up there in years and climbing stairs to get to the bedroom began to get somewhat painful after also climbing up on ladders at my customer's site all week...but that is just me and my old knees."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Slept well in a comfortable bed.
Quiet and peaceful"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Anna's place was a charming stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna has a very clean and safe place. I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs to stay in Palmrya.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna's place was just as described and portrayed in the photos, if not better. It was immaculate inside, as well as beautiful and unique and had everything we needed. She was wonderful with communication and instructions and we would 100% stay there again. We were looking for a quiet place to stay outside of Hannibal - but still close - and this fit the bill. Thank you, Anna!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for a quick family visit!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful place! Palmyra is a lovely town near Hannibal and this Airbnb is a cool place to stay! Perfect for two but does have space for 4. Super clean, quiet. Note: bathroom is not on the same floor as the master bedroom. But the kitchen area is very quaint and wonderful for coffee in the morning! Great towels for a warm shower! The front porch was festive for Christmas Day! Thank you Anna! We will see you again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cool style. Beautiful place and lovely host.

It's an older house and an unusual set-up, but it had everything we needed and we'd highly recommend it to anyone! Nice, safe neighborhood and a short drive to Hannibal, MO - we recommend the Mark Twain riverboat cruise!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an awesome value! You get a huge space (main floor large sitting area, day bed, well equipped kitchen, dining area with Keurig, bathroom and a half. Upstairs is another day bed, and a huge bedroom with a TV). The queen size bed upstairs was super comfy! Everything is cute and VERY clean, and smells GREAT!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely home in a small town. Anna was wonderful & quick to respond to an impromptu request which we were grateful for! A much needed overnight stop was made even better staying in this historic home with loads of character & some modern updates. Would highly recommend! Thank you Anna! Sipping coffee on the front porch In the rain was beyond perfect. This is very close to Hannibal as well… didn’t get to visit this trip but we’ve been before & this would be a great place to stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it! Very cute town with spacious rooms.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this cute place! We got in late around 9 PM after doing the ghost tour in Hannibal so we didn’t have a lot of time to enjoy it, but we had a lot of fun discussing the potential history of the home, why/ how it was designed etc. Happy to report no ghosts :)! It’s a really unique place, super clean, and like everyone else said we had a great night’s sleep in comfy beds with great bedding. We took a nice quick walk through town in the morning, and checked out some of the historical homes up and down Main Street. Anna was very responsive and she’s done a great job with this cute 1910 home. Would very much recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location and very clean!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely adored this immaculately restored farmhouse style rental. It had everything we needed. The kitchenette afforded a nice space to sit in, the upstairs bedroom was comfortable and extremely roomy. What a beautifully restored home with just the right amount of modern amenities, yet still maintaining the charm of the original build. Located off the main street , it was quiet and we slept in late. Anna was extremely receptive to any questions we had. Checkin was seamless and everything was as described. Thank you for sharing your home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charmingly decorated historic house! Very comfortable and clean. Host was very responsive with advice for us to grab some groceries. If our travels take us to Palmyra again, we’d stay here for sure."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a place to retreat to if you need a quiet environment. The place was clean and comfortable, with a fully-functioning kitchen where we could do all our cooking. The bed is very soft, so be aware of that if you need a firm mattress. We found this place a welcome, restful respite in a busy schedule."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was so great!! It was a great location, only about 15 minutes from all the wonderful things to do in Hannibal. The area was very safe and quiet at night! The beds were super comfortable, the house was so cute and clean, and the shower was amazing!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were traveling back from TX to Chicago and we were really exhausted and getting late at night. I knew we couldn't make it all the way and Found Anna's place but wasn't sure if It was to late for her to accept our stay. Anna quickly responded and accepted our stay and sent me all the info. We had a peace of mind knowing that my wife and kids had a clean place to rest for the night.
Anna's home is kind of a unique and antique looking house with lots of beautiful touches. It was an unique experience staying at Anna's home. Our kids enjoyed the night. Very quiet neighborhood and easy to find parking.
Big thanks to Anna for accepting our last minute reservation!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cool place. Loved the decor. The one twin bed is in a loft like area at the top of the stairs and right outside the bedroom. I didn’t realize it wouldn’t be in a bedroom also, so just mentioning it’s not a private space. Sorta private, but not really! It’s also a little warm in that space. Window AC in bedroom worked great. Downstairs (main floor) was cool and the bed/sofa there was comfortable. There is a door on that space that you could close and make private if you wanted. At first, we didn’t notice the second restroom. It’s under the stairs (toilet/sink only). Just down the street were restaurants we walked to. Glad we stayed here. Would recommend."

(I know someone else mentioned it, but it smelled so good!) 😃 As 3 friends staying for a girls’ trip, we really appreciated having the extra half bath. I would stay again if I’m ever in the area!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, quaint apartment in downtown Palmyra. Neighborhood is safe and quiet, with huge beautiful trees and historical houses. Walking distance to grocery store. The apartment is very clean and well stocked. Our family of 4 didn’t lack for anything! Spacious rooms complete with board games which kept the kids entertained. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute duplex was just as shown! Super cute and clean. The weather was perfect for sitting on the front porch a couple hours & chatting. My husband learned a new term ""shabby chic""😄. I loved the fresh bag of ice in the freezer instead of ice trays that are who knows how old😬 Visited Hannibal one day and Quincey the next, then went back to Hannibal as there wasn't much in Quincey, especially on a Sunday. Really can't say enough good about our stay at Anna's!!! Highly recommend❤️"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"sweet apartment , centrally located in Palmyra. tastefully decorated. throughly enjoyed our home away from home while visiting family in the area.
Thank you again Anna."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute! Everything was perfect. We didn’t want to leave!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, peaceful, restful place to stop for a good night’s sleep while on the road. Host is super responsive and helpful. Beds are sooo comfy! Heads up that the full bathroom’s walls don’t reach the ceiling (“loft style” open floor plan), but the 1/2 bath is fully enclosed for privacy. Families with kids will love Flower City Park for the multiple playgrounds and room to run off some energy! Town is super small but close to Hannibal for touristy things, and this home is easy to find — just a couple of blocks off the highway."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Ana was so sweet and her AirBnb was so cute and clean! It smelled homey and comforting when you came in! The beds were comfy and my get ready pictures before my wedding turned out so beautiful! 10/10

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was visiting Hannibal, MO to see the Mark Twain exhibits and was pleasantly surprised by the various shopping and curiosity shops there. My drive back to Anna's house was only about 20 minutes and it was a clean, quiet, warm house. I rested and then ate at the Rebel Pig which is about a 5 minute walk from the house. The food was very good and the I talked to the locals, who were very friendly and made me feel at home on this solo journey. The stay was simple and exactly as stated in the ads."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anna's space was definitely better than described. The unit was spacious and clean (also noticed the amazing scent of the unit!). It is a beautiful mix of modern and shabby chic and we loved it! Extremely comfortable beds, high end bedding (duvets, memory foam). Temperature regulation throughout was easy and very comfortable. Kitchen contained all we needed. Space was bright and cheery and we loved the front porch. We went to see Hannibal and Mark Twain home. This was just a short drive from above. We ate at a fantastic Mexican restaurant in Palmyra, also recommended! Anna made every step of the process very easy and we would definitely stay again. Our family of 4 was very comfortable staying here. Thank you Anna!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We LOVE Anna! She is awesome.
The house is absolutely the best Airbnb that we have ever stayed in. It's beautiful, clean, spacious, and homey.
All the amenities are perfect. The sunlight falls through the windows like liquid gold in the morning.
The radiant heat in the master bedroom is a definite plus.
My husband wouldn't let me get away without saying this, but he insists that ""the bathroom in the closet under the stairs should be called the 'Potter Squatter'"" 🙄😂
Thanks for giving us such an amazing experience. ♥️🌻"
