I was not expecting a vending machine in the kitchen, lol, which I didn't use, but out of all my Airbnb's I've stayed at (one a week for 2 years) this was a first, lol. LOVED the decor and in love with the kitchen itself! I'm also a runner and was able to run a nice 3.5 mile run around the subdivision. Seemed like a very safe/nice neighborhood. I would 100% come back when I return to this area. I travel for work and use Airbnb's for all of it and this is deff one I'll be saving for future stays in this area!"

We adored the groovy decor and loved the personal touches like the turn table and records to play. Our friends’ teenager daughter and her friend were entertained with the board games and gaming table. The location was very quiet but also close to everything we wanted to do in the city.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Tiffany & Christian’s house! The highlight for my kids was the infinity game table. The house was very homey and the beds were so comfortable.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wish we could have enjoyed it longer! We got in late and there for less than 12 hours.
The video game table top board was really fun and entertained the toddler while we packed up.
The vending machine was cool but a little pricy, but you pay for conveniences. Also it would kick on and was very loud when trying to watch TV.
The beds were comfy. The master bed was a little creaky/wobbly but overall good night sleep.
Great location, right down the road from the zoo. It’s a really big and nice zoo (4+ hr experience)
Would stay here again and probably will!"

We loved all of the fun touches and the decor. We all enjoyed the game table and now my husband wants one. Even the Kleenex boxes were cute🤗.
We actually were sad not to have stayed another night to enjoy the lovely back outdoor space.
Tiffany and Christian were awesome hosts. They were very responsive and even alerted us to a potential issue from the guests before us. I appreciated that very much. It all turned out fine due to Tiffany and Christian's above and beyond effort to make our stay pleasant."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I really enjoyed this gem of a house. I really appreciate the effort they take to make their house a home for their guests. I've stayed in bigger houses but this by far has been my favorite as there is soo much to discover within this house. The oil diffuser was sooo relaxing and brought a calm to the house. The old school record player was my favorite as it makes the home so cozy and full of life. THE GAME TABLE was sooo much fun and we spent hours playing monopoly, you'll never want to play the actual board game again after playing it this way😅 The naming of their plants to all of the notes throughout the house to remind you where things are and what to do for check out, those were so helpful! The kitchen was stocked with the appliances and extras that you need. I appreciate the extra towels, cleaning supplies, trash bags and the list goes on. I greatly appreciate them opening their home for us and we would definitely stay again!! Thanks again for your accommodations!"

The location felt safe and convenient. As other reviewers mentioned there was a train that ran through late one night. I happened to be awake, so it did not wake me up and definitely did not make or break my experience.
We had a small issue with the tub and the owner was responsive within minutes.
I will definitely be back when the need arises."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was fabulous. The home is absolutely beautiful and comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more. We really appreciated all of the little touches and miscellaneous amenities throughout. We could not have been happier. We had many wedding activities to attend, so didn't have time to just explore too much around there. However, two places nearby that I would highly recommend to anyone staying there - Bella Vita Bistro on West Rd and Los Cabos Cantina/Grill on 13th. AUTHENTIC Mexican and most excellent! Bella Vita is where we had the rehearsal dinner, but the owners, food, atmosphere are amazing.
Tiffany & Christian were immediately responsive when I did have a small question. LOVE LOVE this place."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We frequently visit Wichita and stay in a hotel but chose an Air B&B this time so we could prepare meals. Tiffany and Christian’s place is nicely decorated, roomy and had everything we needed. It was close to the grocery store and other shopping and an easy drive to WSU."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place and probably the best air bnb in Wichita you’ll be able to find!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Traveling in town for a 5 day softball tournament. The location was great for us but a bit far from all of the newer attractions Wichita has to offer. Tiffany was so incredibly responsive! We discovered the refrigerator was not cold after loading all of our groceries in!! Luckily we had a big cooler and they have a mini fridge so all was well. They had a new one installed by that evening! Wow! The beds were comfy. The house was darling and full of personality!! The only negative is both bathrooms were totally out of body wash! No biggie at all!! Overall…..would definitely rent again if softball brings us back to Wichita!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the coolest places I’ve stayed. They have done a wonderful job making the most of the house.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at Airtrotter was a great experience for our family. The space was functional and provided lots of games to keep our kids entertained. (They especially loved the game table.) The location was close to many of the outings and activities we had planned.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Excellent place for families.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for a night but we loved this Airbnb. If we ever head back to Wichita we will stay here again. It’s easy to check in/out, it’s close to all the fun things in the city and it’s a really fun place to just hang out if you want to stay home. We loved it!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Tiffany & Christian went above and beyond to accommodate us. The home was perfect and very enjoyable. Adorable outdoor space.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed overnight here with my sister's bachelorette party and we all had the BEST experience! My favorite part was the record player that came with a variety of classic albums to pick from. Tiffany and Christian were exceptional hosts-- no complaints whatsoever! Ten out of ten would highly recommend, go check it out for yourself!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and very clean home! So many fun amenities. Loved the location and the communication between the host (Tiffany). Always quick to answer my gazillion questions. Will only stay here when in Wichita! Thank you, Tiffany and Christian!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"AirTrotter was appealing when i picked it out online but i have to say it was even better in person! The way the home is designed makes it feel very spacious and comfortable! The beds were super comfy, enough to where i actually reached out to the host for details on the bedding for my personal home! This place is located in a perfect spot for accessing the highways and is in a very pleasant neighborhood. I had no issues getting to where i needed to be all within just a few minutes. The cleanliness was top notch, host was extremely friendly and accommodating! We’ve stayed at a couple different places in Wichita when family events are occurring and this was by far the best one yet! I will definitely always come back to AirTrotter when in Wichita.. and will be telling our friends and family to use it for all of their Wichita stays as well!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gem of a house tucked away in Wichita. Beautiful home that is decorated very nicely. The host are extremely accommodating. Definitely enjoyed my visit
2022-04-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Very cute home.
The note about the train from the host is misleading. It’s true the train is within a mile, but it’s actually about 3 houses away, and you can see the train and its intersection from the front window. We woke up at 12:30AM to the sound of the train blowing it’s horn and traveling through. It was very loud and disturbing. I’m disappointed because the hosts’s note mentions that you wouldn’t be disrupted if inside, and it would travel during business business hours.
From the host:
“Please note - house is within 1 mile of rail road tracks. Train travels by max 2 times during business hours. This is not disruptive if inside.”
I came to this house to have a good nights rest (one night stay) and was very disappointed. I am shocked no other reviews mention this, so felt the need to let others know.
Otherwise the host communicated great, and the house is thoughtfully decorated with fun extras like the electronic game table. Because of the train, I would not stay here again."
2022-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The location is a quick drive to Delano and Old Town, and is in a relatively quiet neighborhood. It’s conveniently located near a large grocery store, and the Twin Lakes shopping area is nearby. The house has a great open floor plan for the living room, dining room, and kitchen, with lots of opportunity for natural light. The fenced backyard has a great deck area with a propane fire pit and ample seating areas. The house has a pleasing style mixed between a simple and elegant modern aesthetic, and mid-century modern flair. The house was well stocked with pots and pans, condiments, blankets, etc. Our only issues were some cleanliness issues and how they were addressed.
We arrived around midnight of the day of our scheduled check-in, having driven all day from our point of origin. We quickly put the children (a four-year old girl and five-year old girl) to bed, then went to bed ourselves. After getting up in the morning, we noticed feces smeared on the outside of the toilet bowl, near where the convex part of the bowl meets the vertical base of the toilet. We noted a few more cleanliness issues (hair, hair bands, and contacts in the bathroom, dead flies on a window sill, crumbs in the fridge, and a pile of food sitting in the back corner of the cabinet the trash can sits in). We had paid an above-average price for this Airbnb to avoid these sorts of issues, so we sent a message to the host to address it. In the meantime, we cleaned up most of these areas, as we had small children in the house, and we didn’t want them using a toilet with feces on the outside of it.
The host responded promptly, offered financial compensation, and to send out a cleaner to take care of the issues. The host attributed the cleanliness issues to using a cleaner that they usually don’t use. We declined the cleaning visit, as we already took care of most of the cleanliness issues, and we were focused on quality time with family (two of the guests in our group had flown in from overseas, and had not visited with family in the U.S. in five years).
The host wrote later that afternoon to us again. She attempted to send a video from the cleaner which would not load for us, that was purported to show a clean toilet, and asked if one of the children may have caused the feces on the outside of the bowl. The host claimed the refrigerator might have had frost built up and that what we thought were crumbs were not crumbs.
The host then stated that they did a walk through of the house after it was cleaned, which was not mentioned earlier in the message traffic. Then they said, “It’s just a tad bit suspicious that y’all wouldn’t let us come and make it right. At this point, I hope there haven’t been false accusations in hopes of getting your longer stay comped.”
We found that statement incredibly offensive and unprofessional for someone serving customers in the hospitality industry. We were spending the day with family, which included the first time an uncle had the opportunity to meet his five-year old niece who lives overseas. We preferred not to have a person in the house with us, cleaning, while we were trying to have family time.
Then the host said, “Also, we have cameras up outside for the safety of our guests and noticed y’all leaving the door open on many occasions for many minutes. Please be mindful of that. That’s how fly’s and bugs enter.” This seemed a bit petty, as a way to mention that we were being observed. And yes, we did leave the door open on a spring day when the temperature was pleasant and in the 70s.
After receiving the comments about us being suspicious and making false accusations, and that we were being watched on the security camera, we decided we had no interest in the host’s compensation offer, or continuing to support this host by staying in this house any longer than we had to. We communicated directly with Airbnb, arranged alternate lodging through Airbnb, and checked out of this house. We were refunded for the remaining days that we did not end up staying, and partially compensated for the stay where we had the cleanliness issues.
Ultimately, we were willing to resolve the cleanliness issues with the host – up until the point we felt personally offended by the host’s conduct."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this home. It was so modern and cute
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"A solid choice if staying in the Wichita area. Although somewhat distanced from the city center, the house was clean and well-designed, with a bevy of fun amenities. Great communication as well."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"My group had a wonderful experience with this AirBnB. The hosts were great, and responded promptly to my questions. Check-in was easy, and the house itself is even cozier than the pictures show. Everything was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. The house is also stocked with basically anything a guest might need during their stay. My guests each commented on how much they liked the house, and we all agreed that we would definitely recommend it to all our friends."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Comfortable, quiet, clean place to stay! Was just like the pictures show and the hostess was attentive and gracious.
Thank you!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the AirTrotter home exceeded our expectations! The mid century modern home was beautiful, super clean, well equipped and very comfortable for our stay. We appreciated all of the little extras in the kitchen. The owners were helpful, resourceful and provided excellent directions for everything we needed. We can’t wait for a return stay!"
2022-03-01,4,Group trip,"Great and fun with the game selection, home feel and easy to relax in! Great place to stay would definitely stay here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Cute, clean, and very comfortable!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfection ! This was the perfect quiet get away we needed. Thoughtful touches were everywhere and we loved the little names on the plants. The location was perfect and close to many places but still quiet. We felt safe coming back at midnight after our concert. This is a must stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Big house in a great location! We enjoyed a short weekend stay at the house. The house is thoughtfully decorated and everything was in excellent condition, it made for a cozy and relaxing stay."

If we ever come back to Wichita we’ll stay here for sure."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute, eclectic, and clean house! The hosts were easy to work with and we asked if we could check in early, they said yes, but we didn’t get there early after all! We did wonder why there were no sheets on the beds? They had a fitted sheet but no top sheet, just the bedcover/comforter. We had looked forward to the local beers on tap but that wasn’t available because the owners said the keg had broken. They left some Wichita Brewing Co. cans in the fridge so that was a nice touch! We really didn’t spend much time there but it was sooooo cute and we hope to go back when the weather is a little warmer to enjoy the outside area!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This listing was beautiful and so warm welcoming! Definitely would stay again, and I recommend others to stay here it was very convenient and felt like home."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean & organized. Home away from home feeling. 💕
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had the best stay at Tiffany and Christian’s place! We wanted to do a small family gathering and this place was perfect. The kids (and adults) loved the game table and games they had! The beer on tap was a nice touch! The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed as well! Next time we come to Wichita we’ll definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! The house had a lot of special and extra touches that were very impressive including the beer dispenser and mural wall that you can take picture in front of. It had every amenity needed and the the owners were very responsive with communicating with us. I would recommend this place for a short or long stay in Wichita.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place to stay and play
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Because we were in transition, waiting to get into our new location, this was the perfect place for our family to gather during Christmas!. The open floor plan allowed us to have quality time with each other while we enjoyed cooking and had plenty of seating for all 11 of us!
The Polaroid camera was a great idea for guests to use and share!
The kids enjoyed playing around the back yard and mural area. They made s’mores over the fire pit. The game table was a big attraction and the local beer on tap was an added bonus!
The Christmas tree was beautiful! Tiffani did a great job in decorating!!
The pack-n-play was nice to have for our 2 month old granddaughter, Evelyn!
We will tell others about this awesome place and what a great host Tiffany is!!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kim and Brian were exceptional hosts. Not only did their service and space meet expectations, they went above and beyond in being accommodating and making sure I was comfortable and felt at home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly like she said it was. It was a nice quiet area. They were very responsive. Definitely would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the pools and hot tub. We had a great time while staying in Goddard!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was great! While I was a bit worried about lack of privacy, there was absolutely no issue. We felt completely comfortable moving about, playing in the pool and relaxing in the hot tub. I’m already planning a date night with hubby here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place to get away to, definitely a home a way from home feel! Was super excited for our stay and had amazing responsive and informative super host Kim and Brian. Will recommend to anyone who is looking for a getaway from home!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful pool house and pool! It was a cozy stay and Kim and Brian were extremely helpful and responsive to everything. I planned a small get together for my husband’s birthday with their permission first and they were so accommodating. The pool and hot tub were wonderful and the inside of the pool house was immaculate. Very comfortable bed, huge tv, and a great space altogether. Would definitely stay again :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful property! It was tranquil and luxurious. My wife and I had a great time. We swam, relaxed in the hot tub, and reclined by the fire pit. We were able to disconnect from the Wichita Metro in peace and quiet.
The entire property was immaculately clean. This was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever visited. Hats off to the host 👏🏼
Kim and Brian were quick to respond to our needs. A+ customer service.
I only have one negative. This was very minor as we never felt it affected our stay. (I only mention this for couples looking for 100% exclusivity). The guest house and pool is connected to the main house. Very large windows from the main house overlook the pool. It does make one feel a bit cautious. However, the owners did a wonderful job of keeping a low profile. We never saw anyone or any movement inside the main house.
I give this listing an A+
Natalie and I hope to return for another staycation."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for 3 nights and LOVED it!! Kim & Brian are awesome hosts. Very responsive when we had questions. Can't wait to come back and stay again. Maybe when temps are in the 90's and it's not raining. :)
Nothing like this place anywhere (let alone in the Wichita area) that even comes close to the value you get at Summer Oasis!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing everything! Hot tub , pool & bed was all amazing!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a relaxing getaway. Such a beautiful pool and setup!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay for a weekend getaway! Beautiful pool and space.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This bnb is lovely and has almost every amenity you could need. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and you are close to things to do.
There were only 2 cons. The wifi is sometimes difficult to connect to and the power goes out if you plug to many things into the wall.
I would still recommend this place and use this bnb the next time I am in Wichita."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here as we were preparing for and the holding my daughter’s wedding at a venue nearby. Tracey was beyond accommodating and it was so good to know that we had this oasis to go back to when we were needing a break.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Tracey is the absolute sweetest! everything was very clean and location is very relaxing. birds chirping and plenty of shade to enjoy the back deck!
we will for sure book this location next time we are in town!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy is an amazing host! She has thought if it all!
We were welcomed with fresh rolls, made by Tracy herself. They were absolutely amazing! Most and fluffy 🤌
She has house shoes, robes, extra toothbrushes, feminine products, shower supplies, extra fans, blankets and pillows! ! She has thought of it all!
She is so sweet, my friends and I felt right at home and ease."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will probably be using this place regularly when I am in Wichita visiting friends da and family. This place is great for gatherings. Show how baller you are at this place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We appreciated the surroundings and the beautiful garden areas. The host was amazing to work with.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Felt right at home at Tracey's place! Loved the peacefulness and outdoorsy feel. Area is located about 20 min away from downtown Wichita. Far enough away to feel like you're on vacation, but close enough to the city to be right next to anything you want to do! Loved the giant farm table and everything available that you would need. Clean linens and clean smelling home - all Norwex ❤️ overall great stay. Would like to return again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey was amazing, her home was perfect! The pictures don't do it justice, you can't hear all the birds chirping while sitting on the back porch or soaking in the hot tub. The home had everything you need plus some. I will be staying at her home every chance I get when in Wichita........."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible stay! Thoroughly enjoyed the outdoors, the peace, and the quiet! It was a lovely stay, Tracey was very kind and fun to chat with!
Lots of space, we felt at home here!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a great stay 👌🏾💯
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tracey was a great house and the house was perfect for out needs. We were in the area only for one night but I wished we could have stayed another day just to take advantage f the great garden and backyard. Will definitely stay again the next time we are in Wichita.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy access to I-135. 15 min to downtown Wichita. 5min to Hartman Arena. Tracey was extremely responsive and helpful. Super kind human with a cheerful disposition. We enjoyed our stay in this peaceful neighborhood. Back deck was great for coffee in the morning or a glass of wine and conversation in the evening. French press and coffee beans made morning coffee special! We will def be back if our travels take us to Wichita. Thank you Tracey!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracey's place is perfect for a relaxing get away. It is clean, easily accessible and yet private. Friendly. Hot tub is a nice feature."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, large, private back porch with a peaceful, nice view, even in the winter! Clean, nice hot tub was perfect. Clean, spacious interior with anything you need. Eclectic houses in the neighborhood, especially by the river, which was fun on the walk. The host was SO gracious, including goodies that fit our allergy needs!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and relaxing. Tracy was a great hostess
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I feel spoiled now that I have stayed at Tracey's house. Everything was as described. Country setting with horses, trees, and nature, but just 2 min away from QT and 10 min from downtown Wichita.
The highlight for us was watching the snow fall beautifully from the steamy hot tub.
It was a great place to relax after 4 long days of meetings for work...Will book again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect spot for a cozy girls night! We really enjoyed the hot tub, sitting around the big comfy couches, and sleeping on comfortable beds. Tracey was extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Would definitely recommend staying here and can't wait to come back again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracey was wonderful and kind and very outgoing can’t wait to come back in June
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Love is in the details and Tracey’s home had so much love. The dining room table brought us all together fabulously! The rooms were cozy and the front room was perfect for our girls only sleepover! Tracey made us homemade cinnamon rolls and her hospitality was top notch! We have been to other air bnb’s but Tracey’s home had everything we needed and more! We had a great experience!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Just as advertised. Made good use of the hot tub and place was nice and clean
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you need to stay in Wichita and want any privacy or just a place to stay where every family member gets a room - stay here. Tracey is amazingly communicative, the house is clean and has everything you need and more! We loved it and my daughter wanted to move in! We will for sure look if this is available if we ever visit Wichita again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is my favorite in Wichita so far. I’ve already booked it again for the 2024 Tallgrass film festival. The host genuinely likes for those that stay here to enjoy their time. Worth the money and anyone could stay here just to enjoy the property. There was even a Busch light left in the fridge for Pete’s sake. Awesome!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"When searching for accommodations during my stay over the Thanksgiving holiday week my biggest challenge was finding a place that had a dining area that could seat more than 4-6 people. That's basically why I chose to stay here; 2bd+, 2bath, and the large dining area. Tracey and Curtis were great hosts. They were easy to communicate with and went out of their way to accommodate our stay and our Thanksgiving gathering. Great location in a quiet area while being a few minutes away from a giant Walmart and other shopping and dining options. Felt like I was staying at an old friends place as opposed to a strangers Airbnb! I wouldn't hesitate for a second to book this place again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The best place in the Wichita area to stay in. Hands down. ❤️
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Tracy’s place, and the hospitality was next level. We really enjoyed our stay here, and are looking forward to coming back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracey was responsive, welcoming, and personable. Fantastic banana bread. Anytime I am back in Wichita, I will be here with my family!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oh gosh, what can I say about our stay at Tracey's lovely home? She was so helpful during while booking, and continued to reach out to welcome us prior to arrival. She ensured we knew how to check in and exactly how to get there! A delicious bonus: warm, homemade cinnamon rolls. We met with some out-of-town family, and the goal was simply to spend time together; we did just that. Tracey's home was cozy and well-stocked with everything we needed to cook every meal, the living room set-up was excellent when our toddler wanted to play with all five grown-ups, and we didn't feel crowded at all! There are several streaming options if you want to simply veg or have something on in the background, but if you want to explore the outdoors, the yard is a great place to do so. There is a FABULOUS stray cat that sometimes visits and for some on our trip, that was the highlight, haha. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and decorated beautifully, and the hot tub was GREAT! Don't wait, book NOW!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what I needed for a quiet relaxing night! Tracey was hospitable, and such an amazing host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely host/family! So welcoming and attentive that it made our stay that much more enjoyable. The space is very scenic and peaceful. I wish it wasn’t raining during our stay so that I could’ve enjoyed the tea party garden more but nonetheless the vibes were immaculate. Definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking to for a scenic getaway in Kansas. 15/10!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracey was sweetest host I've had the pleasure of meeting! She was helpful, accommodating, and pleasant. She took us to check out the river behind her house and made us delicious homemade cinnamon rolls for breakfast. The home was neat and clean and had very comfy beds, which is a huge must for me! She also had the hot tub ready for us when we got there. After we visited for a while, she gave us our privacy the rest of the night. My favorite thing about this home was the beautiful backyard 😍"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"a home away from home. Our stay at this Airbnb was nothing short of magical. The location was absolutely breathtaking, nestled in a serene garden-like atmosphere that provide
d a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The comfortable beds ensured a restful sleep, and the cozy house exuded warmth and charm.
What truly set this place apart was the gracious host, who welcomed us with open arms and a genuine smile. Their flexibility and willingness to accommodate our needs made our stay even more enjoyable. The host's thoughtful touches were evident throughout the house, from the carefully curated decor to the little extras that made us feel truly pampered.
Staying here felt like stepping into a fairytale. We were surrounded by beauty, comfort, and a sense of belonging. If you're looking for a place that offers not just accommodation, but an experience, this Airbnb is a hidden gem. We left with our hearts full and our spirits lifted.

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Tracey was so great and welcoming. We really appreciated all the info she gave when meeting at the house and had such a great time at our stay. The hot tub was so wonderful too! Would definitely recommend and look forward to potentially staying here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey is an amazing host! The house has everything you need and is so comfortable and the backyard setting was so peaceful and relaxing. The freshly baked Cinnamon Rolls were a nice surprise and were so delicious with a cup of coffee on that beautiful back porch! Can't wait to come back to this beautiful home and hostess. Highly recommend 👌 👍 👏
Sincerely, -Jeffrey Harris"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have asked for better. Tracey greeted us at the house. She walked us through everything and showed us how to do things and where to find things. She told us the ""easy way"" to get to our event, and had freshly baked cinnamon rolls for when we got home. The house was so incredibly clean and dust free. After our 3 day event, it was the best place we could ask for to relax. And, of course, that hot tub was so nice to have in the late evenings. Tracey was very easy to communicate with and always available. Extremely kind and thoughtful. We will be back, and we recommended it to our friends as well."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The owners were so kind. They were able to get us in early, answer questions, and even met us in person and gave us a brief tour. This is one of our best experiences. Not to mention the incredible yard. It was like we were in a secluded forest. Heaven."

Our only regret was that we couldn't spend much time there! When we walked in, our 3 year old granddaughter said ""I love your new house Mommy!"" She was also quite happy with Minnie and Mickey toys to play with!
The Cinnamon rolls the next morning were amazing!!
Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Host!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracey is an A++ host
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Tracey was a great host.
She deserves 5 stars in everything. She started communicating right the next day after booking, she made sure everything is in right place before our visit. She noticed that one of the bathrooms flush isn’t working fine, then she immediately called for a plumber to fix it and she also let me know that this isn’t working. I was impressed for her humbleness and genuine nature. Unfortunately the flush didn’t fixed but Tracey gave me an amazing offer that, she is happy to host us with full refund.
No regrets after visiting the place!
Oh, the CINNAMON ROLLS, ahhhh those were yum…. She made them of our choice and kept them in a tray by the time we visited. How lovely❤️.
Thanks Tracey, definitely will be rebook this place again in summer 🫂❤️"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great, and Tracey was wonderful. The house was everything the listing promised and more. I would love to stay here again if ever in town. The house had everything needed for a comfortable stay, 10 times better than a hotel. I can't recommend this house or host enough!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time having an Airbnb and Tracey made everything so easy. The house with its amenities were more than we expected. Tracey has thought of everything which made our stay fabulous. My family loved all the decor inside and out. When visiting Wichita in the future we will definitely want to stay here again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracey’s home was perfect for our stay. There isn’t a single detail missed and her hospitality is unmatched.

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Tracey’s place was the absolute perfect place for my women’s ministry team to relax and reflect after a recent event we held. The location was perfectly peaceful and private while being minutes from Wichita (only about 3 from a Walmart which was great for a quick grocery run). The home is cozy and welcoming and so well stocked. Made our time together that much better!! Tracey was a fantastic host - great to communicate with and so kind in each interaction and accommodating beyond anything that would be expected. Highly recommend booking this sweet home!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay!! We stayed for a girls weekend and had such an amazing, relaxing time!!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First off, absolutely beautiful home and an awesome tucked in location, perfect for a little getaway. Aside from the house being as cute as can be, the host tops it. I rented the house for a friend of mine who got married and need a mini-honeymoon spot. Tracey went above and beyond every step of the way to make sure their stay was perfect for them, and communicated anything and everything along the way. So personal and truly takes pride in her house. I already am planning another stay here, and would recommend Tracey and her house to anyone who comes across it. You won't be disappointed!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My staycation at Tracey's AirBnB was more relaxing and restoring than I could have ever hoped for. I was so delighted by the coziness, cleanliness and comfort of the entire space. The hottub was a major bonus. Loved this place so much!"

Thank you again Tracey for everything, your kindness does not go unnoticed!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Tracy is the “hostess with the mostest”! From having everything we needed at her lovely home to great communication before and after our stay.
Her location is private and tranquil, yet within minutes of downtown Witchita.
Thanks again for the wonderful stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,It is one of the best places we have ever stayed in. Its a lovely house and the grounds make you feel secluded with lots of privacy. The owner was very helpful and accomodating. They went above and beyond for our stay. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a peaceful and relaxing weekend. You won't regret it!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend. Quiet and beautiful. Safe. Roomy. Clean. Really couldn’t ask for a better place.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place and perfect weekend! Great host!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is an incredible find. I love this location. it's beautiful, quiet, secluded, clean. we plan on using this home whenever we are in Wichita. Tracey is an amazing host. very attentive."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracey was so great and allowed us to book on short notice. The house was clean and spacious and had everything we needed (plus some!). She communicated throughout or stay and was very attentive. The yard is so lovely and the house felt like a home away from home. We can't wait to come back and enjoy a longer stay with a few friends. Thank you, Tracey!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracey’s place was just lovely. Her communication set the gold standard for any AirBnB host. She was quickly available to answer any questions, and it was obvious that she loves her home and wanted us to enjoy every second of it. The inside of the house is a feast for the eyes, with fun furniture and interesting decor, but NOTHING compares to the lovely flowers surrounding the place. We would LOVE to stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place to stay with lots of room!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! Tracy was fantastic. The kids and at least one parent thought the back yard was filled with actual magic. Tons of flowers, lightning bugs, secret paths and fun. The hot tub was huge! Every thing was as good or better than advertised!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Private home and large backyard. Was peaceful and in the evening the fire flies come out and it’s gorgeous.
Come to visit family and this was the perfect location with super friendly and responsive host.
Also check out is as easy as it gets, didn’t have to do laundry or any of that random stuff which is great !
Would recommend and stay again"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication, house just as describe. Tracey seem more like family. I will definitely be returning. Tracey, you went over and beyond, you definitely a blessing."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed in this home which was 7 of us. The host, Tracey, was amazing to work with!! Tracey communicated very quickly from the time we started looking at this airbnb. i sent Tracey messages from before we booked, during our stay, and when we left and she always responded promptly! This was truly a home and had absolutely everything you could possibly need from the kitchen, to games and entertainment, first aid, fans, grill, hot tub , extra blankets, pillows, washer/dryer, any condiment imaginable or spice needed, dishes and any cooking appliance you can think of. i have never been to a better equipped airbnb.
All of it was amazing, but the chemical free cleaning and norwex products used was refreshing to find and made us feel very safe. My family has lots of allergies and trouble staying at hotels with different cleaners and down type pillows . Literally every cleaner, soap, towels , and fresheners used were chemical free. This airbnb is somewhere you can know you will be safe from viruses and any chemicals that would typically bother you in a hotel.
The host was extremely accommodating and we got to visit with Tracey and her husband. They are great people ! We can’t wait to stay here again!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've had many excellent airbnb stays, and this one stands out as among the best of them.  Tracey's house is a clean, quiet, relatively secluded gem located in an older (~1940's-1950's?) low-density neighborhood in the extreme northern end of Wichita. Very close to I-135. The kitchen contained everything I needed to prepare my own food. On site laundry equipment with supplies. Everything I needed for a weeks-long stay was there. Communication with Tracey was easy, prompt, and never intrusive.
One major positive detail: With some of my past airbnb stays, descriptions & photos led to expections very different from what I arrived to find. But Tracey's house exceeded my expectations. Yes, her photos & description are accurate. But the potential disappointments I've learned to look out for never happened. No bad smells. No loud neighbors or road noises. The neighborhood is not sketchy. This is a detached house all to yourself. Lots of off-street parking.
Tracey is was a wonderful host. I very much look forward to future stays in her home."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful & peaceful stay. Tracey is a wonderful host. I can't say enough good things!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific and peaceful place to stay during our time in Wichita. Tracey could not have been nicer or more welcoming. Very happy we had the chance to stay here!

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and a great location. Tracey was amazing at responding and made us some fantastic cinnamon rolls. I would recommend staying with Tracy and would do it again in a heart beat!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful experience. We were there for a medical appointment for our son. We felt very safe and welcomed with the way Tracey handled everything for us. Her home was very clean, and you could tell she wanted to do everything she could to ensure our safety and comfort levels were met. We truly appreciate her helping us keep our family safe during the pandemic. Additionally, her cinnamon rolls were amazing - they were the best we’ve ever had. I’m craving more as I type. It was such a thoughtful extra benefit of staying that I think nicely sums up Tracey’s care for her guests. She wants you to feel at home, and we did."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,The house is beautiful as are the gardens. the hot tub is divine! Tracey is the sweetest and most accommodating host! Would definitely recommend and will definitely stay here again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was the perfect setup for us. I took my daughter and her friend to a concert, and the venue was 6 minutes away. We were greeted with homemade cinnamon rolls and a friendly smile. The home is spacious and had a home away from home feeling. Access to the highway was very convenient with a short drive to anywhere we wanted to go."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was PERFECT for any occasion! My sons and I just wanted a mini vacation, a getaway close to home. We were able to relax in our own spaces. The decor was BEAUTIFUL and truly felt like a home. We did not need anything, Tracey made sure everything we could think of was there and ready for us. She even made cinnamon rolls that were delicious! We can’t wait to come back in the spring and see the gardens, but they were just as amazing in the snow. If it were possible to give 100 stars, I’d sure do it. Best stay of my life! Thanks again, Tracey!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"It was a wonderful stay! there are 3 bedrooms with 3 beds that sleep 2 each comfortably. The couch is large and can sleep 2 more fairly easily as long as they don't mind sleeping on the couch. it is a beautifully decorated home and had everything we needed to cook and clean up after ourselves. There is an extra fride in one of the bedrooms, which is helpful for a party of 8 bringing food. The hottub was great! The host was very friendly and available for any questions. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here! Everything is so clean and kept up, Tracey communicates very well and is the perfect host! Reserve it for your next stay in the wichita area- you won’t regret it"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tracey and her husband were such wonderful hostesses! We felt like we were at home. They had EVERYTHING we needed and more! The house was nice and clean. We loved the fact that there are NO chemicals used in the house. The beds were comfy and the hot tub was just right for a cold night relaxation. She was reachable when needed and replied back to things in a hurry. We had a baby with us and she had some toys and a pack and play. This is a great house for a couple or a larger family. Anyone could stay here and be happy. We will definitely be coming back to this place more than once.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tracey was wonderful. So hospitable and kind. And the house was very clean!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,An honest 5 stars across the board. I would even add a couple stars for communication and being accommodating. The house is lovely as is the feeling of being tucked away from everything in a little garden oasis. It was impeccably clean when we arrived. The location is convenient and easy to find. You will not find friendlier or more personable hosts! I highly recommend this one!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracey's home is simply amazing! It has everything you meed and more! The location is a little slice of paradise!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a family of 10 stay at Alex’s place for a weekend wedding so it was a full house. The house is exactly as it looks in the pictures and very beautiful. I love that it was close to stores and in a very accessible area with many places nearby Target was just about 5 minutes away and there was a playground that was perfect for my son not too far either. Getting on to the highway to get into downtown Wichita was so easy and a straight shot. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors that did see us were very nice and kind. Alex’s place was equipped with everything we needed in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and laundry. It really is a home away from home. A nice plus is that there were also toys for my son who easily gets bored of his toys, we ended up only packing one toy for him but the toddler toys and the little kitchen really kept my son occupied while I could get ready for the wedding. The decor is absolutely beautiful too! We drove from Illinois and got into town earlier than expected and Alex was very kind enough to accommodate us checking in sooner than expected- after a long day of driving , that was a little gesture that made a huge impact for us! It made such a difference in our rest since we had to get ready to go to a dinner 3 hours after we got into town! Alex is very responsive whenever we needed anything. I can’t say enough, THANK YOU Alex! We would definitely stay here again over and over again whenever in Kansas!"

It’s conveniently located and has plenty of restaurants and stores nearby. Exactly as described and then some!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great home! The hosts have excellent communication! The place was clean and cozy. The renovations on the home are perfect! I would absolutely recommend this place to others.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this house! The location was perfect for a trip to the zoo and other places around Wichita. Also had tons of food options nearby.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and easy access. Lots of restaurants within a reasonable distance. Quiet neighborhood
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderfully updated house! We stayed there comfortably with 7 people. Alex was an excellent host and communicator. She was very flexible and easy to get a hold of! Very clean and great access to food, downtown and the Zoo!
We would recommend this place to anyone needing to stay on the west or central side of Wichita!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was fantastic for our family (two small little ones)! It was clean, updated, spacious, and had all the necessities for a nice weekend away to visit family. The host went out of her way to provide high chairs for my two babies and there was a small playroom off the living room already stocked with toys. The beds were comfortable and clean, I loved the linens (all new, from Hearth & Hand). I have unreasonably high expectations and this home checked every box and then some. We feel more prepared and relaxed knowing there are great Airbnb options when we come home to wichita to visit our family. Thank you again for a wonderful stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and updated place. Host was very easy to communicate with.

2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Alexandra is a top tier host! Her place was breathtaking and up to date. My team’s experience in Kansas one to remember because of her. We didn’t have to worry about anything while we were there. We were comfortable, safe, and at ease during our stay! Any time we needed anything she was able to accommodate to us in a timely manner and always offered to help. If we come back to Wichita, we’ll be looking forward to staying here again and we recommend you do the same!"

Thank you"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alexandra's house is great. A wonderful spot for a stay of any length, but particularly if you need to stay for a longer term. On-site laundry and the fully stocked kitchen are a huge, huge help.
The house is also very kid friendly if that applies to you!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Cute and cozy home. We had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable, towels were soft, and the kitchen had everything we needed."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Alexandra’s place for a small work meeting, and it worked out perfectly. It’s a very beautiful, functional place. And she even left out cupcakes for us. Highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,4,Group trip,This home is absolutely adorable and a great layout for a small family. Bedrooms were comfortable and the play room was a huge hit with the toddlers. The kitchen worked for cooking some simple meals. Parking is covered and host is quick to communicate. A cold snap and a heating issue happened along with a loss of wifi. Host was able to respond and get a handy man to help resolve the issue.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Alexandra’s house!! Very cute, modern, and cozy! We all slept great in the beds. AMAZING proximity to the airport. Restaurants and shopping close by. My 2 year old especially loved the kids play kitchen and toys! Only negative is we wish we could’ve stayed longer!!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is exactly as pictures show! It is comfortable, clean, and had all that we needed for a great stay! Bonus was the play kitchen & toys for my grandkids! They were welcomed as we were! Wonderful touches like coffee pods, snacks, cleaners, trash bags, shampoo, soap - everything you need! Kitchen is well stocked with silverware, plates & dishes. Excellent communication between Alex & myself! Check in/out was a breeze! Would absolutely stay here again when I come back to Wichita to visit the grandchildren! Perfect location: airport, groceries & restaurants just a short drive away."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"What a great house! I can not recommend this house and Alexandra the host enough. We were traveling for a family emergency. Alexandra was kind and thoughtful throughout the entire experience, including a schedule change. The house was exactly as advertised and provided a refuge for our family. Thanks, Alexandra, for being one of the great hosts on Airbnb."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We spent two weeks here and were very happy with our stay. The house had everything we needed and was great for a family. We have two teens and a toddler. The space for small kids was great because she could play while we were in the living room. The other rooms were far enough away that she didn’t want to go bother our teenagers and they didn’t wake her when she was sleeping. The house was larger and more spacious than I expected. It was spotless when we arrived. Alexandra was amazing at communicating with us and was quick to respond. She accommodated us in all the little extras we needed which made the stay easier. We will definitely stay here again.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The home is comfortable, kid friendly, and has just about everything you could need. Confidently located but still in a really quiet neighborhood. Alex is friendly, and super helpful. We enjoyed our stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was great! Our family is pretty spread out so we meet in Wichita every year with my sister and parents to celebrate Christmas. This house was perfect for the 6 of us adults and my daughter who is almost 2. There was even a little play room for her that had toys in it and was absolutely perfect. Alex had the house decorated for Christmas which was a nice touch with why we were there. Communication with her was so easy and she made the whole process a breeze. We all agreed this house was perfect for us and we’re really happy with our stay! Thank you, Alex!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is decorated so well! You can tell a lot of attention to detail went into the decor. We loved staying here and the extra room off of the living space was perfect for a kids’ playroom. The only downside was that the cost ended up being much more than was advertised, but that could have more to do with Airbnb loopholes than these specific hosts. We would consider staying here again though even with that price jump in mind. Thanks Alexandra!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great house for our family vacation in Wichita KS. Our 4 year old daughter loved the play room.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect for my family and I during our recent visit to Wichita. It was large enough for 6 adults and 1 child without feeling like we were on top of each other. It was close to the airport and my family. The house was clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable. The only issue is the description states two double beds, but the trundle beds are actually twins. The check in process was easy. I would definitely stay here again and recommend the property to others."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alexandra‘s place was excellent. We loved the modern decor, everything was ver clean. There were complimentary k-cups and a thoughtful welcome gift when we arrived.

the neighborhood was close to the airport and multiple restaurants, but was also very peaceful and quiet. it was easy to find.

2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Alexandra's place is fantastic. The extra room off of the living room was great for kids, since we were visiting some family and they brought their kids over.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This loft is fabulous. The pictures are very accurate but you don’t understand how BIG the space is until you’re in it.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed having a good bbq restaurant to eat at right below with such a nice staff working it. We know that area of Wichita pretty good and always like running around in the Old Town area.
The brewery across the street is fun also.
The place was very comfortable and we will be back again!!
Thanks Shea…..👍"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quiet night nearby to lots of walking distance activities.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a fantastic stay. We all grew up in Wichita but now live in 4 different states. This was such a great place to meet up with old friends and family.

The aroma and style is perfect! The location is perfectly subtle and perfectly in the middle of everything. Amenities and overall ambiance perfect!!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,First I want to say this is one of the best Airbnb that I’ve stayed. The loft is perfect right in the heart of downtown Wichita. With just a flight of stairs away you have the bite me bbq which was so delicious. I want to thank Shea and Chris for letting me stay there and also want to apologize for the way things had went on my part. But I would definitely recommend this loft Airbnb to other travels that would like to stay in a loft.

It's right in the heart of downtown and within walking distance from so many restaurants and shops. Even though it's close to everything we didn't even leave the place and stayed busy with darts, shuffleboard, and foosball tournaments. The pictures are great but they don't even do justice, this loft is massive!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely my favorite place to stay in downtown Wichita.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were so excited to get there....finally we are here....OMG! it was just a Fantastic trip....so inviting....clean....everything we hoped for....we will be back....Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"THAT was a great experience! We went to Wichita for a Chris Stapleton concert and we’re very lucky to find this place. The neighborhood is a great location. Parking was easy. The unit is 3 blocks from the arena. So, we grabbed dinner from the BBQ restaurant downstairs and ate in the unit. Placed foosball, shuffleboard, and darts in the unit for fun. Walked to the arena through a downtown square and park that has recently been remodeled. Beautiful area. Enjoyed the concert. Walked back at midnight and felt totally safe. Grabbed a beer at the brewery across the street for a minute and then slept in a comfortable bed. The next morning walked back through the square to a highly rated brunch place and had a great time. This place helped us enjoy a great experience in Wichita."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft hosted myself and our entire team for a firm summit and we could not have chosen a better location. It was the perfect place for us to get together as a team! Not only that, but the BBQ was amazing! We will be coming back here year after year."

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I've been using Airbnb for 5 years in countless states and in Europe and this loft is the coolest Airbnb I've ever stayed in. My entire family (9 total) was in Wichita for the high school state tournament. This spot provided a great place for all of us to relax between games and slept us all comfortably - not to mention the location is unbeatable for Wichita. Really appreciated all the touches to make it feel like home and provide a unique experience - the games (darts, shuffleboard and foosball) were enjoyed by all, from my 17 year old cousin to my 79 year old grandfather! Couldn't recommend enough and a steal at the price."

They were very good at respecting boundaries but opening their house at the same time. We weren't really at the house too much during the day because we were exploring all that Wichita has to offer. When we were there, they enjoyed listening to what we did that day and giving us recommendations for the next day. I enjoyed reading the guest book that was in the room. Aaron is a musician, so there are guitars everywhere. Some guests have enjoyed listening to his music. I was looking forward to hearing him sing, but unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short to explore more of Kansas. Overall, I'd give them a 10/10 and highly recommend them. Thank you, Laura and Aaron!"

The bed was VERY comfortable along with the linens and comforter. The house is older so creaky floors and older interior but honestly, it made the experience that much better. There was coffee readily available for us in the room and they even had water for us. Instructions that were given to us prior to checking in were clear and concise.

We stayed here while moving cross-country, and Laura and Aaron were incredibly accommodating when our truck broke down and we had to check in late. Parking was very easy, as was travel back to the highway. We would absolutely stay again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great laid back, friendly hosts! The dogs were sweet and a joy as well! Big vintage house with lots of character. Upstairs bedroom overlooking the yard/street lined with beautiful old trees. Lovely all the way around."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House is as unique as the host and the wonderful dogs. Both of the host know wichita kansas well and could not have asked for better guides and hospitality. Great people and pets both make you feel like you are home. Thanks for everything.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won’t find anything better in Wichita! They are the most amazing hosts with a home that feels like a hug from your favorite grandmother. The space is peaceful and rejuvenating for your soul. You won’t regret your stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. Laura, Aaron and the three dogs were absolutely great to be around. Their house is just out of downtown and you will not be disappointed. The room has a large bed, small microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom is small but has a big tub in it for showering and baths. This is a must stay if staying in WItchia. I simply can not say too much good about this listing. WOW."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was excellent! I wouldn’t change a thing. I’ve stayed in hundreds of Airbnb’s. This place with these hosts is in my top 5 favorites.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was more than just a comfortable bed and a warm room, I was able to make a meaningful connection with very kind people, Aaron is a musician, Laura…has a beautiful voice.
The location was just about perfect as I could ride by bicycles from their house to the Keeper of the Plains every day I was there. You’re all of 3 minutes from a very nice local coffee shop and pizzeria. It’s all there.
There’s so much history in their house as well…a Bible with written notes from the 1800’s…those little things mean a lot to me. And I got the opportunity to bond with 3 playful dogs…5 new friends in all…I say it was well worth it.
Plus I got to do a 5 minute stand-up routine for Aaron and Laura. Memories were made…thank you again, Namaste
Javier"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! The hosts are absolutely wonderful and the home is beautiful. I loved getting to experience the charm and unique qualities of this old home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The hosts were very nice and the stay was nice as well.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great little comfortable spot! We didn’t stay long, just overnight on our way through but we loved getting greeted by the sweetest most friendly yellow lab named Bella. In the morning the bouncy Australian Shepard came to say hi and it was great! Wish we could have stayed longer to explore the area more."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host! Would recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful, beautiful spot with incredible hosts. If you can stay here, definitely do!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts. Great house. Great room and stay. Seems to be a famous street for these older homes, after I shared with others. A treat of a way to go back in time."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Would definitely recommend a stay here. Great value, nice home, easy check in process, and very friendly hosts with great communication."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful home with two beautiful people and their dogs at the heart of it. Stayed here as my one real bed to sleep in on a long road trip home and slept so well!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is so cozy and warm and welcoming! I was a bit too tuckered out from traveling to chit chat much but it was lovely to meet the dogs and hear some guitar playing too!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful home and lovely hosts. I had a wonderful time and was thankful for a peaceful and calming home for the month. Great location and always a warm welcome from the hosts and their pups!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a nice neighborhood and there's plenty of street parking. It's maybe a 10 min drive to downtown so it's perfect if you want to be nearby but not right in the middle of things. The room itself is cozy yet spacious and has really nice touches. The only slight issue was that the bedroom doorknob can be tricky to close/ latch properly. Laura and her husband are such friendly and nice people, it was pleasure chatting with them! Lastly, the three dogs are hilarious - they are so eager to greet you and they bark at first (friendly barking) and then quickly become comfortable around you."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Laura and Aaron are wonderful hosts! Bella, Choco, and Indie are also! Very relaxing experience."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny home was super welcoming, comfortable and clean. We had quick responses with the owners and everyone around was very friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice quiet little place. Very helpful and responsive host.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little house! Would 100% have rated a full 5 stars had the water heater worked properly. Had to shower with cold water after the first 30 seconds🥶 I’m sure it’ll be fixed by the time the next people stay there.
Will stay again in the future."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really cool spot to stay. Very cozy. Really enjoyed our stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Charlotte are always friendly and responsive and handle any issues quickly. This place is adorable and has quirky little touches that make me smile. I love staying here.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just as described, this place was perfect for my family (pup included). We travel a lot for disc golf and this BNB is so perfect, with all the amenities that most places don't offer. Thanks for the best stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, better than expected. Perfect for professionals that want a good place near the aerospace industrial zone."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a gem that I almost don't want to brag about it because I'm afraid I'll lose access to it when I'm in town! More privacy, space, and amenities than a hotel and more affordable too. These tiny homes will be the first place I check when I travel to Wichita in the future (which is often)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tim’s place was amazing! My daughter and I needed a place to stay at the last minute for a few days. He was very responsive and it was a great price for what he had in there! He fully stocked everything!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a travel nurse it’s so hard to find somewhere to feel at home when gone. Tim’s place was able to help me accomplish that, perfect location, clean, cozy, so grateful! Will definitely be staying there again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect tiny home adventure. It was a dream and the coffee spot was south a nice touch. We. love this place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was listed as a 1 bedroom but is actually a tiny home, totally my fault, but it has a kitchenette bathroom. My trip was cut short as a wintery mix is coming tonight, and I left one day early. He was kind enough to refund me some money and he didn't have to."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my third time staying on one of Tim’s properties, and I’ve really enjoyed each one. Each one has such a cute theme, and they are very clean and well equipped."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were comfortably, everything was super nice, very organized and clean."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tim was a great host, very responsive and provided necessary information. The home was clean, comfortable and provided what we needed. Conveniently located near the main road, convenience store and some restaurants. It is located near train tracks so if you're noise sensitive bring good ear plugs because the train runs consistently and throughout the night while blowing the horn. Otherwise it's very quiet area. Follow Tim's driving instructions, G00glemaps wasn't reliable. Glad he sent screenshots. Would definitely stay again when visiting Kansas."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute tiny home in an RV park. The RV park was well maintained. Close to major road that makes it easy to get around in Wichita. The train can be loud but the description of the place mentions this so it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. The place itself was super clean and had decent seating to watch tv. Coffee bar was a great touch. Bed has firm mattress. Would definitely stay again for the price.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at multiple properties of Tim’s and it is sways a good experience. Check in is easy and the unit was as described. It is homey, welcoming and always spotlessly cleaned upon arrival."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent retreat and really appreciated the nice touches (and awesome shower). This is the third time (and property) I’ve stayed at here and all of them have been wonderful and a great value. Will definitely be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Clean and cozy would recommend if traveling through Wichita!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little tiny house in a quiet area. Very comfortable and well appointed. Enjoyed my stay here.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place tim and his partner were very accommodating!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, super comfortable and cool decor. Would happily stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s an adorable tiny home, with everything I needed or could have wanted. It was perfect for my needs."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for couple or singles to stay. Only thing I dislike about location is train coming ever so often. I’m a light sleeper and it’s a bum waking up every time. But overall place is spotless and easy access.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time to get a BNB and we will definitely look for more in the future and for sure use Tim’s again when we go to Wichita! It was a pleasant stay and easy to get to all the fun places to shop and eat!!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great location amazing town

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute tiny house! You felt safe and secure in the RV park, and there’s a little area for dogs!
The only thing is you’re right by the railroad so if you’re a light sleeper you’ll hear the trains. :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little home
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The tiny house is so cute and clean. Would stay again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Get over any misconceptions you might have about staying in an RV park. Everyone we ran into & chatted with were friendly & absolutely lovely.
Tim’s tiny home is adorable and spotless. It had everything we needed for a long weekend visiting family.
Plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. Cleaning supplies are available. Tiny house, huge shower. The bathroom is surprisingly spacious and spotless. The coffee maker is a Keurig, so if you travel with your preferred blend, pack pods.
We have 3 small, blind, elderly dogs. The tiny house was a perfect size for them - they were always in sight & they didn’t have to navigate multiple rooms or stairs. There’s even a ramp from the porch to the driveway!
The RV park is close to the highway & convenient for getting anywhere in the area.
There are several small restaurants nearby. We recommend the Thai place just across 31st street.
Pro tip: leave the ceiling fan on in the winter. It circulates the warm air from the mini split."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't have a lot of experience with airbnb so was really happy to have such a nice host to work with. Tim's back up staff was readily available, too. The Tiny Home had everything I could possibly have needed, it was clean and comfortable. The Welcome Notebook included lots of helpful information. If my dog could vote... he'd give a 5-STAR rating, too! Thank you so much, Tim."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tim's little house did not disappoint! Exactly as shown. Location for us was good. Easy access to highway and within 20 minutes of most restaurants ,museums, etc.
You are near train tracks which for us was not an issue, but if your a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. We would definitely stay in any of Tim and Charlotte locations again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Tim's was super easy! Tim is one of the most communicative hosts I have ever dealt with. Extremely quick to respond, and even brought maintenance onsite quickly when I encountered a minor issue. Can't recommend staying at one of Tim's many houses again.
The unit was as advertised, extremely clean upon entry, and convenient for those passing through or working in Wichita. And you can't beat his prices!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place and Diane was so accommodating when weather changed and caused me concern. Appreciate it so much!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at the cottage was so comfortable and peaceful!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third stay at this location, and not our last. It is perfect when I go to the Wichita area. It is quiet, has room for me to work if I need to, and a full kitchen."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a super clean, super cute little getaway. It is a quiet peaceful area with a large window in the back where you can sit with your coffee and watch the cattle. The only noise was that described in the description of the working farm but we could not hear it unless we were outside, the house is very peaceful. Diane is very proactive to reach out and check on you!! We absolutely loved this place!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This quaint little farm house was all we needed for a quick weekend trip. It included all the amenities we needed and more. The bed was super comfy and as if we were sleeping in our own at home. If in the area, I would highly recommend for anyone to look up this listing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about Clearview Cottage and the host, Diane! The space is absolutely precious! The moment you step inside you feel at ease. The farmhouse has been completely renovated and the decor compliments the surroundings. The kitchen is fully stocked! I cooked every meal during my stay and didn’t need a thing. The bathroom is nicely appointed with nice fluffy towels complete with soaps, etc. The bedroom was my favorite… the bed was super comfortable, the linens were nice and soft and extra outlets for charging electronics came in handy. The host has truly thought of everything to ensure an amazing stay!
Diane is a gem! Super fast responses always. She’s helpful, kind and truly cares that her guests only have the best experience in her home! This is my 2nd visit and I already can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was beautiful, very peaceful, great for a little getaway! They also have a telescope that is amazing to use at night for the stars, loved being surrounded by the cows, and also watching the sunrise in the mornings!! Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone (:"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a delightful respite in the countryside. Just what I was needing! And perfect timing to see the tulips booming at the Belle Plaine arboretum. Thank you to Diane for being a wonderful host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Cottage was perfect for my first solo getaway. Diane was very responsive when I had questions.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what we needed after a month of nonstop activities. Had relatives near by that we hadn’t seen for awhile.
It was so relaxing. My favorite thing to do is look out our window and drink my coffee. It was even better at Diane’s watching sunrise and the calves playing with each other❣️
Instructions were to a tee and so were the accommodations.
Thank you."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's always clean and inviting. We so enjoy the quiet and peaceful setting. It's like coming home to relax after a busy day.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I rented the cottage for my son and groomsmen to stay in and prepare for the wedding. They love the surroundings and the quietness of it all!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed a few days while my daughter had a baby. It was the perfect spot to relax while we waited for her arrival. SO much better than a hotel with more space, quiet location, and full kitchen to avoid eating out! We will definitely be staying here again!!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Diane's Place was Beautiful quiet and serene getaway just a short distance outside of Wichita. The cottage had a bay window next to the breakfast nook that overlooked acres of Kansas farmland. A big change for us urban folks, which is just what we needed. She is an excellent hostess. She brought us over some fresh farm treats to make our stay more pleasant. I would recommend Clearview cottage toady couple looking to getaway from the Urban hustle bustle. You will be enchanted just as we were."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place of the beaten path. Quiet. Peaceful. Pastoral. Great kitchen.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly as described. I work in the central-east section of Wichita and it took me about 30 minutes to make the drive. It is quiet, private, and rural. Think: no street lights, nearly no traffic. I loved staying there for a weekend and coming to a full stop from my hectic schedule"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Diane’s place was a perfect spot for my husband to stay at while out of town on business! He loved the rural location and thankful he didn’t have to drive into Wichita other than for groceries the first night. Beautiful accommodation! Thank you!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do it justice! I loved the house and the surroundings; it was idyllic. Diane was a fabulous host! She thought of everything! I had a flat tire and her husband came to help me; it was much appreciated; and even gave me local recommendations to get it fixed. Very kind people! Even though you’re surrounded by cows, you don’t really even hear them. I heard them maybe 3 times; and that’s because moms were calling for babies. Close to the highway; yet far enough out it’s peaceful. It’s about 2 hours away from the pioneer woman stuff. Close to parks for walking or place. It’s close to entertainment places. Diane really is the host with the most; she’s thought of everything! I’m definitely coming back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Diane is a fantastic host and very open for communication. The pictures do not do justice for the beauty and comfort I found at this beautiful cottage! I booked a one night stay and had everything I needed and more! I wish I could have stayed longer and look forward to coming back very soon. Quick easy drive to Wichita and serene place to call home away from home!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable Country guest house. Felt like a place I could stay and retreat for a little while. Backyard is where the cows feed and it was absolutely enjoyable. Clean country home. Definitely recommend for those looking for a retreat. Updated interior. Cozy stay :)

It has been well cared for and Diane had all the amenities provided that we needed. Drinking coffee in the morning in front of the dining windows provided a beautiful and serene view. All the décor and little personal touches everywhere set just the right vibe. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were so soft. It took us about 20 - 25 minutes to get to nearly everything in Wichita yet provided a quiet farmhouse place to relax in at night. We loved our stay."

We enjoyed visiting the sites in Wichita, but each day we looked forward to coming back to this charming cottage in the afternoon to escape the 100+ temperatures and to relax and cool off. Farm fresh eggs, homemade plum jelly, blueberry muffins and a well-stocked kitchen helped us feel right at home. Diane’s tasteful farmhouse decor and the beautiful rural setting create a welcome oasis for any guest looking for a getaway. It has been a blessing to stay at Clearview Cottage and to experience Diane’s warm hospitality."

If you stay here and a dog (Abby) shows up at the door, its my fault, We were playing fetch. The next day after we played, Abby was on the porch waiting for me when I got home. Its nice to have someone greet you at the door."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Home was just right for our family of 6 while in town for a graduation. Spacious and clean and well stocked kitchen with cooking/eating utensils. Game room was a bonus for our 7 year old and we used the private back yard and fire pit for hanging out. Appreciate that home is pet friendly too! Would recommend this place to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the place will be back soon

She responded right away and extended our agreement and we did not have to stress about anything. The house was very clean and provided things to have fun with like games, basketball, foosball, arcade games and a nice fire-it!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Jennifer responded right away to any of my questions. It was the first time we ever stayed in an Airbnb. Really enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Place was very clean and homey in a great location! We had 2 adult women and 3 kids and it was the perfect house for what we needed. Jennifer was super friendly and accommodating.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay at this home. You can tell the hosts have put extra thought into supplying the little things that they believe travelers would need along their stay. The place was extremely clean and everything was comfortable. My wife made mention about how it was obvious that they go the extra mile to use good detergent for their linens, as everything smelled good. One thing I appreciated was the check out instructions were simple. I have stayed at places with a check out checklist of 25 things and this was short and sweet.
To top it all off, the game room was a big hit with my kids during our down time.
Would definitely recommend."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was roomy for our party of 6. The decor was nice, quiet neighborhood and beds were comfy. We were REALLY disappointed with the full bath. The shower was hard to use, especially for children. Coffee and creamer provider but all three canisters were empty of sugar. The back door is hard to shut. Board games and game room were a hit. All the money put into the home, it's disappointing seeing the condition on the only full bath in the home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved Jennifer’s place! So cute and so clean! Exactly as described and had everything we could have possibly needed. Jennifer checked in early to be sure we had everything. The extra game room in the garage and extra games inside were the perfect touch for our kiddos. Due to rain, we weren’t able to enjoy the backyard, but loved the furnishings! Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It’s a pretty quiet neighborhood

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great location for our stay in Wichita. Jennifer was quick with responses if there were any question.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a comfortable older home, fairly updated and clean. It was a good space for the five of us to stay, conveniently near our daughter’s home while it was being renovated. Quiet neighborhood, with off the street parking. Kitchen had enough dishes, but few pans. Comfortable beds and linens. Plenty of nice towels in the bathroom. Thank goodness for instructions on how to work the tub/shower! Nice to have laundry available, but washer is LOUD, as is light/fan in the half bath. Weather was not conducive to using the lovely outdoor space in the backyard or the unheated “game room” in the unfinished garage space. Not a luxury place, but comfortable and homey."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer was quick to respond to all my messages and so very nice. The home was cute, comfy and close to great places to eat. It was perfect for our little surprise Christmas visit with my son’s family!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The home was very clean and felt extremely homey. The extra Christmas touches were awesome. Christmas decor and Christmas coffee flavors for the keurig made it feel like a home away from home. It was super rainy the entire time otherwise we would have taken advantage of the fire pit. There was even popcorn and s’mores fixings. Great stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was the perfect location for us. I have no complaints . Enjoyed our stay.

Thanks!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily's place was absolutely lovely. The house is right in the middle of town and no more than 15 minutes to literally anything you'd want to see/do. The neighborhood was welcoming and quite. We enjoyed several evening and morning walks and would regularly sit on the front porch to relax. The recent updated were well done and fit the homes charm.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy space to stay, there were some games provided. It was a great place away from home."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed it, and Emily was a great host-very accommodating and responsive. The home was conveniently located and easy to get to. Super clean and comfy with all the amenities we needed, and though the place is small, we never felt cramped. It was just fine for the two of us. I liked the upstairs bedroom a lot. Warm and the bed was so comfortable! It was a little noisy late at night on the weekend with unfamiliar and sometimes scary sounds, and we would have preferred our own parking space rather than street, but we never had any problem parking right in front of the door, and there wasn’t any traffic around the house. It was overall a great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Cozy, beautiful and quiet."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet at night, comfy beds, spacious upstairs bedroom, everything very clean. We had a great stay!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house close to everything, 15 minute drive to anywhere in Wichita. Close to hospital campus, WSU, shopping area and Old Town. House was as it looks and kitchen was well stocked. Steet parking- but we didn’t have an issue with that. Area felt safe and neighbors were friendly. There’s another unit attached to the back- I don’t believe anyone was there while we were though."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily’s place was clean and exactly how it was described! Emily gave clear instructions on how to access the space and Eve thing went smooth! The location is close to downtown and many other areas!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily graciously accommodated us when we were struggling to find a place for the night. She was very kind, helpful and responsive! The home was cozy and clean, and had everything we needed to feel right at home. The neighborhood looks a little rough at first glance, but we never felt unsafe. You can tell a lot of love, time and effort was put into remodeling and restoring the property. It’s small, but spacious. We made it work with 3 babies/pack n plays just fine and were able to get the rest we needed to finish our road-trip!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This house is centrally located. I was able to pretty much get to everyplace in Wichita in about 15 minutes. The house was just as described.

We really enjoyed the neighborhood as it was easy to take a good walk and there is a nice park nearby. Emily was very responsive to any of our questions and it was easy to check in and check out.
The kitchen was well furnished and having two bedrooms was a plus for us. It is a quiet, safe neighborhood with easy access to freeways and main roads and a great place to stay because it is near- but not too near- to downtown. We would love to stay again if we travel to Wichita again."

We had a long stay over there, Emily was quick to always respond. If you’re looking to stay in the center of town with Airport being few miles away, and the East shopping malls being few miles away as well.
It would be better if there is more sound proofing and if there is a better way to distinguish between two units. I would definitely come back here. Emily is a wonderful host and is thoughtful with her interiors!"

The place has everything you need, with a wonderful bed. The outside patio/garden area is terrific...relaxing, quiet and comfortable. Upon arrival we were greeted by our hosts and within minutes felt like we were chatting with friends. They were available and helpful, but allowed us our privacy. Really can't say enough positive things about the place, location, comfort and hosts. Thank you Dottie and Jerry for more things than we can count that made our long weekend amazing."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of the BEST Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Definitely my favorite place to stay in Wichita. The area is super safe, Dorothy & Jerry made me feel completely at home, & I was able to have my own separate space, & a much needed place to rest/recover while feeling under the weather.
The kitchen space is amazing! ANYthing you could ever think of is right there at your fingertips.
They have thought of every, single thing that elevates an Airbnb stay from being ‘just a place,’ to— “Home away from home.” For example- portable fan, plenty of extra towels/ linens, premium hand soap, Kleenex, bedside lamp, etc.
My absolute favorite part was their next-level thoughtfulness— homemade cookies/muffins, fruit, milk in the fridge, condiments, juice, hot/cold cereal, & coffee/tea.
In my 3+ years of monthly Airbnb stays around the country— It doesn’t get any better than this! :-)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so lovely I went back a second time. I can't recommend it enough for a spacious, accommodating and comfy stay."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dorothy and Jerry were very friendly and they have a beautiful and spacious place to stay. Private entrance and in a very quiet neighborhood. The price was equivalent to most single room hotels. Here you have a living room, spacious and well equipped kitchen, comfortable bedroom, and bath/shower and toilet, separated from the bathroom vanity and sink. Lovely landscaping, with a pond and deck. This is a great value and they are very attentive to your needs. We plan to stay there again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we arrived we were tired & hungry. We were greeted by Jerry who showed us our warm, inviting place & revived ourselflves with Dottie's delicious snacks to carry us over until dinner. The kitchen is spacious & had everything (pots, pans, spices, mixer, Bullet...)needed to cook on stove, microwave or bake. The bedroom is also spacious with King size bed. Plenty of closet space. Comfy coaches in living room & beautiful, peaceful outdoor area to bird or squirrel watch while enjoying pleasant company of both Dottie & Jerry. Thk u for all the helpful tips & suggestions to visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy’s Airbnb is a lovely retreat. Consider staying here for peace and quiet if staying in Withcita.

It was less than 10 minutes from the hospital and had lots of thoughtful touches. We felt safe and comfortable staying there. Dorothy provided so much for our stay. She had some goodies in the fridge, coffee already measured out, breakfast food, milk, etc. I don't think there was anything she hadn't thought of.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Dorothy and Jerry, for your ready hospitality, especially when we needed a quick refuge from our unsafe furnace! Your place was a comfortable home away from home even when we weren’t feeling well. 😏 It couldn’t be any cleaner and we appreciated the abundant gourmet treats in addition to plenty of food staples. Also, the motion sensitive lights and reflective tape on the way to the door were very necessary, at least for us. Those are just the most thoughtful & appreciated items-our whole list of pros would be much longer and include things like your availability, quiet neighborhood, plenty of pillows, blankets and towels and quickly cleared snow. We would enjoy coming back sometime to enjoy your backyard sanctuary in spring! 😊"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dottie and her husband are great hosts. Their space is clean, so very comfortable, and full of nice surprises: packets of coffee grounds pre-measured for a pot of coffee, cereal in the cabinet for breakfasts, lots of space for getting ready in the morning, a great shower head (watch out for water that's turkey-roasting hot)... Really, if you are looking to stay in this area, you should stop searching and book with these folks. You'll be glad you did."

Their back yard is like a secret garden, with a wonderful deck. Jerry even printed and wrote out special instructions for me to get around some of the construction areas! If you want to visit, Dottie and Jerry will be there. If not, they are perfectly fine with that as well. Their place is very easy to access. I truly enjoyed my stay."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dorothy and Jerry were wonderful hosts, and my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed staying in their guesthouse!

Neighborhood was wonderful and so nice and quiet!! Definitely a hidden gem in Wichita! 5 stars just isn’t enough!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have any seconds thoughts about staying here, I'm telling you this is the right, and only place to stay in Wichita. Jerry and Dottie are amazing people, full of stories and knowledge of the Wichita area for first time visitors. Dottie took the time to bake delicious sweets, and the spot was stocked up with nearly everything I needed for an entire trip.
It's located in a very nice part of town, and is quiet with an amazing backyard that they are kind enough to share with travelers. Shops are very close, and easily accessible for anything you need.
The hosts are more than welcoming to spend hours chatting and having a drink, offering locations to visit. At the same time, they are aware of your time, and courteous to let you focus on your trip.
There's a reason this spot has 5 star ratings up and down. This was without a doubt, my favorite place to stay, and if the hosts had an Airbnb in every town, I'd never choose another place. Thanks Jerry and Dottie!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay in Wichita. Close to Old Town & restaurants & museums.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry and Dottie’s guest house is set up wonderfully. They have all the perfect touches from decor to amazing linens on the bed.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was such a pleasure meeting with Dottie and Jerry!! They were incredible hosts!
After hearing about my delayed, sometimes scary flight (due to weather). I told them I was looking forward to relaxing with a glass of wine, Jerry asked if I liked red and I answered yes, Dottie then presented me with a nice bottle of red wine.
Their baked goods were delicious 😋
The following day I had an upset stomach and they brought homemade turkey soup. It was just what I needed.
And if that wasn’t enough after learning my husbands flight would be later than expected they allowed me to stay for a later check out.
Their hospitality far exceeded my expectations.
Bless you both!, And again thank you for everything 💜 I highly recommend staying here."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with an Airbnb and it was such a great way to start! We were here for a family members surgery and our hosts were so amazing. From inquiring about my father to homemade pastries, they were kind, understanding, and communicative. They made a stressful situation so much easier for us. The space was homey and comfortable with all the amenities we needed. The landscaping was beautiful. It was a genuinely great experience."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't even know where to start with my praise for Dorothy's place. Everything we wanted and more was provided. The bed, amazing with luxury linens and extra pillows. Kitchen, fully equipped to include home baked goodies. Bathroom, grab bar in the tub and great rain shower head with lots of fluffy towels. The whole place is tastefully decorated and so homey. Dottie and Jerry were available for questions but never intruded. My personal highlight, loaning us stadium seats for use at our grandson's baseball game!! We have already booked another stay."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect home, away from home. It has a super comfortable bed and everything you need to have a pleasant stay.

2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy is a great host and her Airbnb has everything you need for a nice relaxing stay in the Wichita area. It is located only a few minutes from some great restaurants and downtown. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying here again.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is huge! We loved staying here. Dorothy is so very accommodating and helpful. We were in town for the weekend for a convention in Wichita and we didn’t want to pay convention center hotel prices. This was the most perfect place that really felt like we were away from it all, even though the living quarters shares the same wall as the main house. Don’t let that turn you away!! We felt very safe and comfortable the whole time. Dorothy also left us a magazine with suggestions on places to go and try out. For someone who’s never been to the area, I felt like we had the best insider tips of where to eat and how to get around. We will definitely be back again :)"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and very cozy place with great personal touches. It feels like you are home. Will definitely stay here again.

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we hoped for! My husband and I were up on our honeymoon and this place is everything we could have wished for. They had snacks for us, cereals, coffee, amazing home cooked sweets and the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept on. Wish we could have stayed longer. Jerry and Dottie were so friendly and thoughtful I hope we come back to Kansas one day to visit again."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love this Airbnb! If its available... book it!
Dottie and Jerry go above and beyond in their consideration for their guests. Communication is prompt and they are both so easy to talk to.
My boyfriend and I stayed for a few nights. The guesthouse is secluded and cozy. It was so easy to feel right at home here. This place is very clean, well kept, and organized; the bed and pillows are comfortable; the kitchen was well stocked in dishes/cooking supplies/small appliances and some simple foods.
I will not hesitate to book it again if its available during future visits to Wichita."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recently spent two nights at Dottie and Jerry’s home. It was almost like staying at the home of friends or family. When visiting Wichita again I will preferentially look for their listing. It was far superior to staying at a hotel.

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in town for a couple nights fora wedding. They are located in a nice quiet neighborhood, wonderful relaxing backyard(too bad it was too cold for us to enjoy this trip.) Clean, quiet space with wonderful, thoughtful touches throughout the space. Home made goodies, along with a variety other snacks left for guests. Large comfortable bed, multiple pillows on the bed, extras in the closet, steam iron and ironing board in the closet. The hosts were very friendly when greeting us and very accommodating! We were given tips on traffic and quicker/easier ways to get around to avoid road construction and traffic. When staying in town we will definitely stay with them again."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Due to an accident, we were unable to complete our travel to Wichita. Yet, Dorothy was exceedingly understanding, communicated clearly, and helped make our disappointment bearable. What a wonderful person we have met via Airbnb! We can't wait to meet her in person. Thanks for your comfort and reassurances!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say. Dottie and Jerry greeted us with smiles and had muffins and cookies waiting as a welcome gift. Super clean, very quiet guesthouse in a great yard with great landscaping. Very peaceful. They were quick to offer to provide anything we might need, but everything was already in the guesthouse. Very thoughtful amenities provided throughout. Just an extremely kind couple with a great space for guests. We will be back."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host! She baked cookies and had water and snacks. I forgot my toothbrush and she thought ahead and had one already in the bathroom. She was pleasant and the house was quiet. This was my first Airbnb experience. I will do ot again.

Their place was very clean, well-stocked, and their linens/towels, which were plentiful, smelled awesomely!
Jerry and Dorothy are very familiar with the area, and offered recommendations for restaurants and things to do. Hanging out on their shaded deck and listening to their waterfall while visiting was relaxing and comfortable!"

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What's to say except this place if PERFECT! It's a complete apartment with all the amenities - the bed linens and towels are high-end. It's in a great part of Wichita and you walk through a beautiful fenced in backyard to the apartment. I couldn't have asked for anything better for my first airbnb experience!!!

The apartment is spacious (king size bed!), clean, and quiet. Dorothy has thought of everything you might need and even leaves some tasty treats to welcome you.
They are set in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by great food and fun shopping!! You can stay in have a peaceful retreat-like experience or you can go about the town shopping and having fun (they give you guides to the best food & experiences Wichita has to offer). I have loved my time there."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At the last minute, we decided to go to Wichita to see family & are beyond happy we were able to stay at Dorothy & Jerry’s place.
We loved:
the hangers (wire, plastic AND clip - their utility is underestimated),
the fans (a floor stand & a smaller one were available),
the bath sheets & ample supply of washcloths,
the snacks/candy/homemade treats,
the cold bottled water & coffee,
the well-equipped kitchen (I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here long term),
the comfy king-sized bed,
the refreshing shower,
the small lotion (since I forgot mine),
the beautiful, peaceful setting
& all the space.
Dorothy & Jerry are kind, thoughtful hosts & their place reflects them very well."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dottie was a great host! Her place was originally a mother-in-law apartment. It's clean, quiet and has everything visitors might need including a thoughtful selection refrigerated goods and bonus, fresh-baked treats. The location is convenient for a visit to WSU (10-minute drive) with tons of restaurants in 5-10 minute radius. We didn't use the outside patio space, but it's a lovely refuge in and of itself. Highly recommended if you need a quiet base in Wichita."

2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Dorothy and Jerry’s place. They go above and beyond to make the rental feel like home. Lots of snacks, bottled water and other condiments were provided. Great tips on what restaurants to try. We would stay here again if we travel to Wichita in the future. The only downside was that we are used to having a tv in our bedroom and this rental does not have one - but then again all the experts say that you shouldn’t have a tv in your bedroom anyway to facilitate better sleep habits. :o)"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place for stay while at a Wichita reunion, celebration or get-away! Super comfortable, private and quiet! Definitely a keeper! I’d recommend it highly!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy’s home is a fabulous place to stay if a roomy accommodation is desired in a nice quiet area. Dorothy and Jerry go out of their way to make you comfortable. The accommodations are sparking clean and Dorothy’s touches will make you feel right at home. Expect a full kitchen and a treat or two to satisfy your desire for a sweet treat. I heartily recommend Dorothy’s home. Airbnb travelers know a great place. This is one.

2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dorothy is a wonderful hostess and her place is perfect for a quiet getaway. The accommodations are clean and comfortable. The kitchen is extremely well-equipped, and the treats and water bottles are a nice touch.

Dorothy and her husband are both very warm and friendly and I would return in a heartbeat!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dottie and Jerry are great. They’re extremely attentive but not intrusive. They definitely go above and beyond.

2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely recommendable accomodation with Dorothy and Jeremy. Thank you very much for the great stay! I was really amazed about the details like the basic stuff already in place in the fridge. Dorothy and Jeremy are thinking on everything!

We would love to stay here again whenever we visit Wichita again."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my second stay with Dottie and Jerry and once again, they are the ultimate hosts. The facility is perfect for a quiet, private stay.

We came in after dark and you could see the address easily and outdoor lights came on so we could see easily. Dotty even had homemade muffins and cookies for us. She really plans ahead.
The apartment is well laid out. The bed and linens are beautiful. The backyard garden and pond are relaxing and delightful. Dotty’s Is the best value I’ve found."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They're wonderful hosts. Our prior experience at Airbnb wasn't so great. This one restored my husband's faith and Airbnb and is a wonderful place to stay. So private and secluded yet close to everything
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mother celebrated her 100th birthday on October 2nd and Dottie and Jerry went so far beyond my wildest dreams of making her birthday memorable that it was way beyond my comprehension. The amenities were wonderful, the homemade treats were heavenly, the peaceful atmosphere so perfect for her. I went grocery shopping before I picked her up and was amazed to see everything that was already there for us. I wish I had looked there first but on the other hand that would have been unfair of me if I took advantage of their generosity. The only thing that I didn't find that I could have used was a needle!! The apartment was easy for her to get around, and both Jerry and Dottie went out of their way to make sure she was comfortable and were right there to help me. They made sure that I went in first to make certain that it would be the right place for her. The garden, complete with pond and beautiful waterfall, is gorgeous. Mom told me to make sure they know that she will be back on her 200th birthday! They brought her a pretty cupcake with lighted candle, a card, and sang Happy Birthday to her. Her smile was wonderful to see. I am SO GLAD that their place was the one that I chose for my first experience with Airbnb. I highly recommend their place for anyone looking for the perfect place in Wichita."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy's and Jerry's B&B was great! Everything is clean and our apartment was very private. We could view the garden and little pond from the living room and kitchen. Anything you would need was available down to baggies in the kitchen! We will definitely go back when we are in Wichita.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. The place was nice and cozy. The kitchen has plenty of room to work with. I was celebrating my birthday so Dottie left me a birthday card and some delicious fudge. Would definitely like to stay again next time I'm up that way.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Dorothy and Jerry's home. For our needs, their location is perfect and they are in a lovely neighbourhood.

As a guest don't have to worry about anything really, because they provide just about everything you need or happened to forget.. even home baked goods to welcome you!
It is centrally located and has quick access to local restaurants and shopping. The place itself is quiet and private for those times you want to stay in.

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy was a wonderful host and so was her husband. She bakes wonderful homemade goodies. They literally think of everything you could need. There is a TV in the kitchen. They are both smart Tv's and they really try not to bother you unless you are passing by the back door and then Dorothy just makes sure you don't need anything and she even offered us more baked goods. I couldn't get over how nice and wonderful the little house was. It was so quite and relaxing. Their host book is amazing especially the reviews they give of the places they have been to and eaten at. They even include brochures with coupons on the back. It was a wonderful relaxing weekend for my husband and myself. It was much needed for us as being dual military. The communication between was wonderful. They are a great couple and we really do look forward to coming back again.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights with Dottie and Jerry and enjoyed an exceptionally wonderful stay. The apartment is beautiful, comfortable, and restful. They went above and beyond anything we could have asked for in anticipating and providing for any and every need we could have had. Homemade cookies and muffins, a stocked refrigerator, and pre-measured coffee packs for the perfect cup o' java are only the beginning of a long list of amenities. They even helped me with our luggage and medical equipment, something I certainly didn't expect! We travel to Wichita occasionally to visit family and friends, and we hope we will always be able to stay with Dottie and Jerry. We only wish we had had a more relaxed schedule so we could have enjoyed more getaway time in the garden. I hope they won't change a thing...it's perfect!"

2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PACK LIGHTER, STAY LONGER. That is what I'll do next time I stay at Dorothy's. There is no need to go out for breakfast as everything you need is right here, from fresh milk and cereal to fruit and yummy home-baked muffins. And plenty of coffee! There's a body wash/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower, fan in the bedroom, extra pillows and blankets, and soft bath towels. The bedroom is dark and quiet...something you will not find at most hotels. Jerry has done an amazing job with the lush, private oasis outside the entrance. Plan to linger in this courtyard. This place far exceed my expectations. Dorothy and Jerry were warm and friendly hosts. This place is a gift and blessing. I definitely want to return, with my husband next time, but will need to plan ahead, as the word is getting out about this lovely place!"

You will feel right at home! Plus, the home made muffins...so delish!"
