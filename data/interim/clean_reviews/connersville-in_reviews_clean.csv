2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, the home was as-described in many ways. Unfortunately, though, the cleanliness of the home left a lot to be desired. Our daughter complained of long hairs in the bed and we found a lot of hair in the shower, including on used bars of soap. There were a number of stains on the sheets and were not sure if they were cleaned after previous guests. While the property delivered what the description outlined, we would not stay again due to the lack of cleanliness."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Karen was very helpful and nice. She communicated quickly and was very responsive to any questions and concerns. I highly recommend staying at her home, she keeps it very clean with no clutter. It was peaceful and it felt like home away from home. I highly recommend her accommodations if your coming to Connersville.

Very responsive during our travel delays which put us at ease. The cottage is beautiful and very private in a lush setting for wonderful peace and quiet.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute cottage and matched the description. Clean, cozy, comfortable. We were only there for one night to stay close to relatives for a holiday gathering.

Kitchen fully stocked. Had the best pots and pans that we have ever had in an Airbnb. Mark & Kristen communicated very well. Would love to have been there long enough to learn some history on the property. If you need to stay in Richmond area, this cottage is a perfect place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage had plenty of space for our two adults and two teens to hang out. It was spotless, and the beds were comfortable. The game room was a lot of fun, and the living room has plenty of cozy seating. We would stay here again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy home with a pretty lot! Kids had fun with the games downstairs and the couches were super comfy. Bathroom was spotless and loved the decor! I also really appreciated the little laminated info/instruction notes around the house, such as on the door with the checkout information and number. That was a nice touch for a scattered mom brain like mine! :) Will definitely keep this listing in mind for our annual Thanksgiving trip to the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Richmond
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay. Highly recommend
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Abington Pike. We stayed here while my daughter had games over the weekend at Earlham. The weather was beautiful! We had a great weekend!
The house was nicely decorated with interesting antiques and collectibles. Very quiet area to enjoy the views from the house. There were plenty of games in the basement to keep us entertained.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend. There are a ton of nice touches and details that are rare amongst Airbnbs typically: spices, condiments, plenty of towels, games that still have pieces and are playable. The pinball machine and arcade games are great. My biggest complaint is they didn't have pictures of how great the view of the fall colors is from pretty much any window in the house."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderfull cottage. We loved staying here. It was super clean and comfortable. Kitchen is big and everything you need is there.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage is so welcoming and quiet, well when you are not downstairs having an amazing time in the game room!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was brief as we just spent the night, but it suited our needs. The kids enjoyed the arcade games."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved the aesthetic of this cottage! It was a cozy and comfortable place for my family of four on our mini-getaway. The kids loved the downstairs game room and my husband and I enjoyed having our morning coffee next to the woods in the backyard where we were visiting by a deer.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute, and comfortable. We were visiting family in Richmond, but I also wanted a home base for some down time. The house was perfect-quiet area but easy access to restaurants in historic area, antiquing along 40, and trekking around Whitewater."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This space did not work well for our family. The kitchen is in down in the basement which was inconvenient with little kids. We didn't have a good spot to eat dinner as there are only two chairs at the upstairs table. the backyard would have been nice for the kids to play in but the grass was high. The water in the refrigerator has hardly any pressure so filling up water bottles was a chore. Most Airbnbs I stay at takes care of the trash etc for you, but here you supposed to get the trash out to the detached garage before you left, which is just one more thing to do when trying to get pack up and in the road. There are more knick knacks than I wanted to keep kids away from. Cute house and cozy decor-just did not work well for us ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. This home is cozy, comfortable, and full of character. Our hosts were kind and welcoming and communication was excellent. We particularly appreciated the view of the trees and landscape from the many windows in the living room and the wonderful sense of history in the cottage.
We were in the area to ride the Cardinal Greenway and access to the trail is just a short drive from the cottage. After biking we very much enjoyed a stroll around the beautiful grounds at nearby Earlham College. Richmond has a wonderful sense of history and place. On a previous visit we really enjoyed visiting the Gennett Walk of Fame, a must visit for jazz and history lovers!
Thank you Kristen and Mark for allowing us to visit your wonderful cottage!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed your clean, cozy home as a quick rest place on our long journey. We even took time to play a couple of the games you had available."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the woods view. In town but not.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a really nice stay. The place was clean and welcoming. The neighboorhood was nice and peaceful. Though not a particularly walkable area, we did walk to a nearby yard sale and the neighbors were friendly. The directions for where to park and check-in/out were clear. We had a slight issue with the wifi connecting to some of our personal devices during our stay, but the hosts were responsive and friendly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect location between Centerville and Richmond.
We loved the Centerville antique mall.
Excellent restaurant choices surround you. This is a very private and peaceful location."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful vintage home with beautiful hardwood floors, but tastefully upgraded. We slept well and were ready for a day on the bike trail that is located less than a mile from there house on a quiet country road.
They provided excellent recommendations for the dinner in town and our stay was just what we expected."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had no issues whatsoever. Very clean and beautifully decorated.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a little confusion at check in with the key code, but Mark & Kristen were very quick to respond and rectify the issue! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the house, our 2 year old grand son had a blast. There was something for everyone to do, from the game room to just relaxing in the back yard. Very peaceful and calming to relax out back in the evening. Would definitely recommend to all!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house and yard are reminiscent of an era gone by. It feels historic yet has updated bathrooms and feels clean. The drive to the house was through a less affluent part of town so that feel did not match the feel of the actual house and surrounding area. Also if you are particular to strong smells that you would encounter in an older home then this might not suit your needs. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The area is so green and quiet.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place. We used it for an overnight stay on a long trip. Was sorry we came late and had to leave early. Very responsive,helpful hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property in a home with an historic feel. Easy to get to and keypad worked well. We didn’t need to interact with Kristen and Mark during our short stay which suited us just fine.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful and homey. Extremely clean and well kept. Would absolutely love to come back.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for a getaway. Ridiculously peaceful place considering it's so close to everything. It was nice and immaculate, surprisingly clean considering that it's an old-time cottage. I think you'll like it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love stay at this place. Clean and quiet! Nice bathrooms great living room. Wish they had more chairs at the table upstairs, there were three of us. Can’t wait to stay there again 😁"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A really lovely place. I wish we could have stayed longer than just over night. I hope we can make a trip back and stay longer. House was simply gorgeous and comfortable.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,5 miles from our kids
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely clean cottage. Highly recommended.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was beautiful, private and homey. It was close to town, but felt very secluded. The cottage had plenty of room. The bathroom had extra amenities like body wash, shampoo and toothpaste. We certainly enjoyed the game room downstairs. Parking was a breeze. Getting in and out was easy. We will definitely be back when we come to visit family in Richmond."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quiet area, close to everything. House was very clean and comfortable, exactly as listed. Would reccomend to anyone!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Cottage was adorable! There were comfy beds and plenty of blankets and pillows. It was quiet and tucked away. Kristen was quick with responses and helpful. The video games were a hit and the kids loved the themed rooms.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Richmond! Very handy location, and the house is super nice and clean. My friend and I met up here for a girlfriend getaway, and we had no complaints--comfortable beds, roomy living area to sit and visit, and we especially enjoyed the unique arcade room in the basement. Very easy access to the house and great communication from Kristen. We would definitely stay here again."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cottage is simply fabulous! Everything you need for the stay has been thought of and made available.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for letting us stay in your home!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Abington Cottage is a cute and clean bungaloe with some amenities that other places simply don't have.
It's far enough out of the city to be peaceful, but close enough that it's easy to access shopping and fooderies.
The downstairs game room was a big hit with my group. It's nostalgic, charming, and relaxing.
This place felt very homey.
Much thanks to Mark and Kristen for hosting our group!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Second time we’ve stayed here and we love it. It’s so peaceful and great for a weekend get away!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean, comfortable, and well worth the price. The owners were very responsive to messages and very accommodating. 10/10 I would stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a repeat stay for us at the cottage. It is the best place for uninterrupted sleep and quiet we’ve had in a long time! The place is always expertly prepared for guests. Everything is as described; a great spot to relax and unwind.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was very clean, the communication was excellent from the start, the house was in a great location and just what we needed for somewhere to stay while working. They were also very helpful and kept in touch and asked if there was anything we needed. We would definitely go back when in the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful cottage. It is accurately described as listed and is clean, cozy, and roomy. We liked the rural setting, while still being close to the nice town of Richmond.
The attentiveness of the hosts was quick and kind, yet unobtrusive. We rested well, had more than we needed, and felt well cared for.
A delightful experience, our stay at the cottage is something we hope to do again!"

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little house was just as advertised. It was well maintained and very well provisioned. It sits on a pleasant, secluded lot where deer appeared in the mornings. Entry was easy. We appreciated the porch light that came on at dusk so we didn't have to come back to a dark house. Thank you, Mark and Kristin."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for stop over between IL and WV. Relaxing backyard and great club/boardgame room. Big family room and comfortable beds. I recommend dinner at Colonial Inn and breakfast at the very cute bagel shop across the street from the Colonial Inn.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely cottage. There was unique decor throughout the house, and the kids loved the American themed bedroom too. They also have a beautiful backyard with a nice patio area. Our only small suggestion for them was to add more cable channels or Netflix, Hulu, etc. There did, however, seem to be a very good selection of board games that we unfortunately did not have time to enjoy as our stay was only about 12 hours. We'd definently enjoy staying again if we're ever in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great and offered a very nice and quiet retreat after a long day on the road. Our daughter loved the America room! Highly recommend if you’ll be staying in the area!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place for my family and I to spend the night! The beds are comfy and the upper-level shower was just what we needed after a day on the road. It rained quite a lot while we were there so we didn't get a chance to sit out on the patio, but it looked nice from the windows. We also saw a family of deer passing by. The downstairs den/dining area has a fully-stocked book and game shelf that we took advantage of. All in all, comfy, welcoming, quiet, and nice."

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Not a senior-friendly home. The few steps into the house are fine, but the kitchen is in the basement. A walkout basement, but not on the same floor as the bedrooms. A bad remodel job was done on this home. The plumbing wasn't done correctly and the floor transitions are awful. Many tripping hazards in several doorways. Basic TV was nice, but the TV itself is the size of a large computer monitor. Good thing it's on a cart that you can pull closer to the seating area. Beds all need new mattresses."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this charming cottage!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Directions provided by the hosts were top notch. The only thing that caught us off guard was that the kitchen is in the wall out basement. The room adjacent to the kitchen is a cool place to play a game or hang out with your other guests.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a quaint and comfortable stay, even complete with creaky flooring that reminds you of a nostalgic stay at grandma's house. Everything was accurate and clean and centrally located.
Only issue I had with the property is parking under a tree that left thousands of little spots all over my car. It did come off the windshield fairly easy, just hope it comes off the body as easily."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You know you’re at a wonderful Air Bnb when you envision actually living at the residence on a daily basis! This cottage brought my family and I joy during a time of traveling for a sad occasion. I could see how a few families could stay here together and still feel like they have their own space. There are intentional touches, such as the loaded games to please the guests. For those with mobility issues, be aware the kitchen is located downstairs. Would highly recommend staying here if you find an open date!"

We enjoyed our stay. Everything was very clean and inviting. Easy check in. We loved looking out the back window into the backyard, we saw an opposum and deer. The TV was pretty small for the space but we were out checking out the town so didn't bother us much and looking outside was a treat for us being from a city. We would stay here again!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice. Lots of rooms and beds, tastefully appointed and decorated. Ample towels,pillows, and blankets. The grounds are beautiful and if it hadn’t rained— we would have been outside all day! But being stuck inside was just fine due to the lovely space. We chose this place to meet our son halfway and celebrate his birthday. Also got a chance to check out a local Amish grocery store! Hosts responding quickly to the few questions we had when we arrived. Checking in was easy as was check out. Would stay here again. (Also enjoyed watching the family of deer enjoy their evening meal)."

Senior ladies, three of us mobility challenged; we selected this home because there were 3 bedrooms on the main floor and it was described as handicap accessible. There are some suggestions we will make to enhance senior/mobility safety, but the home was lovely and quite comfortable with beautiful views. There is a beautiful front porch and back patio with seating along with extensive outdoor area for kids to play.

On two nights, we had additional family members join us for visiting (back deck, spacious front porch, large space for yard games, beautiful sunset). We gathered in the family room for a genealogy presentation, and were able to use the dining room and living room for displaying pictures. Jean was a great host! We hope to return soon!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were recently in Richmond for a wedding. As city dwellers, we thought it'd be fun to spend the weekend in the country. We were not disappointed. Jean's home is absolutely lovely, and surrounded by beautiful meadows and wide open space. We especially enjoyed quiet mornings out on the huge porch watching deer and listening to the birds.
This home is immaculate, cozy and spacious. The kitchen is well-appointed, the beds are very comfortable with nice-quality linens. The baths are spotless and well-stocked with everything we could have needed.
Jean was very responsive and helpful in our few communications. All in all, it was the perfect weekend get-away and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Richmond."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I hosted a small family reunion (50 people total including ten children) at this house and it was absolutely perfect! The floor plan flow makes moving around very easy, and offers plenty of spaces for feeling like you're all together or small nooks to have more one on one conversations. The front porch and garage were nice alternatives for additional space if we weren't able to be outdoors due to rain. The expansive property gave us plenty of room to spread out for kickball, croquet, bocce ball, and other games. And out of town family had places to stay for the night. This house would be great for small family gatherings, smaller office parties, work retreats, and baby/wedding showers.
The host was wonderful and accommodating to our specific event. I really couldn't have wished for anything better. And the 360 views from every window in the house are amazing!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at the yellow house on the hill!!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hilltop home is beautiful, peaceful, spacious, and so comfortable. With four bedrooms, three on the first floor, accessibility for old knees is appreciated. The kitchen is well equipped, the beds comfortable, one downstairs room with twin beds is decorated for kids, and she has child-proofed all the outlets we saw with protectors. 3.5 baths allowed for all of us to have our own space. I loved having the Bluetooth speaker and business center with printer for doing the bit of work needed, and streaming my favorite music. Roku tv in the living room and in the upstairs bedroom also worked well. Hummingbirds visit her feeder often, and we were told to watch for deer but didn't see any. The ""yard"" is enormous, grass cut widely but with flowers and longer grasses beyond. So loved watching the sun go down from the patio, and the swallows swooping for bugs at dusk. Her property abutts a pasture of shy cows, but we didn't hear them moo from the house. I am so happy to know Jean's home is there for us the next time we need a getaway."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Yellow House on the Hill was absolutely amazing. So spacious! Felt like home!

My niece and myself both love antique anything and this home was inviting from my first moment viewing it. It’s so charming and beautiful. What luxury to be able to be in the past and see the property’s growth. The gentleman who greeted us was so down-home and welcoming we were charmed. Hopefully we will be able to get back soon and come “home “ again. Frances and her family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed wonderful family bonding time in Heather‘s beautiful home - such a peaceful location. She has a great selection of DVDs, as well as boardgames .

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great value! And, since there aren’t many Airbnb options in the area, it’s nice to be a short drive away from Richmond, connersville, rushville, Centerville area without needing a hotel. It’s a very old farm house, so it’s a bit weathered and dusty like any old farmhouse would be, but overall clean and comfortable!"

Heather and John took extra care for amenities that most hosts do not - making sure you have disposable cups, plates, plenty of toiletries, dvd’s and so much more. We loved relaxing on the porch after a long day of antiquing."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John and Heathers house was the perfect house for our trip. Far enough away from other houses that noise was not an issue but not so far as to be inconvenient. We fell in love with there house and it was hard to leave. John had a lot of fun stories to tell about the house which made our stay that much more special. We will definitely stay at this house when we visit this area again!!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely lovely! Country home that’s not too far away from surrounding communities. I grew up in the area and the farmhouse flooded me with memories! This is not a place for someone who is not used to being in the country and it being quiet! Otherwise this is the perfect farmhouse experience:)
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a family house, been in the family for generations, and they chose to share it. It's a very personal house with antiques and furniture that I imagine is close to their heart, so we felt privileged to have been able to stay there. The owner met us personally to check us in and show us around which was very sweet. The house was old but had everything upgraded. Beautiful house to be taken care of when you stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this farmhouse. Plenty of space for a larger group, but it was jut the two of us. Updates make this place equally charming, functional, AND cozy. The A/C kept us very comfortable :) Communication with Heather & John was easy and timely, too. We hope their farmhouse is available for our next visit!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay here. The house is quite old and has a lot of charm and is quite quaint. It is also definitely worth the price.
2019-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I understand it's a very old farmhouse and that was actually why I wanted to stay there. Once I got there, it was very cluttered, not to my cleanliness standards and needs keep up better. On the porch, there was a hole in the ceiling, some of the lights didn't work, and outside areas had ""stuff"" everywhere. I was just not comfortable there."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this rural farm house. Heather and John thought of everything and are quick to respond to any need.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very neat house. Lots of room. Great host.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"After staying at cookie-cutter hotel rooms most of the time during our annual family road trip, it was very refreshing to stay at Milton Haus. The location of the house was very convenient for us to do antique shopping but secluded enough to afford peace and quiet. The house itself was, although old, very comfortable and had everything we need. It is one of a kind and it's perfect for us, a family of four."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Heather was a great host. Milton Haus was perfect for an overnight stay on our trip from PA to Kansas. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious, with ample provisions in the kitchen and bathrooms. Heather was excellent with communicating with us to coordinate check-in after our long drive."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Milton Haus is a spacious, historic farmhouse with tasteful modern amenities. From the rocking-chair front porch that overlooks a lush lawn and the surrounding farmland to the cozy backyard fire pit where you can watch the fireflies, the setting is idyllic. During our visit, a constant, gentle breeze rustled the leaves in the nearby trees.
The home itself retains all of the charm and some of the scars of its near-100 years, yet the thoughtful hosts (and their generous updates to the kitchen and bathrooms) pamper guests with modern conveniences. The three bedrooms are upstairs. However, each floor has a full, remodeled bathroom and comfortable sleeping accommodations. The home has original windows that allow the breeze indoors, but it also has digital thermostats to ensure your comfort. The kitchen offers all modern appliances and some commercial touches as well.
In addition to maintaining a lovely retreat, the hosts quickly respond to inquiries about everything from features of the home, to its history and its future, to the animals on the farm behind the home."
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed at the Milton Haus for a local wedding reception. The house is very interesting with obviously a lot of history. The interior is old, but very usable."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the charm of the old farmhouse!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely loved this beautiful home. It was extremely spacious and had comfortable beds. I spent a good deal of time working on school work while staying here and had no trouble with the internet. The house is also conveniently just 6 minutes away from a Walmart, so there was no hassle of having to drive great lengths in order to get anything that was needed. But what I loved most was how the house was decorated. From the artwork around the fire place, the books on the shelves, and the piano in the living room; this house has a lot of character. If I were to visit Indiana again I would stay here once more in a heartbeat."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an *awesome* stay at this AirBnB. It was a great place for our entire family to stay together and just a short drive from where we needed to go. Communication was great and the house oozes charm! 10 Star Recommendation!!!
2018-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is huge! It’s such a great value for the price. We loved having such a well outfitted kitchen. The piano and fireplace were wonderful to have, too. Having 3 bathrooms really made it a great place for the 7 of us to use."
2018-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a bachelorette party here and it was so open and spacious. The kitchen is amazing and had plenty of pots and pans to use. It has such a charming feel to it and the sunsets in the master bedroom are gorgeous. It's very warm and inviting in general as their are a ton of windows around the whole house to let light in. We also really liked that their was an extra sink upstairs with the bedrooms outside the bathroom to brush teeth and get ready. It was a great place to spend the night at.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Perfect
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I had a wonderful get together with our friends at Sarah farm house . The place is truly enchanting , situated on the beautiful farm , not too far from away from Brookville Lake . The house is spacious and easily accommodated our group of 7. The amenities are great and easy to use . It is also located only 20 minutes out of Haspin Acres Motopark where we went for the day visit to enjoy dirt bikes and a quad rides . I definitely recommend Sarah’s charming house to everyone. It offers a perfect opportunity to relax and enjoy family or friends get together ."

There was plenty of room for all 15 of us! The property was beautiful and peaceful! The house was stunning! So glad we chose Susan's home to celebrate our Mom's 70th birthday together! We would love to come back for another visit! We will be telling all our family/friends about it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! 9 of us friends stayed here. Peaceful, yet packed with fun is the only way to describe this place. We enjoyed the hot tub surrounded by nature, caught bass, bluegill, and catfish in the pond, and played pool. Plenty of room for everyone. The property was extremely clean and well taken care of. The kitchen in the basement was so convenient! We loved our stay so much that our group will be returning from now on for a yearly fishing retreat! (If we can wait another year!) highly recommend! Thanks, Susan!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was amazing, would definitely come back again to stay! It’s beautiful, peaceful & you feel right at home. Susan was also very helpful & responsive if we had a question! Thank you so much for having us! :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I cannot say enough great things about the stay at this gorgeous home and Susan as a host. We went for the eclipse, and to avoid traffic on the way, I asked to arrive a bit early. Susan was more than accommodating although we were an eager bunch.
The house, grounds and view are stunning. There were only 8 of us, but the house would be absolutely perfect for a larger gathering. All the beds were comfortable, the entire house we spotless and we loved the reclining couches and pool table.
Can’t rave enough- if you’re considering booking this spot do it NOW!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my family rented this beautiful place for Easter weekend and trust me, it did not disappoint. My family is already planning on going back.
The house inside is well decorated and very spacious. The kitchen has almost everything you could ever need( well stocked). Bedrooms were comfortable. Master suite has a jetted tub (very relaxing) and a very nice stand up shower. There is plenty of space in this house.
Outside the house has a hot tub and a pond. The hot tub area is nice. It has a little area to sit and start a small fire.( small fire pit). Wife loved it. Has lights and a blue tooth stereo. Also has a unique swing that everyone liked getting on.
The pond was my favorite place. It is off the basement level of the house. Has a medium fire pit. Burnt a lot of wood there. You can cook steaks over the flame using this fire pit. The pond itself is stocked with Catfish and Bass.
I definitely recommend this place to anyone !!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Krista's Copper Dream Cottage was wonderful! Her cottage was immaculate, decorated perfectly and had every amenity we needed plus more. We felt right at home from the beginning and once we met Krista, we knew she was a person with a great heart. She was quick to respond to any questions we had and was very helpful in pointing out information about the area. Beach towels were provided for our adventure to Whitewater State Park beach, firewood and a S'more making kit for our evening camp fire, and several games were available in the cottage. Krista also provided a baby gate for us to put at the bottom of the steps to keep our almost 1 year old grandson from climbing the stairs, and she bought outlet plugs to keep him safe as well. Our stay at the cottage was relaxing, quiet, and exactly what we needed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Krista’s place was great for getting away and relaxing. They make you feel right at home with snacks, it was very clean and super cute."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about how great our stay was. Krista is awesome and will help with anything you need. The house was by far the cleanest and most comfortable I have ever stayed in. I would say it was just like being home, but it was better! What a wonderful week my brothers and I had. Can't wait to do it again next year!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Krista and her house were both amazing! She really does think of everything you may need, and even goes beyond that. The coffee cake, fruits, coffee, s’mores kit, even sandwich bags to stuff your left overs in. She responded immediately when I would message her, had great recommendations when we had a chance to chat, she was very understanding and sweet. Overall great place to stay, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The home was beautifully decorated, had charming character, and extra thought put in down to the littlest touches. They thought of everything you might need. We were looking a place to relax for a getaway weekend. We enjoyed cooking in the well stocked kitchen, playing games that were available, reading and just simply hanging out. We ventured to the lakes nearby and walked some trails and checked out some local shops. Thank you for the fruit and coffee cake- Delicious!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautifully decorated all around and very comfortable home that was perfect for our family of five. The upstairs bedroom is a fun space!

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"In my opinion, if you are staying in this area of Indiana- Copper Dream Cottage is so beautiful and comfortable and deserves much more than a 5/5 rating.
We were there for a family event this last weekend, and my family and I absolutely loved our stay!!
Krista is the best host and even had her Mom's recipe of Coffee Cake freshly baked on by the coffee bar in the kitchen for us when we arrived. (So yummy with our coffee the next morning & best stocked kitchen I have ever seen:)
It is not right in town, a few miles out, but worth the drive. Brookville Lake is close by with hiking trails and very scenic.
It was our first time booking the cottage, but will not be our last!
Many Thanks,"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Krista had clear instructions for us to get in the home on the day of arrival. The place is beautifully located and the house was perfect for our stay.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most lovely AirBnBs we've ever stayed at. Fresh fruit, coffee cake, coffee, tea, even Lindor truffles and a s'mores kit all awaited us! My dad commented, ""I can't believe there are people this thoughtful!"" The home was beautifully decorated and so, SO clean. There were robes in all of the bedrooms and motion-sensing lights in the kitchen. They truly thought of everything! Krista was easily accessible and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. We have family in the area and would happily stay here again. Truly an unbelievable value when we looked at hotel prices nearby. Don't think twice about booking this place- just do it!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, quiet, clean and very comfortable. The best place we've stayed since we started traveling since 1999. Highly recommended. Thank you for a great weekend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Krista was a great host! She was easy to deal with and extremely nice. The house was great she supplies everything you need plus some. The place makes it easy to say because all you need is a change of cloths she provides everything and even made a great coffee cake. She has a great outdoor area with a fantastic fire pit with wood. Everything was extremely clean and ready for us. I will for sure be back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel often, and our family agreed that this was quite possibly our best Airbnb experience ever. Krista was extremely helpful with our arrival, as we arrived after dark - she met us at the park entrance and we followed her to the cottage. The cottage itself is absolutely wonderful- extremely clean, decorated beautifully, and stocked with anything you might need during your stay (including fresh fruit, fresh flowers, and homemade coffee cake!) - Krista really thought of everything! It was the perfect setup for our family. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer - we hope to be back again someday soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite Airbnb stay to date! Krista is an amazing host and the home was extremely clean and cozy. We can’t wait to visit again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute and cozy wish we could’ve stayed longer. Would definitely recommend ❤️
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time and felt right at home 🏡 The host even made us coffee cake 🥮 as a welcome to us. She had everything you could imagine in all areas of the home, so if you forget something, I can almost guarantee she's got it there for you! We also enjoyed meeting and playing with Mr. Brody, the resident cat 🐈
The only recommendation would be to offer some type of creamer for coffee."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Krista is a great hostess and made us feel right at home the minute we got there. She had fresh fruits, and even baked a coffee cake and had next to the coffee maker. The house was immaculate."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Krista is a great host. The rental has everything you could need and more. No need to bring towels, fans, cooking supplies, toiletries, she goes above and beyond. Just note that this is a very rural location about 5 minutes from Brookeville Lake. As noted there is no internet. We use ATT and had zero data reception although phone service does work and we could send basic text (no pictures). Going to the grocery was a challenge as our phone GPS wouldn't pick up a signal until we were a few minutes out. If you are looking to go to the lake you could not ask for a better location or host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really nice house.
Krista is a lovely person, she made us some coffee cake.
It was delicious.
It’s a quiet and peaceful area.
I think we would come back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have rented cabins and condos around the Smokies area and none can even come close to the wonderful experience we had with Krista . She even makes a coffee cake for her guests. Fresh fruit and flowers. It is a very beautiful and peaceful place. No wifi but no need for it. Just relax and enjoy. She provides spices and oil cold water in fridge. It is lacking nothing. Games and books. Never seen a rental with all the amenities that she provides and pots and pans that are in great shape. I will always use her place for my trips to Indiana. Thank you so much.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Krista was an amazing host! She was so helpful and very hospitable. We plan to stay at her beautiful home again during our next visit. We highly recommend this home if you want some rest and relaxation. Mr Brody was very friendly too and Krista thought of everything.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Krista was an excellent host and the property was perfect. Great amenities like the fire pit, corn hole, and grill area made for wonderful evenings. Beautiful house and very well kept property. Very close to Brookville Lake for easy boat access.
Krista went out her way to provide extras that made the stay that much better. Will definitely be returning!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Krista’s place was definitely off the beaten path, which we loved. Very comfortable living room, bedrooms, and porch to relax in. Very cutely decorated with EVERYTHING a traveler could think of needing. Krista was a wonderful host who noticeable cared about her guests. I wish we could have stayed longer and hope to make it back again someday."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"THE single handed greatest air bnb experience we have ever had. Krista is an over the top thoughtful host. From helping with driving directions, to a wonderful coffee cake ready for us at arrival, she has thought of everything. The home is comforting, CLEAN (like actually clean, not just picked up) and felt right at home. We will be back. Many times. Felt like we were coming home for the holidays. A true treat to stay at her place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Krista was an amazing host - she went above and beyond to accommodate us and make us feel at home. The house was extremely clean, well stocked with supplies, and on a very beautiful property. She even welcomed us with complimentary coffee cake. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Krista was extremely kind and a fantastic host. She went the extra mile to provide excellent hospitality. Thanks Krista!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing host! Nicest ever!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very thoughtful host, quick response time, super clean, everything you would need is there. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! We visited to be able to try out Brookville Lake and the home was perfect for that!! House is so clean, updated and the host had so many cute extras to make our stay comfortable!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay at the house! Very private and peaceful! Coming from Indy with lots of people and noise this was a change of scenery. I loved waking up hearing nature - like frogs and birds! If I plan another trip to Brookville I will most definitely be coming to stay again!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very peaceful!
Enjoyed a one night stay. Easy to find.
As the description states, the water is well water so be sure to bring bottled water for drinking, cooking, and coffee."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was in a peaceful location not too far from town. We loved the private wooded area with fire pit for grilling and making family memories!
The space was clean, however there was some moisture that settled from a switch in temperature (AC was set on 63 when we arrived. We adjusted to 73) leaving both beds feeling damp for the entirety of our stay. Our last night we decided to leave at 2am due to the uncomfortable damp feeling, and a mixture of different environmental allergies we developed during our stay. Unfortunately our son’s allergies turned into a nasty sinus infection and rash that needed medical treatment after arriving home. Pollen, lake swimming, and damp sleeping arrangements all being contributing factors.
My recommendation is a dehumidifier, allergy medicine, and request the temperature be set on a comfortable degree before arriving. Aside, the host was friendly, and we had fun with all the local outdoor activities!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place but you need to know what you are getting. It is very quiet, peaceful and serene but if you need to be connected to the internet know that it does not always work. This cabin is pretty remote although there are neighbors so you feel secure in the area but with being remote, the ability to stay connected is often a challenge. We were using the cabin to visit my daughter for graduation from Miami University so when we got back at night we wanted to relax and watch a movie. Due to the internet not being great for two of the nights we stayed, this was not possible. Sometimes it is great to disconnect but just be aware and take books, card games, downloaded movies on your devices if this is important to you. Overall Jacob's place is very nice and a bargain compared to what the hotels and airbnb charge for anything in Oxford. I would stay here again. Worth the 5 star rating for everything that this cabin is but know how sketchy the internet can be."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Fire pit area was nice! Loved the forest.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay while in town for a fishing tournament. Will definitely be bookmarking this listing for future needs.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Beautiful and peaceful surroundings. Cottage was super clean and had everything we wanted. Beds were very comfortable. The only regret is not having more time to enjoy walking the grounds , sitting on porch…..making a fire. We will need come back."

I would recommend this place 10/10!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was amazing about the cabin!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the remote rural location. Comfortable and clean. Ceiling fans and TVs in every room. Internet a bit slow and we found no wood for the fire pit. Although not mentioned that there would be wood it was assumed based on staying at other locations with outside fire pits. Just be sure to bring your own! Thanks for the comfy stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great fire pit and grill place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This charming little cabin met all our expectations. It was squeaky clean, beds were comfortable and we slept like babies. We loved spending our morning on the porch watching the squirrels and listening to a rooster crow while enjoying our coffee. This little cabin is nestled in a quiet little community with very friendly neighbors."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Highly recommend also the hosts are very responsive, helpful, and great people!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely spot! This was a great place to unwind after a cross county drive to drop my daughter off at college.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very nice place to stay! Quiet, woodsy, peaceful and relaxing. It had everything I needed, even though I brought my own stuff (coffee, paper towels, tp, hand soap, foil, etc...), I didn't really need to because it was all provided. Great solo vacation!!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,A nice stay for our family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was perfect! Driving past rows of corn fields to get there and this beauty is tucked away on a great piece of land. The place was super clean, well cared for and the beds were very comfortable!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! It was our first family vacation with our 1 year old. It was perfect. We were able to get out of the house for a change of scenery but still have all the things we would need for our infant. During her naps we were able to sit on the porch, enjoy the views and relax. They had a book with all the information you would need for your stay. It had maps of the area, restaurant recommendations, and grocery stores. I’ve never seen such an organized book at an Airbnb, it was like having a concierge. We went to the near by Brookeville lake which was very clean and great first time beach experience for our little one. The kitchen had everything we could need to make meals. Every room had a ceiling fan for comfort and the ac wall unit in the living room was quite powerful that made the whole house feel very cool. We would definitely stay here again as a little getaway from the city, thanks for letting us enjoy a slice of your little peaceful cottage in the woods!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend stay was absolutely perfect, everything was great. From check in to check out everything was smooth and easy. The house was more amazing than expected, very clean, had everything we needed and more! Very short distance to Brookville Lake and White Water where we spent most of our time during the day, at night we spent our time playing cards games, the games included were such a nice touch! Wonderful location, friendly neighborhood, overall 10/10 experience we will be back very soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little place! Easy to locate cabin that is all but in the woods. Tons of birdsong, beautiful mature trees and wildlife tracks. Very comfortable seating with a good sized TV in the living room and both bedrooms. Husband was a fan of the bed. We had storms so we were unable to use the fire pit which was pretty heartbreaking as the fire area is over a little bridge and well within the woods. It must feel like your own little world down there are night! Polite, friendly and super quick responses from host. Cabin has well water so bring bottles for drinking if you are adverse to the odor. We plan on returning in the future to further explore the lake and surrounding area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to get away!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay in the woods, enjoyed everything this spot had to offer.
Truly a gem."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very nice stay at this little two bedroom cottage. Perfect for two couples or small family. Spent most of our day boating on Brookville lake which is a short drive and nice to have a clean comfortable place to come back to. We would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Jacob’s stay was overall okay! We were surprised to see a LOT of other houses around, as the description about it being away from the road led us to believe it was more remote. The front yard was significantly smaller than pictured as well. Having to do the dishes prior to leaving (no dishwasher) meant we spent a lot of our morning cleaning and putting things away which was not the slow morning anticipated. Our oldest daughter loves the fire pit for s’mores, and our youngest daughter loved walking around the yard and looking at flowers and the raspberry bush!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Close to the parks and the lake. Very quiet setting.

Check in was super easy, only thing was I couldn't figure out the lockbox (it's super easy, I'm just an airhead), I ended up contacting our host and he immediately responded. He messaged me a few times making sure we were good and if we needed anything, he would be happy to assist us. Such a welcoming and wonderful experience! Cant wait to return :)"

It made my birthday very special"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,lovely little place with seperated bedrooms. it was nice to have wifi sevices since my cell phone provider had no service.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was exactly as described! Would highly recommend if you’re looking to stay in the area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I really loved the drive to and from. I saw lots of wildlife every day on my way back to the cabin. The cabin was immaculately clean. And although the cabin is in the woods it’s a short drive to liberty. I would definitely stay there again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed this cozy getaway for a peaceful work from ""home"" day! This would be a great place to come and stay overnight and is in a quiet location! I thoroughly enjoyed the little touches of games and throw blankets that added a fun personal touch! 10/10 recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay close to Brookville Lake! Fire pit was a great place to unwind at the end of a long day on the water!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a girls getaway weekend. The snow was beautiful and the location was perfect.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cameron was an awesome host! Super responsive!
The Hidden Gem was beautiful. So much space, super clean, and so many little things that were so nice like coffee pods, and other little extras. We absolutely recommend!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Hidden Gem was perfect for our family Christmas! Plenty of room for everyone to have their own space, but so fun to gather for activities. Camerin was very communicative and proactive with information. We’d definitely come back again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The 'Hidden Gem' is an awesome place. Some of the other guests staying there, and others we hosted for social gatherings, are locals to the town. All of these locals noted how this must be the nicest vacation rental, hotel, etc in Connersville and the surrounding areas. It was actually nicer and had more space than we expected. The furnishings are beautiful, antique-style hardwood, and the bedrooms are massive and could easily sleep up to the listed maximum number of adults. Each of the 5 bedrooms has a bathroom, with 1 exception. The space was kid-friendly without many (if any) hazards or things for our kids to break, and ample common space for them to run around. I gathered that renting this space can also be combined with renting out the downstairs venue. There's even an interior staircase connecting the two.
I would unhesitatingly book again with Camerin, and I absolutely recommend this particular venue to anyone considering it. Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Camerin sent us instructions before arriving and we were so glad he did! It made it a much easier to find parking and the entrance. The whole group was super impressed by the amount of space! We had more than enough room for everyone to comfortably hang out and relax after a long day of boating on Brookville Lake. This option was much larger and more affordable than anywhere else we looked up close by. We were also able to try a couple of local restaurants which were amazing too, Ole Roost and Daniel Girls Farmhouse Restaurant. Definitely recommend staying here and would stay again myself!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was awesome! Perfect for our large group.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our son’s graduation from Miami University in Oxford. Although it’s a small drive, it’s worth the space and amenities that this location provided. TONS of room which allowed us to relax and enjoy the weekend with our family. Highly recommend!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place everything about it was as advertised. Camerin was very helpful and quick to respond. We will definitely recommend his place and be back if we are ever in the area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hidden Gem was exactly what our family needed. We came in from out of town for a funeral and were all able to gather together. There was plenty of space and the amenities brought back a ton of memories with the foose ball, chess, & pool table. Camerin was very responsive and accommodating. Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place is huge! Great way to spend NYE with friends. Plenty of bedrooms, the bar area and pool table room was great perfect for entertaining."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Camerin's place. It was huge and beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 families to stay and 9 kids to play. We traveled to Connersville for the Polar Express train ride and the location was very convenient so we could walk there - even in the freezing weather. Space heaters and blankets were great during this unusually cold stay. Great beds and air mattresses made everyone comfy. Such a gem of a place on the inside, you'd never know it from looking at the outside."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a wonderful stay and perfect for our family. We will be using it again next year!
The beds were quite hard, and the hot water did not last long. Other than that, it was perfect!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Camerin was very accommodating and understanding of an unfortunate turn of events that led to us cancelling our trip at the last minute. Camerin was very communicative during the process and we worked out a credit that satisfied both parties. I will certainly look to book here again in the future.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Already booked another reservation.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for a friend’s wedding and had a great stay! There was so much space for our group to spread out and get ready with the extra large bedrooms and king beds. The space was very clean and had lots of parking and was easy to find. My limited communication with Camerin was great! If I’m ever in the area again with a larger group, I would use this hidden gem for sure!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for a family gathering. LOTS of room and a fun common area with the pool table, chess, TV, bar etc. Very thoughtfully decorated and comfortable. Check-in and out was super easy. Only tough thing was the stairs when you first entered because we had some older folks in our group. Otherwise, a very great find in Connersville!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! Plenty of rooms and plenty of space. Amenities were also fantastic.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing! Beds were new and comfortable, plenty of towels for everyone for days, lots of games to keep everyone entertained and the space is huge. Highly recommend for large parties. Only negative was the road noise at night when the kids went to bed early but we got use to it. We would definitely stay again should the need arise."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay especially for larger groups. We never felt crowded and sound control in bedrooms was great for those that wanted to go to bed earlier than others. The snacks and water were greatly appreciated!!

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing! Clean! Beautifully decorated and yet very much feels like home! The complimentary snacks and coffee were perfect for the kids! Our family was blown away with how much space this place has. The kids literally played hide and seek most of the time :-).
The adults loved the bar area and pool table! This place truly is a gem!
Fyi, we ordered Big Boys pizza just down the street. It was not great.
The cleanliness and communication was beyond anywhere we have stayed yet! Great job! Definitely want to come back!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Hidden Gem turned out to be a diamond.
My Dad recently passed away and we needed a place for our large family to stay and be close to each other for the services. I grew up in Connersville, but had no idea this place existed. It was perfect in every way.
Our host was kind and extremely helpful and answered all my questions in a matter of minutes.
The bedrooms were large and spacious. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped. The cabinets and countertops made serving our meals extremely easy as the coffee pot seemed to serve coffee day and night!
The family fully enjoyed the pool table, the foosball table, the chest/checker board table, and all the TVs!
There were so many places to sit and chat with each other. We couldn’t have imaged a better place to heal together as a family.
Camerin, we wish you the very best as you with your Hidden Gem and we highly recommend your place!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here! Check in was simple and Camerin was easy to get in touch with and always responded quickly.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay. Very clean and very peaceful. Location was good as well. It was only about ten minutes away from a great mexican restaurant. The host was very friendly and checked in often to see if everything was okay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have dealt with Jennifer. She is always so responsive, caring and welcoming!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"She was friendly! Smooth checking in even though I got there late at night. I wasn't sure if she didn't had bedding quilt for me to use. Was not on the bed, instead I found a blanket. Had to use that..
Was little chilly, but a heater really helped a lot. Her house rules were nice/ she stated pets should not be in bedroom for those people who are allergic to any pets. I couldn't find cutting board. Water did smell. I wasn't used to this smell. I'm sure it is still clean water. Nice she provided bottled water in the fridge!🙂"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. A Midwest paradise!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a short girls trip to Jennifer’s place and she was so helpful and answered so quickly to our questions. Very helpful and so welcoming!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jennifer was so great at accommodating us despite us getting in late. The space was so quiet and we all got a great nights sleep. We especially loved sitting out on the deck and listening to the lovely sounds of the farm and wildlife. Thanks again Jennifer!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirBNB I’ve stayed in! Comfortable bed, GREAT hot tub, actually wanting to buy one now! Loved that the bathroom had a bidet (weird perk but we don’t use TP so I was thrilled to find that out)! The scenery was breathtaking! Hardly any light pollution so great for stargazing. Almost no traffic, and some unique shops locally (candle/antique shop specifically). Jennifer was a great host! She left us snacks and water for our stay, and made sure all of our needs were met. We went for 2024 WGI World championships in Dayton OH and although the drive was 1.5 hours away, it was worth the price and EXTREME peacefulness out in the country. Also had some loving cats on the property as well! If you’re looking for a place to get away from the business of life and relax in a quiet area, this is the place for you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer is an excellent host! She communicates promptly and gave us timely updates regarding events in Indiana prior to our arrival. She added special touches for our visit to see the total solar eclipse. Her rental apartment is cozy and the countryside is peaceful and relaxing. She ensured that our stay was enjoyable. We spent some time on the well-appointed deck with snacks and took in the countryside views. Rushville is a short drive away and has its own charm.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We so enjoyed our stay! The surroundings are beautiful and the space is neat and cozy. Our toddlers loved running around outside and the little playhouse (and the outdoor cat that stopped by to say hello). Would recommend!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about Weathered Fence Post! The suite was very cozy, exceptionally clean and secluded. The hosts were so kind and helpful. It was a girls weekend trip. We got there during a snow storm and the next morning the walk was cleared and they even cleaned off our cars. They gave wonderful recommendations to a cute brewery in Rushville. The hot tub was a great treat as well. I would 100% recommend for a nice retreat away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! Thank you, Jennifer!"

Our entire itinerary was to visit a couple of state parks and national parks in Ohio and Indiana. We made pit stops at towns as Mansfield, Toledo and Rushville. I would highly recommend Jennifer’s place as a getaway from chicago."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at this home was perfect for what we wanted to do. We wanted to just get away and have some leisure time to look around the county.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although our stay was short, we got exactly what we were looking for, a peaceful, relaxing overnight stay. Thank you, Jennifer for providing such a pleasant experience! The jacuzzi was an outstanding way to unwind, with a tranquil view of the surrounding farms, along with a gorgeous sunset!!! The next morning, we drove just a few minutes to Rushville for breakfast at a family-owed diner. After, we headed just a few miles further to Amish country and Troyer's Country Store. We had a wonderful time!"

Linda was sweet, welcoming, and accommodating, even with our late evening arrival and large moving truck. She provided plenty of snacks and waking up to the beautiful peaceful country was a pleasure! Thanks so much, Linda!"

THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL SET-UP IN A VERY BEAUTIFUL SETTING. THEY HAVE A LONG ZIPLINE SET UP FOR YOUR DOG (OURS LOVED BEING ABLE TO SNIF AROUND WITH FREEDOM, BUT NOT RUNNING LOOSE. WE WOULD DEFINATELY STAY AGAIN IF IN THE AREA."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Linda was a great hostess. Met us at the door and gave us a tour to make sure we knew how everything worked. The farm was beautiful!

We loved every minute of it, looking forward to go back. Thank you to the Wallace family for their kindness and hospitality."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay here for the solar eclipse. It's a large property in beautiful Amish farm country. Very quiet and peaceful. I could hear the faint clop-clop of horse drawn buggies on distant roads, and the railroad couple miles away. Far enough from big cities that you can see many stars.
Apartment is very nice and cozy size for 1 or 2 (400 sq ft). Furnishings comfortable. Kitchen well equipped -- full size fridge / freezer, microwave, toaster oven, K-cup. No stove but didn't miss it. Kitchen well stocked w essentials and snacks. Everything clean. Dish TV and WiFi worked well. You can park right at the door & only 2 steps up into the space. The rest of the building is a large workshop -- all very quiet.
Hosts live in the main house and are very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach. Home-cooked meals and pies were delicious and unexpected. I felt very welcome. Hosts appear new to AirBnB but I can't think of anything to improve. Hope to return someday. Highly recommended!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful quiet spot! The hosts met me upon arrival, gave me TV and heating instructions. The place was clean and we'll stocked.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy and comfortable. Super quiet in the country. Plenty of towels provided. Tv in living area and bedroom.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice duplex suite. The downstairs unit was one large single room, I had thought the living room and bedroom were separate from the photos. There were quite a few insects inside despite us cleaning every day. Lots of things to entertain our kids in and around the house. Karen was very pleasant and helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very beautiful property, definitely one of the best air bnbs you can find in the area, highly recommend!"

Everything was clean, Karen was extremely friendly and responsive. They also make homemade soaps which she was nice enough to bring some samples over. I highly recommend giving them a try, they were wonderful so we placed an order online to purchase some as well. Overall very impressed and highly recommend this stay if you’re looking for something in the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a restful, peaceful setting that is kept in pristine condition and has all the amenities you might need, this is your place! My friends and I appreciated the attention to detail, from the country decor to the provided tea variety and snacks, to the Candylane game stored under the master bed. (Yes, we discovered that even adults can find enjoyment in a simple game of Candylane!) We look forward to visiting again when the weather warms up and we can enjoy more of the outdoor space this property provides. (It was a frigid 3 degrees on departure day, but warm and cozy inside!) Thank you, Karen!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I rented the entire home for an off site brainstorming meeting. We all know that cannot be done in the office!
It was absolutely perfect! We truly had a wonderful & productive time. We have decided this may need to be our “go place” for all of our off site business meetings as well as a get away for family time with our adult children."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed with Karen. We rented the whole house for visiting family during Miami’s December gradation and held and impromptu holiday celebration.

We had truly the most marvelous family holiday gathering thanks to Karen and Taaphasia!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Good value, very clean, convenient floor plan with 2 floors and 2 living rooms.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"OUTSTANDING!!!
The pics and description are extremely accurate but DO NOT do this place justice! Don’t hesitate to book. It is quite possibly the most well appointed property in which we have ever stayed, right down to the special welcome treats and the basic toiletries! Inside and outside toys and activities.
This was an excellent choice!
Thanks Karen, we will be inquiring on our next trip to the area."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was Awesome! Everything was extremely clean and beautifully decorated! The amenities were amazing. They have thought of EVERYTHING! All you need is your clothes. They even had lots for the kids to do. We rented the whole house. The one thing that was hard to tell from pictures was that the king bed area is open to the kitchen which isn’t ideal. However, it posed no problem at all for us as we know our travel mates well and aren’t shy. Karen was very responsive when we had questions. It’s VERY close to New Fairfield Marina where we keep our boat so the convenience couldn’t be beat. My son loved all the games and outdoor toys. The grill was in great repair which isn’t always the case with the local air BNBS as we visit the area frequently. The price is very affordable for the area. We couldn’t have been happier! We will return! Thanks!"

My daughter found this property 9 months ago and our family has been back for a total of 3 times. I would recommend this property, this will be my go to place when traveling through the area. Karen
is a great host, providing for all our needs, very friendly and respectful of our time."

It is located in small town America and it really allows one to relax. There are 2 bar/restaurants within walking distance and the town is beautiful.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We normally stay in hotels when we go to Indiana for the family visits, but this time we chose an Airbnb and we are very happy we did. This place is very nice and in a very secluded but beautiful spot. The ""country"" drive to get in to it a big part of the fun of being there. My family joined us for a BarBQ the first day and absolutely loved the place also. They have lived in the area many years and not been there before. We ate at a local restaurant/grill together a separate night and had a great time. We will definitely consider this place again. Thank You very much Mary for allowing us to use your cottage for our week long retreat..."

Inside was incredibly charming and clean. Foosball, chess, tv, wifi, and more to keep the teens entertained, and really charming mix of throwback memorabilia and modern amenities giving it a style the grownups can appreciate.

We met Mary and her couple kiddos this time and it was a pleasure! She is an awesome and genuine host and makes sure that you feel at home and comfortable and have what you need. We will def being staying there again and I feel I’ve gained a new friend :)
If you are thinking about booking but haven’t decided...take it from me....get it now because she books up fast and has the best in her area in my opinion!!!"

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about Mary’s place! The Cottage Lodge is more than expected! The pictures, description and communication were great but upon arrival is where the cottage charm comes alive! It’s a beautiful quaint little place full of personal touches and a lot of heart! It felt like home away from home and was a place I knew right away I would return to. Actually it’s “we” I originally went out of necessity to get myself and my girls out of my parents house (where I live) so my 2 brothers (18 & 15) could do final testing at home in peace. To make the most of this trip, I chose an area where someone very special that I’m getting to know lives so I could visit with him and enjoy that oasis of our own as we both live with our parents for now. Any questions or concerns were handled promptly as well! Overall, Mary’s place was an amazing get away with plenty of rustic charm and a cozy homey feel! We made memories and we have already booked it a few more times! I highly recommend staying at Mary’s if you need a peaceful place in the Laurel, IN area :) You won’t regret it!"

Very clean and comfortable space - and Mary was quick to respond and even met us at check in to give a tour and local recommendations. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again if back in the area!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary’s cabin was very nice - perfectly clean, roomy, and comfortable. My group’s plans changed multiple times (3 people instead of 2, dropping stuff off early, rather than checking in at 4pm, as originally discussed...) and Mary was wonderful about responding to me and accommodating all of our requests. We were able to meet her in person and she’s absolutely delightful.
I recommend her cabin for anyone who needs a place to stay in this area. It’d be great for longer stays too, with the full kitchen and big back yard."
