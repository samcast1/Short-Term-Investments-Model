2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10!!!! We will absolutely be back. Perfect for a little getaway from the city. Kayaking on the river was amazing, the local wineries are a blast, and the tiny home is cozy, quiet, and relaxing. The hosts were so sweet and helpful."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this property is very good. It is close to Roseburg and multiple wineries. It is also close to a couple of different parks. If you are there to enjoy the Umpqua River, I would recommend launching at River Forks park this early in the season. The park is VERY close to this property, and it has a great boat launch. The park is extremely large. This property would be an ideal spot to launch a boat once the summer season arrives and the water levels drop. Over-all, this is a great place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location along the River. Very quiet and peaceful. The cabin was clean, had ac and heat if needed. Anna was quick to respond to any questions or needs. I would recommend. 10 minutes from Roseburg."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very private and peaceful setting along the Umpqua river with beautiful flowers and garden. Very special place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! We felt right at home! Sitting out on the back deck and listening to the river was so peaceful! We can’t wait to come back in the summertime!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little place , right by the river. Very peaceful .
Would recommend to anyone"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was visiting Roseburg during a stressful time and the garden cottage was exactly the quiet and beauty I needed to restore myself.
I wish more had been in bloom, I'll have to come back later in spring or during summer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location! It was quiet and secluded in a beautiful area. Our host was very helpful in getting us in and out without any difficulties. She was available for any questions. This was our first time trying an air bnb. What a great host for our first experience! Great communicator. Will recommend to our friends who stay in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing very quiet, love the views. Bed was very comfortable it was nice to sit on the couch read a book and watch the river run by."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay, looking forward to coming back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Unfortunately I didn’t get to stay at their Airbnb, pretty sad about that. The weather kept me from traveling there and Ana and her husband were nice enough to let me cancel. They are one of the nicest people I have ever known. Hopefully next time I’m in Oregon I can stay there."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay here and it was lovely again
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,If you want a private quiet place in the country this is a good option.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place was lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable, I had everything I needed to rest at the end of the day after my obligations. The chickens greeted me each morning and didn’t mix a little attention. I picked some lavender and rosemary for tea and a sprig of eucalyptus for the shower. The property is a beautiful mountain dream."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The river was beautiful. The flowers garden was lovely, though not in view. Furniture and furnishings a little slap dash. Quiet country setting."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A fantastic location and unforgettable experience! Gorgeous flowers are blooming everywhere!! We sat by the river every evening watching the pretty sunsets. An extremely special place and a peaceful, cozy, comfortable guesthouse surrounded by a variety of U-Pick farms and wineries. Worth every penny."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So fun to be at a flower farm and near river. We enjoyed the use of Anna’s kayaks and gardens.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time on the flower farm! Anna is a friendly, helpful, and responsive host! The location is gorgeous and off the beaten path. The wildlife was amazing to watch out the windows or while kayaking down the river. We were able to cook our own meals, as well as go out for a bite or do some wine tasting not too far away. Try Two Shy Brewing: Beers were great, staff was friendly, and they have a rotating food truck daily. The Burgers and Q truck had the best burger…ever. Wine tasting at the charming Becker Vineyard was a wonderful and personal experience. If you’re headed to Redmond, this is the place to stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Anna’s place. It was very peaceful, and the view of the river and surrounding area was beautiful. Our toddler loved meeting the chickens! A perfect place to relax."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great location. The dock on the banks of the Umpqua is epic! The kayaks were so easy to use and we had a blast. The perfect spot for a quick getaway.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice property and responsive hostess.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place !!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing, amazing, and did I mention amazing. This place was peaceful. If you are looking to get away from the city this place is it. The river, the kayaks, and the view are great. Airbnb should allow customers to give a gold star one time a year or maybe once every two years. This place would be my gold star. Thank you so much for allowing us to stay. This is country living so make sure you read the detailed description when booking this place and enjoy it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best host, best location, BEST everything! You will love staying here and you couldn’t ask for more when it comes to the host. Anna is WONDERFUL!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Beautiful surroundings, enjoyed the river and the flower garden!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna was super quick with responding when I had questions which I really appreciated. The yard was beautiful and quiet. We had a great time hanging out on the deck outside.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, we couldn't have had a better getaway from Portland! There were so many reasons why we loved our stay: the incredible river/forest view, the gardens, picking bouquets in the flower fields, kayaking on the river, and the comfy and cute accommodation. We are already making plans to come back! So very pleased. :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd and I had such a nice time! Your place was perfect for getting out of the city to enjoy the quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There was so much to enjoy at the guest house! Relaxing and eating dinner on the porch, watching osprey fly over the river is the epitome of peaceful, wandering through the gardens, admiring all of the flowers, and playing on our private stretch of the river. Having kayaks at our disposal was a huge bonus. Anna provided us with great local recommendations as well. We’ll definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing combination of comfort and adventure. Anna was welcoming and her property is beautiful. The guesthouse is positioned so that you have utmost privacy if you want it. I can’t wait to return. Kayaking upriver was the highlight of my stay. Thank you Anna.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The surrounding nature and beauty was wonderful and a perfect get away. It was very private, peaceful and quiet despite family being on the property. The very few times we did see them they were extremely friendly and helpful! The kayak usage and fishing gear was a extreme plus and made our stay that much more entertaining! The place itself is super cozy and cute, and that bed is one of the most comfortable things we’ve ever slept on. 10/10 stay. We would come back for summer fun for sure."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Anna’s place! This was our second stay there, and we’ll be back again. Simple accommodations, but unbeatable access to the river. We kayaked and swam every day."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our flower farm stay was magical! Our family of four enjoyed kayaking up river, snuggling in the hammocks at dusk, watching the baby fawns bound through the field and nurse right in view from the deck! The night sky view is also spectacular.
Anna also invited us to participate in a lavender wreath making workshop she hosted while we were there. My only wish was to stay a few more nights.
Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my time in this Summer cabin. I feel like my soul got some rest here lounging by the river, swimming, hammocking and watching the deer. Everything i needed was there including some nice extras like bug spray, coffee, shampoo/conditioner. The bathroom is only semi-private in my IMO so you need to be comfortable if sharing the space with others but most time here is best spent outside on the deck or next to the river at the swimming hole anyway."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Utterly lovely and tranquil spot. Space is low key and quiet. Beautiful property on a bend in the Umpqua River.
We enjoyed everything from deer watch at night to nearby wineries, a dip in the river and naps to birdsong. Anna even let me take a bouquet of early summer flowers with me. Can’t wait to come back again later in the summer!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,this property and cabin is so beautiful - like a slide of heaven here right in the river!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place by the river...farm feel...not super fancy but quaint.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We love it here! Ambiance is amazing, Anna is amazing, location to downtown is perfect for us! Only thing we’d want different is a bigger water heater, otherwise… 5 stars. Simple, peaceful, and beautiful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's truly a gift to have the opportunity to stay in such a peaceful and rejuvenating spot. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, even though it was cold and foggy everyday. I can only imagine how nice it is during spring / summer. The space is somewhat rustic, but also very comfortable."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. So relaxing and cozy! Would definitely stay there again
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely cabin located on prime land next to the Umpqua River. If you are a bird lover, you will adore this location, as even in the wintertime there was an amazing assortment of birds feeding on the plantings just outside of the double glass door, and deer coming and going as well. Between the sliding glass door and the large window you have a ring-side seat to nature! The kitchen does not have a stove, in case you are not aware from the listing, but has a small refrigerator and sink, as well as other basics. Very comfortable bed!! Very serene and quiet, just an absolutely lovely and peaceful place to be. In the summer there are kayaks that would make this a really fun adventure spot, too. Don't pass up on the opportunity to stay here if it fits your needs in size!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, charming, and peaceful surroundings!! I loved everything about this sweet cabin and lake front!! Warm and cozy and clean! Best bed ever!! Thank you Anna for a lovely visit and change of pace! Aloha from Hawaii! Mahalo and blessings to you! Will come back!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little spot right on the river in the Umpqua Valley wine country. This is not the most glamorous space, but it is very cute and homey. The fun part is you are on a flower farm, right on the Umpqua river."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great “little house” close to the river with kayaks provided! Surrounded by beautiful flower gardens - Bed was very comfortable - Anna was a welcoming host, we enjoyed our time there!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely farm! Anna's place was so quaint and quiet. The place exuded welcoming and friendliness. It was obvious that Anna is an artist by the clever ways the room was designed. The bed was extremely comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This quirky, tiny house is a nice, quiet oasis to enjoy some peace among lovely flowers, sweet wildlife, and the relaxing hum of the river. The highlight for our son was the friendly cat and chicken, and the frolicking dear running across the field in the evening."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect. The place is very peaceful and we were greeted every morning by a very friendly orange cat and chickens. The flowers are way pretty in the morning sun and kayaking in the early morning was beautiful.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was absolutely amazing. The location, the tiny house, the gardens and flowers, the river and the host were all fantastic. We slept ""like babies"" because it was so quite and we had the windows open all day and night to enjoy the beautiful smell of the flowers and grass. The access to the river was so easy and we enjoyed some time on the water. All-in-all, we could not have had a better time. Thank you Anna!!!!! For anybody reading this, just book it...it is that great!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the quiet and beautiful flower farm and enjoyed the cozy little place. Anna was easy to communicate with and the place seemed nice and laid back. Perfect for a special weekend with my young daughter!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your Airbnb is so nice, we really enjoyed it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location, and perfect kayaking water if you are into it. Also saw some beautiful browns in the water if you like fishing. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! So so beautiful and very cute.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We need to come back. we love the time we spent in Anna's place. This place is out of our normal daily life and my family loved it.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, great view"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna’s place is lovely. We had a great time on the river with the kayaks. Just a little upriver the water is slow moving with some deep spots for swimming. Be sure to paddle up there. Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful location with gorgeous views. Such a cozy space with multiple spots to sit and enjoy the scenery. It’s the kind of place that makes you dream about buying some land and leaving the city life behind.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beauty of the river, surround of flowers, and expanse of sky created a magical and healing sanctuary."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Anna’s place is heavenly. The view, flowers, river, and town are amazing. You wont regret booking! Cant wait to be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna’s house was fantastic. The view is amazing and the house was extremely comfortable. We had an amazing time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! Surrounded by The best of Oregon’s beauty and wilderness, this river side retreat is a MUST visit! We got to pick beautiful flowers at Anna’s farm, picked deliciously fresh blueberries right off the bush just up the road, it’s an easy 2 hours to the stunning Crater Lake and a quick 2 hour breathtaking drive west to the Oregon coast. The weather was gorgeous! They provided kayaks for us and we took full advantage, kayaking up the Umpqua river every evening. To say that our week spent at Rustic River Farms was an unforgettable experience would be selling it short. Cannot recommend this place enough! If you’re in the area or even just looking for the perfect cross country getaway (we live in Oklahoma!), book this place immediately! You will not regret it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"COZY accommodations in absolutely GORGEOUS setting, everything we needed along with generous hosts❣️❣️❣️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just what we needed! This was the last leg of our six night Oregon vacation. There is no way to capture, in a picture, exactly how beautiful and peaceful this property truly is. We ventured out to wonderful local wineries and scenic adventures by day. Our favorite part of the day, though was our nights down at the river. Both nights began with talking up who was going to be the nightly champ of cornhole. We laughed, a lot! The romantic and beautiful ease of the river, and all of its surroundings, left us feeling refreshed, relaxed and recharged. Anna's flower farm was a perk. We thoroughly enjoyed being able to experience the first day of u-pick season. The customers were quiet and respectful and it was easy to see that, they too experienced peace and joy, during their time on the flower farm. We'll be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, and a relaxed interaction with the host."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful spot, lovely deck with view of a grassy field leading down to the river. Shady spot to sit and play corn hole down by the river bank, a minute’s walk from the deck. The cabin was all that was promised, very small, clean, cozy and efficiently laid out. A little small for 2 adults and a child; by the time the sleeper sofa is pulled out and bags are unpacked, the only place to sit is out on the deck. And it’s primitive: the bathroom door is a wobbly barn door that doesn’t provide much privacy, there is no bathroom sink, and the hot plate is only big enough for a kettle. But if you’re here to enjoy the outdoors, with private river access, you’ll find what you need here."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Idyllic little getaway on a pristine flower farm by the Umpqua River. We love staying here and it was our second visit.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and peaceful. The flowers and herbs are lovely and make a very relaxing atmosphere.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is quiet,peaceful and cozy. At the end of the road with the river and birds just at your foot step.the tiny cabin had all you need and more. Walk the meadow or just sit at the back deck and let the stress melt away.Would recommend it to any body in need to reconnect with there self.Fish or swim at the river ,winery with pizza next door.Theres just so much around that you wont regret staying here,Hope to be back again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place to stay on the mighty Umpqua River. The house was a modest little getaway with everything you need for a quiet escape. We were there too early to really enjoy the whole experience but we would definitely return later in the summer to see flowers, pick fresh fruit, and canoe the river. Great location too. Right in the heart of Umpqua Valley Wine tours, right next to the river, only 20 minutes from Roseburg or Sutherlin and at the end of a gravel road. Perfect for a single or couple who don’t need all the extra “stuff” in life."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed meeting the host, and it was very delightful to enjoy the sunset while listening to the river."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot. Perfect for a couple. Spent the day reading. Got to watch ospreys and a bald eagle hunting while we had breakfast on the patio. Simple, no frills, and serene!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with an amazing view!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect little bohemian cottage right on the wine trail, on the river, surrounded by flowers and birds and only 10 min from town. Wonderful hosts and a great getaway."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property. Very friendly and accommodating hosts. Wonderful stay once again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorable studio! Everything you could need is available. So nice to come in to a Bouquet of flowers. Perfect location, just far enough away from town. Very relaxing. Thank you for the wonderful weekend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the most charming time here! Clematis in bloom & Peonies budding. Appreciated how quiet & cozy the space was. Friendly farm cats & chicks were such a delight. Perfect spot for celebrating a birthday + Anniversary. Already planning future returns:) 🌸
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have picked a more perfect place to enjoy the Umpqua River in Roseburg. Cozy, warm and inviting. The hosts were kind and answered any questions we had. A great place for a weekend getaway to check out the area!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quirky is the key, with awesome added. We had everything we needed for a great stay. Being right on the river is a special treat."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cabin on riverfront property is truly a gem! Upon arriving, the host Annna was very friendly and welcoming. However, the cabin is situated in such a way, that you can also enjoy the privacy of sitting on the deck facing pastures and the Umpqua River, and have your own time there, which is nice. The sleeping area is very comfortable and cozy, the kitchen quite functional, and the entire space was decorated just beautiful! The location also is just perfect in being maybe a 10-15 min drive to town, and yet you are clearly out in the countryside!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay... beautiful property nice and quite... thanks!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet, rustic place on a beautiful river. Enjoy the plants, flowers, and animals while being off the beaten path. All the basics are provided for a relaxing stay. I hope to return again to this special place. Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at Anna’s cabin by the river. It was cozy, orderly, and super refreshing. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a place to unwind and find a moment of stillness and quiet."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Beautiful location.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a fantastic time staying here and enjoying the seating area outback with the sunset. It was very peaceful and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Highly suggest for someone looking for a quiet place to stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s Farm is the perfect weekend get away! October is the perfect time to go, as I spent two brisk mornings outside enjoying the wonderful view. The guesthouse was private and cozy!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place! Was as described. Anna was a very responsive and friendly host. The area is very lovely and private, with a cute little deck where you can look over the fields and smell the lavender and eucalyptus. Kayaking was wonderful, with all the things we needed right there (boats, paddles, life vests). Bonus super friendly cats were there to show us around!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cozy. The location is beautiful.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, serene place to recharge. Loved my stay here!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place was wonderful! Very clean, cozy and inviting! The view was incredible! Would definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a quiet getaway on the Umpqua river and found Anna’s place. It was everything and more! The property itself was beautiful, tranquil and had a lovely rustic vibe. The animals on the property were adorable especially Bella the dog, the chickens and the two cats. It’s also a flower farm so there are flowers everywhere and an amazing field of sunflowers right outside the cottage. Lastly, there were kayaks to use and great bass fishing all throughout the river. The communication with Anna was easy and she was always quick to reply. I wish I had spent more nights at her place."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our little family enjoyed the heck out of our stay here while we were visiting family in roseburg.
There was plenty of room for us and the kitchen was stocked with a great variety of utensils to prepare and cook meals with.
We were greeted throughout our stay by impressively friendly chickens, two cats and lovely Bella the dog. Having kids that adore animals ; this was a real treat for them and made our stay just that much better.
Our favorite experience was the riverfront access and the kayaks!!! We saw So much wild life on the river and the current was calm.
There was spotty cell service and no WiFi but I believe that made the experience better for us. We were able to unplug and escape the screen time.
We had so much privacy and felt very cozy.
We would definitely come back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place and setting. Cozy, peaceful, quit. Very relaxing. Highly recommend if visiting area wineries as a great jumping off point."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s lovely cottage is simply perfect! My husband and I could not have asked for a better way to start our trip in OR wine country. The cottage is bigger than you’d expect and very well appointed. Eat dinner with the bumblebees, listen to the river, smell the lavender, pick some berries down the road, and definitely explore the neighboring vineyards! Thank you, Anna!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The flower farm is lovely. It’s just the right amount of rustic. The kitchen facilities are limited but we were able to cook basic meals. Bed and sleeper sofa were comfortable, the river was great for cooling off, and the view from the porch is a great way to spend an early morning."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna’s place was peaceful and quiet with access to the river and a great view to the farm and water. I recommend staying here away from the bustle of downtown Roseburg.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very calm, peaceful, laid back location to enjoy all through the day!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This idyllic getaway on the Umpqua river will not disappoint. The flower farm made for a perfect place to relax and unwind. We loved everything about this place from the swimming in the Umpqua, to Anna’s homey touches, to the glorious setting of the Garden Valley. Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna was great and the place was beautiful. The river access and kayaks were just what we needed on the hot day. We checked out Wolf Creek and Hemlock falls during our time and really enjoyed both. Close to a lot of scenic areas and Umpqua National Forest and river.
Being able to walk out of the door and smell the lavender field and bees humming on them was just amazing."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Medicine for any aching ailing anything: stars animals birds water and the coziest cottage ever. Garden. Quiet. Blueberries to pick down the road. Wonderful wonderful place.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best. Stay. Ever. We didn’t want for anything. Anna is a wonderful host, incredibly kind and helpful if you need it. Her farm is, in it of itself a wonderful and worthwhile location and experience. It’s also in a fabulous location for exploring the Umpqua valley - the national forest and wine trail, etc. We got lucky to arrive on the eve of one of her lavender wreath workshops, and she included us. We sat out in one of the flower fields and got to work with the lavender to our heart’s content on a huge farm table, with the cats, chickens and Bella the dog, wandering among us. We woke up to the river view every day, went to bed with the crickets and rushing river sounds. Calm and content. Great to use the kayaks and jump in the river for a moment on our last morning! We will be back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful relaxing stay. Anna was so easy to work with and her cabin was very clean and perfect for a couple. The deck outside of the cabin had gorgeous views of flowers, birds and the river. A beautiful area to vacation!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna has a beautiful flower farm which we throughly enjoyed seeing and smelling. The space was bright and airy and looked out on the flowers. We both thought it was a very comfortable and well decorated space. It was close enough to town and the wineries while still retaining an air of peaceful solitude. When we are again in Roseburg, this will be the place to stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna's farm is a slice of heaven. It was so enjoyable and in a great location.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway!! This Airbnb was outstanding!!!! So clean and so fun!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful escape to the farm. Super cute Airbnb with plenty of seating and space inside and out! Sweet smelling flowers everywhere. Peaceful cricket, bird, and river soundtrack to give your ears a vacation, too!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect spot for a relaxing stay at a beautiful flower farm on a quiet, dead end street on the Umpqua river. The bed was very comfortable and the grill on the porch made for lovely evenings, making dinner and watching the sunset over the Umpqua river. Definitely recommend this spot to anyone! If we’re ever in the Roseburg area we’ll stay here again!!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna is wonderful to work with. she immediately responded to any question. The place is peaceful as it is beautiful. I highly recommend staying here.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend staying here! It is a beautiful location with great hospitality. The perfect little getaway right by the river. We are hoping to return when the flowers are in bloom!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book your stay already! Anna’s place is pure bliss. I had actually booked this stay for my good friend, as I live in Roseburg. But my husband and I visited and want it to be our little staycation spot! Gorgeous u pick flower property with views of the river while you sip your morning coffee or just sit and enjoy the picturesque sunsets. The tiny home itself is fantastic as well, it feels much larger than any tiny home I’d ever been in.
You won’t regret your choice with this spot!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! Safe and secure, beautiful views. Cute little house! Very clean and had everything we needed for bathroom / kitchen. Thank you!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna is the most incredible host, and her guest house is so lovely. Unfortunately, my fiancé and I weren’t able to stay for the entire duration of our intended stay due to personal health reasons, but during our time there Anna went above and beyond to accommodate us. If you’re looking for an escape, this is the perfect getaway on the river. The view is stunning, and the ambiance of the guest house is so quaint and cozy. Would absolutely recommend. 💛"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great and relaxing spot on the Umpqua River. I really enjoyed coffee in the mornings by the river, the surrounding nature (so many birds, deer, ducks, etc.), and the breeze that flowed through the space when I read in the afternoons. It is also nicely located by highway 138 where you can check out waterfalls and such. Great spot!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for a intimate family retreat. A very peaceful quiet atmosphere with smells of lavender all around it put my whole being in a deep refreshing rest. I enjoyed my mornings sipping coffee on deck reading and dinner evenings taking in all the beauty the land with the view and sounds of the river. Great park for kids down the road, nice country market, also town was only about 10min away. Perfect!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s flower farm was better than expected. Comfy bed, great water pressure and amazing views of mountains and the Umpqua river made for an awesome touch. Also - the smell of fresh eucalyptus is hard to beat. We will stay here again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna is amazing! She was incredibly responsive and ready to help us out with anything we needed. The guesthouse was very cozy and spacious with a lovely view of the river. We enjoyed waving to the chickens and the neighborhood dogs! :)
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our first time traveling with a baby. Anna's place was just the right size. Our baby loved watching the chickens and pigs. We loved visiting local wineries and enjoying the sunset next to the river. What an awesome location!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s home was exactly what we needed for our romantic vacation. We laid on the back porch in the sun, hung out by the water, and was greeted by a super sweet pup named Bella. Would definitely stay again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time! The bed is comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the whole place is quiet and quaint. The location is so close to the river with beautiful views and peaceful green spaces all around. This was just the perfect weekend getaway, and the owner's dog is so friendly if you want company. We had a lovely weekend; well worth it, great value."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming, relaxing retreat by the river."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely stay! A perfect spot for a quiet getaway.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. If you are looking for a quiet retreat, on the river, this is the place!"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a charming getaway! We stayed in winter so didn’t have the benefit of the flowers, but would love to see the property in bloom—the view of the river, sunset, and stargazing were fantastic."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I were hoping for a relaxing getaway over Christmas and that’s exactly what we found at Anna’s place! The space was so cozy but plenty big for the two of us. We had everything we needed and wished we’d stayed longer. We’d love to come back in the summer when the flowers are in bloom and to take advantage if the fantastic riverfront!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna was a wonderful host who provided a quaint space to rest and enjoy the quiet. Looking forward to coming back when the flowers are in bloom!
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful little escape from it all, with thoughtful hosts.
When we had to return home due to the sudden smoke from the local fires Anna kindly offered to refund our nights of stay and kept us informed of the changing situations."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Extremely beautiful and peaceful location. We loved the easy access to the river, and the current and depth were perfect for apprehensive first time kayakers. The free roaming chickens were a delight."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna was a great host and the property was divine. It has everything you need to relax and unwind. The kitchen supplied us everything we needed to cook 3 meals each day. The bed was comfy. And the patio was a great place to watch the sunset. We paddled up river in the evenings and drank coffee on the porch in the mornings. Anna was available when we had questions but gave us plenty of privacy. Would happily stay again!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have never been somewhere like this before and I almost refused to leave! Going from farm to river on the same property was amazing and I ended up spending most of my time on the dock of the river. Inside of the home was so cute and very clean, can’t wait to come back again!!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolute must stay! I enjoyed every second! I definitely will be coming back. Quick walk to the river with chairs to lounge in. The guest house was absolutely wonderful. Loved seeing the animals all around and beautiful flowers. It was the perfect place for a relaxing getaway!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Looking out past the sunflowers to the peaceful river was immensely restorative. This stretch of the river features a swimming/fishing hole a stone's throw away. River access is slightly dodgy for but for most not an issue.
The air conditioner was much appreciated and Bella the farm dog delighted our son on her morning visits.
We hope to make it back again someday."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place was in an amazing location, and a perfect place for relaxation!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly way more than just a place to rest your head! Set at the end of an idyllic country lane, Rustic River Farms makes for an excellent place to get away from it all while being close enough to any need that might arise. Nature is abundant and the flowers and farm make for a peaceful atmosphere. Enjoy your morning coffee with the friendly chickens and hostdog, Bella, before heading down to the Umpqua River for a gentle kayak trip. Later one can stroll among the sunflowers and dahlias to make a complimentary bouquet. The location also allows for easy access to many of the spectacular natural features of Douglas County and the Umpqua National Forest. Any questions or needs for Anna received a very quick response and were taken care of no problem. Would definitely recommend Rustic River Farms to any one looking for a quiet place to get away and would certainly love to return."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"EXCELLENT STAY at this home. The trip was exactly what I hoped for with my wife and friends, pure relaxation. The home is super cool inside and can easily sleep 2 couples, the river is also only a 2 minute walk out the door. To be able to jump out of the house and go kayaking anytime was the best part. It was exactly what was needed for all of us from our everyday rush lifestyle. We brought sandwhiches for lunches, but for dinner there is great food in town only 15-20min away. HIGHLY RECOMMEND as a getaway spot."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful flower farm on the river with bass fishing and farm animals that we all enjoyed including our grandson. Blackberries all around area and a pick you farm around the corner that we visited and picked anazing vegtables and friut.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When staying at Anna's place, you can expect a quiet get-away with restful views of the surrounding nature and flower farm which overwhelmed the senses. We kayaked and swam daily in the river just a short walk down from the tiny-home. The space worked well, even with our 4-month-old son. Peaceful mornings with coffee on the porch over looking the river, refreshing walks through the rows of sunflowers and bachelor buttons (August), and lots of space to take the weigh off your shoulders and sit back. We'll be back."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed here for four days and had a wonderful vacation. We explored nearby rivers and swimming holes and enjoyed wine tasting at the local wineries. We had so much fun on the farm visiting with the dog and chickens, exploring the river in the kayaks, and eating our meals on the deck while watching the birds. The little house had everything we needed for a great vacation. Anna was available if we had any questions or needed anything. Thank you!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great experience on the flower farm! Loved the privacy and the proximity to the river. Found a few parks close by with good river access in addition to the river access from the farm. Thanks to Anna for the hospitality!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow this is a special place! So peaceful; walk to the river, on the farm! Anna is an absolutely wonderful host, could not ask for better. Private deck with a view of the flower garden, river, fields and hills. We kayak’d every day (slow river is easy). Watched the deer, osprey, mergansers, and so many other birds. Fun to check in on the chickens and pigs. Bella the sweet farm dog makes her rounds. Very comfortable studio tiny home with all you need for a country getaway. Bring your binoculars, a book and leave your troubles behind."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space that’s nice and secluded, great location close to/ minutes away from umpqua National Forest, outstanding hospitality, also a lovely security guard named Bella (family pup) watching over the property!🖤 really appreciated Anna’s efforts to make our stay the most comfortable as possible."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna's place was great! The path to the river is a steep hill so be prepared for that. The fridge is dorm sized and the only sink is in the kitchen.
We had the best time without cell service and wifi. I got to connect with my kid through playing games and just spending time together without a screen. Check out the yummy pizza place that she suggests. Take out the kayaks for a peaceful adventure."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna’s place was absolutely amazing. We had such a great time exploring the river with the kayaks and enjoying the property. Such a relaxing getaway! We didn’t want to leave.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place I’ve been to on Airbnb! Peaceful, quiet, in the middle of nature. The lavender farm and the river were the highlights. Amazing experience overall!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is amazing! The landscape is breathtaking and your flower farm aspect is the best finishing touch!
The setup of the Airbnb is phenomenal. It is anyone’s dream tiny home and the direction of the deck is genius because of the position of the hillside and sunshine’s path.
The color scheme inside is boho-chic meets farmhouse with colors like teal, yellow, red, and green dominating the decorations. The design/layout of the tiny home is perfect size and open enough to feel larger than it is. The green tub in the bathroom made the whole place feel retro and old fashioned.
The deck right on the river is my favorite spot. It’s the only deck right on the river so you feel secluded and special. The kayaks were so fun to try out and the water was so warm I forgot I was in Oregon for a second. The wildlife surrounding the land is active. I saw many deer as well as hawks and falcons. It was a pleasure being able to witness such beauty.
Overall, I would DEFINITELY rate this property five stars as well as the hospitality. I would return year after year if I could."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was so cozy and the natural beauty of the farm and surrounding landscape was stunning. We loved the visits from Bella the farm dog, getting to float down the river, and snoozing in the shade on the riverbank. Thank you for a wonderful retreat."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A lovely farm on the end of a road filled with other farms. Anna's porch has a gorgeous view of the river. A bucolic and restful place to lay your head. I enjoyed exploring the area's swimming holes and forest lands.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! It’s so peaceful. You won’t be disappointed :)
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint place with stunning views among the flowers. Comfortable bed, close to wineries. The flowers were beautiful! We really enjoyed our stay."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a quaint and homey little place! It's so close to the river and it's surrounded by beautiful and healthy plants. It was absolutely gorgeous out there and the perfect country getaway.
My favorite parts were falling asleep to the sound of the rain on the metal roof at night and drinking coffee on the deck while hearing the hens in the ""Chick Inn""!
The river near the house flows a little shallow & quickly for fishing, but Anna had some great reccommendations of places to go nearby. She was super hospitable and welcoming, and she had quick communication and was available whenever we needed anything. I would definitely stay here again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was exactly what my partner and I had hoped for - a quiet and private home with all of the essentials in a beautifully relaxing place. It's hard to get a real feel for this place just through photos. The herbal garden is very much alive, with pollinators such as honey bees and hummingbirds buzzing about while geese perform laps over the Umpqua river just a few hundred feet across the pasture. The house and the garden are reflective of the host, Anna, who made us feel at home and for that we are endlessly appreciative. 10/10."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful spot, not just the little guesthouse itself but the whole valley. We woke up every morning just stunned by how peaceful and beautiful the mornings were. It was nice to be cut off from the internet too, especially in these times."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place! Beautiful inside and out, the veiw of the river was fantastic! Anna was extremely nice and thoughtful, we will definitely stay there again! Absolutely loved it!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to relax and create. I would definitely recommend this lovely space and definitely return. Anna made us feel comfortable and at home. The view is breathtaking and so peaceful. Just lovely all around!
2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Small quaint and simple place in a beautiful setting. Outside of town with peace and quiet, but close to town as well."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place.
THE PICTURES DO IT NO JUSTICE.
Stayed during the winter so not much of a flower farm for us, but an amazing get away 50 steps from the river.
Dark Sky's, amazing sounds and amazing views!
Our original plan was to visit Crater lake and the Oregon coast while we took advantage of this amazing spot but found ourselves not wanting to leave, so we hit Walmart and spent 2 days secluded from the world.
Can't forget to mention the good morning visits from the Anna's dog Bella! Beautiful and friendly!
Can't wait to visit again!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Anna's retreat is amazing. The view is gorgeous. Family is very respectful of your peace but very accommodating as well. Bella is an added bonus coming to say good morning😊 I would love to visit in the warmer months to see the property in full bloom!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a beautiful spot - peaceful, quiet and relaxing yet just a short drive from town. The small cottage was very comfortable and situated with a wide view of the surrounding landscape along the river."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place! great place to be away from the city, the noise, traffic and no technology interruptions. the Family had so much fun at the River kayaking. and just relaxing by it.
wonderful place! and we also had wonderful company by Bella! (dog)"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Will definitely stay again next time I come to Roseburg.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Anna’s guest house was absolutely lovely. I stayed there for a month and enjoyed waking up to beautiful sunrises, walking around the farm, and watching sunsets over the river in the evening. This is a fully equipped guest house with lots of privacy and I would recommend it to anyone. The kitchen was large enough to prepare meals, the bathroom had a shower and tub, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Overall, I was sad to leave and wish I could stay another month it was so great!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of my all time favorite stays! We had no reason to do anything other than hang out at Anna's place enjoying life on her flower farm on the river.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a retreat! My family loved our stay at the farm. Our kids had so much fun watching the goats and chickens and playing fetch with Bella, the dog. We enjoyed taking the kayaks out in the morning to explore up river. The house was super cozy and adorable. Thank you!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s guesthouse was incredibly beautiful! You have your own private deck overlooking a gorgeous flower garden and river. It is so peaceful listening to the river and the birds while drinking your morning coffee. The guesthouse has a comfy bed and plenty of amenities to make your own meals. Anna is quick to answer any questions you may have and the space was clean and cozy.
I would love to come back someday!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here 2 nights to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had a great time!:) we kayaked up the river in the two person kayak and had a blast. Saw many fish, crawfish and birds. I thought going up river might be tough but it’s a very calm river. We enjoyed hearing the chickens and pigs next door to our place. Their little dog Bella was very sweet and loved to follow us around. At night we played games on the deck and saw some bats. In the morning we saw some bald eagles, birds and hummingbirds. They even had a hops vine. Very fun and cool place:) we had a wonderful time. Anna was great and left us some great recommendations of places to eat as well."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous property!!!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Rustic Riverfront Flower Farm Retreat is my new favorite piece of heaven. If you want to connect with farm, flower and river life, this is the place to be. Anna was a friendly and amazing host. Even Anna's adorable pup is a friendly host! She likes to come say hello, especially in the morning. The home was clean and comfortable and despite being close to Anna's home, the back porch and access to the field and river allowed for ample privacy.
The first night within an hour I saw a deer prancing across the field. The sunsets and moon show were amazing. I loved all the sounds of nature and the close access to the river. I could hear the water from the back porch. I could smell honeysuckle through my window. I saw a hummingbird, blue jay and a robin. There are tons of Eucalyptus trees, mint, rosemary, lavender and so much more. In a short time the field will be blossoming with tons of sunflowers! I sat and watched nature for hours. I went down to the river every day. Although the current was swift, it was quite shallow and I was able to walk a good distance in to the water.
When you come, pack your suit, best water shoes and your binoculars. Stop at the grocery to fill the half fridge with snacks and sandwich stuff and plan to never leave during your stay. I can't say enough about my experience. I am recommending this place to many of my friends in need of retreat and will most certainly be coming back."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible place to stay scenic, stylish, and peaceful:) thanks to Anna and her family!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, flowers everywhere, friendly hosts...we saw 4 eagles in one morning! What could be better!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a great place to stay!

Wonderful stay, and hope to visit again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect house for our family to gather. There was plenty of room, the kitchen was stocked (with cookware, dishes, etc) better than any Airbnb I’ve ever been in, and the yard was AMAZING! We were so happy with the Bailey River House and the hosts. They were super accommodating and very considerate."
2024-05-01,4,Group trip,Great place for a family gathering.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hi, booked this house a couple of times a year for corporate functions. It’s always very clean and relaxing."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,This place was rented for two clergy couples who came for my husband's Memorial service in Roseburg. Since I didn't stay here I wanted the guests to write this review but AirBnB doesn't allow that. They did try. The house is in a most beautiful area and I'm sure in the summer it would provide a wonderful place for a mini-vacation. A big thank you to A.J. for sharing her lovely house!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"It was peaceful, easy, and exactly what we were hoping it would be."

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great time.. It was everything and more than we expected.. Clean, for well equipped home.. There was a very large group of us, and we were very comfortable.. Will definitely be staying there again.. Thank you so much!!"

Anna June was super friendly and responsive. If I have the chance to visit Roseburg in the future, I will definitely look to stay at Anna June's home again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I had the best time here. This house is in a perfect location and the amenities were more than expected. We definitely want to visit again!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at this home. The view and outdoor areas are beautiful. We will return next summer to fully take advantage of the outdoor activities.
The home was spacious and well equipped. The kitchen is especially fabulous and nicely stocked. The bar room is a fun bonus.
This is an older home that has had some updating done. It’s a mix of contemporary and nostalgic with nice furnishings, a great layout and some cool decor. The entire river side of the house provides a wonderful view of the outdoors.
The hosts were responsive and helpful from start to finish.
Thanks for sharing the home and we look forward to staying again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This was our 2nd visit staying at Baileys River House. This home worked great for our family stay in Roseburg. The setting is awesome. Highly recommend
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you, for supporting our wildland fire crew."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our family has stayed at The Bailey River House a few times. Its a beautiful home and a great location for all of us to come together and spend time together.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place so much! It is an older home, but well loved and very comfortable. The outdoor area was much more than I expected! So very beautiful and peaceful. Having morning coffee at the river each morning was amazing. Loved the kayaks and firepit circle! Thank you for the wonderful family memories that were made. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"beautiful home on the river. Not particularly safe for real little kids, but it was lovely"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay with wonderful space at the property, inside and out.
We all spent time in the lush grassy front and back yard for games, used the bbq and fire pit overlooking the river, the dock and boats. The best spot was the shady, grape covered patio on a hot day to get out of the sun, but still enjoy watching the river activities.
The kitchen made it easy to cook for a crowd and the pub room was popular too. We loved staying here a couple years ago during a winter snow, and will be back in the summer again"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I believe this was the 3rd year we've stayed at The Bailey River house. Always a great time is had by all.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We have been coming back to the Bailey River House for over 3 years now! We make a goal to visit (hopefully) every year. We love it so much and the Bailey's are so kind and helpful! 💗💗💗
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gorgeous home on the Umpua River. We wish we could have stayed longer to use the bbq, fire pit and kayak!
Maybe next time!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Bailey house is a treasure find. Anna June greeted us upon our arrival and showed us all of the lighting switches for outside and the music controls that are throughout the house. This house being right on the river is heaven and with the beautiful patios and yard you will want to spend a lot of time outside. Even had a visit from the neighbor's dog. The house is very well stocked. And what a treat to have your own pub/game room in this very roomy house. The beds are very comfortable as well.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time here so I will spare everyone a long review but I am a very picky traveler and there's a reason that this is my second time here.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The Bailey River House is the perfect family getaway spot and has become an annual tradition. The house is roomy and cozy, but the real star is the backyard, riverside firepit, and dock. The kids and adults spent most of the day on the water - a beautiful, slow-moving section of the river - on paddleboards and kayaks. It's the perfect warm-weather spot. The hosts are gracious and responsive and the kitchen is well-stocked. I can't recommend the place enough."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Everything was super. The only suggestion that we have is that the outside cooking place be taken care of a little better. The refrigerator out there was pretty dirty

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice older home, set up well for a multifamily rental. The hostess keeps the place spotless, and we had enough towels/kleenex/TP/soap/shampoo etc. We didn't take advantage of the full kitchen other than for coffee in the morning, but if you wanted to cook at the house you've got what you need. We also didn't take full advantage of the pub, and included beers on tap, as we were wine tasting during the day, but it is a nice feature."

The house had everything a family or friends would need to have an enjoyable time. The kitchen is extremely well stocked and even has four ovens (if we counted correctly!). Plus, there is plenty of refrigerator space for drinks on a hot day. Music is readily available in any room. We also utilized the outdoor grill and enjoyed some games in the full scale bar. Chess or poker anyone? We would recommend this home for any family or group. Great value."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house is very nicely equipped for families....plenty of room for everyone to relax and eat and just hang out. Fun equipment to use with the kayaks and paddle boards and right on the beautiful Umpqua River. Great outdoor space on the river with a fire pit and BBQ area and lots of yard space. Its a great location and good price. The hosts were terrific.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Bailey River House has become an annual tradition for my friends & me! We look forward to it all year!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best place to stay! We had a wonderful family reunion here, so easy to check-in & out, Anna June was quick to answer when we had a question, like how to turn on the fireplace. We loved using the row boat, kayaks, cooking s’mores over the fire pit, having enough room for our multiple families & having the piano for our musical family. Hope we make this a yearly event here. Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house is AMAZING! its open and clean and everything you’d want to make a stay in Oregon pleasant. Also, the hosts are some of the nicest, most considerate people I’ve ever met. They went above and beyond to help us out with several things and really made us feel at home and like we were in good hands. Would highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love absolutely everything about the Bailey River House and have made it a family tradition to come every year. The house is roomy and comfortable and well-stocked, but to be honest we spend nearly all of our time outside on the kayaks, paddleboards, grilling in the outdoor kitchen, and fishing from the dock. It is perfect for our extended families and for all the different ages of children with us. We hope to be back ASAP."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place for the 8 of us to connect and relax. The weather was beautiful and we spent lots of time on the water in the kayaks. We enjoyed a lovely fire one night.

2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Anna June's place is amazing. My family loved getting on the boats and paddling around. We tried to enjoy the fire pit for as long as possible but unfortunately the Oregon rain drove us inside. So half of us sat by the fire and the other half sat in the English style pub room playing poker. The kitchen is wonderful. I enjoyed making meals for the entire family. There are 4 ovens. My daughter who lives to bake nearly passed out from excitement. Parking is incredibly spacious. I can't say enough good things.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent location, we have stayed here twice an will again, very nice outdoor patio space an very comfy inside as well for when it’s raining"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures in no way do Anna’s place justice. The actual home will far exceed your expectations.
The kitchen is large and capable of producing some amazing meals fairly quickly. Two of the many burners on the gas stove are actually able to facilitate Wok pans...wish we would have prepared for that!
The Irish Pub is such a unique touch. Our teenagers enjoyed playing games on the pub tables while watching ‘The Office’ on the large flat screen in that room.
Great laundry room set up with Speed Queen appliances, which made keeping towels for a large group available a breeze.
Beds were sufficient and the linens were nice.
Overall, an amazing stay!"

There was enough space for my bridesmaids and I to get ready, as well as enough space for the groom and groomsmen to get ready. Our daughter had so much fun in the grass and our siblings had an amazing time kayaking. Every part of the house was breathtaking even before we set up for the wedding.

We had a small backyard family dinner here to celebrate our marriage after Covid caused us to cancel our big reception plans, and this was the perfect spot for it. We enjoyed the kayaks and paddle board as well as the fire pit. Wifi worked well, the beer on tap was a nice touch, and the built in sound system was awesome for our backyard dinner. The only small issue we had was using the dryer caused the electricity to go out, so that might need some looking into! Everything else was perfect!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Very beautiful property, nice place for any kind of event."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For starters the hosts are so amazing and friendly. Always responded very quickly!! They did so many extra things to help plan for our wedding!!!!
As for the house, where do I start??? It was the most perfect and amazing venue for our small wedding. Everything was better than even described!! Although I brought everything we needed there was plenty of extra supplies there for back up. Extra platters and everything helped.
The location is beautiful, right on the water. We got stuck with the wildfires during our stay so we didn’t get to play in the water, this time!!! We really hope to come stay again when the weather is nice and clear. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us! Photos to come soon!!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super comfortable and spacious place for families to enjoy the beautiful Umpqua river. I especially loved the beer on tap option as well as the amount of river toys for us to play with. Also loved watching the bald eagles off the back patio with my morning coffee :)
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"The Bailey River House is a wonderful place to stay if you find yourself in Roseburg, Oregon. This house has all the amenities you could want while staying in a rental. The yard is landscaped to perfection and the access to the N. Umpqua River was my favorite part. We took the kayaks and paddle board provided a few times and had a great time. We loved the the house had speakers throughout. The only thing we had issue with was the television. The connection kept going out while we were trying to watch sports in the pub. My friends and I are already planning another trip to this house next year!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome stay in location, amenities and comfort!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"This spot is sheer perfection! The back yard features a firepit, bbq, shady veranda, and private dock to launch the kayaks from. Upon check-in, you're greeted and given a tour of the house, along with opportunity to ask questions. Anna June replies quickly to airbnb massages as well. The kitchen is phenomenal, and the beds/living areas comfortable. This was my second visit to the Bailey River House, and I'm already looking forward to my third."

2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Baily River House is one of our all-time favorite destinations. There is so much to do at the house - cook in the well-equipped kitchen, hang out in the gorgeous backyard, or chat around the built-in fire pit - but the real star of the show is the river. A stand up paddleboard, two kayaks, and an aluminum paddle boat are provided and the days can be spent enjoying the serene river.
There are a ton of beautiful wineries around Roseburg and some really good restaurants, but when at the house we normally eat in and enjoy the facilities. A fantastic place for multiple families and the hosts are top-notch."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Bailey River House and host Anna June never disappoints. It is the perfect entertaining/vacation home for families who enjoy outdoor activities, kayaking & paddle board, cooking in a gourmet kitchen, roasting s’mores in the huge fire pit, BBQing, and for those who appreciate privacy and a beautiful view. The property is incredible, quiet and serene, & the home has everything you could possibly need and more for a fun family experience. One feature not pictured is their baby grande piano, which we really enjoy every time we visit! And I have to mention the indoor pub with beer on tap, and surround sound! They did such a fantastic job with the home, you literally will have no need to leave during your stay. The privacy and security made us feel super safe even with the quarantine still in place and the home was sparkling clean. Our kids were able to feel like kids again, free to run around and play, while the adults kicked back and enjoyed the home. Our family cannot wait to come back again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful home. We traveled up for a 4-generation family trip to the Wildlife Safari in Winston, and this home was just a quick drive away.

The decor was modern with plenty of throws and lovely linens and furniture. Exactly as pictured in the listing photos.
With temperatures above 110 we didn't get a chance to use the outdoor gathering spaces but they looked lovely. There was also a nice green grassy area we were able to gather under the shade in the late afternoon.
We are definitely planning to stay here again on any future stays in Roseburg!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful experience! We were greeted with a welcome box of treats, house was just as described and Abby was a perfect ""hostess"" even though nothing was needed as the house had all the amenities listed.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could tell this would be a great stay before check-in day even arrived.
Heather reached out well ahead of arrival day saying hello and asking for anticipated arrival time so she could be available should I have any issues. Heather was nothing short of EXCELLENT! Questions were answered immediately.
There were of course no issues, everything was laid out exactly as expected.
This place is AWESOME!. SUPERB view while waking up to your morning coffee. Binoculars provided should you need to ""zoom in"" on something you see in the distance. Everything was clean and orderly. I particularly enjoyed the decor (I wanted to keep the mortar and pestle for myself!). This place leans in flawlessly on the ""old"" charm of the house. There are some older features without feeling outdated. I also enjoyed that the decor wasn't excessive and didn't feel cluttered. The beds were also very comfortable.
I have more positive things to say, but am out of characters allowed!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house! Beautiful view!! We would love to stay here again!
2024-05-01,4,Group trip,"The house has a great view and good gathering spaces for guests, both inside and out. All of the toilets are considerably low to the floor; definitely not ADA compliant. Only one has a cabinet near it to assist. This might be something to consider when renting."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place at the top of the hill in Roseburg. The fenced yard is great since our dogs tend to wander if not completely fenced in. Very unique house that we would return to next time we're in Roseburg.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a great view!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic home with a great view of Roseburg. Lots of room, and was surprised to have three floors, one of them basically dedicated for a pet!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Heather’s place is a wonderful stay in a quiet neighborhood with gorgeous views. The house it stocked with everything you need to feel at home and close to everything in Roseburg.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Great stay over Christmas. Comfortable house and the Christmas tree and other decorations were a nice touch without being over the top. Great views.
The last night we found d the heating had gone off and the dryer did not work. Heather helped with feedback and suggestions and was willing to send someone to sort but it was not too cold so we’re fu e not to get resolved. Heather offered a night stay credit without hesitation for our trouble which we appreciated.
Be awere that the train that passes through at night does sounds its horn through the centre of town around 10:30pm.
While we are unlikely to visit Roseburg again we would be happy to stay here again if we did."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Can not beet the view from any deck or window in this home

The floor plan is unique and fun, and there are several outdoor living spaces, as well. Comfortable beds and plenty of blankets and pillows are provided. The extras in the kitchen are a nice touch."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather is responsive and proactive. The house reflects her ability as a hostess. The view is awesome. Downtown is a short walk away. If you work when you travel as my husband does, the office desk is big enough for several screens and the room is big…and has that same great view. Outdoor decks have plenty of tables and chairs. The basement has a huge dog crate. We didn’t bring our dog…but I was impressed.
One of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed in."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was exactly as described. Cool little mid century mod house. The view out the back of the house is great. Everything we needed in the kitchen to cook our meals. The beds were very comfortable and she has an amazing housekeeper.

We had to leave early due to the smell of the past dog guests and other fragrance sensitivities was too much for us. But, Heather was extremely understanding and responsive and we were satisfied with how things were resolved. If you like dogs, you will feel right at home here! There were good suggestions for things to do in the area and it was very easy to check in and get settled."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming spot in a convenient location.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Heather's home is as described and would comfortably sleep 6 adults plus children if you did not mind putting a couple of children on the couch.
The home had a nice office to work from if you were working while travelling/vacationing. Like most homes, including my own, there are some updates/projects needed around the home like the bathrooms and basement. However, the house was clean and in order and Heather was always very helpful.
for location I marked lower but that is just because Roseburg if not my favorite place to visit. The area the house is located in seemed safe and was quiet."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house has a charming, old school modern character. Amazing views of Roseburg and the Umpqua River valley. This house sits high on a hill and is split in three levels. There are a lot of stairs. But the house is well laid out. Charming and comfortable. I would recommend this place to my friends and family when traveling in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a fantastic mid-century house on the hillside above downtown with everything we needed to be comfortable for a weekend of coming and going around Roseburg. Some highlights included - the short walk down the hill and back to downtown for coffee, the gym or dinner .. evenings outside on the balcony overlooking the downtown and west across the valley, and proximity and access which easy and perfect for anyone new to Roseburg. The owner was readily available and communicative and the house is modern but still authentic and a great place to feel at home. It's also quite large including the outdoor space so you can feel spread out and private. Thanks Heather! "
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We stayed during a visit to the Wildlife Safari with our 3 daughters. The home is lovely and we would definitely stay again. Beautiful view and sunset from the main living area and deck, and the home was the perfect size for our family. Unfortunately the air conditioning was not working during our stay but we were able to use fans and a portable A/C. Heather was very responsive and gave us a partial refund for any inconveniences."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This may be the best Airbnb we have stayed in! It’s a comfortable and cute house with an incredible view, and great amenities! Our family of 6 stayed here while we spent a few days exploring the area (Crater Lake NP and white-water rafting), and we loved it. It was a great place to come home to - we really enjoyed our stay. It had all the little things that make a stay so nice and welcoming like coffee and snacks in the well-equipped kitchen, and thoughtful spaces that have everything you need. Would love to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Heather's place while in town for a wedding at Clark's Ranch, which is about 20 minutes away. The home is only a few minutes away from several restaurants and activities, which made it very convenient for our family of two adults and two teenagers. The home itself was beautiful and filled with character, and we loved the abundance of outdoor seating options. Heather was very informative and responsive, providing clear instructions and check-in information. Some AirBnb's have excessive checkout instructions such as stripping beds, starting loads of laundry, etc., but not here. The checkout instructions were simple and required very minimal effort on our part and we really appreciated that. Overall, we had an excellent stay and would definitely stay here again."

Heather’s communication was helpful. My only disappointment was that we couldn’t stay longer. I’ll be back!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I come to downtown Roseburg 2x a year and have always stayed at the local hotel but prices have been on the rise. Heather’s home was absolutely gorgeous and within walking distance to downtown Roseburg, and so much more enjoyable than a small hotel room. The house was so big that I couldn’t find the laundry room and so I messaged the host and heather responded within minutes and was an absolute gem to deal with. I also loved drinking coffee every morning on the deck and will for sure be back in the fall. Thank you so much for your hospitality!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great Location on a hill overlooking mountains and city, Fabulous View, Comfortable, Spacious, Super location to explore the waterfalls along the Umpqua Scenic Byway, enjoyed 3 beautiful sunsets from the upstairs deck, dog friendly a huge plus for me, and Heather was great sharing information and responding in a timely fashion to our inquiries!

Home was clean and stocked with ample amenities including bathing necessities, kitchen utensils, various spices/condiments, laundry items, and cleaning supplies. We really enjoyed the layout of the space, with easy access to the outdoors via three separate porches. We also appreciated being able to bring our pup along, and the host's provision of several dog beds/crate areas. Host was accessible and communicative throughout our stay. Would absolutely stay again :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really great place to stay in Roseburg. You can’t beat the view and all of the decks. The appliances were smarter than we were and we loved them!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We made the trip to Roseburg for a baseball tournament. The house was perfect, it was close to every place we needed to get to.

Only issue for some, if you have any mobility issues, the bedrooms/showers are all on the lower level which are only accessible by stairs."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Hawthorn House was perfect for our stay. The neighborhood was great for walking our dogs and easily accessible to walk to downtown Roseburg. The view was amazing! Heather was quick to respond and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again.

The kitchen is well equipped and the office space is awesome (also the master bed is really comfy). The house is older and makes noises but other than that we found it quite cozy. It's super close to downtown Roseburg (go to North Forty Brewery!), TONS of vineyards/wineries (go to Hillcrest or Reustle Prayer Rock!), and TONS of waterfalls (go to Toketee or Watson for the most dramatic ones). Also only 1.5-2.5 hours from Crater Lake depending on the season."

2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Everyone is right-unique home, great neighborhood, great views, good location to downtown and lots of yummy coffee!
For awareness if traveling with a larger group, the additional half bath and shower room are on the same end of the hallway as the master, which is the far opposite end from the queen size bedroom whose occupants would be using it. (Room with two single beds is between queen room and master.) There are plenty of nightlights, but useful if traveling with others or early sleeping children.
Overall great stay and Heather was a friendly responsive host, much appreciated!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather was an awesome host! She was thoughtful and considerate of our needs and worked with us on an earlier check-in time.

The house was very clean and just an overall cool place to spend a few days. We would happily stay there again if we have to come back to Roseburg.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is located perfectly in the hills of Roseburg. Every room in the house has an incredible view. Bonus: it’s dog friendly (the host even had dog treats)!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was one of the few pet friendly homes we could find for our stay in Roseburg. The home is beautiful and bright with big windows. And the VIEW… Gorgeous! Breakfast looking out over all of Roseburg was a wonderful start to our day. We had a bit of a hiccup with the pet fee, but Heather was responsive and had it cleared up in under 30 minutes. Airbnb could work on their app a little to avoid future confusion. Heather was quick to reply and made sure our stay was perfect. The complimentary coffee and pastries were a pleasant surprise as well! Will definitely stay here again for future visits."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was the perfect place for our family to come together. The house was very clean and felt very safe. The views are such a joy and the sound of a train is off in the distant if you leave the window open brings joy as well.
The location was perfect, so close to down town and close to neighboring cities.
Heather is great at responding and there if you need anything. Plenty of room and comfort of home. Hope to be back soon."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Shandra saved the day when our Motor coach broke down and we needed a place to stay with a dog and 2 cats. Shandra quickly answered all questions and made our check in smooth despite the challenging day we were having. Her home is adorable and well equipped. The master bed was incredibly comfortable and our animals love the backyard. Would definitely stay here the next time we are in town. Many thanks!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful bungalow 🌺🌺it was absolutely gorgeous!! We are coming back in a few weeks!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shandra’s place was very well put together for Guests. We had everything we needed and more. It was just delightful with such thoughtful effort put into this charming and comfortable home. The outside spaces were also so well kept with beautiful flowers and landscaping to greet us, even though the remnants of winter still lingered in the hills. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Zero hesitation telling you to book if looking for clean, large, quirky space. Really a nice setup super reasonable cost. Bonus that it had awesome toys for my toddler."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Looking for a lovely, cozy bungalow with good vibes, super cute decor & exceptional cleanliness?
Then look no further. Shenandoah Oasis is the spot for you.
The photos don’t do enough justice. From the time we walked in, we were instantly pleased with how cute & clean it was.
I felt like we were staying in a model home with such a wonderful collection of beach, bird and positive affirmations decorations spread throughout the home. Amenities galore, let me tell you. Games, puzzles, toiletries, as well as coffee pods & creamers. Bonus stars for the hallway slimming mirror next to the bathroom.
We really enjoyed being less than a mile to Stewart Park for our daily runs and the home is quite central to everywhere we wanted/needed to be during the week.
I also want to commend Shandra & Amy on how easy everything was when it came to rules. They were very straightforward & reasonable with expectations. Shandra was also very quick to reply and very attentive with any concerns. #Grateful"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shondra is a great host. Super easy to work with. Her bungalow is super clean, functional in every way and easy to get in and out of from the highway for those exploring the Douglas County area. She offers various books that give visitors ideas as to what to check out throughout Oregon as well. Toiletries are provided, always a plus when traveling. We own two VRBO's ourselves and have very high standards when critiquing places we stay. Shandra does a great job! We strongly recommend visiting!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. The home is super cozy and comfortable. Location was great too for why we were in Roseburg.
The carport has a low ceiling for our huge truck but we were still able to park in the driveway and there was street side parking as well.
Will definitely plan to stay again for our next trip!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Shandra’s bungalow. The home was exactly as described, extremely clean, and a good layout for our group (two adults, a young child, and a baby). It’s very family friendly, with games for various ages and an additional sitting/TV area/workspace. Check in & out was very easy, with clear and specific instructions. The bungalow is on a quiet street with easy access to shops and restaurants within 5 minutes.
Shandra was a welcoming and communicative host. We did a last minute booking (a few hours before check in), and Shandra made it over to leave a personalized welcome note for us. When I left a few items behind after checking out, Shandra kindly offered to send them to me, and they arrived quickly.
If we’re ever back in the area, we hope to book Shandra’s home again. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay!"

The host was transparent about landscapers coming during the week, so we were not caught off guard when they showed up. Would stay here again"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is better than the pictures! If you like what you see... you'll love the reality of this relaxing little bungalow!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked this place for my daughter and her new husband's honeymoon. They travel a lot and stay mostly in Airbnbs. They said this was the best they have ever stayed in. The place was very clean, very well maintained and very private. Would recommend it for anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is simply perfect.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We would give this host and her lodging a rating of 10, if that were possible! This is the most fastidiously maintained, most beautifully designed, furnished, and equipped AirB&B you will find. It is spotless, comfortable and quiet, light and airy, and it has a fabulously comfortable mattress! The sectional is upholstered in washable slip-covers, confirming Kendra's attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The view is toward the Umpqua River on whose bank Kendra has provided comfortable seating and a fire/barbecue pit. Despite being quite rural, in an area of vineyards and fields, it is only a short drive to Roseburg where one can dine or provision for a longer stay. Kendra went the extra mile to help us identify where to go to find specific items for which we were searching in town.
Our only regret is that we were only able to stay for one night before continuing on our journey!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home and space! Very amazing amenities and very comfy bed, even was able to sleep in. Will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay if you love the country and peace and quiet. There are no buildings, no traffic noise, nothing to see but beautiful nature out each window and silently flowing river. The place was squeaky clean, lovely decor and furnishings, and super comfy bed. The hot tub was also a bonus after driving down that beautiful coast all afternoon. Kendra is the sweetest host! Five stars for this truly ‘Magnolia’ style home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This bnb was amazing!
Super clean and comfortable. It was so well styled and had everything you could need and then some. Kendra's land and river view are gorgeous. It's amazing she's sharing it with us.
We walked in and it smelled so good and felt cozy. The bed was so comfy and we loved the bathroom and big shower. It was so quiet and beautiful view from everywhere in the bnb.
My husband and I loved this stay. We just wish we had more time. Definitely recommend. And it's not too far from Roseburg at all. Worth the short drive to see this perspective of Oregon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great extended weekend during Mother's Day at Kendra and Josh's place. Everything about the location and unit was excellent, we really enjoyed it and are hoping to be back very soon."

I especially loved the little guestbook they have available to sign and leave our mark. I thought that was a unique idea I haven’t seen before. I would definitely stay again. Kendra has been very accommodating and easy to get ahold of as well- a great host! We will recommend this Airbnb and definitely return at some point!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Hideaway was awesome! Absolutely beautiful surroundings a great view of the river and very private!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"An adorable place! Very well decorated and well equipped with everything you could need — steamer, kitchen items, etc. Absolutely loved the hot tub and the view of the river was incredible!
It was connected to another half of a house, but we still had the whole place to ourselves and a private entrance and yard. Wonderful location and would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such an incredible stay!! So grateful I found Kendra's spot. The location is incredibly picturesque and peaceful, and the house is really well decorated, has everything you need (including the hot tub!) and soo comfortable. A++ stay :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely outstanding place! The location is so gorgeous, and the guest home
is perfect. My boyfriend and I came for his birthday getaway and we had such a great time. It is a very clean, well decorated, private, and peaceful location. Kendra is a great host, very responsive and kind! You can tell that every detail was thought out. I would recommend this to anyone and we will definitely be back!:)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely beautiful. I missed some of the instructions in the beginning regarding the remotes. Probably because I just didn’t read them all. Kendra was quick to respond to my inquiries. The jacuzzi was a major bonus as I was in town to do a lot of yard work on a property I own. Stunning location on the amazing Umpqua River.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and we will for sure stay here again soon! I have nothing negative to say at all and just want to thank the hosts for their responsiveness and how well they took care of us and the space. Don’t think twice book this place!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Kendra's cozy house by the river was nothing short of extraordinary. From the attention to detail to the pristine cleanliness and stunning natural setting, every aspect of my experience exceeded my expectations. If you're looking for a serene retreat where you can unwind and reconnect with nature, look no further than this riverside gem. Kendra outdid herself in creating this warm and cozy place!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I cannot begin to tell you how perfect this spot is. A perfect nature getaway on the river surrounded by beauty. I was so cozy, happy and blown away staying here in this quiet and peaceful spot. One of my favorite parts was sitting in the jacuzzi with a view of the river and snow on the mountains while drinking my morning coffee. I even saw a blue jay which was not even 2 feet away from me and blue jays are my favorite birds, so cool! This Airbnb is so clean and decorated so cute, I felt like I was at a 5 star resort. I cannot forget to mention the amazing host, Kendra, who helped make my stay so fabulous, easy, and stress free. Kendra is a top tier host and friend. Kendra goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is everything you wanted to be and more.She offers great local recommendations, is very accommodating and is the nicest person that I am so thankful I’ve got to speak with.I will be back here again and again if it doesn’t get booked out for months….10000/ 10!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely amazing stay for us and it was Josh and Kendra’s place that made it so.
Their AirBnB is secluded & and peaceful. Just steps from the Umpqua River & surrounded by beautiful rolling hills and vineyards.
The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals and it was just so nice to sit and stare out the big windows while eating or enjoying our morning coffee.
The bathroom was completely new and updated and it had the most amazing “rainfall” shower head with great water pressure—it’s the little things.
Topping it off was a brand new hot tub on the back porch which we enjoyed a few times—it was perfect.
Josh and Kendra were incredibly friendly and responsive and we couldn’t recommend a visit to their place enough—they nailed it!
- Scott & Julie"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This air bnb was gorgeous inside and out. Clean, inviting and beautifully decorated. Kendra left a handwritten thank you note and local carmels to welcome me. Their property was beautiful and the hot tub was the icing on the cake. I would absolutely stay there again! Thank you Kendra"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kendra and Josh were very easy to communicate with, and the stay was super cozy!
They gave some excellent restaurant recommendations and Josh knew the local outdoor attractions to look into. Tons of surrounding farms and vineyards to visit!
They recently added a hot tub to their listing and we’ll be excited for future visits!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ very much enjoyed this stay and Kendra n Josh! Great hosts! Felt right at home🫶🏾
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stunning location, beautiful amenities and amazing hosts! FIVE STARS! ⭐️ IS UNDERSTATEMENT! On the beautiful Umpqua River makes this place a must stay! Close to world-class fishing, wineries, and tons of outdoor activities. Just close enough to town as well to grab a bite to eat. I’ll definitely be back! Thank you so much!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I travel for work and wanted to escape the city and this place fit the description! It was just like the pictures but even better. I was able to relax and enjoyed the peace and quiet. We did some Star gazing at night and loved the view of the river in the morning! I hope to return in the summer!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. Saw some wild turkeys walking down the road on way to thanksgiving dinner. Lucky group of fellas.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cara and Matthews place is a luxurious small home with all the amenities we could ask for. Often places are lacking in this regards, but here we felt like we’d brought our home with us. We were never disappointed in our needs. The place is appointed tastefully with personal touches and is decorated in hues of gray, green and rubbed bronze. We especially loved the beautiful tile designs in the bathroom and kitchen, they have pizzazz. It’s definitely in the country and a bit of a drive to get to from town, but not bad. Once there we found the place so restful, quiet and relaxing I didn’t mind the drive. The hiking near by is great to have so easily accessible too. They are truly super hosts."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my happy place - it’s so peaceful, modern, comfortable, all the joyful things that keep me coming back repeatedly. There were a few plants still blooming even in early October, these just enhance the natural serenity of the location right on the river. There were quite a few wild turkeys milling around, deer, geese, ducks, squirrels, chipmunks, and of course the pot-bellied pigs next door. It’s such a great spot, I’m always sad to leave it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a long drive, it was a pleasure to arrive at what was to be our North Umpqua ""home"" for a few days. Although a short distance from the main house, we experienced the privacy and calm we were looking for. The cottage was very clean, cool and well equipped with all the necessary items needed to make our stay comfortable. Great design to the cottage from the spacious bathroom to the sweet private deck. My wife Kathryn likes to cook, even after a day out in the landscape and found the kitchen a comfortable space to spend time in. ""Good quality tools"", she remarked, ""makes cooking a joy not a task."" Our first morning's walk to the river was a comfort to see and hear. The location, being out of town, was not a problem for us. We found many reasons to enjoy the drive to and from various spots we chose to visit each day along the North Umpqua."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew & Cara were amazing, very responsive and a pleasure to meet! Property and guest house were beautiful, everything you would need was there and was extremely emasculate upon arrival. The wildlife, the river were both amazing! Definitely will stay there again and highly recommend to anyone considering a stay with them. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cara’s place is light and airy. The kitchen is high end, with everything you need. The North Umpqua River is a stroll away. We carried our coffee and toast out each morning. There’s also a little patio and gas grill. Cara is very attentive. A great place to stay!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the most beautiful places I've stayed in. I'm very grateful I was greeted warmly and then given my space to enjoy the river and surroundings as I wished. Thank you for sharing your wonderful home and area with others. I very much enjoyed my time away from the city.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was wonderful. Cara gave me detailed instructions on finding the house along with pictures. It was after dark when we arrived, so that was really helpful. The house is in a rural neighborhood. It was very quiet and peaceful.
The house was clean and the bed was comfortable. The kitchen had everything you might need for cooking or baking. Cara was very responsive to my inquiries. We didn’t get a chance to enjoy the river or explore the neighborhood, but we will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay! Matthew and Cara were very accommodating and friendly. The place is clean and exactly as described. Would definitely recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The guest house was amazing and Matthew and Cara were the perfect hosts!

We would highly recommend this lovely guest house to anyone traveling in the Roseburg area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m a happy repeat guest here; at first I was staying here out of necessity while handling local business, but now it’s become the destination. I purposely book to stay here as a vacation destination/retreat. Even the wildlife love it here: various critters lounged in the yard right along with me. I read a couple chapters of my book while relaxing to the sound of the river, it was blissfully serene. The tasteful seasonal decor gave it an even more cozy touch."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous little cottage, very tastefully decorated. Owners have thought of everything, including water and coffee creamers. A bit of a drive from I-5 but well worth it. The river is just a short stroll. We loved all the wildlife, deer, egrets, wild turkeys it was lovely."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The site is absolutely beautiful, indoors and outdoors. It’s spacious and clean and beautifully decorated. Absolutely worth staying here."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful vacation and break from city life at Matt & Cara's Cottage. It was clean, comfy, and very homey with everything you could possibly need included. It was nice to take a break from city life and feel connected to nature again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy place with super friendly host’s
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this property, the hosts, the scenery in the area, it keeps me coming back whenever I have the opportunity. Sitting by the river is serene, this trip even included spring goslings, baby deer, too many fantastic blooming plants to count. The shower is hot & spacious, the sofa & bed are both so comfy that I dozed off on both with the big snuggly blanket that was there for that very purpose. It's so hard to leave here when it's time to go home."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect Airbnb for a single or couple. Peaceful location, well stocked kitchen and just a nice place to be. I am a multi-visitor traveling for business and I highly recommend this Airbnb."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Matthew and Cara are the perfect hosts. The guest house is ideal. The setting near the North Umpqua river adds so much to the beauty of the area. The amenities in the guest house are so complete, that guests aren't needy of anything."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house was so clean and comfortable! I had everything I needed for my long stay. The beautiful river views and wildlife were an added bonus! You all were great will definitely return!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home and property is absolutely beautiful. Matthew & Cara were great as well. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in the area!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable guest house in an awesome area. The bed is comfortable and it was well stocked with cooking supplies. There was also a snack basket which we were grateful for. It was neat to see all the wild animals such as deer, turkeys, and many other birds. Their property is in a peaceful area next to a beautiful river."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, comfortable, of the beating track guest house. Adorable farmhouse decor. Cara stayed up for my late arrival and extended hospitalities. I enjoyed the location, and cant wait to visit again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house is very clean and stocked with everything you need. In the kitchen they even have flour and baking supplies. There's pass to access to the river side. Lovely back yard facing the river.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very beautiful home and we loved staying by the river! lots of wildlife and would definitely recommend staying here
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful river location with cute animals in every direction. We cant wait to come back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect as always!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here, it never feels long enough - it’s so hard to leave this peaceful, private gem on the river. Matt & Cara are the friendliest hosts, the accommodations are divine, it’s an absolute dream. I enjoyed the serene nothingness of watching a woodpecker & some busy squirrels from the covered porch, as well as sitting in one of the chairs down by the river & watching the sun go down, the ducks & geese pass thru, the fish jump… and that’s just the outside. Inside, I probably spent too long in the toasty hot rain shower, the soft cozy bed or relaxing in front of the tv. I will definitely be back again, no doubt about it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful, comfortable home. Cara & Matt are wonderful hosts. We will absolutely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was even better than the pictures made it look! Matthew and Cara were great and brought over extra bedding without even asking. Would highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This guest house is lovely and well appointed.
It has its own small back patio with a table/chairs and gas grill. Inside, the kitchen had everything you might need, including nice dishes and cutlery, mixer, insta-pot, a keurig with some k-cups and the little restaurant pods of vanilla half & half, so you are all set to go. WI-FI was good. The river location is beautiful, with the Dixon Falls visible upriver from their riverbank, and an island in the middle of the river providing much seclusion. The river is calm and slow right there and would make a great place to paddle around in a raft, kayak or paddle board. Cara was friendly and helpful without being remotely intrusive."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful guest house and amazing hosts! Matthew and Cara are some of the most compassionate and genuine people. I would highly recommend staying here.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for job interviews, I was unfamiliar with the area — and this listing stood out from all others. When asking locals where I was interviewing, they urged me to “book it ASAP” because there’s “nothing so nice at this value within a 40 mile radius”.
This guest house is stocked, modern with rustic touches and almost seems too good to be true. It is nearly as beautiful as the accessible (but never intrusive) family who own the private, separated guest house on their vast riverfront compound.
THIS IS #SimplyTheBest"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew & Cara’s place was super clean and welcoming - Matthew even stayed up extra late to make sure we got in okay. The bathroom door only has a curtain, but you can close the bedroom door for extra privacy if it’s needed. Will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful and beautiful location, comfortable and well equipped home, Cara and Matthew were very attentive hosts. It was the perfect location to explore the North Umpqua waterfalls and trails. We also enjoyed relaxing at the house. It was quiet, peaceful and everything that we wanted! We had a great stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beaufitully appointed space. There were some light snacks/water available, everything was sparkling clean and elegantly simple. All cookware was nice and there were some basics like oil/flour/sugar as well as some other basics for meals. Bedding was soft, towels fluffy and the shower was HUGE! We didn't get to the river, but could hear it and we saw some deer in the neighbors yard. The directions on how to get in were spot on and Cara was easy to communicate with. Only drawback is that the cottage is about 15-20min to I-5 and Roseburg but the drive is gorgeous!.I can't recommend this place enough!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Second stay at this wonderful place. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I stayed here with our 9-month old daughter while road tripping from California to Oregon. Matthew and Cara were such wonderful and generous hosts. Everything was so clean and organized when we arrived, and they even put out some kids books for our daughter to enjoy. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need -- my wife and I cooked dinner and were able to enjoy it on the back patio. It's the perfect spot to enjoy some peace and quiet and relax while taking in the views and fresh air. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Oregon :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anyone planning a vacation in the Roseburg / Glide area should consider the vacation home offered by Mathew and Cara. You'll have a nice deck to enjoy morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. You'll have a washer and dryer at your disposal, and best of all you'll have serenity. We enjoyed drinking an early morning cup of coffee while listening the river just steps away."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a little piece of heaven!! The accommodations were first class and
Cara was the best hostess ever. Hopefully I will have the opportunity to stay here again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic. It's clean and the pictures represent it very well. The rain shower is so luxurious. Easy access to the beautiful Umpqua River.

The location is right on the river. This was the perfect place for me to relax after exploring the Umpquah National Forest."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time here and will definitely be back!
The house is in a beautiful location nestled away on a lovely stretch of the north Umpqua river. It’s the perfect spot to unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle but it’s also close to town.
The cottage was spotless, comfortable and private. My sister couldn’t stop talking about about how cute it was and how it had everything we needed. The shower is amazing and the bed is super comfortable.
Cara was such a lovely host. She was responsive, flexible, friendly and very kind. We truly enjoyed chatting with her.
Don’t miss out on this gem of your near Roseburg!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is charming for a party of two. Really tastefully done, they've thought of everything. Cara also excels at the communication piece. Checks in to make sure everything is good, is friendly and helpful--but not intrusive.
Great spot!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy directions. The Airbnb was beautiful and clean. They had all the amenities and more to cook meals. Check in was super easy. No reception but they wifi and a phone you can use if you needed to make a call. We enjoyed the pigs, who were super friendly and the Llamas made us laugh. The view of the Umpqua River is gorgeous. We went on a hike to Wolf Creek Falls and the bridges and waterfalls were worth it."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy space is nestled in a country atmosphere in Roseburg. We were able to enjoy the natural beauty of the area, which is what we were looking for. The kitchen was perfect for cooking meals - we relaxed and slept well! Cara is a wonderful host."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing AirBNB! Beautiful location right on the river and approximately 15 minutes from downtown Roseburg. The unit is brand new and has all the amenities you would want!! Will be staying here again!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great experience! We couldn’t of hoped for better. The house was perfect for us and our son. We are looking forward to returning in a few months. Thank you Cara and Matt.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Their place was perfect for a quiet weekend away. In between the North Umpqua Forest and Roseburg, you can enjoy everything Douglas County has to offer. The place was spotless and had everything you could ever need! It was decorated adorably, and had lovely furniture! Perfection all around!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot! Will definitely come back again. Kids loved seeing the pigs next door.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This truly was a perfect stop on our road trip. The guesthouse is in a great spot especially if you are going to crater lake or umpqua. I did like how we had privacy but still the security of being on the property. Cara was so welcoming and helpful, the view of the river from the house is beautiful and the guest house itself was so clean and beyond everything you need for a stay. I would recommend to bring any groceries you would need, the kitchen appliances and utensils are fully stocked."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing — one of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed at. The hosts are very thoughtful in putting all necessary equipments and furnitures for the guests to have a comfortable stay. There is insta pot, mixer, toaster, zip lock bags, condiments! Really everything you need in a house. The house is very clean and well-designed! Give yourself a favor and stay here when visiting Roseburg/ Umpuqua National forest."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is nicer than my own house. Everything is newer with high-end finishes & elegant style, but still comfy and relaxing. The bed was comfy, the pillows were perfect (didn’t see a brand name or identifier, believe me I looked), spacious high ceilings, generously stocked kitchen, lots of thick fluffy towels, enormous 65” TV. Truly was a home away from home, I will be back again."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is immaculate! Cara is very nice and has everything you need in the place. It’s the nicest place we’ve ever stayed. The property and river is beautiful. We will be back!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cara is simply wonderful! She is accomodating and very friendly. As to the Guest Cottage, it looks brand new and was beyond our expectations! The kitchen is AMAZING!!! It is well stocked with nice pots and pans, knives, flatware, utensils and dishes. Just bring your food! The bathroom shower was HUGE with two shower heads. Very nice! The few pictures do not do it justice! You will not be disappointed! Do not pass up this Airbnb. You can walk on green mowed grass right down to the North Umpqua Rivers edge! So Beautiful... We brought our camp chairs with us and sat and watched the river go by. Relaxing! It is located a little ways out so I would recommend bring your groceries with you. Think ahead, plan your meals and have fun! I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful peaceful location. Perfect for relaxing. Kitchen is extremely well outfitted. Great area for bird watching, wild turkeys, acorn woodpeckers. You are in the middle of nowhere so best to stop before you get and stock up. Also there is no door between bathroom and bedroom which was fine for us, yet could be an issue for some. Cara was extremely welcoming. Excellent choice for us."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a beautiful home! Do not underestimate this home. I would suggest stopping at the grocery before hand. The kitchen is more than well equipped! Good range of spices to pick from! There is no cellphone service in the area but the home has amazing WiFi and a landline for all your needs! Cara was a great host and was sure to keep us up to date with wildfire news. Thank you Cara, we hope to return in the future!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly reccomend! This place was better than advertised! The location on the river is amazing, the house was set up beautifully and so clean. They had the sweetest touches- like a welcome basket and every kitchen essential you would need! Don’t overlook this place- we felt so lucky to have stayed here!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matthew and Cara's Place was gorgeous, modern, immaculate and well supplied. We loved our time there and would definitely stay there again. Cara was so thoughtful and had a gift basket with the wifi password waiting in the kitchen and allowed us to use their backyard access to the river. My one year old enjoyed seeing the pigs and llamas next door as well as splashing in the river and the room to run and play outside. Amazing stay overall."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was our second stay and already planned another stay. Very comfortable place and very clean. Works great four our needs.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Leah for allowing my family and I stay at your place. Such a beautiful home and well took care of.

We had a great time and would certainly stay there again.
Thanks so much,
Holly"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a nice location. Very convenient to the Safari and restaurants. The Mexican restaurant nearby has great food & margaritas. The house is spotless, and the bedrooms were pristine. Plenty of bath linens, which I find is rare. Well stocked kitchen. We were in town to visit our Son’s family and help them move, so we didn’t spend a lot of time at this house, but it nice to come home to this house after all day doing renovations at their house.
The back yard seating area is beautiful and the immaculate lawn was perfect for a 1 yr old to crawl around on. Leah was very responsive to our questions, and extremely helpful when we needed to stay another day.
There is nothing missing or negative about this property and the price is very reasonable. We will definitely plan to stay here again. Thanks Leah, you’re a great host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely house on the edge of town:
Boasting three bedrooms and two bathrooms
Table that sets six and adequate table service and dishes /pots and pans / BBQ - with utensils
Beds were very firm
Each room has its own controlled heat/cooling unit ,,,
Nice sized TV

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay in Winston.
I received a number of automated messages from Leah, so I knew what to expect every step of the way. She was also very responsive and accommodating in the one or two replies I received to my messages as well.
The location was easy to find and in an area that felt safe. There was a bit of traffic noise, but it wasn't too noticeable with the windows closed.
The house itself was well maintained, stocked with the essentials, and pretty clean. We did encounter a couple of issues with hairs and light staining on bed sheets, but it seemed like the sheets were clean - maybe just caught some straggler hairs from the dryer? There were also some glasses which were a bit crusty, but it was nothing a quick run of the dishwasher didn't fix.
Huge bonuses: HDMI cord available to hook my laptop up to the TV and lots of games to play in the closet. Nice touch!
All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love Leah’s spot! It’s cozy, spacious and very tastefully decorated. Leah is responsive and kind! I would definitely stay here again."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We frequently travel to Oregon but have never tried air B&B because we were nervous what accommodations would be like. This time we decided to give it a try based upon pictures and we were not disappointed.
The home is very well kept, clean, comfortable, and safe. We were able to relax and enjoy our vacation without worry. All beds were comfortable and all amenities you would expect in a hotel plus some nice personal touches, such as games for the family and variety of coffees.
The whole house was very clean and no clutter. Although it rained most of our trip we could see the backyard and patio area was nicely done.
The neighborhood was a family friendly quiet neighborhood. We were able to jog a few miles each day and feel safe doing so.
Overall, great value for price and I would stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Leah’s home was beautiful. Very clean and free of clutter. The beds were super comfy as well as the linens. She was responsive to questions and even had a book made to describe the home and traveler expectations!
I just have a couple odd ball things that would make it better.
1. If you’re going to allow smoking on the back patio provide an ashtray.
2. The AC was so amazingly good we were actually freezing in the house. Maybe provide clear instructions on how to turn up the temperature. We tried to on the wall temperature remotes, but it didn’t seem to work.
Thank you Leah for your hospitality!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Immaculate and well-appointed home. Extremely accurate description of the home. Peaceful, quiet neighborhood; we enjoyed coffee and (later) wine on the patio! Would 100% stay here again. Highly recommend."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is the best A&B accommodation I have ever stayed in. Especially, the bed mattress was comfortable, so I had a good night's sleep, and it was nice to have a beer while watching the sunset in the yard. As a intermediate stopover in Seattle, it is adjacent to the 5th road, so it is convenient. I wanted to stay longer in a quiet place if I had time"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent stay at Leah’s place. Everything was on superb condition, well cleaned, and thoughtfully stocked. There were plenty of extra linens, games in the cupboard, toiletries in the bathroom, etc. Our family felt right at home and comfortable here. We would definitely come back or recommend to friends! One of the best places I’ve stayed at."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is clean and comfortable. Loved the good quality soaps. The house smells good but it was pretty strong so if you have scent issues this may not be the spot for you. The only negative for us were the microfiber sheets. They make you run so hot.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great location to do Crater Lake or shoreline. Very comfortable home and we enjoyed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful, spacious house, elegant and tidy furniture, I highly recommend it"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family of 5 felt perfectly at home. Very comfortable space. I really appreciated the memory foam bed, it’s a firm foam but wow, I slept great. No issues and the host was very kind in her communications"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house fit out 5 people perfectly. It was as appeared in pictures. Only minor issues like limited fire wood for fire pit and gas grill ran out of gas mid week and was never refilled. When meals were planned around grilling and limited pots and pans, that was difficult. The house was very clean and lots of space. Close to everything we attended so perfect location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home has everything and more. Even a gourmet kitchen and nice well equipped patio Nice yard for pets too so everyone had a five star stay!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This rental had the most comfortable beds. The house is nicely updated, big open floor plan and a nice back yard with a small firepit, Everything was great! The house is in a cul-de-sack and buts up to a fairly busy road but once inside we didn't hear the traffic at all. All in all it was a great stay in a very nice house with a good nights sleep :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have not stayed in an Airbnb often. The house was just as described, everything was very clean and the house was super nice. Had a lot of amenities which we enjoyed, able to cook dinners and barbecue and hang out in the backyard and enjoy the great weather. Would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay! We had a group of 6 in town for a concert at the Casino. It was a little bit of a drive to the venue. The house was in a great location, easy to find. The house was very well maintained. The back yard was very cute."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at the Watusi Place!
We booked at the very last minute when an atmospheric river interrupted our camping plans. Even with zero advanced notice, Leah made us feel right at home. Her communications and instructions were crystal clear and we found the house to be spotless and welcoming.
Thank you, Leah! You saved the first night of our family's spring break!
Best,
Caity"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time in Winston, the house has a great room that is amazing!!! Lots of games for family time, smart tv so we could get into our subscriptions and watch what we wanted. Kitchen has a great fully stocked coffee bar, which was nice and a nice washer and dryer we had access to. The beds are super comfy with your choice of pillows available. The only thing that I could say I wish was a little softer was the living room furniture, all of it was very pleasing to the eye, but not cozy in to watch movies kind of furniture. But don't let that stop you from booking because the house it amazing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home a whole was modern, clean, and comfortable. Had all the amenities we could ask for. The hosts were friendly and informative. They had a suggestion book for local activities and eateries.
Overall a great place."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. Not only was it extremely clean but Leah has the home supplied with anything you may need. They also have a wonderful book with house rules, a checklist for when you’re heading out, recommendations for places to eat and fun activities nearby, and a little “get the know the your hosts” section as well. I can confidently say that it felt like home away from home and I would definitely recommend Leah’s place to anyone planning to visit the area!"
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,It is a beautiful and clean home! We loved our stay. Our only dislike to the home is the living room sitting area and bigger curtains. Would highly recommend a bigger and comfy couch and some bigger curtains in the kitchen and living room.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leah’s home was even better than the pics! She has put in so many lovely details that make you feel right at home.

The amenities are plentiful and high quality (e.g., fluffy towels, two different coffee makers, beautiful dishes, etc.) We’ve stayed in Air B&B’s across the globe and this is one of the nicest. We would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend it"

We spent Thanksgiving at the property and I didn't feel like I was away from home. everything we needed was in the house. The method for getting in was perfect. it was a digit lock which is excellent. I dislike the lock boxes most houses have because I always have a hard time putting in the codes, the digital lock was so easy. I will definitely use this house if I'm ever around Oregon again."

I had my two dogs with me and the backyard was a great place for them to run around. The neighborhood is great - very quiet! I would highly recommend this place. It felt just like home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leah was a wonderful host. She was extremely attentive and patient (I kept hitting the wrong buttons on the key pad, …… while we were talking on the phone, 3x in a row) 😬. The home was very clean and cozy.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed 3 days while visiting a friend in the area. The front yard was in full bloom, it was beautiful. There’s off-street parking, room enough for two vehicles, and a covered carport. Evenings were made cozy by the simple click of the gas fireplace, perfect for unwinding with a free Netflix movie.
Most notably, the house was impeccably clean, the beds incredibly comfortable, and the hosts exceedingly friendly with prompt and clear communication. I could easily recommend staying here. Thank you!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was a home away from home. Great host!! I accidentally locked the keys inside and she had me set to go in minutes. I honestly could not have asked for a better place to stay. I will definitely be renting again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was great. The place was as described, and they gave very clear instructions and information. It was perfect for a quick overnight stay.
The only thing of note was that I didn’t realize was there isn’t a way to control the temperature. It didn’t end up mattering because most of the time it felt fine."

2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"Roseburg is sweet and having this front part of this classic, older house to sleep in was very nice. The t.v. in the bedroom was great. We watched a movie. The wood floors are beautiful. A bit chilly at night so bring an extra blanket for the bed. We didn't walk around the outside to the back seating area but the neighbor says it looks very cozy and nice. The coffee was yummy as was the microwave popcorn. Thank you for having us. ~Lizzie"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a funeral, and the privacy this place afforded me was invaluable - I had some wonderful peaceful moments here in the middle of a very tough trip.

2024-02-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"I was never given a door code the day of check in. I reached out to the host, but never received a response. I had to contact AirBnB and then didnt hear back from them either so I ended up booking a different AirBnB. I requested a refund and finally heard back from the host. They did grant me a refund, thankfully, but I wish my experience had been different."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Chadwick was so peaceful and adorable! I love old houses, and this place was well-maintained and decorated in such a cute style. The instructions were very clear, and I had absolutely no problems during my stay. I was only in town for one night, but now I wish I could have stayed longer!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little place to stay as a base before heading out to Umpqua National Forest and Crater Lake!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for my needs and as advertised. I would stay again during my next trip.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Chadwick is extremely well-located near downtown. Hosts have clearly taken care with the decor, which fits beautifully with the original detail of the home's construction. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows. I also appreciated the generous stack of towels and all the hangers in the big closet. Work travelers may want to note that there's not a lot of bright light in the designated work space, and the outlets are typical of an older home. The living room looks like a cozy spot for a movie and a glass of wine!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Robin’s place. Very comfortable. I never felt such homely feeling in any of the Airbnb’s i rented. Calm neighborhood, peaceful place. It has all amenities. Private bathroom with endless amenities. feminine products, make up products, everything that a guest wants for. If you are looking for the best Airbnb in Rose burg, don’t think further just book this place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was an ideal spot for us to stay during our time in Roseburg. It’s super close to a handful of restaurants and shops. The neighborhood was quiet and the space was very comfortable.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quaint place. A bit dated, though the decor matches the era the house was built. Quiet neighborhood and a short walk to a good restaurant. Thoughtful touches. The rental is attached to the main house so could smell cooking late at night after the host returned home. Not a huge deal and otherwise the house was very quiet."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful suite in a great location! We loved the art deco furnishings! Wish we could have stayed longer, but it was a perfect stay all around. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Chadwick is an adorable space in downtown Roseburg that’s packed with amenities to make you feel right at home!

The bathroom was large and luxurious with all kinds of top-notch toiletries to give you a spa-like experience. The decor was so sweet, cute, and eclectic. I loved the vibe. This was such a great stop on our road trip through Oregon. It felt like home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Chadwick was perfect for a short stop on our way from CA to WA for our daughters wedding. The place was private, clean, comfortable and dog friendly. Most important, the bed was comfortable. Robin was responsive and helpful. We would stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a comfortable and cozy place to stay. We enjoyed sitting in the charming living room and walking in the neighborhood area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a 1915 vintage home. The one bedroom is in the front separate from the residents entrance. It really is decorated great. Nice coffee, snack, towels, sheets etc. the back porch area is their entrance and is okay to sit outside. Just needs cleaned up a small bit. The cat says hello. Would define recommend the suite for a stay in roseberg."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet location and well laid out apartment. Near good restaurants and a very walkable area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had to wait till 4:30, when checkin was at 3 to get in due to no door code being sent until then. After then, host was very responsive.
Other than that, host was amazing with clear instructions."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We would have loved to stay in this gorgeous place. But the high temps and wildfire danger caused the city to shut off all power in the region. The forecast called for 106 degrees the next day. We tried messaging the host, but then decided to drive 2 hours north to Salem and book a hotel to insure we would have air conditioning. Hope everyone in Roseburg survived both the heat and the rolling blackouts."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We just stayed just for one night. But the place was amazing! Robin communicated well.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The space was completely okay and an accessible, beautiful terrace. Contact with Robin was minimal because he has a very busy life with 3 jobs."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for our overnight visit to Roseburg! We loved the decor and vibe, and the neighborhood was quiet at night. The back deck was good for our afternoon happy hour, and Robin’s kitty came to visit. It’s easy to walk to downtown from the house, and we were able to park on the street right across from the entryway. The mini fridge and freezer worked great, too! Would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a cute and comfortable stay! Robin was a great host - we will definitely book here again if we’re back in the area.

I recommend staying here and will definitely stay again in the future!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent little spot! It was well situated for lots of activities in the Umpqua River Valley, and was a lovely place to come back to after a long day of hiking and being outside. I was only there for a short while, but it is located centrally in Roseburg's delightful downtown, so there are plenty of restaurants and cafes for all eating needs if one was to stay longer. I will be recommending it to friends and family."

We got a good night sleep after a long drive from Crater Lake National Park, thanks to the comfortable bed, peaceful neighborhood and some more entertainment (the TV has all the streaming services).

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay! Beautiful space, lovely Art Deco touches, clean, quite, felt like being right at home, everything we needed plus more and very comfortable bed. Robin was also particularly wonderful as we accidentally check out over an hour late (thought we booked two nights, when we only booked one, oppsie!). He was so nice and understanding about it. And we would definitely have extended, but someone else was already booked for that night. If we are in Roseburg again, will definitely try to book this place again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a great stay!! 10/10!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely little spot! While this spacious one bedroom/one bath doesn't include a full kitchen (just mini fridge + microwave + espresso machine), it's at once homey, cozy, and *stylish* in every other way. Extremely IG'able, if that's your thing!
You're also very well-located. You're on a quiet residential street, but literally just around the corner from the historic downtown where you'll find winery tasting rooms, cafes, and lovely restaurants. WiFi was also solid for when I had to work and host conferences.
Already miss the lovely fixtures and tiny details in this space. Made for a very comfortable and even luxurious 3 night stay in Roseburg. Hope to be back soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super comfortable :)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Loved the vibe inside and the location was right downtown! Would stay again

Robin had thoughtfully provided snacks and coffee, and plenty of table ware too. Loved the vintage style games! The place was pristine and well decorated.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,So fun! We loved the historic house. Such a good vibe and for almost all stays here I could see how you wouldn’t need a full kitchen and the kitchenette works fully fine!!! We’d stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic and very cozy, had all the amenities we could’ve asked for and them some for our stay! Only issue we found is the bathroom faucet is rather forceful and you’ll definitely notice it the first time, but it’s easy to manage once you learn how to use it :)"

2023-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Robins place has a nice feel and was good for a night on my way through. The lighting is dim in the living room and light switches were not intuitive or marked. You don’t control the heat but it was comfortable enough. The back porch would be lovely in the warmer months.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I didn’t get to meet Robin but she had so many great suggestions for me!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So cute! Just as pictured except better, bed was comfy, soft blankets and pillows tucked away all over near the couches and bed making it very cozy. Decor was fab and general aesthetic was totally up my ally! We had a quick stay and this was just the right place to relax and take a breath. It looks like the view from the deck would be outstanding, you can see the old houses and downtown Roseburg, there was fog this time of year but that’s typical. There were even board games as well as dishes available in the cute buffet, Robin really thought of everything! Would stay here again for sure."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia's place is our favorite Airbnb. We have stayed there countless times and love the quiet solitude and pristine area! Each time we drive back and forth to CA, we book Patricia's place. It feels like home to us!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia made everything easy. She met us, and did not intrude after the quick tour. The place is both cozy and complete. Everything we needed was there, plus thoughtful touches like chilled water and the home already warmed to a nice temp. We loved the place and hope to stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My dogs and I loved our stay at Trish's home. The huge fenced yard was like a dog's dream come true. It was so very special to watch my dogs explore and run around!

Patricia was a fabulous, gracious host and we hope to be back someday!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! I loved this little studio so much. It is very comfy, quiet, and private. The yard is completely fenced in - my dog loved running around and seeing the chicken, turkeys, and sheep! The bed is comfy, and all linens smelled so good; it made me feel like I was at home. Patricia is super friendly and thoughtful. She left a bunch of snacks and water bottles for me. I’d love to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I believe this is the eighth time we have stayed with Patricia, and we always feel at home and welcome. I enjoyed a chat with Patricia this morning, before we left."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for our 1 night stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Patricia offers a large, homey, warm, cozy, and quiet apartment. The furniture is generously comfortable. The patio is perfect for relaxing and enjoying the clean country air. We walked through the neighborhood, watched a group of sheep eat, and received smiles and waves from the drivers of passing cars. The internet connection is fast. Patricia offers an infectiously happy greeting. We stayed here twice and plan to return in the future."

A nice little mini fridge, coffee maker, and microwave. Patricia even had some bottled water, popcorn, and some snacks! The standup shower even had soap for us to use. All of the linens were extremely clean, and the place is also very clean. The outdoor space is amazing! Great little covered back patio, fully exposed side yard, and a massive covered front patio. You can either get your sun or stay dry from the rain. Love the front patio!! Loved seeing all of the wildlife wandering around and in all the neighbors yards. We will definitely be back again for our next family visit.￼ Thank you again!! We will DEFINITELY be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed an outstanding stay at Patricia's place. Instructions for reaching the property were very clean and she welcomed us with a brief introduction to the cabin. After that, we only need to reach her once for a small issue that was quickly fixed. Very clean and spacious place. Wifi worked great. It's about a 10 minute drive into town. Very quiet. I would love to come back during summer time to better enjoy the area surrounding the property. Highly recommend if you're in/near Sutherlin!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little cabin, pretty spacious and had a homely feel to it.
Patricia was an amazing host. Would recommend her place for anyone road tripping through I5"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We feel like we're going home when we visit Patricia. This is the seventh time we have stayed at her cabin.

Thanks Patricia for hosting us! See you soon."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia’s spot was very clean and affordable - it was the perfect place to rest my head during a roadtrip.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived late around midnight. It was well lit and very easy to find. We were pleasantly surprised to find the heater going thanks to the host! Very warm! ☺ I was reluctant to rent far from town but the commute to very short and we enjoyed the drive to and from. Overall, the experience was peaceful and relaxing. I really enjoyed being able to bring my dog! The cabin was extremely clean and free of clutter. Lots of linens and towels. Coffee for the morning!There wasn't a full kitchen but the host kindly left the essentials for us with access to a microwave and full sized fridge. The host was very responsive and friendly. I worried that we wouldn't have privacy, being close to the host. She never once bothered us, and we felt like we were the only ones there. The bed was absolutely the most comfortable I've ever slept in. I have back problems and it was the first time I woke up with no pain! Wi-Fi and a Smart TV to use. We look forward to another future stay! 😊"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia was an angel and welcomed us into a very comfortable and warm space. The bed was super nice! Everything felt clean and intentional. Providing water after a long journey was really an extra layer of kindness in a studio space. Taking time to walk the property and say hello to the fake animals was a cherry on top!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent, clean, comfortable, safe spot to rest during a long drive. Patricia is very kind and takes the extra step to make sure your stay is enjoyable!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was pleasure stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The best thing besides Patricia's great, welcoming personality is her bed. Most of the Airbnb's I've stayed in have firm to rock hard beds, and for people like myself who have arthritis, it hurts to sleep on those beds. I was so happy to finally sleep on a comfortable bed.
Patricia also had the place ready and warmed up for me and my pup Jasper. it was cold out and to be able to arrive somewhere that was already warmed up, shows how thoughtful and prepared Patricia was for us. I would definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place slightly off the I5. It was easier to find than expected. When we arrived, Patricia greeted us and showed the place. It was warm and cozy inside. The cabin is also bigger than it appears on the pictures."

Patricia was friendly and responsive! Her house is in the country side of the town so it’s not walkable to anything. We were comfortable and the wifi works great. We would definitely book again! Thanks for having us!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia place was a perfect night stop for us. She was very responsive and was able to accommodate us for a late check-in too. Her place was very clean and tidy. We also loved the calm country side surrounding too. Highly recommend this!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little hotel-style guest room in the country. This property has a lovely patio area between the guest room and the main house surrounded by beautiful pastures, horses, chickens and friendly dogs in the adjacent yard. There is also a small dining table inside along with a coffee maker, mini fridge, microwave and an electric water kettle.
Patricia was welcoming and kind. She provided bottled water, hot chocolate, apple cider and basic tableware such as cups, glasses, bowls utensils and paper plates to warm ready-made meals.
The bed was comfortable and the big armchair was perfect for curling up with a book. There's even a little wood stove that looks like it would be cozy in cold weather. Good price, beautiful setting, would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Patricia’s place. This was a perfect stopover after a long day of driving. We really enjoyed the quiet surroundings and had the pleasure to pet the friendly horses. Patricia was there to greet us and she is very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend staying here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the guest house. It was clean and Patricia was quite responsive whenever needed
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exceeded expectations! There’s a beautiful spacious farm for your dog to play, it’s huge and your dog would just tire out from running around the farm. The room is spacious too, lots of room to walk around between bed and the kitchen. The kitchen/dining area is cozy with views of the farm and mountains through the windows. Patricia is very responsive, and was there to welcome us when we arrived. The place is surrounded by mountains, and it’s beautiful during dusk and dawn. It’s totally worth it! I’d stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Patricia’s place was cozy and comfortable! We stopped by for a night on our way back home and it had everything we needed after a tiresome day on the road. The surroundings are beautiful and Patricia was absolutely lovely and made us feel right at home. Thank you! :)

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It is a super cute place with spectacular scenery. Address was a little hard to find in the dark so a visible sign on the road would be helpful. Definitely 💯 appreciated all the communication with the host and agin very beautiful property
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia’s place is absolutely lovely. It is in such a beautiful and peaceful area. The chickens are so cute!
Patricia is one of the kindest hosts we’ve ever been able to meet, and it is clear how much she loves her home and property.
This was the perfect place for us to stop and rest on our trip!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia was really nice and helpful and I would stay there again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second visit this year. We returned because we really enjoy the small farm setting, the relaxing space, the wonderful hosts and the affordability. Over the past 3-4 years we have enjoyed short stays two or three times per year in various Air BNBs around Oregon. This was our first repeat visit and very likely not our last!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow is an understatement. We had such an enjoyable stay with Patricia. She is extremely responsive and flexible on top of being an amazing host. She was extremely friendly and welcoming and was a pleasure to interact with.
The property itself is just as amazing. Beautiful scenery, quiet and peaceful. We had our two large dogs who were able to roam the property freely as it was fully fenced in. They were able to interact with her dogs between the fence as well as encounter her adorable chickens and horses at the fences as well. We had an incredibly comfortable stay as the cottage is spacious but cozy, one of the nicest beds we’ve slept in for an AirBnb.
I would absolutely recommend this place and would love to stay again during our travels. Absolutely stunning!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful 4 night stay here…our base for day trips to Wild Life Safari, Crater Lake, & the Oregon Sand Dunes.
Host is very friendly & readily available if ever needed. Large room (bigger than pictures show) was very clean. Small refrigerator in room, plus large refrigerator that guests can use just outside on covered porch. Helpful for extra food supplies.
Very comfortable bed. Large overstuffed chair & ottoman great for TV viewing.
Horses & chickens & dogs on premises…loved the peaceful setting! Glad this place is pet-friendly. Our little dog was quite welcome!
Hope to visit again sometime…"

you would need. It had a kitchenette, high flow shower with its own water heater, a/c, heat and the most comfy bed I’ve ever slept in when renting. Highly recommend!!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin. Patricia greeted us upon arrival, showed us around, and gave us some restaurant recommendations. It was peaceful, secluded, and just what we were looking for! Also, the comments don't lie, the bed is very comfortable!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I honestly thought because of the price we might be staying in a bedroom in her home. Not the case at all. The cabin / guest suite is HUGE and unbelievably private / separate from her house. Pictures don’t do it justice. My dog was able to roam free outside in the morning while I watched hummingbirds eat out of her beautiful flowers. Bed was unbelievably comfortable. This was the perfect stop on the way to crater lake. Can’t say enough great things
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely friendly host. Adorable rural accommodation. We enjoyed the stop in the small cottage in the transit very much!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia’s place was a perfect stop on our way home from a road trip. It was such a cute little place and had everything we needed. Patricia was so nice and welcoming. Loved the little patio and it was nice and quiet and dark for sleeping (fan was great as we always sleep with a fan) and bed was comfortable. Would recommend!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely setting! Simple, comfortable accommodation"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia’s place was lovely. We only stopped for one night in between long days of driving on a road-trip but it looked like a very peaceful and pretty area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect! It was a great place to rest after a long drive. The bed was super comfy, the shower was wonderful, and it was a steal for the price. Patricia was a very warm and welcoming host. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Patricia's on the way down to California. Great place to sleep for the night, huge cabin. Patricia was super kind and greeted us upon arrival, even with our super late check in. She let us charge our car overnight in her barn, which was super convenient!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia’s cabin came with a super comfortable bed in spacious surroundings with plush towels in a beautifully appointed bathroom. The garden, farmhouse and property was idyllic! Patricia came out to personally greet me and show me into the cabin. Very lovely stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a brief but lovely stay at Patricia’s cottage. She was kind and welcoming and the place was a perfect spot to catch some rest following a couple weeks of van life en route back home to BC.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was wonderful. Highly recommend!!!!!!! The best experience with airbnb ever. Great host, great place. I can't say enough about this place. Loved it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here on my road trip from Washington to California. Patricia was so responsive, welcoming, and lovely! Arriving at her place, at the end of a very long and hot day of driving, couldn't have been more perfect. She even turned the A/C on for us (myself and my travel cat) before we arrived so the space would be a comfortable temp once we got there. The bed is SO comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. The space is private, quiet, clean, and roomy. The location feels ""out of the way"", but it's actually conveniently close to I-5. Serene and peaceful, with an amazing hilly backdrop where their horses graze. I would one hundred percent stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I couldn’t believe my eyes as I pulled in the driveway and realized that there were horses- I LOVE HORSES!!! This place has the perfect combination of being close to the freeway but far enough out in the countryside that you feel like you’re staying on a ranch. The room was bigger then I expected, which was very nice for me and my two little kids and their beds and such. Patricia even got out a little mattress and my little toddler slept on it in her cozy chair, and he slept great! The outdoor patio was lovely and my son and I enjoyed looking at all the beautiful plants and wildlife, as well as the dogs and horses. My only disappointment is that I stayed for one night- I should have booked Patricia’s place it for the entire weekend!!! It’s amazing!!! I can’t wait for another family wedding in Oregon so I can go back and smell the fresh air and see the horses."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Can’t rave about this place enough. Super cute and with moderate space and everything you need. It’s quiet and you can see all the bright stars at night. Bed is super comfy. They have cute chickens, horses, and dogs on their property. It is also fully fenced, which my dog loved, as he was able to explore freely and interact with the other animals too. We had a great time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia met us at the gate with a caring smile and a warm welcome. The place was exactly what we needed, just an overnight stop as we headed south. A bonus was the star-gazing we did after the sun went down. Very little light pollution allowed us to see an amazing blanket of stars and even a swath of the Milky Way galaxy. The bed was super comfortable and the cabin was well appointed and spacious."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, very comfortable!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice country area. I like the quiet and feeling of farm/horse country.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Its exactly what's on her description. We felt right at home when we arrived. She was flexible on our schedule and greeted us on our arrival. Very warm and friendly host. We love her farm animals at the back that set our abnb experience extra special.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay with Patricia! She was a responsive host and her guest cabin had all the essentials. Highly recommend
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Just awesome! Patricia has a cute little cabin with everything you need. We were visitors just passing by for one night but we would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,as always loved staying here...my 3rd time and I always love it
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Patricia is a lovely host and we felt right at home. Genuine hospitality and a great space can't be beat!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay and tranquil location. Scenery was amazing. Patricia was very welcoming and friendly to show us the unit and premises. Nice fenced backyard for dogs. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Patricia greeted us even though we arrived quite a bit later than expected. Bed was super comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Not a single complaint for this wonderful, cozy cabin retreat! As a traveler just passing through I was at ease with the process of getting in and settling down for the evening from a long day of driving. I would absolutely stop by again should I ever journey through the area. Beautiful spot with friendly and hospitable host! 5/5 would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Patricia’s guesthouse. Patricia was a lovely host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia's place was very cozy and peaceful, we loved it there. The guest house has everything you might need for your stay, it is nicely decorated and has many windows, so plenty of light comes inside. The location is very calm, and you can see stars at night without light pollution. Patricia met us when we arrived, she is a lovely and friendly host :) I would definitely recommend this place for all the travelers."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was easy to find and the place is so cute. We were exhausted from the long drive and she kept the place cool for us and joined us when we got there with a sweet welcome and helpful instructions. Really enjoyed the peacefulness of the cozy space, the quiet, the beautiful horses next door with sheep and wild turkeys in the distance. Our pups were comfy and happy and were we. The fenced in yard was perfect for the pups and the patio was lovely once the weather cooled down (was over 90 degrees when we visited).
My daughter came through here on her way to Seattle and enjoyed it with her pup and we will come through again on our way home. Thanks Patricia for sharing your home and welcoming our family ☺️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy stay, and perfect for traveling with a dog."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy and had all our necessities; beautiful area as well!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay with Patricia! I don't think stayed at a place where a host has thought of literally everything, super impressed. The ranch stay was beautiful, peaceful and super comfortable. Nice linens to a nice kitchenette and everything in between. We loved the porch and the gardens and ranch were stunning. Patricia was a great host with a great personality, helpful and made us feel right at home. We were sad to leave!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"great stay, again. will be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little cabin was so much better than we expected. We needed a place to rest on our drive up to Canada and booked Patricia’s cabin due to its location, and we are so glad we did. The cabin is more spacious than you expect. It has all amenities you need and more, including a private bathroom and basic kitchen appliances. Everything was clean, organized, and comfy. Patricia was so sweet and the location of Patricia’s cabin is amazing. Nestled in with the nature of her farm property, the cabin is surrounded by beautiful flowers and foliage. It’s well off the main road so there’s no traffic noise. It’s a short drive to the town where you pass by a beautiful lake. Lovely stay! I would definitely pay the money to stay here again in any season. 11/10"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great short stay, found everything in order. I would come back again if I’m in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"beautiful home, great host"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We travelled with a baby and it was a perfect place to stay. Quiet, spacious, beautiful surroundings. Would stay again if we pass by next time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved my stay. the accommodations were just what I needed and the outdoor space was lovely
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia's place was the perfect stop on our road trip from WA to CA. It's about 8 minutes from I-5, but worlds away--quiet, peaceful, safe, and charming. A spacious studio, it worked well for us, as we brought our own breakfast fixings and didn't need a full kitchen. The only sink is in the bathroom, which is right next to the kitchen area, so be prepared for simple cleanup for your meals or snacks. We enjoyed our stay, it was a true respite from the rigors of the road. I suspect I'll be back, next time I'm passing that way!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Patricia’s guest suite for a night with my dog on my way down from WA to CA, and I was so glad I stayed here.
First of all, Patricia is a warm and super responsive host. She made us feel so welcomed.
The guest house itself is cozy and charming, yet spacious enough for 2 people. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The location is peaceful, beautiful and so very quiet, both I and my dog slept very well and woke up so refreshed. It is a short detour from I-5 and so worth it. It was a pity we only stayed one night, and had to leave relatively early in the morning. My dog thoroughly enjoyed Patricia’s garden, and exploring the area. I would love to come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia’s place was such a gem. We are so happy to have found this after a very long road trip from Washington. The place was clean safe and the stars at night were just spectacular. There is also a freshwater reservoir within biking distance of Patricia’s location where you can paddle-board, swim fish and do other outdoor activities. All and all this place is hands-down, one of our favorite places to stay in countryside Oregon It is also in close proximity to food places we will definitely be staying here again in the future. Can’t wait until we come back to Sutherlin Oregon."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Patricia and ?Gary? (sorry, I'm bad with names) were very friendly and communicative. The detached space was warm, comfortable, and plenty spacious. The horses and chickens were a plus!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,STILL our favorite Airbnb and we've stayed at approximately one billion of them.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A quiet spot on a farm with a beautiful garden, so cozy!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great stay! We had a u-haul truck moving from the Bay Area to Seattle, and it was the perfect stop to sleep for the night! Dog friendly, had a big backyard and a beautiful location. We would defiantly stay again and recommend to our family!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a beautiful, quiet location, perfect for a relaxing stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A place we merely chose as an alternative to motel 6 on our way back to the Bay Area from Seattle turned out to be not only a destination location--great setting, nearby Highway of the Waterfalls, the ranch farm--but, in what is more rare nowadays with airbnb lodgings--a destination host. Patricia is the definition of gracious host. While the cabin is simple it is impeccably comfortable and clean and all the amenities you could wish for(eg, great a/c on a hot day), and the setting--the garden about the cabin, the farm, the horses, the chickens, the turkeys--is terrific. Will definitely come back again,"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was very quaint, private, and easy to find! Patricia communicated instructions well! It was very spacious and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, beautiful location, responsive host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"experience the rolling hills of Oregon and close proximity to many public parks and the famous waterfall highway along north Umpqua. amazing little cabin type feel on a very cool horse Ranch just minutes from downtown sutherlin. Tricia is an amazing host with a heart of gold. slept like a rock on a super comfy bed, especially enjoyed the roses and ranch setting reminded me of home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Patricia has an amazing place that is peaceful, spacious, cozy, and inviting. She had everything we needed for a great stay. She is a wonderful host. Very rustic setting perfect for connecting with nature. We have a 9 month old and he enjoyed meeting the horses too!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,this place is adorable
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia is exactly the type of welcoming host you hope for. We only stayed one night on our way through, but she made us feel welcomed and right at home! The bed was extremely comfortable and the place was exactly as described! Beautiful beautiful area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I enjoyed staying at this cute cottage. It was well taken care of and had all of the necessary amenities. My daughter loved saying hello to the farm animals, especially the horses. We will definitely stay here again when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay with Patricia, and I look forward to the next time. It’s the perfect place to relax and recharge. She couldn’t have been more gracious and accommodating (to say nothing about the kindness she extended to my four-footed travel companion). She gets my highest recommendation!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I truly do feel blessed to of been able to stay here and enjoy such a beautiful serene place. Trish has truly made this place and the entire area around it very beautiful and comfortable.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Trish's hidden Gem is absolutely beyond one's dream of complete & utter peace & beauty🥰 From the gorgeous healing garden setting to the inside of the cottage to the absolute serene surrounding's & don't forget all the farm animals & wild bird's🤗🤗🤗 I can't even give enough kudos to this Airbnb that for me was literally heaven🙏🏻💖🙏🏻 Trish is one of the most compassionate, kind & understanding humans I've met in a long time & if this place doesn't touch your heart she definitely will🪷 I'm already scheduled to come back & if I could I would never leave🥰 Stay safe everyone💫💫💫"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia's property was/is beautiful. I was amazed at the property. Beautiful flowers, well keep lawns and gardens, chickens, wild turkeys, horses, birds and neighbors with pastures and plenty of sheep. I loved it! I took plenty of pictures and video. The hills, the greenery, the birds singing; I loved waking up hearing nothing but the sound of animals and birds. I had the chance to sit and talk with Patricia several times and she is a wonderful person to talk with. I truly enjoyed my trip. The cottage was spacious, nice and well kept. I give the experience a thumbs up and would love to return again someday."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Patricias place, which was just right outside of town, which lent to the peaceful atmosphere. Comfortable bed and mini windows for great ventilation. Patricia was on site but not intrusive at all never really was bothersome. It was nice to see her working her little piece of land and her animals."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"wonderful place with a nice garden! loved the dogs too, especially my dog."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful charming country stay. Has a lovely English cottage feel with all the flowers and herbs and trees around, not to mention seeing beautiful chickens way back in the yard, didn't hear them at all. Tricia was very nice and welcoming."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"i loved my stay at Patricia's place. The cabin was stocked with everything I could have wanted. The bed may be the most comfortable one I have ever slept in! If I come back to Sutherlin, I would definatly stay here."

She is a wonderful host and you would search long and hard for a more peaceful countryside environment."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia’s place is great! I had a very quiet and comfortable stay. Will stay here again if needed!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Patricia's cabin was a wonderful place for a bit of an escape during a busy trip. Friendly hosts, quiet surrounds and a cosy abode filled the bill. Kitchen area was well provided for 2 with micro and small fridge. Water is available only from bathroom tap but that was not an issue when the coffee pot needed filling. I will be back next time I'm in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This private cabin is a spacious room with comfy bed and private shower. The snack area has a small fridge, microwave and small drip coffee pot. Patricia greeted us at check in and showed us our space. There are two attached covered outdoor spaces. Very nice for the price. Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Patricia was a wonderful host. She personally greeted us just after sundown and had prepared the room to be warm, nicely lit, and inviting when we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised to discover the space is much bigger than it appears in the photos. As well, there is a delightful, large covered patio area for relaxing outside the front door. It is surrounded by Patricia’s many blossoming spring plants and a large Wisteria trellis. The property was very relaxing, and the surrounding countryside is beautiful!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia is a very kind and friendly host. The place was well organized
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love staying at Patricia’s place! We have been there many times and find it to be very relaxing, quiet, clean and comfortable.

We look forward to our next visit there in the fall!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay. Everything was as promised and clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Patricia’s for 4 nights while visiting relatives in Sutherlin. Each evening after visiting, I felt like I was coming home. Very comfy bed, quiet nature sounds, clean and cozy! I loved it and so did my little dog, wandering the fenced area. I will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I don't even remember how many times we have been here. It's simply perfect for our road trips with the dogs between Seattle to the Bay area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! It was quiet and restful with a very welcoming host who was super helpful and generous.
The bed was comfortable and I had a great night of sleep. It was equally beautiful and peaceful as the sun set as well as in the morning with the fog slowly burning off. Overall one of my favorite places I have stayed over the years😊"
