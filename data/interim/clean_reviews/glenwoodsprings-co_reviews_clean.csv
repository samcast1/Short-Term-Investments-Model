2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic spot - perfect Glenwood perch. Steps to hot springs pool and just a few more paces over the bridge to town. Great view, great place, great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, well-appointed apartment really close to town but quietly tucked away on the other side of the river. We loved being able to walk downtown (less than 10 min walk) and leave the car behind. There's an amazing bakery (Annie's) just 5 min away, and a foot bridge that takes you the rest of the way to shops and restaurants.
Tyler and Marc were really communicative and responsive; we had some issues with the noise upstairs but they offered a few solutions that worked great and we didn't hear anything after that. The apartment is cozy and clean with views of the mountains and downtown. The little kitchen is great for simple meals and snacks. The king bed was super comfy. The place looks just like the pictures.
We had a great time exploring Glenwood from Tyler's studio apartment and will definitely be back! Thanks for a great stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a lovely stay at Tyler’s place. It was very clean, well stocked, comfortable, and the view was gorgeous!

Whenever we come back out this way, we would definitely choose to stay here again! :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio apartment was charming, modern and has amazing views. The space is just what you need for a perfect getaway in Glenwood Springs. The space itself was clean and bright and had amazing views of the valley from the balcony. You are just one block up from the Hot Springs downtown and within walking distance of the footbridge that takes you to the local restaurants and bars and even the gondola to get to the Adventure Mountain.
The host was repulsive very quickly and addressed any concerns or questions immediately.
We would love to stay here again!"

Very private and comfortable space with any amenity that we would've or could've needed. Everything was super clean and the decorations were amazing (lots of mountain photos and artwork that were beautiful).

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in the heart of Glenwood Springs The space itself is clean, spacious, and incredibly comfortable. Has everything one would need in a stay away from home. The washer and dryer is shared with one other unit, but was no problem having access and availability to. Just up the street from the CO Hotel, the Airbnb looks down upon the city and is an easy 10 minute walk to downtown GS. Loved my stay here and would recommend anyone visiting the GS area to check it out themselves."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a convenient location, close to historic old town, you can’t do much better than this!
It’s good for one or two travellers. Three would feel a little tight. The bathroom is small but the main room is airy and bright.
Very comfortable bed!
The stairs to get to the unit are steep so be aware that getting heavy luggage up and down will take some effort. I couldn’t have done it on my own.
There is definitely noise from the other units so if you are looking for a feeling of seclusion and privacy, or are bothered by noises, this might not be the place for you.
We only stayed one night so we did t explore the town but there is no shortage of great options close by!
Hosts were excellent with communication!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place in a great location! Easy to walk to hot springs, entertainment, and lots of restaurants! The place was absolutely beautiful! Will definitely be back!"

Added to my favorites, would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful condo! The views are amazing, location is prime, less than 5 min walk to the hot springs :) Host/co-cost are quick to respond and very attentive to our needs. We’ll def be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tyler was an amazing host and saved our Labor Day weekend. He and Sara went above and beyond in preparing the house for an early check-in and even had a bottle of wine ready for us! At the time of check-out we looked around all the binders but could not find any to-dos for the checkout process except to make sure the property is securely locked. What an amazing white glove service.
The location is pretty good too with amazing views, and peaceful privacy while everything within walking distance. The property is ideal for winters too with its attached garage. The Glenwood Hot Springs pool is literally just steps away. We definitely plan on returning sometime in the future and highly recommend it to other travelers as well."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here!
The location was great. The place was very clean, and the town area is within walking distance. The host was excellent with communicating and answering any questions!
The only reason why I could not give it five stars was because there was a misunderstanding with the cleaning crew and entered our unit just after 8am while we were still laying in bed, the day that we had to check out.
The host was very apologetic and handled the situation professionally.
Overall, I would highly recommend and stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tyler's place is clean, classy, and cozy. He and Sara do a great job taking care of their guests!

I used this Airbnb last year and came back because it was clean, had a garage parking and provides a comfortable atmosphere. The host is also very responsive. Lastly, it has awesome views!
I would absolutely comeback and stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super fun place to stay, close to great food and shops. Would enjoy coming back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had an awesome stay for our anniversary!! Totally recommend this place to anyone trying to have a little get away.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely perfect for our carless adventure into Glenwood Springs. Walkable from the train station, right across from the hot springs pools, super close to downtown yet a quiet and peaceful place overlooking the valley. Lovely, pristine accommodations. Great spot."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tylers place was in a perfect location, near all the things with a fantastic view. The space has a great bed, great bathroom and towels and even has a garage space to safely park the car! We loved our stay :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The moment we stepped inside this adorable place we felt at home. It is beautifully furnished, clean, clutter-free, and had everything we needed. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook breakfast and dinner. The sheets were crisp, the towels looked and felt new, the pillows perfect, and the fold-out sofa had a magnificent new foam mattress. We loved the shower, and the amenities. Many Airbnbs do not supply this level of (nice-smelling) shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.
The view from the studio was a delight. In particular, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the afternoon lightning and rain 'show'. The place was very quiet and it felt safe and cozy. The garage was a plus too. I can't say enough good stuff about this place. It was perfect!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely little studio! Very comfy! Super accommodating host.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful flat with equally wonderful views. Extremely clean and bright inside, easy to settle in for the night with provided amenities or walk downtown to enjoy the local offerings."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time booking a place on Airbnb, and we could not have been happier! Communication with Sara was terrific — we were able to check in a little bit early, and she remained in contact throughout our 2-night stay. The studio was spotlessly clean and included everything we could have needed, including a binder full of suggestions for things to do, see, and eat. The “welcome” bottle of wine was an especially nice touch! The view is gorgeous, and the king size bed was super comfortable, with the coziest bedding. This is easily the nicest place we’ve stayed in Glenwood Springs (this was our third visit here), and we hope to stay here again on our future trips. We cannot recommend Tyler and Sara’s place highly enough!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with beautiful views! We loved how easy it was to walk to town. Keyless entry was very convenient and the place was homey! We loved our stay!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in Glenwood Springs! Location can’t be beat! Gorgeous view, super clean, comfy bed, balcony and garage to park in were a welcomed xtra. Felt very safe and immediately at home. Host was very nice!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Here are the highlights of my stay:
First and foremost, the location is absolutely amazing. It's conveniently situated within walking distance of various restaurants and hot springs. Being able to explore the local dining scene and indulge in relaxing hot springs without the hassle of transportation was a huge plus for me. The proximity to these attractions made my stay both convenient and enjoyable.
Now, let's talk about the view. It was truly breathtaking.
One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that this place exceeded my expectations. In most cases, Airbnb listings tend to use heavily edited or exaggerated photos, but this was not the case here. The photos simply didn't do justice to the actual beauty and charm of the place. I was delighted to find that it was even better in person. The attention to detail and the thought put into every aspect of the accommodation made me feel like I was staying in a true home away from home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tyler’s place was exactly as pictured—amazing views, and the inside is beautiful! We even had a chilled bottle of wine in our fridge waiting for us. We wish we could stay longer!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome location, super clean, and private with excellent views. The mud room / closet space was a nice bonus to stay organized during our stay, and the outdoor space, huge windows, ceiling fan, and king sized bed really topped off the experience. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We cannot gush more about this gem! We picked 4 spots on our Colorado tour, and this was our second destination. The host was communicative and friendly. We were greeted by a beautiful bottle of white wine and the place was immaculate and perfect for what our family needed. We also loved how the studio was decorated with Colorado scenery. We spent two, fun-filled days soaking in hot springs, eating at local restaurants and enjoying the cool vibe that is Glenwood Springs. We will certainly be back and would definitely be tempted to stay at this Airbnb the second time around!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A modern and cozy apartment with amazing views, just a few minutes walk from downtown Glenwood Springs! The apartment included plenty of local recommendations, and Sara was also flexible, offering us an early check-in. Would highly recommend this place!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tyler and Sara’s place met all of our expectations! The location was perfect and it was easy to find. The stairs to the apartment are incredibly steep, so watch for that. 10/10 experience and will definitely be back! Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in. The view is priceless. Location is top notch. The hosts, especially Sara, was kind and responsive. I left a sentimental item at the Airbnb & she was able to assist me in returning it right away. They have a whole binder of local recommendations and activities. The room is clean & updated. Can’t rave enough about this stay, will be back!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space and location were absolutely perfect with an incredible view to top it all off. Thank you for a perfect weekend away!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"it was so perfect that i booked my next stay before even checking out. we loved everything about it! so gorgeous and clean, too! can't wait to go back!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment isn’t quite what we were expecting, but it suited us just fine. This is a 3 story townhome that’s been split into an airbnb and a permanent residence. The bottom floor is a two car garage shared with the resident that lives on the third floor. We were on the second floor and could hear every footstep and voice above us.
Thinking it was an entire studio apartment, I incorrectly assumed it would have a stove top/oven. It does have a full sized fridge, plug-in hot plate, and everything we needed to make a simple breakfast.
The highlights: super clean, SUPER comfortable king bed, ease of parking, and 10 minute walk downtown."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect, super fun location, the place was super clean and well decorated. The hosts were amazing, very communicative and helpful. Would recommend!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location and view from Tyler’s place was well worth every penny. We were very comfortable and had virtually everything we needed. Wi-Fi is not the greatest, but Tyler reached out and was able to provide a quick solution. Only real negative was the noise from upstairs; pretty consistently happened early each morning (not the fault of the people upstairs; more likely due to poor/old construction). Being able to walk across the pedestrian bridge to restaurants was a bonus! Host was extremely responsive and made the stay comfortable and enjoyable."

Jim went above and beyond setting up our cabin- he pulled the futon out and even put a mattress on it so it would be comfortable and ready for our boys. We didn't arrive until around 9:00 PM, but Jim met us at our cabin and showed us around to ensure we felt comfortable. The grounds were expansive and a lot of fun for our boys to explore. Jim and Sharill gave us a tour of their other buildings and some great history of the area and artifacts in their home. Breakfast was a bonus!!! Each afternoon we were brought our breakfast to enjoy the next morning at our leisure. We enjoyed quiche, scones, yogurt and orange juice. Whenever we needed anything, like more papertowels/TP/towels, Jim was quick to bring it over to us. We feel lucky we found this place and will definitely be staying at the property again!"

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, the stay wasn't exactly what we were expecting or had in mind for our family of four due to the condition of the cabin and with the difficulty of trying to cook anything with very limited materials. The couple was sweet enough to try to accommodate an allergy. However, we didn't realize it wasn't a traditional bed in breakfast where a variety of options might be offered such as a hot meal each morning, fresh coffee and/or teas, etc. For families that prefer to cook light, even on vacation, it would be helpful to have more silverware, actual cutting knives, clean cutting boards, a whole roll of paper towels from the start, more kitchen linens available, soap at the kitchen sink for washing your hands, a larger trash can, etc. Outside of the cabin was nice in that our kids could explore independently and have fun. Despite our experience, Jim and Sharill were very kind, welcoming, & shared an interest in what we had planned during our trip. We appreciate that!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim and Sharill's bed and breakfast is an absolute gem! The uniqueness of the place is immediately apparent, with captivating artwork embellishing the spaces and a delightful music venue adding a special touch.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a slice of heaven that Jim and Cheryl have. They have been there 25 years and beautifully restored the barn and cabins. Scenic setting beneath tall trees set beside 4 Mile Creek just a few miles outside of Glenwood. Even had breakfast (rare with Airbnb hosts) ready to go in our fridge with great outdoor seating spots adjacent to the creek. Make sure you carve out some time to just hang out on the property. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely magical! Escaping a heatwave of 100+ degree temps in Houston to stay in a mountain cabin at 65 degrees, who could ask for more? This place has so much, it’s the ultimate place to relax. Our cabin was next to a small stream, so nice to hear the sound of it as you go to sleep. Lots of things to look at on the property including a large barn with a stage, old fire trucks, a bridge over the creek to a large pasture with a teepee, a small cowboy cabin/mini museum, antiques and more! I also recommend reading the two books Mr. Hawkins wrote and listening to his music. Thanks to “Hawk” and his lovely wife for a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jim and Cheryl’s place was beautiful! Lots to explore and plenty of places to enjoy the peace and quiet of the Colorado mountains.

Recommend the stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Four Mile B&B is rustic, charming and a little bit of heaven. We stayed in the cabin by the creek and WOW what a wonderful experience. We could hear the creek running. It was so calming. Jim and Sharill are great hosts. They showed us around and Jim told us some wonderful wildlife stories plus he treated us to a few songs. He is a great musician. You must check out Sharill’s jewelry. She is quite the artist. One last thing the breakfast was delicious!!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I desperately needed a retreat-I had planned on a day at the hot springs and did not want to drive home. I booked Jim's place and as I drove out of town into the mountains, my whole body rejoiced! It is also located on Four Mile which has multiple meaning for me.
The property is amazing- I booked it because of the cabin being near a creek..it was so much more. I am going to book again for September.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was tranquil and the welcome was warm. Jim and Sherril were lovely hosts and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The homemade breakfast was delicious too!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jim and his wife are delightful hosts. We found we had our love of music and guitar-playing in common and spent some time sharing songs and stories! Lovely, unique, hand-made-by-his-wife earrings were available for purchase. The surroundings are everything you’d want for a relaxing and interesting stay — creekside seating and a fascinating old bunkhouse filled with intriguing articles of the Old West are highlights. Jim’s books of stories from his years as a firefighter and lyrics of songs he’s written were great reads. A 20-minute drive gets you to downtown Glenwood Springs. Definitely recommend Four Mile Creek B & B!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful property! Very unique! Hosts are super friendly!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a little place of Eden. Truly beautiful and a wonderful find. We will be visiting again.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The creekside cabin was perfect for us - we had everything we needed and it was super cozy. We loved sitting in the evening with the windows open listening to the creek outside. But even better was exploring the property that Jim and Sharill have lovingly appointed - from a green lawn across the bridge with a stage and tons of seating areas, to the new sculpture garden among the aspens, and last (but not least!) the amazing barn converted into a live music venue."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space was adorable but could use a little updating. The mattress was not the most comfortable mattress in the world but decent.
The location was unbeatable. You listen to the creek all night and have an incredible view of the stars. Lots of great history with the location as well. Breakfast was delicious and a lovely touch. Would stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful spot, and warm and charming cabin, with wonderful hosts. Jim and Sharill’s art and creativity suffuse the property.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We could not say enough positive about Jim and his wife and their lovely bed and breakfast! It is so peaceful and cozy and perfect for our three day getaway into the mountains! They are great hosts and spent time with us sharing the story of how they transformed this homestead into the beautiful bed and breakfast they have now. The breakfast each day was delicious and filling. Take time to explore the barn. I would love to come back in the summer when they host the local musicians.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Five miles up a winding road near Glenwood Springs, CO sits a pastoral idyll called Four Mile Creek Bed and Breakfast featuring timeless amenities ranging from repurposed barn beams and radiant floor heating to classic furnishings amidst fresh linens and other eye-catching comforts and adornments. Like the 3 creekside guest cabins, the 1885 main house is charming and comfortable with a careful collection of remarkable antiquities from an era gone by. In fact, the entire scene breathes with a classic Colorado country charm not often found in more modern accommodations. We awoke from our peaceful slumber to a bright Western Slope sun glinting off the snow and silence (save the creek) our only companion. With a tip of the ten gallon, we left with Jim and Sharill's warm invitation to revisit this little canyon paradise a stone's throw from the Roaring Fork. 'til next time, then..."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location! Perfectly quaint and the owners were very nice.
I want to come back to enjoy the scenery, as opposed to using it as a one night crash pad for Snowmass"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s cabin was absolutely cozy and beautiful. There is a creek that winds around the cabin and it’s so quiet you can hear it gurgling. The barn has a performance space that seems like an incredible spot for community events in the summer. We are looking forward to returning!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in the cabin - friendly hosts, yummy breakfast treats, comfortable space for two adults and two small kids. Perfectly located for skiing at Sunlight Mountain and an easy trip into town. Thanks!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute. The barn that you can explore is such a cool feature, it’s a concert hall and they do shows in the summer! Jim and Sharill bring you the cutest breakfast every morning of homemade quiches and scones and juice. The cabin we stayed in was so cozy and cute. We should have brought a better equipped car for the snow this time of year and we got stuck twice, but Jim and Sharill totally saved us and we couldn’t be more grateful. Can’t say enough nice things about this place. Really great spot for relaxing and so close to the hot springs. Thanks so much Jim and Sharill!!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim & Carol take incredible pride int their B&B and community. Peaceful and charming location with everything you could possibly need in your room and the main house. Close to Sunlight Mountain, Glenwood & Carbondale. Highly recommend. We will be back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic time at 4 mile creek b&b! It was exactly what we were looking for. Comfortable, peaceful and delicious breakfast each day. 7 minutes from Sunlight Mtn ski resort. 20 min from downtown Glenwood Springs- close enough, but away from it all. Beautiful property, our dogs loved playing in the snow. Much cozier for our dogs than a hotel. Jim and Sharill were kind and welcoming. They shared details of their home and history and welcomed us on their property. We would definitely stay again."

This is the place!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Four Mile Creek B& B is a really special place about halfway between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale... If you're booking a room here, seriously consider actually spending some time on the property - explore the barn (their music venue!) and the museum, take time to notice the sculptures and fun things that have been placed around the property, sit by the creek, and chat with Jim and Sharill who are full of stories about the area and their experiences at Four Mile Creek. I spent 4 nights there for some deep rest and relaxation, and loved every minute of it. The cabin was cozy and clean and the kitchen had everything I needed to prepare simple meals. The creek (which can be raging in the springtime!) lulled me to sleep. Wifi is good, if you want that. Loved eating meals on the bank of the creek, and sitting on the sunny deck in front of the potting shed with my book. I can't wait to go back!"

We will be back! Thank you again for the hospitality and warmth!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"4 Mile Creek Bed & Breakfast is truly adorable. It's a wonderful historic homestead that Jim and Sharill have lovingly restored, and it has a few buildings that they have set up as homage to the original owners of the property. They are welcoming, warm, have a host of stories to share if you are interested, and they make quite the delicious breakfast. Jim made our arrival nice and easy as well even though we arrived quite late. The cabins are cozy and right next to the namesake creek, making for the perfect bedtime lullaby. The cottage was spacious and cozy, and although we didn't bring our dog, we plan to next time we visit. The location is also remote enough to feel calm while still having easy access to Carbondale and Glenwood Springs. Highly recommend a visit! We didn't realize how cute and unique this place would be until we arrived, but it was a wonderful surprise."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here! The creek outside was so relaxing and we loved walking the grounds with our dog. Jim and Sharill were so welcoming and left us some delicious homemade breakfast, juice, and coffee every morning. 10/10 recommend!"

Being able to bring our dogs with us made this trip extra special :) we loved this place and can’t wait to return!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful and charming stay. We drove by this location over the summer and really wanted to figure out how to book a stay. We are so glad we found it on Airbnb. Jim and his wife are as kind as they are interesting. Getting to chat with them and hear stories of the property was a highlight for sure.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was one of a kind. Jim and his wife have made this place charming and inviting.

Outside, Aspens and coniferous trees are filled with singing birds and if you are walking around the property check out the Tipi!. The inside of the cabin was just what you would imagine: comfy, warm and lovely. There was an abundance of towels, dishes, and bathroom necessities. Anything you might need was available. The Big Red Barn is unbelievably picturesque and has the coolest loft you could ever think up. The hosts were so authentic, kind and provided a delicious fresh breakfast for us each morning, the scones were my fav. Overall it was wonderful."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin and would definitely return. It's about 5 miles from downtown Glenwood Springs on a beautiful property which we loved to explore. The breakfast tray left in the fridge is such a nice touch. Jim and his wife take pride in their property and making sure guests enjoy their stay. They also had great recommendations for restaurants. There is currently construction on the road to the cabin, and at certain times we had to wait about 7-8 minutes before going down the one lane road. It was not a big deal, but just something to be aware of."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim’s place is absolutely gorgeous! We loved leaving the window open at night to hear the creek. So peaceful
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really cozy cabin just outside of Glennwood Springs. Loved the area and Jim recommended some great side trips we could take our Wrangler on to see more of the country side which we eagerly took. Thanks again, Jim!"

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was an adorable little creek side cabin in a quiet and remote location. Jim and his wife Sharill have homemade items for breakfast that were very delicious! Aside from the road construction that was going on while we were there, it is a quick drive from Glenwood Springs. We were only here for one night, but Jim offers a lot to see and do on the property during your stay. We would have loved to experience these things had we not had such a tight schedule.
These are older cabins, but my friend and I noticed several cob webs and a large amount of dust on the wood beams in the ceiling, both of which should have been cleaned before our stay.
Most AirBnB hosts provide the WiFi information in their arrival message or it is posted inside the rental. We didn’t have cell service without the password to the WiFi. You must have to request it from Jim."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little Airbnb. Very nice having breakfast and our own little cabin!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,older log cabin next to a babbling brook that you can hear with the windows open. Jim and Sharill are amazing hosts and breakfast was homemade
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the 4 Mile was a terrific experience. Jim and Sheryl are fantastic hosts- friendly and accommodating. The B&B is in a great location- remote but still easy access to both Glenwood Springs and Carbondale. And the morning breakfasts from Sheryl were lovely and thoughtful! Thank you, Jim and Sheryl."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Creekside Cabin was a lovely respite from the city. After busy and active days, we loved coming back to the cabin to relax and listen to the creek. Jim and Sharill are delightful hosts who provided helpful tips and suggestions. Keep in mind the cabin is modest--you won't be able to cook a fancy meal, and the facilities are basic--but it is spotlessly clean, a budget-friendly price, and just what you need for a quiet time away. I wish I had a creek to listen to as I fall asleep every night. Overall a lovely and tranquil stay, and we hope to be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome people and a beautiful place!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a lot of fun! Jim and Sharill were the best hosts we’ve ever had, too many things to list! We enjoyed the property and all of the cool things to see, it was like getting a free tour with your stay! Jim and Sharill were so kind and great to visit with. Loved Sharill’s earings and OMG her cooking was amazing! Definitely recommend staying on this charming little farm!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This beautiful little gem of a property is not to be missed! We loved the Serene and tranquil surroundings from the babbling creek to the cozy accommodations and all the amazing eclectic things they have collected and decorated with throughout the years! Such a neat property to explore and learn about the history from Jim and Sharrill. We appreciated how amazing our hosts were with recommendations for great places to eat, a stunning, easily accessible scenic drive recommended by Jim with a map provided was incredibly helpful and appreciated. Sharill makes beautiful jewelry, and probably some of the best toffee bars I’ve ever had in my life and oh my was the breakfast they provided beautifully done as well! Overall our experience was perfect and I look forward to returning and recommending to everyone I know! Thank you both for my best Airbnb experience to date."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome property with so many interesting things to check out. Friendly hosts that go the extra mile to make their guests’ stay memorable.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our favorite Airbnb to date so far. The land was beautiful and peaceful. The hosts are amazing, genuine, friendly, and helpful! The breakfast every morning was wonderful and delicious! Would absolutely recommend this stay to all!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim and Sharill's sanctuary is a beautiful labor of love. We only spent one night but our family loved the cozy accommodations, full kitchen, creekside country location, and outdoor spaces. Our children swang on the rope swing, explored the many plants, including beautiful herbs and wildflowers. The underground teepee and cowboy museum were real treats. But the best part was interacting with both Jim and Sharill. We loved hearing their stories and they gave great advice and directions."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was perfect for a quiet weekend of hiking and hot springs. The cabin was cool, comfortable, and breakfast was perfect."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rustic cabin on a great piece of land! There is a stream, lake and lots of fun things to check out! Would recommend."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, you can hear the creek rushing all night long. Breakfast was well rounded and delicious. Lots of grassy areas to walk the dogs."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 Stars in all categories did not fully express our joy and satisfaction with Cheryl and Jim's awesome Creekside Cabin. They are wonderful, kind, and generous people with integrity. The value of our experience was immense. Their complimentary breakfasts were fine restaurant-quality meals in presentation and flavor. The Cabin was charming, comfortable, clean, fully functional, and safe. We slept well and relaxed while savoring the gurgling creek and crisp air. Cheryl and Jim were accommodating hosts eager to please and help us. They recommended walking/biking trails, better traveling routes, restaurants, shops, etc. Their pricing format is lodger-friendly with no fees for cleaning or dogs. The ambiance of their Cabin with their spacious property's wonders to explore, including their teepee, cowboy tribute room, and barn auditorium, are appealing. We will return and confidently recommend Cheryl, Jim, and Four Mile Creek B&B to our family and friends. Cheers to their humble greatness."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very charming B and B. Such a gorgeous setting and amazing hospitality! We loved being Creekside. And couldn’t have imagined how charming this was going to be. We will definitely be back.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The only bad part about my family’s stay here was when we had to leave. Such a great time here! We could have gone without stepping foot off the property and been just as happy.
To begin, Jim and Cheryl were such lovely hosts. We were supplied fresh fruit and juice every morning to my daughter’s delight. We fell asleep to calming sounds of gentle waters flowing by our cabin. The property was large and offered many places to explore.
I highly recommend this to other families. Your kids will thank you for the experience."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Incredible place to stay and spend quality time in this cozy cabin by the creek. Absolutely breathtaking scenes and breakfast by the creek in the morning was an extra perk. Breakfast was delicious and our guests were so welcoming.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Where do I even begin? Jim and Cheryl were exceptionally hospitable. Their attention to design makes it so that each part of the property has it's very own western aesthetic. Cheryl makes the best almond bark, and Jim certainly knows his way around the area. The breakfast was amazing, and we saw all kinds of wildlife while we were there!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect getaway for me. Jim's property provides many opportunities to be introspective and reconnect with oneself. I would highly recommend it to anyone who feels bombarded by life and the hustle.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim and Sharill are welcoming and wonderful hosts. The property is truly magical and a delightful place to relax and enjoy the incredible beauty.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to get away from everything. So much fun and brings you back to the old days. A live in museum! A very delicious breakfast was in the fridge.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. Sharill and Jim are gracious hosts. The Creekside was exactly what we were looking for as an escape from Denver. Take time to wander the property, smell the air, check out the barn and bunk, look at the stars, and listen to the creek."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The creek! The barn! The rustic charm and thoughtful hosts make this place a must! GREAT for a family of 4 and a dog. Minutes away for great skiing also at Sunlight and a gorgeous backroad to the gem of Carbondale.
Saved a lot of $ since we used the the kitchen in our own little cabin for most meals. The breakfast provided was super yummy!! Would recommend 100%"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I stated at the Creekside Cabin for a short weekend getaway. It was great! We were in the smallest cabin which was perfect for the 2 of us. The B&B is rustic but charming. Jim and his wife were wonderful hosts and we look forward to going back in the near future. My daughters comment was ""I'm not sure why anyone would ever want to leave"".
:]"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I, along with our aging pup, had a great stay at Four Mile. We loved the sound of the running water outside our window, the warm hospitality and conversation of the hosts, and the proximity to Sunlight ski resort. The daily breakfast provided was a real treat and the hosts were responsive when we needed a kitchen cleaning essential. The atmosphere was rugged, charming, and slow - just what we needed and wanted to have a true respite from the city and distractions. The accommodation of the Creekside Cabin was modest but had everything we needed to slow down and have a meaningful weekend trip. Multiple walks around the property in the fresh snowfall were a real treat. We’d recommend this option if you’re looking to slow down and/or reconnect with some of the best simple pleasures in life."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in the CreekSide Cabin! The gorgeous mountain location was exactly the peaceful retreat under the stars that we needed. The authentic, creative touches like the cowboy bunker museum and renovated barn theatre were so fun to explore and the home-baked apple tarts for breakfast were killer. Perfect distance from hot springs and skiing, plus stunning views while driving through the mountains."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Highly recommend.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a pleasure to stay at Red mill bed and breakfast. Jim and his wife were extremely nice and welcoming. The location was perfect. The breakfast tray was a nice touch. Would highly recommend to anyone.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Come here to see ALL the stars and enjoy the peace and quiet in a delightfully quaint cabin. We're definitely coming back.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I definitely recommend this place!!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin was super cute and cozy and located just far enough outside of town to feel remote. Jim and Shirill are great hosts.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Somewhat of a random find - but an absolute gem that will always be on my radar from here on out. The live music theater in the barn looks like a crazy good time in the warmer months.
I suggest checking out their website for more info and photos.
Either way - Jim and his wife’s B&B will exceed your expectations.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Bed and Breakfast i a cozy gem tucked in the mountains.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim’s and Shrill’s place is incredible. We were only there for one night, but it was fun to wake up to discover a magical land covered in snow. We chatted with the hosts and had a chance to check out the theater in the barn and see Sherill’s jewelry. Great hosts and what a fun experience! We’d love to come back. Definitely recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s perfect, located in the mountains and covered in snow, the grounds are vast and a great time to explore.

Thank you for a quiet, relaxing retreat!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gem. The vibe- honesty, simplicity, authenticity and charm. An old soul charm with kindness that facilitated a relaxing respite and promotes exploration ad thought on history. The beds are impeccably made and comfortable. My large boys, my husband and myself were so happy here. We watched movies and played games around the table. It was like taking a step back in time to a slower way of life, something my husband and I deeply crave. The proximity to ski areas like Sunlight Mt. ( super awesome for kids and budget) and hotsprings both in Glenwood and Redstone are just a bonus of this property, the real and most impressive part are the sweet owners and keepers of this peace of earth. They are excellent stewards of the gift they have been given and it shows in every detail. My family and I felt blessed to be there and loved are brief 48 hour stay and will be back. The scones are amazing! =) This place IS Colorado at its best. - the LaCours"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and very peaceful! We loved the close proximity to attractions and restaurants. Check in and out instructions were very clear and it felt so much nicer than a hotel. The washer and dryer in-unit were a game changer especially with the hot springs nearby.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and centrally located. Would prefer if there were more curtains (on all windows that were not frosted) for privacy. The bedroom does have curtains. The rental is a split between another unit that is under construction. Once you find the separate door, it is easy to access."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! So cute and perfect location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and comfy place for hubby and I to rest and relax for three nights. The amenities were great as well. We cooked breakfast and dinner in the well stocked kitchen. The washer and dryer in the unit were helpful too. Would definitely stay here again! I highly recommend you do too.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a 4 night stay at Dustin's place which is an excellent location close to all things downtown and the hot springs. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking supplies like pots, pans and utensils which was nice since we cooked a majority of our meals.
It is nice to have off street parking since virtually everyplace you want to visit downtown or the hot spring are an easy walk. The location is quiet, free from noisy neighbors or street traffic.
We will add Dustin's place to our list when we revisit again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute house! Had all we need. Extremely clean and efficient! Thank you for sharing your home Dustin! We will be back! ☺️

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal location and great property! I absolutely loved the bathroom and all of the decor. Perfect little spot for our weekend getaway. If we come back to Glenwood we will definitely be securing this spot with Dustin again!

10/10 would stay again.
Thank you!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place. It was homey and comfortable. Dustin was even accommodating about the parking situation because of our huge SUV. The place is literally within walking distance to an array of restaurants and things to do. Wish I could have stayed longer but def recommend !
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! what a beautifully decorated home that was right in the middle of town. We stayed at Dustin's place while visiting Iron Mountain Hot Springs and everything was 5 minutes away. We had one of the best meals ever at Pullman and it was only a 4 minute walk. The home was spotless, which made it an enjoyable stay."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cozy winter stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dustin place was an amazing get a way for the night. Was super close to everything downtown. Definitely plan on renting again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was an ideal location for us as it was walkable to all of the places we wanted to go. Was very quiet and was able to relax. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can see why this is a guest favorite. A nice space blending original and contemporary and impeccably maintained. For a private home it couldn't be in a better location in G. Springs.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dustin was super responsive and great to work with. Great location if you're taking the train in. The place was cozy and clean.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great stay, will return!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an awesome long weekend here! The location couldn’t be better - very walkable to so many restaurants, Hotel Colorado, & breweries! The place was lovely, private and very cozy & “Hygge,” so it was easy to make ourselves at home. They did a beautiful job with everything, it was excellent. It snowed in Glenwood all weekend, which was gorgeous.
The house had all the amenities we needed and they even shoveled the snow & salted the walkways and around our car each day, which was really helpful and thoughtful as well.
If I was critiquing anything, it would be pretty helpful to have curtains on the kitchen/dining windows for privacy, as there are cameras in the courtyard pointing toward the house. And perhaps a few more hooks throughout the house & bathroom to hang clothing.
We would definitely love to return and truly enjoyed our time here! Absolutely recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is in a phenomenal location- super walkable to downtown and feels private. It was also decorated beautifully and cozy. Pay attention to check in information if arriving after dark (and the provided map) because it can be a little tricky to find in the dark. We loved it!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cute little unit. It had everything we needed for our stay. Being super close to downtown restaurants/shops made it super convenient. Would definitely recommend and would stay here if ever in Glenwood again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot to spend a few days, and we will absolutely try to snag this spot again if we do another trip. The place itself is so cozy and comfortable and beautifully put together, we felt like we were at someone's real home. And the neighborhood is very quiet, but very walkable with just a couple blocks to several great restaurants and only a bit further for groceries or the pool."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dustin’s place is small but really well (professionally) designed and perfect for a couple. The unit is functional and beautiful. After finding the parking in the alley we noticed some wonderful aromas coming from the west…turns out is was the Masala and Curry restaurant; the food was great! Cooper Wine and Spirits next door. Nice bottle shop. Be aware there is the typical noise associated from being in town. We enjoying being in the thick of things; we parked and car and didn’t drive for two days. Also we really enjoyed the outdoor courtyard area. Places like Dustin’s are what keep us coming back to Air bnb. Thank you Dustin. A+.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place! Charming, and a very short walk to the center of town. Having no dishwasher was a small inconvenience. The patio is delightful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and secluded but close to everything.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our couple’s getaway! Dustin was great!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dustin’s place was the perfect home base for exploring the Roaring Fork Valley. Walkable to downtown Glenwood Springs. The cozy cottage feel and privacy of this accommodation is why I would highly recommend. Look forward to staying again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dustin’s home was a perfect place for us to relax and experience the heart of Glenwood Springs. We loved that we could easily walk to a variety of restaurants, and that it was still tucked away in a peaceful/quiet spot. The home looks unassuming from the outside but is fully renovated, homey, and clean inside (with fun decor!). Great accommodations for me, my husband, and our one-year old (slept in our pack n play). Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing trip. Glenwood’s best attractions are 90% walkable from here. The home seems recently renovated, it’s gorgeous inside. Dustin was responsive and this place is a treasure. We will back!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Glenwood. Quaint, homey, clean and excellent location!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were in Glenwood Springs to celebrate my 50th Class Reunion (1973) from Glenwood Springs High School in mid-September. The location of this beautiful place was perfect. Downtown restaurants, shops, and amenities - including the Hot Springs Pool - are all within a 10 minute walk. Yet, this lodging is secluded in the loveliest setting. As much as we wanted to get home, we were very sad to leave this secluded gem."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is perfect for anyone visiting glenwood. Amazing location and an extremely comfortable space.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house and you couldn’t wish for a better location. Photos are very accurate, although no snow in September:). And there’s been an added seating area outside. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dustin was quick to respond to some minor concerns. Had a great time! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic location! Super responsive! I was traveling for work and didn’t have a rental car but because of the location I was still able to walk to work. Restaurants walking distance. One or two pick hiccups and he was responsive within 10 minutes. The place is perfect for solo or a couple. Washer and dryer is fantastic. All the kitchen utensils you would need. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds. I’ve slept in, and the linens were by far the best any Airbnb. Would definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place. It was extremely clean and had everything we wanted. We really enjoyed the private little front porch area with the cozy loveseat. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware, dishes, coffee maker (drip), coffee, etc. Everything was very clean and the atmosphere was extremely inviting. The bed was very comfortable and with the portable AC in the bedroom, it made it cool enough to sleep at night. It was very close to downtown, but surprisingly quiet. The TV was easy to use, and intuitive. Overall, very pleased; we will be back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and very walkable to restaurants and Glenwood Hot Springs Pool! Cute little place.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place in a great location close to the main stretch of town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dustin's place looked exactly like the photos and his communication was very clear and responsive. The place was very small but worked well for us, as we spent most of our time out and about exploring the town and mountains. No A/C in July was a bit uncomfortable, but having a stand-up A/C unit in the bedroom helped keep us cool at night, and the mattress was super comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dustin was a great host and has a great location for tapping into restaurants and bars. His place had a great vibe and encourage others to check out his place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dustin's cottage was close to lots of restaurants which made it easy to stay parked and take a stroll. Despite being within walking distance of food, music, and activities, we were impressed with the peacefulness of the location. The cottage is situated in such a way that we were able to enjoy what felt like our very own private escape. It was a pleasant surprise considering the walkability of the cottage that the main noise we heard was the sound of birds singing. The cottage was simply perfect for my husband and me to get away and simply be able to focus on relaxing and rejuvenating."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warm eclectic place to stay in the heart of downtown less than 1 block from AmTrak Station and 4 blocks from free local transport bus stop. Not your typical, sterile AirBnb with numerous rustic and interesting furnishings. Peaceful private outdoor setting as well to chill and relax. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend the stay! It was out of my origional price range, but was well worth it, considering I didn't drive any more than 5 minutes. Everything else was in walking distance, and I loved that."

Thank you!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Dustin highly responsive and attentive. Place was very small, looked like the photos, just much smaller than I anticipated. Located so close to town that we could walk everywhere which was a great bonus. Overall, a decent place to stay for 2 people."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I really enjoyed our week stay here. The place was quiet and the amenities were great.

We would definitely come back again."

The bed was so comfortable and it was nice having a washer and dryer for our clothes. Dustin was super responsive to everything we needed. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in Dustin’s place was amazing and super cozy. Place was super clean. I don’t usually walk in my socks 🧦 when I’m at a hotel or any other lodging place due to, for me, I feel the flooring is dirty. Well, that did not happened to me at Dustin’s place at all!!! I was walking in my socks up and down the place 🙂🙂.
Only thing I would suggest, is curtains in both kitchen windows for privacy. The sink window is right in front of a tall building that has windows facing the place and they can see down from there. The eating area window faces the outside part by the entrance. However, there is a security camera facing that direction and you can feel a little invaded. The camera is perfect given that faces the entrance, as long as you have a curtain in the window.
Other that the two curtains, I give the place a 5/5 ⭐️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is cute and cozy. It was exactly as expected from the description and photos. The bed was comfortable and it was quiet despite being in town. I will stay there again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Airbnb was cozy, cute, and we loved the little sugar cookies. Good water pressure and nice body wash too! The best part was getting to feed the cute alpacas and see them out the windows during our stay! 🥰"

The entire cabin was spotless and well furnished, and had great entertainment options between the board games and streaming services. We could really tell that the owners put a lot of thought and effort into the design and upkeep of this space! We ended up hiking around Rifle Falls (30min scenic drive) which is a must-do, and spend a few hours hanging out with all the Alpacas. All of the Alpacas were very sweet and getting to spend so much time with them was extremely fun. Tiffany was incredibly kind and friendly, and everyone on the farm was excellent.
Without a doubt a top-tier Airbnb experience."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location was a great choice for our family. Kim communicated with me in advance and provided clear instructions for getting to our destination. We parked right beside our cabin an easily brought bags inside. The cabin looks just like the photos. It is adorable and comes with anything you might need for a short stay. The kitchen has all of your basic cooking supplies and we made a delicious breakfast of farm fresh eggs and cookies (provided by Kim) in addition to the food that we packed. The refrigerator and freezer have ample space. The only thing missing is a small kitchen table, but there is a moveable table you can pull up next to the couch. All linens we provided in the bedroom area and bathroom. We were able to put a pack 'n play in the room without moving any furniture. The alpacas are a few steps from the cabin and we visited them multiple times during our stay. Downtown Silt is an easy 5 minute drive and Rifle Falls (an excellent stop!) was about 30. Thank you, Kim!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You cannot find a better stay in the area than this beautiful guest house on Kim and Cory's alpaca farm. We couldn't help smiling while visiting the alpacas.

Definitely add this to you list of places to visit!🦙"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I cannot say enough good things about our stay at Kim’s place. I felt so much peace being surrounded by nature. Visiting the Alpacas was such a highlight.

Great little cottage with everything we could ask for - fresh eggs- alpaca cookies.

Got to meet Kim and such a great host. She educated us on the alpacas. They all have such funny personalities especially if you have food for them.
Would highly recommend a visit or a few nights there!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! It was perfect for a couple and we had such a lovely time! It was awesome to hang out with the alpacas, and such a beautiful location to be. We would totally come back, but bring bottled water next time. It was so lovely!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hope everyone has a chance to stay at Kim’s place. Truly, their place is a slice of heaven. They truly put so much love into their property, homes, and alpacas."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the alpaca farm. The cabin was quaint and comfortable, and we liked the alpaca themed decor everywhere. The chalkboard of recommendations by the door and the dinner menus of local restaurants made it easy to pick a place to eat every day. My wife loved enjoying her coffee while petting the alpacas. My favorite thing about the stay was the location. The cabin is far from most city lights, and so the view of the stars was astounding. I've never seen so many in my life."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful stay! The ranch brings comfort and relaxation. We could have watched the alpacas from the patio happily for hours. The location is great for summer and winter with hot springs, lakes, hikes, and ski mountains all within easy reach.
Kim and Cory are wonderful hosts with a friendly attitude and careful attention to detail."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay. Our first visit was 2 years ago and we loved it. When we were planning this years vacation our daughter insisted we stay here again. Beautiful surroundings, peaceful and quiet. The alpacas were adorable. Our place was cutely decorated and very clean. We are already talking about coming back next year. Special touches were alpaca cookies and a lovely boutique. You will not be disappointed!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"SOOO Cute! And Kim is very responsive and helpful. Beautiful interior. Loved the attention to detail and ambiance. The dedication to the alpaca theme is adorable! When booking, please keep in mind, you are on a farm and may have little, tiny guests [gnats/flies] in the corners by the entrance door. You have everything you need for a relaxing stay including entertainment and friends with their community of Alpacas that were very welcoming!
I do want other guests to enjoy this host/listing as much as we did. However the one downside to our stay was the shower water pressure.
Definitely felt at home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here as part of a birthday trip to Glenwood Springs and the amazing quality of Kim and Cory's space made the trip so memorable! The space itself was cute, clean, and contained everything you would need to feel comfortable. Beyond that, the alpacas had such great personalities and getting to hand feed them was an absolute blast! Waking up to them each day made the experience really special - there was even a new baby born while we were there! The hosts themselves were nothing but kind and helpful throughout each part of the stay. Inside the cabin they have a board that lists excellent recommendations for places to eat (we LOVED Hogsback Pizza and Miner's Claim) and things to do in the area. This is the best and most unique experience that I have ever had at an AirBnB and cannot recommend staying here enough!"

Kim was responsive and proactive when it came to checking in and out, plus answered any questions that we had. Great restaurant recommendations and we loved learning about the alpacas. The farm was peaceful and inviting, with so much beautiful land. We would love to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Alpaca farm was exactly what we had hoped it would be. The cottage was clean, functional and very well decorated. The farm was beautiful and peaceful with many happy alpacas to visit and pet. During the day there is a very cute boutique where souvenirs can be purchased as well as alpaca food to feed the alpacas. Staying in a cozy cottage and interacting with the alpacas was such a fun experience that we will never forget!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Fun and beautiful surroundings. Kim was very friendly and responsive while we stayed! Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you Kim for a restful stay. We especially appreciated your time and energy getting us engaged with yiur Alpacas. I think we will miss Reese Silverspoon and rabbit eared Dawson the most. The recommendation on Miners Claim for dinner was also spot on. We soent 4 nights in Aspen core before visiting you, and Miners Claim was easily our best meal and less expensive at the same time (admittedly a low bar where Aspen is concerned) Finally, although I know 100 degree days are not typical... the portable AC was critical and effective."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an amazing place!! I absolutely loved staying here. Kim was so responsive and sweet. The cottage was immaculate and decorated so cute! Highly recommend and I hope to come back one day!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved that the alpacas are right outside the door. The sunset is amazing over the mountains. So peaceful!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I loved our stay at the Alpaca Farm Kim and Corey! It was a great pit stop on the way from Denver to Salt Lake City, Utah and we had such a delightful and relaxing time. Check in was easy, the little house was adorable, comfortable and clean inside. Alpacas were grazing in the field when we arrived and we were literally surrounded by them when they came in for the evening. Corey opened the shop for us after hours so we could check out the merch for their farm and we got yarn from one of their own Alpacas, so cool. The morning was peaceful and we got to feed lots of the mama Alpacas and discovered how sweet and gentle they are! Highly recommend stopping here and enjoying the beauty all around!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place and amazing hosts! I planned a trip to Glenwood for my boyfriend’s birthday and found this adorable spot and surprised him with it and he absolutely loved it! We had a great time at the farm and kept going back to feed the alpacas as we had so much fun with it. The cottage itself was very clean and very cozy:) We felt right at home thank you!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the Alpaca airbnb. Close to Glenwood springs, restaurants, and hikes. Lots to do in a short distance away. The alpacas were adorable and friendly. Definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My daughter loved saying “moo” to the alpacas. The studio was really cute and had everything we needed. A great stop on a long vacation.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A night with the Alpacas is always the right thing to do! We very much enjoyed the peacefulness of the farm and watching the Alpacas do their Alpaca thing. It was a Sunday night so not much open for dinner but we had some pizza takeout and brought our own wine/beer. Many thoughtful touches including the eggs and cookies! We even got to see the Alpacas being sheared which was a special treat. I highly recommend bringing bug spray and a citronella candle if you are going to be hanging outside at night and a sleep mask as the room gets very light when the sun comes up. Thank you for sharing your farm with us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim was very nice, and the stay was wonderful. Would definitely stay again when we visit Glenwood Springs again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice location on the alpaca farm. Quietly located with a nice view. The cottage is neat and cozy. Everything is available as described. Highly recommended!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great stay! The cabin was immaculate- extremely comfortable and relaxing. Got to see and feed the alpacas, who are, of course, the main attraction! They’re amazing to be around.
Also got to do some good stargazing as well! There’s some light pollution, but bringing a friend from the east coast, it was more stars than she’s ever seen!
Book this stay, you won’t regret it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An easy drive from Glenwood Springs, Sopris is an Alpaca Oasis waiting to be discovered. Get a taste of farm life with all of the perks and none of the work. We loved watching the sun set over the red barn while the crias chased each other around the paddock."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! It was so peaceful watching the alpacas play. Kim was so friendly and brought us food to hand feed them :) the room itself was so cute and full of little touches. Our only regret was not booking another night !

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim and Cory's place was amazing! We live just a few hours away and decided to take a last minute trip to Glenwood- the pictures don't do this place justice. The studio itself was sparkling clean with a ton of local recommendations but the alpacas were the star of the show! They are so cute and friendly, (they don't smell!) and Kim couldn't have been kinder. There was a baby alpaca born the day we were there!! The alpaca cookies and fresh eggs were such a lovely touch. We can't wait to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay here was an absolute dream. I spent hours enjoying the alpacas, and I loved it!! The farm is beautiful, as is the guest house.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have a great time staying in this Airbnb surrounded by alpaca. Kim has a great knowledge of alpaca and it is a pleasure to chat with him and his wife. The location of the house is pretty convenient if you are planning to visit Glenwood Spring or Aspen.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim's place was spotless and cozy, and the alpacas were soooo cute and friendly!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another incredible time at Spris Alpaca Farm in the Tiny House. Thos was our 3rd year in a row..Each time we make more sweet memories. It's our happy place. Kim & Cory are wonderfully friendly and always responsive if needed, but let their guests have privacy and peace. The house has virtually everything you need. The alpacas are sweet and have great personalities. There are so many baby crias this year and they're full of shenanigans! Leonard the farm cat loved to follow us around for sunset walks. Book this or another of their air bnb's there are 3 on site
This is the smallest one and always perfect for us. Our daughter is growing up going here every summer and loves the experience every time. We love it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Happy place to stay!
We enjoyed staying at Kim’s Alpaca farm. This place makes the great and sweet last destination to our road trip. The unit is super cute and clean. The farm is well-kept and well maintained, super clean and neat as well. The alpacas are so cute. Kim and Cory are very kind, dedicated, and friendly.
We would love to go back again and recommend to anyone! My 4 years old love it and this is the best part of her trip."

We were over the moon when I found this AIRBNB because who doesn’t love Alpacas?! The property was insanely gorgeous and peaceful. I loved all the greenery and scenery. The alpacas were so beautiful and friendly, there were so many alpacas. The property itself was so quaint and cozy. This property had an extremely comfortable couch and the bed was amazing too. Thank you for the cutest cookies ever and the eggs. The property owners were so friendly and taught us about the alpacas. I can’t wait to come back. They also had free Wi-Fi and access to Netflix and other streaming channels for the night time.
This is the perfect spot for a night out with your bff or a romantic getaway. I am in love."

The place is just 15-20 mins to Glenwood springs. We would definitely stay here again 🦙"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay on this alpaca farm was simply incredible! From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the beautiful setting and the warmth of the hosts. The farm was nestled in a gorgeous valley, surrounded by mountains and green pastures, and the alpacas themselves were such a delight to be around. This alpaca farm stay was absolutely amazing! The setting was stunning, the hosts were warm and welcoming, and spending time with the alpacas was an unforgettable experience. The cozy cabin was comfortable and thoughtfully designed, and the farm-to-table meals were delicious. I can't recommend this place enough!"

Great for couples and families!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had a whole lot of fun at this cottage. You get a lot of extra time with the alpacas, outside of the farm hours. We woke up and had breakfast outside and spent the sunset with the alpacas. It was quaint and clean and quiet. The view was beautiful, there was plenty to do in Glenwood Springs which is only 20 mins away. This was one of my most favorite airbnbs & I would definitely come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Kim’s ranch was outstanding. We’ve lived in Colorado most our lives, but this little gem was a welcome surprise. It was a stopover for us from camping along the southwest border headed back to the front range and it was perfect. We were planning to rent a hotel room but in comparison Kim’s place was far better for the price. The construction of the tiny house/ barn is really high quality, cozy, and comfy. Plus Kim is super sweet and fun. And the alpacas! What a cool animal. They just wanted to hang with us and were so adorable on every level. We’ll definitely return the next chance we get. *Also, we had our 2 and 9 year old kids along, but I’m not 100% sure if this listing is intended for children. But they absolutely loved it. Alpacas are their new favorite animal and the house was super accommodating for them."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly unique Air BnB experience. The actual cabin is amazing, but the proximity to the alpacas and the location made it even more memorable.

Kim has menus from local restaurants and suggestions of where to go for food and entertainment. We had farm fresh eggs waiting in the fridge and homemade alpaca cookies to greet us which were so good and impressively decorated.
Being able to roam the ranch and watch and hand feed the alpacas was an experience we will never forget. S’mores by the fire pit under the stars at night capped it all off. Kim was so friendly and shared some of her knowledge and story with us. All the personal little touches they had for us and everyone who visits daily was so amazing. Truly great and caring people. Can’t wait to visit again in the future!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Experience and very unique!

It was our one year anniversary and waking up on the farm with the alpacas was a perfect way to start our day. We ended up heading back east and made a pit stop at Vail Resorts to go skiing/snowboarding.
The heat was on when we arrived which was fantastic and I would totally recommend this spot to anyone looking for something extraordinary.
Thanks Kim & Cory!"

meeting alpacas 🦙 was awesome experience!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Chacra Cabin was easily one of the best Airbnbs that I have ever stayed in. The location was beautiful and peaceful while easily accessible to Glenwood Springs. I loved watching the sunset over the canyon on the front porch and listening to all the wildlife. The cabin itself was clean, roomy, and had all the essentials for a comfortable stay. Ali was a very responsive host and was kind enough to be flexible with my check-in time. I would absolutely stay here again with no hesitation, and highly recommend this cabin to anyone staying in the area!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved Ali's place. The cabin is cozy and comfortable with unbeatable views. We were there for a whole week and felt right at home. Ali and her co-host were always willing to help with practical needs or in answering questions. We would absolutely stay again.
Be sure your car has a little bit of clearance to get up the final part of the road to the cabin. We were in a Chevy Malibu and made it just fine (not very high clearance) but anything lower riding would have been questionable."

If you want to get out and explore, it’s only 15 minutes to downtown Glenwood Springs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I toyed with the idea of leaving a really negative review to keep this place a secret and easier to book in the future, but the truth is that this was a wonderful place to stay and I plan on staying there again."

The space was cozy, very clean, and thoughtfully stocked - which I always feel makes a stay just that much more comfortable. I really have nothing but good things to say; I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and it was very relaxing, we saw some elk on the ridge across the way from the front door. The cabin was not far from Glenwood Springs and the scenery was beautiful. We would definitely recommend the cabin for others to enjoy as well, we will be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s place was really nice. We had winter storms moving in and arrived a little early and she accommodated ￼us. The surroundings are beautiful. There’s plenty to do in town. It was just what we were looking for.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was hands down one of our favorite stays yet! Ali’s cozy cabin was just perfect in every way and she was a wonderful accommodating host! We definitely look forward to returning soon!

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding little cabin on the border of “nowhere”…quiet and mostly secluded. Great location for a quiet couples/individual getaway and launching pad for Glenwood Springs and the surrounding region with great access to the highway.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin in a beautiful location, definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin felt very cozy. I loved the fireplace and the view. This cabin felt very private. There are surrounding homes but at a distances. Definitely recommend a stay here.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing!
Peaceful, cozy, and quiet! The best part is about being outside of the cabin and hear the river sound between the mountains!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful interiors , amazing outside view , drive to the property was not as bad as I imagined it be even good snow .
Overall amazing .."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time at the cabin and will be back again. Peaceful location and as cozy as one could ask for. Love it!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s place was even more wonderful than the photos show. Absolutely worth the stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such an amazing get-a-way location! We enjoyed every moment spent in this lovey cabin and could not have asked for a better private way to spend the week, thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A true hidden gem. This mountain getaway cabin is perfect for those looking to getaway, relax and unwind. The views are spectacular! Ali is a fantastic host, very responsive, friendly and glad to help with any questions or concerns. Would highly recommend you stay here if you’re looking to spend some time in Glenwood Springs!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect couples retreat from the normal hustle and bustle to recharge your energy! Just keep going on the gravel road past the private property sign quite awhile before you hit the cabin sign. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, private little cabin. Will definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and quiet. Great mountain views on all sides."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"awesome little cabin, very cozy and great for a chill weekend, conveniently close to town but also nice and secluded, caught some trout in the creek👌"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin, nestled in the mountains. Absolutely gorgeous"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay with Ali, would highly recommend to anyone visiting this area. The cabin was clean, accurate, and in a beautiful location. Great amenities too. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything that I look for in a vacation home I found with one small exception. Things were clean, the place was as I expected from descriptions, plenty of items in the kitchen, and private. However my husband and I found the foam bed to be uncomfortable, which I realize is a personal preference. We still had a fairly good night sleep. The water tasted phenomenal, which in Colorado is important to keep hydrated. This was a fun and unique place to stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed at here for our honeymoon and it was everything we could hope for! The cabin was so cute and cozy and the views around were just breathtaking. We absolutely loved having our own trail up the mountain (it was a bit rough but 1000% worth it for the views). We had the best time ever and honestly never wanted to leave. We will most definitely be back for another trip in the future!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ali’s cabin is so dreamy! It’s cozy and comfortable. Everything was clean and it’s very well equipped - had everything we needed in the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. The views are stunning and the big windows really bring the outside in. The decor and the fireplace really give this cabin a vibe. We hit Iron Mountain hot springs, which was only about 15 mins away, and a great place to soak!
Only downside - there is construction happening just a stone’s through away. We’re from the city and we were really looking forward to some quiet time with the sounds of nature. Not as quiet or private as we had hoped. The owners did leave a note about the construction in the cabin with a number to call if it was bothersome (which is thoughtful), but we didn’t feel that strongly about it. It was a minor bummer. Overall, we had a lovely stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ali's cabin offers a truly mesmerizing experience with its great mountain views, providing a breathtaking backdrop to your stay. The sight of majestic peaks against the horizon is a constant source of wonder, making each moment spent inside or outside the cabin an unforgettable memory. Whether you're sipping your morning coffee on the porch or cozied up by the fireplace at night, the mountain views add a touch of magic to your stay, creating a perfect mountain getaway that you'll cherish forever."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Ali's cabin for our anniversary trip and it was just as beautiful and peaceful as we hoped it would be!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To start off the pictures do not do justice! This place is sooo beautiful inside and out. As soon as you walk out of the cabin, you see all the mountains, the creek and the apple orchards down the road.
It felt right at home and when it was cold, the fireplace came in handy.
There is so much natural lighting inside of the cabin. The way the place is decorated is very detailed and I loved all the little crystals that were placed in the cabin.
There’s a few neighbors around but still feels private.
After a long day, my fiancé made us steak fajitas as we gazed into the sky full of stars.
There are plenty of stores around and gas stations.
On our last day, we took a hike up the mountains and enjoyed all the beauty nature has to offer. This place is hands down the best Airbnb we have stayed at. It has so much to offer."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is fantastic! Incredible views and perfect accommodations. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin that was cozy and clean! Easy to find l, even in the dark, and was super peaceful with beautiful surroundings. We loved our stay!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was so sweet, peaceful, and private. The owner came around once to see if we wanted him to put out the fire pit and some wood for us which was super sweet and we really enjoyed it. We did the hike up to split rock, it’s pretty rough but so worth the views. We can’t wait to stay here again, thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a nice, relaxing stay. Everything was spotless and super cozy. The view is amazing. I wish we would’ve stayed longer to get to hike around and sit by the creek. 10/10 highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable, extremely clean cabin. This was our favorite stay of the trip. The cabin is very nice and lots of cool spots to walk to. Ali was a great host and extremely easy to work with."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay! Private location, cute hike, lovely fireplace. We’d love to stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stunning and peaceful property. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. We would stay here again and recommend to friends and family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Ali’s cabin! The location is just remote enough to be super quiet and relaxing while also being close enough to the roaring fork valley for daily adventures/activities. We really enjoyed hanging out by the creek and grilling out on the back patio in the evening. Overall, a great place for a relaxing and refreshing weekend and we’d love to visit again soon!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Cabin is a little heaven in Colorado. We had a great time in this lovely place, we would 100% recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin in a beautiful location. If possible go there for the first time in the day because it's a little difficult if you don't know how far down the road you should go. My only suggestion would be to have the cabin sign with the arrow bigger and if it could light up that would be even better. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed this cabin. Extremely well decorated. The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s everything you could hope for in a mountain cabin stay. Amazing views, cozy cabin, back patio with table and lights. Convenient to Glenwood springs city center. It’s very unique and don’t think there’s another one like this out there. You won’t be disappointed. I would book for a longer stay next time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Listen, this place was perfect.
My husband and I chose this for our honeymoon and it was magical!
The view was really pretty.
It was quiet and private!
It was also pretty close to town and the drive was easy and the place was easy to find!
There was plenty of small wildlife about!
There was a lizard who sat outside on the fence in the back that sunbathed next to us as we ate lunch most of the time. I actually fell in love with the little guy and hated leaving him behind 🥲
There were rabbits, crows, and magpies that visited a lot. All were very docile but stayed pretty close to see from all the beautiful windows.
The only thing that wasn’t too fun was the harvestman spiders that got in and scared the bejeesus out of us when they crawled up on the couch. There was only about three the whole time and they were real docile and were not difficult to let outside!
However, it was still a really great place! It was so perfect and we want to come back on an anniversary another time!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely- even better than we expected! Beautiful setting, peaceful, homey and comfortable. I just wish we had another few days there to enjoy it 😊"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this little cabin tucked away. It was peaceful and perfect for a couples getaway. Ali was great at getting right back to us if we had any questions. Place was clean and exactly as described. Almost better in person!! Loved everything about this place and we would come back in a heartbeat. Kitchen is well stocked with everything you need if you want to cook your own meals.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and location are beautiful. Everything was provided for an easy stay. I would love to return someday!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay!! Very private and our host was very helpful! Definitely would stay here again. 😁
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Secluded and beautiful spot. The perfect couples getaway. The cozy cabin has everything you need but may not use because it is so peaceful!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a perfect stay hiding in the mountains and had a great hike behind the property in the morning, thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and private! Loved it here will be back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a wonderful stay! The house was so beautiful and the location was beyond breathtaking!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot just outside Glenwood springs. Ali was nice enough to let us check in early and gave us good recommendations on a little private nature hike just behind the cabin. An amazing spot for a couple looking for a little mountain get away
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time at the cabin and found the surroundings to be breathtaking. The cabin itself was clean and beautiful. One thing to keep in mind is the steep drive up to the cabin, but that was explained in the directions.
We would definitely love to come back again in the future!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this place enough! It was remote enough (we didn't see a single person while we stayed here unless we wanted to). Comfortable, peaceful, plenty of space for the two of us. It's close to plenty of restaurants, touristy things and grocery stores. Even in the heat of the summer, the cabin was comfortable. Has an AC unit and a couple of fans and it was plenty to keep it cool. The kitchen had everything we needed, there were a couple of fans and puzzle and two smart TVs and fast Internet. Remote yet comfortable getaway."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So glad we booked this cabin for our Glenwood Springs stay! The cabin itself is stunning, beautifully decorated, close to town/attractions, and has everything you need. There is so much beauty in sight of it as well. We enjoyed sleeping to the sound of the creek, saw turkeys and their babies on our walk down to the water, and my husband really enjoyed hiking to the top behind the cabin very early in the morning. He said the hike was quite tough (even though short) but the views were amazing. Also really enjoyed going to the nearby Iron Mountain Hot Springs in the evening. Only wish we could have stayed a little longer."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay here! It was so nice to be able to hike and have access to water right where we were staying! Especially visiting Glenwood during a busy season. I was in love with the space inside and being away from town and people. The house is absolutely beautiful and has everything you could need! Ali was very fast at communicating with me and gave so many great recommendations for our trip! A truly amazing place to get away!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully private, expansive and beautiful- lovely cabin, land and energy!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible views, sound of the creek, really thoughtfully designed cabin as far as space layout. Those windows! Comfy bed. Your privacy is respected. Air con worked great. And two furry little dogs even greeted me on my way out"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is gorgeous, the hosts were incredibly helpful when I asked to hide my car so I could propose to my girlfriend on the property (she said yes). I cannot recommend this place enough."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my husband and i had a wonderful time and felt right at home the moment we came through the door!
There was great air conditioning and the mountains surrounding are so beautiful!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my fiancé stayed at Ali’s place and it’s been nothing short of magical and romantic. We were greeted by Ali’s dad since we were a little early, but due to us landing early they still were accommodating. You are surrounded with beautiful views and the stars are absolutely stunning. We will definitely be coming back to the chacra cabin. We loved everything about it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect spot for our visit to Glenwood Springs. Close drive to lots of activities and downtown but very private place to go home to in the evening and enjoy nature.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful location and super comfortable cabin!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this beautiful cabin so much and hope to return. We did the Split Rock hike and loved it! It’s more like a half hour hike as you have to take more time because the red rocks and dirt are loose. We also walked down to Canyon Creek. We could hear the sounds of the rushing creek from our super private cabin. It was very clean and cozy and equipped with everything we could have needed. We met Ali’s Dad, Royal, and he was a super cool dude and built the cabin himself. It was an easy drive into town too. We loved Glendale Springs and hopefully will stay in the cabin again on our next trip through. 🫶🏻⛰️☀️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You definitely want to stay at the cabin. It truly soothes the soul.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. Reviews don’t give it justice to how great it truly is.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this secluded much needed peaceful getaway. Surrounded by mountains it’s a beautiful place to stay :)
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. The bed was amazing. We slept so well. It may have also been the sound of the river combined with the comfort of the bed and location. The setting is magical. We loved our hike right out the back door. The grill ran out of propane, and Ali was super prompt and had a new propane tank for us within minutes.
Truly, one of the best stays anywhere we have experienced. ❤️❤️❤️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was a wonderful private get away surrounded by stunning views.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful settimg.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really sweet cabin in a private location. Super clean and the mountain behind you is a view. Do the hike to the top it rocks. Wifey and I loved this place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved this place! If you like the privacy of being on a beautiful mountain away from it all, and also in close distance to many nearby activities in Glenwood Springs-- this is the place for you. Ali has decorated the cabin perfectly and has thought of everything. We loved the views, the trails on the property and sitting outside of the cabin in the evening and taking in all the beauty! Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here!! Very cozy and cute cabin. The surrounding property is beautiful! We hiked up the trail behind the cabin and got some amazing views. 15 minute drive to Glenwood Springs Adventure park and the hot springs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great! The host answered my questions in a timely manner. Very peaceful. Everything you need right there at the cabin. We hiked the trail up above the cabin and then down to the creek. It was pretty high due to the melting of the snow. We explored Glenwood Springs. Would recommend Rocky Mountain Pizza and the Brew Club restaurants. We got groceries and did breakfast at the cabin so we just had to eat out once a day. We did the Doc Holiday and Hanging Lake trails. Had a great 25th anniversary getaway! Scenery is breathtaking!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cabin and beautiful surroundings! Only negative is the really small shower.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars is not enough.. everything and I mean everything was PERFECT.. we will be back it’s a absolute given ..
thanks so much for sharing your corner of the world with us .."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful little cabin tucked away in the quiet! Can hear the steam in the bottom of the canyon during the night. Adorable place! They responded very quickly to any messages sent.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali's cabin was absolutely perfect! This is by far the best Airbnb I've stayed at. The property was quiet and peaceful. The cabin had everything my husband and I needed for our weekend getaway. It was 15 minutes from Glenwood Springs so it was nice to have a getaway from the other tourists. Absolutely incredible!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolutely lovely place to stay when visiting Glenwood Springs. It’s bigger than it looks in the photos and so well decorated and furnished. We were so comfortable and had everything we needed to cook a few meals as well.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this property was perfect. It has all the amenities you would want on top of being a great location. Communication with the host and locating the rental was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the cabin was amazing from location to amenities. Definitely check out the trail behind the cabin and the creek down below, both beautiful places right at your backdoor. Ali was super responsive with any questions and proactive in giving instructions ahead of time. 10/10 recommend to anyone staying and we will back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was a little hidden piece of heaven and Ali was amazing!!! So happy she shared it with us!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is a must if you’re looking to travel around Glenwood springs. Surrounding area was amazing! I plan to stay here again whenever I’m in the area!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a very great experience! Both my wife and I enjoyed our stay and the views from the cabin. Would highly recommend and would love to stay again in the future during a longer stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time at the cabin and we hope to be back! Everything is great! As someone else noted, the shower is extremely small and for us that is the only drawback—easily still a 5-star cabin. The location is gorgeous!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning views. Clean and cozy cabin. Close enough to town to go in for dinner, the cabin itself is secluded and peaceful. Perfect for stargazing, relaxing, and taking in the mountains. Would definitely visit again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nifty cabin in a neat location. Super comfy and well equipped! Incredible little steep but epic and quick hike out the back door.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I wanted to simply get away for a weekend and this was the perfect place. The view from the cabin was amazing, we were able to sit at the cabin and just relax. Definitely a perfect weekend getaway."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an absolutely beautiful location with such cute, cozy aesthetics inside. Very private and dramatic, beautiful scenery but still very close to Glenwood attractions. I can’t wait to come back here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin, great location, great views. Host was very clear about directions, rules, etc. Perfect mix of feeling secluded, but also a short drive from town. Would highly recommend to anybody looking for a weekend getaway. Only thing I would note to future guests is the shower is quite small, so it may feel a little crowded for anybody that is plus size and/or claustrophobic. Wonderful stay overall! Will definitely use again next time we are back in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and close to the hot springs!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy!! Great place
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Ali’s place. Peaceful cute & comfy.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This our third time staying here. We continue coming back because it's beautiful, peaceful, and has great hosts. Definitely recommend. See you guys next year!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was phenomenal. The view is the best part. There was some business going on just outside the cabin on a couple of days so it wasn't as secluded as it looked 100% of the time but this review stays at 5 stars because of how much we enjoyed the cabin and the decor/amenities inside. Great place for a couple.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you, Ali for sharing your beautiful space with us! Dream home material ☺️"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this little cabin for a one night, mid week retreat! The perfect size for two. We would absolutely stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is well worth the money!! If you are thinking of booking Ali’s place it is amazing! We are from California and nervous driving in the snow. They gave us an ATV the minute we felt uncomfortable. So cozy and beautiful. Best airbnb we’ve stayed in so far 💌💌💌

So peaceful. Ali kept in great communication as well. Extremely worth it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in January, this place was like a magical winter wonderland. If a snow globe came to life, this would be it.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible stay! The cabin was absolutely perfect. Secluded, quiet, clean, cozy, and just stunning. If you want a great Colorado mountain experience, this is the place to do it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! We were looking for comfort, privacy, and beautiful views, all of which we got at Chakra Cabin."

Always clean and cant beat the views.
This place is paradise."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The setting would be hard to find anywhere else.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a A very needed getaway
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a Cozy cabin and beautiful location! The sound of the creek was calming and the star gazing was amazing! Loved the attention to detail when it came to amenities. Great place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin. Warm in the winter and the views are amazing.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Words cannot express the beauty of the area around this cabin, nor the comfort and coziness of the cabin. Beautifully decorated and furnished and appointed with everything you could need, this space is a destination in itself. I only wish we’d had more time here! The hosts are easy to communicate with as well."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this cute cabin for a relaxing get away. It has all you need. Every detail has been thought through. It is close to anything you want to do in the area but far enough to feel like you are secluded. We appreciated the coffee and tea very much. We will be back in warmer months to enjoy the adorable back patio.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It is a cute little cabin that feels very isolated but is a short 10-min drive to downtown Glenwood Springs. It’s cozy, well-decorated, and had lots of little details to make our stay comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ali and her family had wonderful communication and were there when we had questions. The Airbnb was in a stunning, secluded location. The nearby hiking trail has some of the best views we’ve seen in this state and worth the visit alone."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. Ali's place was perfect. Great spot for hiking and only a few minutes away from Glenwood Springs. The cabin was clean and provided everything we needed during our stay. Would definitely stay again on our next adventure.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin, tucked away in its only little corner of the mountain range. Great stay if you're looking to spend some time in the Glenwood Springs area. The views are epic and the cabin is cozy."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic!!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's my second time to stay at Ali's place and loved it again! Last time visited during snowy winter time, this time got lucky and saw lots of colorful trees/foliage. Drove through McClure's pass (thanks Ali for the recommendation), it was epic - and there's a small town Paonia, CO that's worth visiting nearby. I drove back via Grand Junction (to not go back via the same road) and stopped over at Big B's Delicious Orchards (worth a visit too!).
Anyway, I hope stay at this place again next year!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s cabin is absolutely amazing. Inside is way bigger than in looks from outside. The custom details are very cool. Like the breakfast bar and antique farm sink. Just so cool. Everything you will need is there. And the quality! Nice knives to work with! Nice & clean cookware. The small details really set this place off into a category all its own. I was only disappointed that I did not stay longer. But I will be back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love this space. Everything was perfect. The lighting options were lovely. The bed was like heaven. The views are amazing from any window.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, cozy and super clean"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute cabin. You can hear the nearby creek. Only spent one night, so not much time to really get to know the area. Hosts very responsive. I would stay there again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ali’s place is great! There’s a fantastic trail in the backyard, too. It’s pretty much straight up the side of the hill, so be prepared to scramble a bit 😄"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was a dream! Could not have imagined a better trip and a better cabin. Definitely recommending to friends and will return if we come back to the area!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Chacra cabin was just as described and was very comfortable for two. We loved the back porch with the lights on and then enjoyed star gazing with the lights off as it is quite dark. You won't be disappointed to stay here if you want a mountain get-away.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful views and location. Private and cozy!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great stay! Had everything we wanted and more.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can't recommend this cabin highly enough! A perfect cozy little spot nestled into the mountainside. We enjoyed hiking up the private trail in the back and getting cozy on the couch and in the kitchen. A great spot for a weekend getaway!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very scenic location! Clean and manageable space with a comfortable bed. Would stay here again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cutest most peaceful places I’ve ever stayed at through Airbnb, and I’ve stayed at many. Don’t let the outside appearance deceive you, the interior is very spacious and laid out. It is a perfect cabin for a couple. It’s quiet, peaceful, and serene The Decour is perfect. You cannot beat the views and scenery. The little rabbits in the front yard, the eagles flying above, the crickets at night add to the ambience. It all made for a very relaxing getaway trip. Glenwood Springs is a short drive away."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot imagine a more perfect cabin to rent, this place had everything! We felt at home immediately and wished we had rented it for two nights! The thing we enjoyed the most was the dark skies and seeing the Milky Way!!! The host has attended to every detail, there’s lots to look at and it’s very calming and comfortable in every way! We appreciated the washer and dryer, large windows that open, a beautiful throw blanket, furry rug and all the heaters and the gas fireplace. There’s a little lawn, big driveway, nice couch, back porch, scenery galore and a big kitchen! My love proposed to me on a hike behind the cabin and I said yes!!!❤️❤️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we had an amazing night even if it was just one we're definitely coming back for longer amazing stay to be secluded
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For such a secluded location, check in was a breeze with very clear instructions.
The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in in an Airbnb. It is also very dark for good sleeping. But I'd recommend a middle-of-the-night stargazing session.
Kitchen was well-equipped, water pressure and temps were good. Cute, unique decor. I appreciated a lot of the food related stuff like MFK Fisher!
Truly a unique and beautiful experience."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most beautiful little cabin, so homey and comfortable and on a great piece of property. We had a blast drinking wine outside under a billion stars!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying in this beautiful cabin. The views were spectacular, and you could not see a home out of any window. We felt we were in the middle of the mountains in a cute little cabin. If you like to Hike, go to Hanging Lake. It's about 20 minutes down the canyon, and it was one of the best hikes I've ever taken. You need to make reservations for parking."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this cozy little cabin. The bed was very comfortable. Since we were in the middle of our vacation it was nice having a washer and dryer available.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Chacra cabin is a magical spot. Far enough to get away from the hustle bustle of everything and unwind. I was able to do some good photography right from the front door. It's rare to feel one with nature and this spot you do!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful! Using the private trail was a great adventure and loved that no one else was on the trail with us.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s place was great! It was clean and it’s a great location that’s quiet but also not too far from town. Definitely would stay there again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful cozy little cabin right in the middle of a breathtaking location!! We had a wonderful 5-day 4-night 25th anniversary trip!! Highly recommend!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great get-a-way spot. Ali was very good at communicating and the accommodations were fantastic. Serenity and space to rest was what we were looking for and it was every bit of that.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is a work of art full of little details which made for the perfect setting for our spiritual retreat ❤️ the creek was great to take a stroll and we climbed the hiking train that led to stunning views.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As the reviews before all share- this is a wonderfully serene and secluded cabin.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Ali’s cabin! It was charming, cozy, and made us feel very at home! Ali provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay from Keurig coffee pods to shampoo and conditioner to plenty of towels. The kitchen is well stocked as well! The bed was extremely comfortable and it felt like we were laying on a cloud! The property is gorgeous and very quiet which we appreciated. We enjoyed taking a hike up the trail behind the cabin. The location is also a very quick drive to downtown Glenwood Springs! If you’re looking for a place to stay, look no further!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay this weekend! It was our second time at the cabin and this time we brought our baby. Bonus points for having a pack and play available for guest use! FYI there’s a curtain and no door between the bedroom and living space, but that just meant my husband and I got to enjoy chatting outside under the stars after the baby went to bed. Loved it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was just lovely and had everything as stated in the description. The setting is very peaceful. The bed is very comfortable!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s place was great! It’s nicely tucked away and quiet with the sound of the creek below running its way to the river. The surroundings are awesome with views over the mountains across the way as well. The drive there takes you on a great road for views while driving through the canyon. Would totally recommend.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin was absolutely lovely. The location is gorgeous and we were able to take a small hike on the trail behind the cabin that is very beautiful. 10/10 would recommend for a weekend getaway.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was clean and cozy with very comfortable furniture. We had a wonderful stay here!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our weekend at Ali’s cabin! Waking up to see the mountains and beautiful skies was just so lovely. The cabin itself is well equipped with basically everything you could need. I loved the decor and the plants too! And we definitely found ourselves sinking into the super comfy couch to watch TV each night.
Location-wise, we had no trouble finding the place with the helpful information provided by Ali, and it was super close to downtown Glenwood Springs for restaurants, hiking trailheads, and the hot springs of course.
My only *tiny* complaint was that the AC unit struggled to keep up in the 95 degree temps, but hello it was a heatwave!! And it did not detract from my enjoyment. We ended up turning off the AC and letting the cool breeze come in thru the bedroom window since the temps dropped quite a lot at night!
Would 100% return back and recommend to others."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Chacra Cabin is a piece of heaven and I am grateful I discovered it and was able to stay there for a week while I explored part of Colorado.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at Ali’s place was absolutely perfect from start to finish! The place was so beautifully decorated and completely spotless. It has such a cozy homey vibe, it’s kind of my ideal home. It’s also super close to Glenwood yet out of town so you feel like you are in a secluded cabin up in the mountains. Ali was very responsive anytime we needed anything and her father was even there when we arrived and was so nice. All in all it was the absolute perfect stay! Will definitely be my place going forward whenever I’m in Glenwood!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want perfection and a little piece of heaven this is it just beautiful definitely worth every penny ❤
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ali’s cabin exceeded our expectations and we hope to stay again soon. We’ve spent many weekends in Glenwood Springs before and usually stay downtown, but this cabin was a refreshing change and exactly what we needed to get away and be immersed in nature. Check-in and checkout was really easy, and communication with Ali was great and timely. I highly recommend staying at least 2 nights to fully appreciate all that the cabin has to offer."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love this cabin! Close enough to downtown Glenwood but far enough away to feel remote. Ali and her dad were very accommodating and the cabin had everything you need. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome stay!!

Overall they were so awesome and the views and stay were perfect!! Highly recommend

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Camille was so amazing and communicated so well with me.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The RV was a very nice place to stay for a couple days. It was clean and modern. The host was very nice and accommodating. We loved being around other dogs, cats and some pigs because we are animal people ourselves. Even with a RV style kitchen i was able to make dinner every night and they had everything you need! The only little down sides is the hot water is very very limited (I know it says that in the listing but only last about 5 minutes) and it is not as secluded as it seemed from the listing, you are surrounded by houses. BUT with saying that, it is still definitely worth the stay and the price because the view is breath taking and you can keep private if you want."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved this so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I've never had a better customer service experience ever! I look forward to another chance to stay here!!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location - easy commute to all the hotsprings & ski resorts specially sunlight ski resort. We loved our 5 days stay. Camille is very responsive and great host. She decorated the space with Birthday banner for my husband and welcomed us with marshmallows. She also gave us a tour of her farm and introduced us to her animals.
Stay is very comfortable- the converted trailer luxurious Airbnb is so spacious- ample space for two people. The view is so gorgeous and rural paradise. I fell in love with the cat Tiffy, she was there with us throughout the stay.
We had just one hiccup, Camille is very particular about the checkout time so be sure to checkout at sharp 10 am or she will charge extra even for 30 to 40 mins delay.
I would definitely come here again, and whoever is concerned with safety- should not worry. Very safe even for single women travelers."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a blast at Camille’s place! I really appreciated the birthday decorations :)

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Camille's was fantastic. The place was spotless and the kitchen fully stocked. The camper is parked on an open farmland with beautiful views all around. Camille went above and beyond to accommodate our needs by rearranging our reservation due to a last minute cancellation. We would definitely recommend this place and plan to visit again.

Lots of extra touches that made it a very special, comfortable stay. The host was extremely responsive and provided great service. Little tricky to find, but the directions were very helpful and clear. Highly recommend and would love to go back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Camille’s stay was a breath of fresh air (literally). Make sure to cut some Colter Wall on while on a morning drive to Silt or Rifle for some local coffee, and bring a book to read while you gaze out at the beautiful mountains and fully immerse yourself into the west! Camille herself was a wonderful host and gave very informative directions as well as check in instructions to create a smooth check in experience. Everything was very clean and we really appreciate the added thoughtfulness with her touch of Christmas cheer! Camille was very kind and responsive, my girlfriend and I loved the coziness of our stay. She was also very accommodating for our pup! We Would 100% stay again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This RV get-away was a great way for me and my girlfriend to spend time together and spend the holiday season up in Silt to be at the Glennwood Hot Springs. Camille and Grant are fantastic hosts, with a clean and beautiful stay. It was so kind of them to leave us some s’mores to make, and show us their pigs!
Thank you so much Camille and Grant! Happy Holidays!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Camille's hideaway was amazing! My boyfriend and I went up for the night and had an incredible time.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Camille’s place is perfect! We really love the stillness of the location and how everything is very clean. A great getaway to indulge yourself in Colorado’s beautiful mountains. The RV itself is also pretty spacious for our groups of 5 people. Everything we need is provided. Would stay again and recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing experience!! My girlfriend and I spent thanksgiving together here. The location is great! Definitely visit the rifle fall, about 30 minutes drive. It also 30 mins away from Glenwood Springs if you are planning on spending your time at the hot springs. The RV is very spacious but cozy for two people. We were so lucky and happy to visit host’s piggies farm and pet them!! Camille was so nice, she would check in with us periodically and was very sweet and thoughtful! Don’t hesitate, book it now!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's wonderful to stay in a rural setting that is peaceful, quiet and secure. Camille's RV is very comfortable with all the amenities you'd find in a house.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute little camper nestled in a quiet, rural neighborhood. The camper was very nice and clean. It is small but has all the essentials. The fire pit on the patio was great, and there are cute pigs close by. Camille was very responsive and kind. Would recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in my fair share of Airbnbs and Camille has hands down been the best host. Her property was beautiful, she responded to questions I had no matter the time. The camper was extremely clean and had all the small amenities that we could’ve though of. Definitely will be booking again with her!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Camille’s place was a nice, secluded place. It was a nice getaway for us city life girls. Very relaxing and perfect for us and our two little dogs. We travel to Glenwood area at least once a year, but like to stay in Silt. Went to our favorite pizza place (Burning Mountain) the first night. We waited until the last day to see the piglets and it was perfect because 3 were born within the hour of us seeing them; so adorable! Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a must stay. Not only is it peaceful with beautiful surroundings but Camille made us feel right at home. She even hung a birthday sign for my girlfriend to surprise her. Loved everything about it
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Camille and Grant were awesome hosts. They were friendly, easy to converse with, responsive, and provided useful information about the area. The RV was a new experience for an Airbnb but it was so enjoyable! The RV was modern, clean and contained everything we needed for a best friend weekend getaway. It was private and quiet and we could see a million stars in the sky! We even got to meet and hold their baby piggies! We highly recommend Harrison's Hideaway and will be back! Thank you Camille and Grant!
Joan and Karole"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can’t say enough great things about this Airbnb! We have stayed in a few different places and this is by far our favorite! Camille and Grant are so amazing. We loved every moment. The pigs were such a great highlight! My son won’t stop talking about them 😊. Highly recommend! And we will definitely be staying again in the future
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Camille was the most kind and helpful. Not only was the RV awesome, but she also let us meet her piglets on the property. A highlight for my kids! Many recommendations for activities and food. Overall the best!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is so great! Very well put together. It’s got a beautiful view and Camille’s pigs are fun to watch. My boys also loved the indoor s’mores they provided. It’s was super clean and very well organized. We loved the Burning Mountain pizza and sub restaurant in Silt. Definitely recommend!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I do RV camping a lot late spring to end of September so it was fun to find a RV near Glenwood Springs,CO
We felt right at home. I would highly recommend and we WILL be back! Thanks Camille."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute camper! Really nice amenities and a kind responsive host! Only warning - this is a camper in a remote area so expect some bugs, we had flies and ants come visit during our stay as well as some nighttime sounds from the surrounding animals. As long as you’re prepared and expecting that, a very nice stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So much nicer than staying at a hotel during a cross-country trip. Being on a private, rural property, we felt way more comfortable leaving our carload full of stuff in the parking spot right below the RV, than we would have in a hotel parking lot. The peace and quiet, fire pit, and starry night sky created a very relaxing atmosphere after a long day of driving. Everything inside the RV was not only very clean and comfortable, but also aesthetically pleasing, including the electric fireplace at night, and the views of the hills from the windows in the morning. After a good night’s sleep, Camille and her husband took us out to meet all the pigs. That was a lot of fun and a nice way to start the day before another long stretch on the road. I highly recommend staying here, especially if you can stay long enough to enjoy a relaxing evening and morning."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you wanna try camper stay, this is the best option for you. I feel like I stayed at a hotel. This is one of the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. If you have chance to stay here, go grab this."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Camille’s place is a gem! Out in the beautiful country side of CO, not too far from Glenwood Springs, Basalt, Aspen. Camille is a wonderful host, incredibly responsive and accommodating! We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for our day at Glenwood Springs Adventure Park and hot springs.. right by a lake for an extra swim, farm sounds and dark skies full of stars. Thanks again, Camille!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay and the kids loved feeling like they were “camping” but with all the amazing amenities. We felt at home and enjoyed the beautiful interior as well as the breathtaking views. We would love to come back again!

Close drive to Harvey Gap Lake, and 20 min from Rifle Falls, Ironwood Hot Springs. and Glenwood Springs for dinner and fun. Camille, the host, was so welcoming and sweet. She was happy to show us her chickens and let us feed her piglets.
We hope to be back again!!"

The RV was clean, comfortable and well-equipped with everything we needed for a cozy getaway. The smores were a nice touch. Camille was incredibly friendly and helpful, making the experience even better. And don't even get me started on the piglets!! They were beyond adorable and we had such a wonderful time getting a tour of the farm and getting to meet the animals. We would highly recommend this RV."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, new, cozy, clean RV trailer with privacy and a beautiful view of the mountains that is only walking distance away."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was exactly what we needed. My husband and I needed a reset before a busy end is the year and Camille helped make that possible. It was quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed waking up to hearing roosters on nearby farms. We were able to meet newly born piglets on her property as well. Very close to both Rifle Falls and Harvey Gap. We’d love to go back and stay. Camille provided all the little things that help make our stay an A+.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Camille's space was lovely! I was just passing through so I didn't have the pleasure of staying long, but this RV is spacious, clean & has lots of accommodations and fixin's that you'd need! I love the interior design of the RV-- everything is roomy and cute! It's also very quiet being out in the country, which is always an added plus. I was lucky enough to be able to visit the newborn piglets they have too! Camille was very kind & communicative. Definitely come stay here if you find yourself passing through. Thank you so much!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are new to glamping then I highly recommend you try staying in this RV! The Rv is located on beautiful farm land with lots of cute animals nearby. The hosts are super friendly and were very accommodating to our last minute change we had to make in our reservation. On the property they have pigs, chickens, and dogs which my kids got to pet. It was really nice to sit on the porch and look at the stars at nighttime. If you stay here go check out Harvey Gap state park. The lake was very beautiful and my little ones enjoyed playing in the water."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place! Really enjoyed our time there first time in an RV and didn’t event feel like an rv was awesome
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Beautiful place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hideaway was amazing and had absolutely stunning views! Camille was super responsive and very kind. If we had more time we would stay longer! But, we do hope to come back. The place was clean and everything was labeled which was very appreciated. Our sweet baby boy had a blast."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our 3 nights we spent in the Little Hideaway were very comfortable, peaceful, clean, fun and welcoming. The hosts were very friendly and personable. Good people. Great hospitality. I didnt have to pack all of the things we usually do, because they already had it there! I have 2 children under 4 and the RV was safe for them and allowed plenty of room for the whole family to sleep safely and comfortably, they also had toys and books for the kids to play with and eating and drinking dishes for our little humans to use! :-) You cant beat the price. You cant beat the location. Most of all, you cant beat the confort of knowing that your family is safe and enjoying themselves. They had great recommendations for fun things to go do with our kids, and we enjoyed them all! Including meeting and feeding their family of piggies and their pups! It was just an all around great time and we hope to stay again in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is an amazing RV. So clean and modern. We really like the farms around this RV. Camile and her husband were always at the top of things and response very fast. They can show you their farms and animals. My kids also really liked the place. If you want to come to this area, you have to reserve Camille’s RV."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, 2 young boys, and I really enjoyed our stay at Harrison’s Hideaway. It was our first time staying in a travel trailer and it left us wanting to buy one in the near future! Camille was a great host who was very responsive and invested in making sure her guests have a great time. We got to pet the pigs in the pen nearby, cook s’mores indoors (provided by Camille ❤️), and sit on the deck watching the sunset and stars. The rv was facing east for our stay and gave a great view for sunset glow on the ridges. Harvey Gap lake was very close so we stopped by and had a swim as well. We could’ve left the majority of our supplies back at home too because this RV was stocked with everything, including a large water dispenser. If you’re looking for somewhere unique to get away from the daily grind I can’t recommend Harrison’s Hideaway enough! We hope to stay again if we are ever in the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely location, wild turkeys in the backyard! very clean"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great gem in walking distance of downtown Glenwood Springs. This place offers both privacy and comfort. Sonja was great about her communication throughout the whole process, making check-in a breeze. This place was perfect for everything we needed. We loved the ability to stroll to the path by the river, or into town for a bite to eat and a drink. Sonja left some great tips about places to go while we were in town. Not to mention some farm fresh eggs were waiting for us! Would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean and well cared for. Sonja is very proactive and responsive with her communication. If you read through the description, you’ll see that this is a basement of a family home so you will hear footsteps above. The host provided earplugs and a box fan to dampen the sound. If you’re very sensitive to noise then this probably isn’t the place for you. Also the bed is quite firm. If you need a softer mattress then I’d keep that in mind."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at the Red Mountain Getaway was perfect! The place was clean and decorated nicely. The backyard was beautiful and fun to spend time in shooting hoops. Just around the corner from the house there is a whole trail system for biking/hiking. And the hosts were wonderful, my husband lost his wedding ring in the backyard and they were so quick to help us look for it and connect us with another local with a metal detector who helped us find it. Great place, great hosts, great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in a quiet neighborhood right next to a hiking trail. We were close to downtown and everything we could have needed was in the unit. It’s a place where the host goes the extra step to ensure a great stay with the comforts of home.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Walkable to restaurants and hiking trails. Just as advertised
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja's place is very clean, sunny, peaceful and home-y. The king sized bed & quality pillows are extremely comfortable. Everything is tasteful and lovely with some fresh eggs waiting for us to boot! She has a 3 ring binder with ALL the local activities and sights. I wish EVERY Air B&B host was this prepared, thorough and hospitable. HIGHLY recommend!
We didn't enjoy the new overcrowded Iron Hot springs pools (""Disney Springs"") at least this time of year.... The local SPLENDOR MOUNTAIN SPA was great. So many hikes, great food and walking the creek path was delightful.
We'll be back for sure... thanks again Sonja for such a special stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice basement apartment. Was just what we needed for our fishing trip.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute space, perfect for 2 people. Private entrance around the back and dedicated parking for one vehicle. Bed was comfortable and shower hot.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja’s place is cute, tidy, and very well represented by her listing. She was an extremely helpful and responsive host (I had a question early into our stay and it took her minutes to respond) who offered a comprehensive binder of recommendations and info on the area. The best part of all was the complimentary eggs, fresh from her chickens who could be seen from the airbnb! Thanks, Sonja!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja is super helpful, proactively communicative, and flexible. The location is great - walkable neighborhood, a trail a few minutes away, close to the hot springs and downtown. We had everything we needed . Loved the shower stall and the shower itself. The neighborhood is quiet and nestles against a mountainside with great views of the city and the surrounding mountains. Try Slope and Hatch for great tacos at a reasonable price in a cool old building with exposed brick walls.
If you're a light sleeper, use the earplugs that are provided, as you'll hear noise from above in the morning. Sonja warned us and it was not a deterrent for us. We had a great time and appreciated all her help."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really great stay. Easy parking on snowy days. The washer and dryer were fast, accessible, and really helpful especially for ski gear.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great apt. Easy to find and the apt was very comfortable. The bed was almost as soft as our own bed. The amenities were what was posted on the site and Sonja even left fresh eggs for us. I would recommend this and I hope next time we come back to area we can stay here.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying here. Had everything we needed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sonja's place is a perfect getaway. It's very private with a great view.

We did quite a bit of cooking and the kitchen has everything we needed which is nice. They warned about the noise in the morning and do provide earplugs and a white noise machine, wasn’t a problem for us but definitely do hear it. Very accurate description, responsive host and clear instructions for parking and getting in!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the whole setup! The finished basement apartment was really nicely done and had everything that was needed. It was cozy, warm and comfortable. It was close to town and the bike path and great restaurants. We enjoyed the chickens in the backyard and the fresh eggs! The hosts let us put our bikes in the garage for storage between rides and we really appreciated that. Would love to stay there again-highly recommend this rental! 😁"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay in Glenwood at Sonja’s guest house. It was incredibly peaceful and the backyard was large and spacious for our toddler to run around. It was close to downtown and to the hot springs. The hosts were helpful and responsive and gave great recommendations. We wished we would’ve stayed even longer!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! Beautiful surroundings, comfortable bed, and the kids loved the swing set in the yard. Very responsive and had good recommendations of things to do nearby."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for our little family. Our son loved the play structure and Sonja’s mom let him help feed the chickens! Sonja messaged to offer a pack-n-play for our daughter, and just to make sure we knew we could message with any questions at all. The pull-out mattress in the sofa was actually quite comfortable, and downtown was only about a 4-minute drive from Sonja’s place. Highly recommend and will likely be back!"

Thank you Sonja! Everything was ABSOLUTELY perfect!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay. The couch and bed was super cozy. The place was clean. It was everything we needed and more.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the Red Mountain Getaway. Had great fun riding the bike trails. Easy access to walk into town for breakfast or dinner.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This spot was perfect!!! The Airbnb was easy to find and very clean upon arrival. Check in was seamless with the lockbox. Location was walking distance to all the fun downtown ~20 mins. We were in town for a wedding and it was just what we needed! Thank you Sonja!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect my son and I to stay while we did day trips in the valley. Very clean and well appointed.

2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja was a very communicative host and the apartment was cute! We liked the location a lot. However, we could hear every footstep in the upstairs apartment, which didn't make for as relaxing of a stay as we hoped."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend the Red Mountain Getaway if you’re staying in Glenwood Springs! This place had all the great basics but it was really the details that set it apart — fresh eggs from their chickens, a detailed handbook with food, shopping, and outdoor activity recommendations, and a stocked kitchen and lots of storage. The wifi was great for working remotely and the bed was super comfy."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our weekend at Sonja’s place! The apartment is just a quick drive or nice walk to downtown Glenwood Springs. Sonja provides a really nice guide with great recommendations on where to eat and what to see. The space itself was clean and had all the amenities in the restroom and kitchen we could need. We loved the selection of board games and that there was a TV in the living room too. Sonja’s great about giving guests a heads up that they may hear some foot traffic from above. Maybe we’re heavy sleepers, but we didn’t hear any noise in the early mornings or evenings. Already planning to come back the next time we head to Glenwood Springs!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is exactly as advertised. Lovely, exceptionally clean apartment about a 20 minute leisurely walk downtown. The owners are accommodating and had everything ready for us when we arrived, including a pitcher of ice water. The kitchen had all you might want for a longer stay, the living and dining areas were great for conversation."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our Red Mountain Getaway. Private with a great location. Very cozy and clean. Will need to be back .
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that you don't want people to know about. One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. Great location, able to walk downtown for dinner and drinks, clean and well designed space with great views. I'm always a little weirded out by apartments with the owners on site but this was easy, private and the foot steps above us was no big deal at all. I've visited Glenwood at least a dozen times and always stayed in hotels but all the conveniences and space in the airbnb makes a great home away from home. I 'll stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful relaxing stay here. Great views, quiet, and very nice host and family. Very responsive to any requests/needs. Very clean and comfortable unit. Would definitely come again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We were very comfortable and it’s in a great location. We met the owner and it was nice to talk to her. They mentioned we might hear footsteps from above but we weren’t bothered by that at all. The air conditioner and sleep machine muffled the noise. So don’t let that keep you from renting this great property! Sonja has thought of everything to make your stay wonderful!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Restful and beautiful accommodations!
I loved the fresh eggs from their own chickens! Very clean and well equipped."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment! Sonja adds a lot of niceties such as fresh eggs from their chickens! Filtered water in the fridge. Bath gel, shampoo, conditioner, ear plugs. Close to the main area of town but still you still feel like you’re in your mountain hideaway. Great hosts!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will feel like you are at home, everything you might need is available there !"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm so glad I decided to stay here instead of a hotel, this is all around a fantastic place to stay! The location is perfect, very close to downtown and Hwy 82 & I-70. The space was all very clean and welcoming. The bathroom is newly remodeled and the shower is the best. Also I never realized how much better fresh eggs are until Sonja left us some from their hens! I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect home base for our adventures around Glenwood Springs. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere—there’s a cute trail close by that zips you right into the center of town! Place was exactly as described. The chickens are so cute!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such an awesome place to stay. Sonja communicated clearly, and the space was exactly as described. Everything is clean, cozy, and comfortable. The Red Mountain Getaway was conveniently located to numerous sites and hiking spots in Glenwood Springs while only a short drive to Carbondale and Basalt. In an hour, you can also be in Aspen. The chickens were an added bonus. They were very polite, LOL! Sonja clearly states that they are early risers and we would hear them in their home above the BnB, but it was way quieter than a busy hotel with kids running up and down hallways to the pool. For noise sensitive guests, Sonja provides earplugs and a white noise machine! Can't beat that! We absolutely loved our stay and would happily stay there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience staying here for 2 nights. The place was very clean and very well maintained. Location is really good and everything is nearby. Highly recommend staying here.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja is a terrific host, the view from the patio is gorgeous with coffee in the AM or a nitecap in the PM. The bed is very comfortable & the walk in shower is huge and has a soap dispensary that is a very nice touch. She provides all of the supplies to make coffee to your liking, including the beans & grinder! Can’t forget about the complimentary free range eggs provided. She also has many suggestions on things to do in the area. We will definitely stay here again when in town!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a marvelous time at Red Mountain. The Airbnb is well appointed and the solid interior design made everything feel easy - we made excellent meals in the kitchen, set lovely tables, watched the Oscars on a great Roku TV, found hikes in their guidebook and got extra suggestions from our hosts directly, the bed was so comfortable, we slept really well, the light inside is really nice from the multi directional windows, the view of the mountain across the yard and river is superb, and it’s quiet from outside traffic. The location was 5 min from everything. Sonja was an excellent host and she answered all my questions during the stay quickly and with great generosity. Finally, we were delighted to receive fresh eggs from the chickens in her yard. What more could we ask for? It was really fantastic."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful airbnb. So much thought and detail went into the space. I highly recommend this place.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall an amazing stay. Would definitely return! Clean and perfect!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot near downtown Glenwood. Super quiet expect for a bit of rustling around in the morning - which you let us know about ahead of time. Not a big deal for us. A great place to use as a base for Glenwood Springs adventures or to just hole up for the day. Will stay there again on our next visit. Thanks again Sonja!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect stay. The apartment is so inviting. The view was beautiful. Not far from town at all. Highly recommend!!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sonja’s Red Mountain Getaway is a lovely apartment in a very pretty part of Glenwood Springs. It is quiet and peaceful with a tree lined walkway in and view of the large back yard. You wouldn’t know you were that close to the center of town. The apartment is beautifully appointed and the bed really comfortable. You couldn’t ask any more from a host! We would definitely stay there again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place within a few minutes walk to downtown. Hosts are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great step up from the hotels in GSC because of the kitchenette and living room. It is about a twenty minute walk from City center so be aware of that if you're traveling by train! Sonja left us some fresh eggs from her cute chickens and was a very kind and responsive host. We also saw a beautiful deer hanging out in the backyard! This unit is above their home so just be aware of that when booking.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place and short 10 min. walk to central Glenwood Springs, the hot springs, and train station. The Hosts were exceptional. Because you are in the lower floor you may occasionally hear some footsteps - but didn't bother me at all. Very private and very clean and comfortable."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja’s place was absolutely perfect for my friend and I’s long weekend stay. It’s walking distance to downtown and in the most convenient location.

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and easy to find. Sonja is very easy to communicate with. Not a great place for quiet but definitely didn't bother me. If you like to be close to town she has a wonderful place to stay. I'd definitely stay there again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chickens and fresh eggs. Pick up some butter, bread and sausage or bacon to go with your fresh eggs. Deer walking by in the morning. I was sold on the view from the patio and was not disappointed. Hard to imagine getting to live here everyday. Our second Airbnb and we will be staying with Airbnb locations for our travels. Just a few minutes from downtown. Great restaurants Lucy's and Smokes are both recommended by me. We had a great time."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sonja’s please was great! It’s a huge basement, a big kitchen with lots of appliances and a very comfortable bedroom! We had a great time. It’s located very close from downtown Glenwood Springs in a relaxing neighborhood. I recommend the place and would stay there again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and enjoyable apartment. The view is beautiful, the location is perfect (less than 15min walk to downtown), the apartment was clean and thoughtfully furnished, and the perfect size for us. Sonja spent a lot of time making personalized recommendations when asked, and the binder in the Airbnb had so much useful information in it. Will 100% stay here again on a future trip to glenwood."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely apt for two that is cozy, efficient and has a wonderful view. It is so close to main downtown and walking is a breeze. Sonja is quick to respond to questions and cares about what your needs are. We would definitely recommend staying here."

The chickens were surprisingly friendly and entertaining (and the eggs a treat)! The option to drop off luggage before check-in was much appreciated."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are traveling to visit the hot springs, Sonja’s Red Mountain Getaway is the perfect place. It is minutes both to the hot springs and the charming downtown of Glenwood Springs. The apartment is cozy and with a full kitchen makes it easy to eat in if desired. The bed is comfortable and the water pressure in the shower is awesome. As if all of this isn’t enough, Sonja is an incredible host who has thought of everything you might need for your stay—including extra towels for the hot springs. We highly recommend staying here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja's place was great and worked well for our stay - close to town and the hot springs, very clean, everything was as advertised. Very comfortable stay for us, they even provided coffee and a french press, and they havre chickens in the backyard! So they shared their fresh eggs with us. A very good value, we'll be back!
Ray and Kris"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good jumping off point for Glenwood Springs area. The apartment is below a single family home, so it is mildly private. You can walk to the restaurants, and it is close to a park by the river. Fun chickens in the backyard and some fresh eggs in the fridge. The kitchen is usable with all the needed tools."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place for a quiet getaway! love the chickens!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best stay at Sonja’s place! It was cozy, clean and such a beautiful view from the little private patio. We also Loved all the chickens in the yard…So much fun watching them every day and also got to eat some fresh eggs! The bed was huge and comfortable and there were all the basics and everything you would need for cooking provided which was really nice. The location really could not get any better. We brought our bikes with us and just biked or walked everywhere. It was within 1 mile of everything you can do downtown, including the hot springs. Also being so close to the river was awesome. We loved walking down to where the two rivers meet and enjoying the water and watching all the rafters. All in all it was a great stay and we highly recommend it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is excellent and the hosts very friendly. Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja’s place is perfect for a relaxing getaway and is just a 10 minute walk away from the Main Street in town. The air bnb is super cute and homey, and Sonja added little things like complimentary coffee, shower toilet trees, and an extensive binder of cool things to do around Glenwood Springs. This is a great spot to work from home, explore around town, or just sit and enjoy the views of the Red Mountains. Thank you, Sonja!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great getaway location central to everything in Glenwood Springs. We loved the rustic feel of having chickens in the yard. Wverything was very spacious, immaculate and the amenities were great."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful room. Quiet neighborhood. Right next to a mountain bike trail. Really close to all the attractions we had planned for and stores and restaurants we wanted to eat at! My girlfriend booked it for us and we were not expecting chickens in the yard but they did leave some fresh eggs in the fridge for us when we got there. Convenient check in. Nice little guide book for planning ideas and what to do in town. We enjoyed our stay and slept comfortably in the super clean room. Living space and all essentials in the kitchen. Way better than a hotel room for sure.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"simple complete accommodations, both convenient for playing in the many local sites or cozy up indoors to get some work done"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The apartment has everything you need. The king-sized bed was comfortable and the linens were nice. So many small things were provided that made our stay easier (coffee, beach towels, sunscreen, first aid, ear plugs, etc...). They have a flock of backyard chickens that come right up to the windows and we loved that!
It's only about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown where there are lots of restaurants, which is great. There's a good, challenging hiking/mountain bike path trailhead around the corner, which we made use of.
As stated in the listing, this is under part of their home, so you will hear noises from time to time. It didn't bother us at all. Also, there is a sloped gravel walkway to the apartment, so if you have mobility issues, you may want to check with Sonja about accommodations to help you reach the apartment."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent. Book it!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja’s place was exactly as described, very comfortable and a great place to stay in Glenwood Springs. Easy walk to downtown for coffee, food, and drinks!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best places I’ve booked with Airbnb & I’ve booked a lot of places! The living space is wonderful. It’s basically a well appointed apartment with mountain views for the price of a hotel room. I will definitely be back!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the Red Mountain Getaway. It is located near all the attractions yet in a quiet neighborhood. The place was very clean and the bed and pillows comfortable. Although there was no air conditioner she provided a big fan for us. We lost one of our credit cards and looked everywhere for it. We almost cancelled it when we got an email from Sonja saying her cleaning lady had found the card and she would mail it to us. Not many people would be that honest but Sonja was and we greatly appreciated her kindness. We will be back to visit the Red Mountain getaway in the future.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, comfortable bed, great location. Quick and easy communication with the host."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-located property in a quiet rustic neighborhood at the foot of a mountain. Guests are a block or two from a few of the many hiking trails in the area. Spacious, well-stocked. clean, and comfortable appointments. A very accommodating host."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Sonja’s apartment. It was very clean. It’s walkable to the downtown but in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment is on the lower level, but being the downstairs residents didn’t bother us. While the place has no AC, we were comfortable day and night in the apartment despite the 90 degree days. We enjoyed the laying hens coming to visit us!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at Sonja’s place with my husband and 9-month-old daughter while vacationing in Glenwood Springs for a few days. We loved our stay! Sonja and her family are gracious hosts, and their home has the most spectacular view. The home is also very conveniently located for adventuring around GWS. We went to the hot springs, rode the gondola, and visited some breweries in town - all within a five min drive or 20 min walk. The space was clean, well-stocked w/ cooking necessities, and so comfortable. We loved the king-sized bed, and the games/puzzle selection. The shower/tub water pressure was an extra bonus!"

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja was very kind and understanding. We stayed here on our honeymoon and she left us flowers. When we had some activity scheduling issues, she was understanding although she wasn't able to accommodate us extending our stay. Thank you! :)"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja's place was absolutely perfect for our family's stay in Glenwood Springs. It was incredibly clean and had so many thoughtful and tasteful touches. The location is great, as it is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood yet very close to all the things in town. The yard is lovely, with a pretty view and so much for our two small kiddos to enjoy. Chickens were such a fun bonus too! The communication with the hosts was excellent, and they both went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Overall we loved it and would definitely stay again when we are in the area."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja & Jeff are terrific hosts. Their garden level apartment is charming, clean & well equipped. Location is fabulous. The trailhead up Red Mountain is steps away & town is reachable on foot to avoid the hassles of parking. We would definitely return"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is perfect! It’s reasonable walk to town, yet very private. The trailhead up Red Mountain is only feet away. Sonja & Jeff are amazing hosts! Their garden apartment is immaculately clean & way cozier than the pictures. They live upstairs, so you do hear some footsteps. But we didn’t the sound obtrusive or disturbing. And they are ready to do anything to help."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Red Mountain Getaway was a cute place to stay in Glenwood Springs. Spacious and within walking distance to downtown. The entrance is a narrow inclined gravel path.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sonja’s space was so lovely and perfect for us as we were working remote while making our way out to Utah!

The drive from the airport was easy and beautiful with views full of snow filled mountain tops. The residence had a beautiful small creek right on the side of the unit and gave such beautiful music in the nighttime. 10/10 highly recommend !! Thank you all for our stay !

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even though we only stay there for 1 night, it was still an experience, its very peaceful and we had an amazing night sleep. The location is beautiful."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I didn't read the listing well and didn't realize it was a guest suite until I showed up. Despite that, I do feel that the hosts did their best to give us our privacy during our stay.
The creek was really nice to be next to since you could just walk outside and listen to the sound of the water and enjoy being somewhat secluded.
The suite had everything the hosts said it would and the hosts were super responsive and willing to help!
The only thing I saw as a negative was the cobwebs inside the suite. With it being by a creek, there are bound to be bugs. But, there were a few cobwebs in the windows that could have been dusted.
The shower/tub situation was a bit uncomfortable. The tub was rather tall so your head would basically touch the shower head. I'm only 5 feet and I was pretty close to the shower head. I'm sure if you're taller, it could be a little tight. But the water was warm and had great pressure.
Overall, our stay was nice and I would recommend it to someone else."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ultimate surene location. I couldn't have chosen a better place. Everything was A+, especially the star gazing. It was an absolute dream, tucked away in the woods, perfect for a relaxing getaway. Thank you guys, we will be back!"

The hosts are extremely helpful and responsive. The bed is comfy. It is not luxurious and the bathroom could be thought out a little better but overall we would recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I checked in late at night after working in the area and left early in the morning. Slept amazingly in a clean and comfortable bed. The creek running nearby is gorgeous.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for me and my daughter. It had all the amenities that you could want in a place.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our visit very much! It was very private with beautiful surroundings.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After being on the road for two days, this studio was a true sanctuary! Sitting roughly one mile away from the west side of Glenwood Springs, the property was very quiet while still feeling safe for a solo female traveler.
The photos on the posting represent the space well - I especially appreciated the mini bottle of wine to unwind after the drive, and the granola bars for my hike in the morning. Finally, check-in and check-out were incredibly easy. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I loved staying in this lil Glenwood Springs cabin. It was so thoughtfully put together, between the snacks, robes, toiletries, games, etc. It was extremely clean, cozy, and convenient. Thanks so much for a great stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot- couldn’t recommend more.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Elli and Erics place was more than perfect. The space was so clean and had everything you could need- fridge, microwave/airfryer, washer and dryer and extra towels. The location of their place is perfectly placed and so peaceful. Less than 5 minutes from town but up in the mountain. The fish hatchery was such a cool thing to have just at the end of the driveway for our son. There is zero reception in the area but with wifi we were still able to use our cell phones. I will 100% come back to their place if we visit Glenwood Springs again."

You can go down and learn all about hatcheries and the types of trout they have. You can even feed the fish! The studio itself was clean and cozy, and it had everything we needed. There were awesome spaces to relax outside as well. The Airbnb is the perfect distance from town -- not too close but not super far either. It's a very peaceful location that allows you to really connect with your beautiful surroundings. Communication was also very direct and helpful. Definitely a must-stay!!"

The location was great, a mere 10 minutes from downtown, but still totally isolated and off the beaten path. We also appreciated Elli's helpful instructions (check in and out was super simple) and the nice touches like snacks and a bottle of wine. A great escape!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, gorgeous cabin. If you’re visiting in the winter, there may be a huge patch of ice in the parking lot before the driveway. Don’t stop on it! You may get stuck like I did 😂"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really don’t think I can leave a short and sweet review, but I will try! They were beyond accommodating, helpful, and friendly! Elli and Eric provided us a bottle of wine upon arrival as we were staying there for our honeymoon. We had an unfortunate situation with the water tank, but that was no one’s fault and they jumped into action right away! Eric provided myself with an extra ice pack due to a fall I had prior to our arrival. He also provided my husband with a few gear items for snow and hiking. Our dog played with their dog a little bit so they were able to socialize. I just cannot say enough wonderful things! Even Elli’s mom came to the rescue on our departure day. Such wonderful people and we will most definitely be back! It’s also a major bonus that Eric is a fellow Hoosier. Hoo-Hoo-Hoo-Hoosier!!!"

There’s A beautiful hike just up the road with no cars allowed in the road and I loved that this location as it easily accessible to ever turn and on all easy paved roads.
The stargazing was stunning at night and the creek is literally steps from the unit.
It’s a small studio with a very comfortable bed and bedding and the real draw is the location and all the beauty of nature and quiet."

The studio was well outfitted with about anything you would need from a studio away from home, including a few books and games to enjoy in a group of two. We were able to enjoy our morning coffee on the landing outside, which had the soothing sounds of Mitchell Creek and hummingbirds. We encountered only a few bugs during our stay (in early May), but fewer than I expected, considering the creek is only a mere few feet away from the entryway. We enjoyed our stay and would consider coming back if we're back in the area!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed our stay… Especially enjoyed the location by the fish factory… LOL…fish hatchery.
If you are a walker or a jogger it’s a perfect location for both.
There was also an awesome Bald Eagles nest in the trees at the bottom of the road where we got to see the mother at the nest almost every day… morning and evening. I think we also saw the head of one of the newborns.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elli + Eric are so sweet.
We were greeted with a gift in the coziest little studio! They did everything to make sure we had a comfortable stay and were so easy to get ahold of if I had any questions.
There is a rather large front yard that allowed us to play in the snow as much as our hearts desired. They even had a couple sleds for us out front!
The cabin is super cute, and so comfortable. There is a washer and dryer that was just beyond convenient as our clothes would get wet in the snow!
Im already planning a trip back to CO, and will undoubtedly stay here again! 11/10 recommend 🦋✨

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, quiet studio in tucked away in the woods adjacent to the fish hatchery. Studio has all the conveniences (3/4 kitchen- no stove, Neltflix and private entrance) and is extremely comfortable. Probably best for a solo traveler or a couple.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were so lucky to stay in this cozy air bnb as we transitioned into moving to the Glenwood area. Elli was wonderful and very accommodating. She allowed us to stay longer, which was a huge help! We highly recommend this air bnb! It's perfect for short and/or longer stays, being conveniently located to West Glenwood, still feeling secluded and in nature."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Elli's place is wonderful! It is in a beautiful location on Mitchell creek by the state fish hatchery. There is room for 2 cars to park. Our family of three stayed in it long term and it worked out perfectly! A huge bonus was the washer and dryer, especially if staying long term! She has thought of everything from a microwave/convection oven, to storage for clothing, a folding dining table to save space, and even brought sleds for us to enjoy when it snowed. Her communication is wonderful! We highly enjoyed our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great location by the creek!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome cabin
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning, quiet location next to a creek. It was a guest next to a couple of other houses but the way it was set up was private because the front of the house faced away from the other houses.
Some lawn games in the yard would’ve set this place off! We enjoyed it immensely."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, comfortable accommodations.
Responsive host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this cabin for 2 nights and it was a fantastic place to stay. We loved being out of town, not far, but it was so peaceful. We loved that the cabin was right next to the stream, the sound of the water was great. The cabin was very comfortable and just right for the 2 of us. Cris gave us suggestions of nearby hikes to take and we followed his suggestions for a great hike. We enjoyed getting to explore Glenwood Springs, going on hikes and having some time to relax and just enjoy being together, life can get so hectic. We plan to come back and will certainly try to book this cabin again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cris's place was an excellent stay for my friends and I as we attended a wedding this summer. I enjoyed how private the location was as well as how beautiful the river nearby and the green space in the back was. My friends and I even enjoyed a small picnic together outside. The home itself is beautiful and so clean. I am glad that the home was accessible by keypad rather than keeping track of a key or having to meet up with someone.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cris was a fantastic host and his place was a great getaway for my wife and I. Close but not to close to Glenwood Springs.

We spent a lot of time on the deck at night looking at the stars! Would definitely stay again"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean and cozy. Everything was good except for not knowing ahead of time that Verizon doesn't have service at the house so I needed to drive down the road to get service in order to access the door code in the Airbnb app. The large TV in the house has no TV stations and there is no way to connect the computer to it (and I'm technically proficient). Once inside you can connect to the internet and turn on your phone over internet service so you can use phones just fine. It would have been nice to know these things beforehand. Other than that it is a nice place."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cris' place was comfortable and spacious! We found it centrally located for what we wanted to see in Glenwood Springs (Hanging Garden, hot springs) and in the Aspen area (Maroon Bells). Eating breakfast on the porch surrounded by nature was a peaceful way to start the day and gazing at the stars was a peaceful way to end the day. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen large and well equipped, and sitting area relaxing. The bathroom has these charming twinkle lights in the shower ceiling! Right after booking I messaged Cris about hiking in the area and he immediately responded. We had a memorable stay at Cris' place and would definitely stay here again, if we are fortunate enough to travel back to Colorado."

It’s really cozy and homey. The twinkling lights in the shower were one of my favorite things. Also the sound of the creek running right by the house. Everything was clean and tidy. Cris makes the check in part very simple and we had no issues our whole stay. I definitely would go here again!

Don't miss'em, they're super cute! The bed is very comfortable and it accommodates two people just right. There's a little outdoors table perfect to drink your morning coffee with a pretty view.
Our only little feedback is that there was no trusted drinking water available. The house has a britta water pitcher with a filter on, but even after using that the water still had a yellow-ish color and we preferred not to drink it. We were lucky to have two gallons of water in our car."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not far from the springs but nice and out of the way. At night we could sit around the private patio and look up at the stars, which being from the city is a rare treat anymore.

The directions were clear and concise and we found the place immediately, found it clean with fresh linens and towels and all the necessary cooking utensils if you are so inclined. It also has great Wi-Fi connectivity. There is a washing machine available for guests that are staying longer than two days. The location is perfect if you are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to all the attractions in Glenwood so you can experience all it has to offer. For skiers/snowboarders it is just minutes from Sunlight Mountain.
We would also like to thank Chris and recognize his generosity as there was a mistake made on our end when booking the reservation, he went above and beyond and made sure our trip was perfect. Thank you so much! We would come back in a heartbeat."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great cabin, quite place, really preatty the outside, a great please for two persons, impeccable house acoustics, great quality music boxes. I had a great time there, would definitely come back!! Cris was so nice!! Totally recommend :))"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Superbly comfortable, Cris' cottage was the ideal nighttime base camp for days of mountain exploration. Many high quality (and subtle) details stood out: immaculate kitchen, automated fireplace, ""starry night"" lighting in the bathroom, shelves full of interesting books. A splendid, warm, and comfy place to stay and Cris was a wonderful host. We hope to visit again!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cris's cabin is perfect, honestly, the pictures don't even do it justice. It is more spacious and well-kept than you are seeing from these photos online! We had such a lovely time in the very clean cottage with all the necessary amenities. It is just 15 minutes from town and we couldn't have asked for anything better.
Again, really can't recommend this place enough. We will absolutely be coming back if we get the chance!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. We had a really wonderful escape here.
Note that the most ""direct"" GPS route between Carbondale and the BnB includes about 5 miles on a dirt road. It is well maintained and pretty smooth, but don't know what it is like in the winter."

Great location right outside of town!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful lodge and a great location. We stayed one night before heading to Hanging Lake the next morning and this location was ideal. The lodge was beautiful with all amenities available that we needed. The location was ideal too being it wasn't too far from our destination the next morning. Definitely would recommend if you want to get away for a night
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a nice cozy cottage that was a comfortable distance from town and still remote. The kitchen, bathroom, living space and bedroom was amazing.

2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The maintenance person woke us up around 7am with the weed-whacker. Then leaf blower, followed by the lawnmower. So there was noise until 11am when we left. Other than that, the place was clean, away from the hustle of the city, and had all the amenities we needed. Chris was also quick to respond."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Glenwood Springs is a destination place with lots of tourists. But my wife and I decided a ""getaway"" AirB&B apart from the crowds was just what we needed. We were not disappointed. This cottage is located seven miles outside of town. There are a few neighbors nearby, so we didn't feel isolated. But we were left alone and it was quiet and peaceful, with a rural feel. The cottage has lots of character with warm, rustic tones, but with all the modern amenities. Comfortable bed. Great shower, decent size kitchen for a cottage (which we did not use). Would recommend to others."

I stayed for a week long sabbatical and the cabin was well stocked - only brought groceries and some charcoal for the grill. Cris is a great host - kind, very responsive, and very knowledgeable about the area - he gave great suggestions on local hikes that weren’t too crowded. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cant say enough great things about Cris and Scott's cottage! The cottage is super cozy with everything you need for a short or long term stay! The cottage is about 15mins from downtown and all the bustling of the town. We most enjoyed getting to meet Cris and Scott and chatting with them about the backpacking trip we were heading out for. They had AWESOME recommendations and thanks to them our trip out to Glenwood Springs was unforgettable!
Superhosts through and through!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and quiet home, only issues was the address of home was different at time of check in which was a 30-40 minute drive…and the tv codes aren’t displayed. I texted for parental codes but no response."

Just a few miles from downtown Glenwood so it’s peaceful and quiet but not too far from stores, etc. A great base for exploring the area. Queen bed is comfy and kitchen had all you need. The shower is roomy and has nice hot water. The place is set up with tv, dvd, music, but we did not have time to use it. I would stay here again if in the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay! We stayed here for an event at Sunlight Mountain which was only a 5 minute drive. This place was very clean and had all the amenities shown in the description. Cris was very nice and told us to let him know if there was anything we needed.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING place. I stayed two nights with my boyfriend as a home base as we explored and hiked around the area and it was always great to get back to the cottage, have a fire, and sleep. The creek provides a really nice white noise while you’re outside."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage, very quiet and peaceful. Cris is a great host he checked in on us once we arrived and was very quick to answer any questions.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great weekend here with my partner! It was quiet and private, and Cris was both easy to communicate with and very helpful. It was just a few minutes outside of town, which made going into Glenwood easy, and we liked having a calm mountain spot to go back to at night. Definitely reccomend this spot to anyone who wants a relaxing weekend!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic place! Super cute and the babbling brook was amazing to wake up and walk outside to. 20mins outside of downtown , and secluded perfectly for an intimate feeling. Easy to find with his instructions. We loved it for our 3yr anniversary ❤️10/10"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a comfortable, quiet, central spot in Glenwood Springs, very close to shopping, restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. We were in town for a wedding, and everything was easily within walking distance. The place has a great kitchen, air conditioning, an iron & ironing board, plenty of pillows and linens and towels. Truly, a perfect spot for a Glenwood getaway. We’ll absolutely be booking again when we visit later this year!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very neat little cottage in a great location. Walk to all the bars downtown!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and very accessible to local restaurants and attractions. It was slightly lacking on kitchen supplies and amenities compared with other places I've been. It is an old home and doesn't heat very well or quickly. Overall, it was a great, great, great location and the bed was very comfy! The host was very flexible and responsive."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place close to everything downtown. Walked to the courthouse where I was working. Perfect.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot. Quiet yet very close to everything central
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was really well situated! We could do everything walking. Parking is easy. We forgot food in the fridge and a bag of clothes, and they helped us making sure we recovered everything even after the check out time. The bed is in a very cute alcove (not completely separated), the apartment is very cute and functional, and quiet (despite being downtown!). One of the cleanest AirBnB I have been in. Highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this cute little house! It was within walking distance of our favorite Glenwood Springs restaurant and an easy walk across the pedestrian bridge to Glenwood Hot Springs. We are definitely coming back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at Old Yeller and it was even better than the first because I felt so at home. I tried to come to Glenwood previously but Greg’s place wasn’t available so I just would find a time when it was. The location and price make it the only place I’ll ever stay there! Being able to walk to the springs, the caves and so many great restaurants makes it a perfect stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was great and perfect location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greg gave good detail on the house and the what the do’s and don’t’s were in the house since it is older. If you go in the colder months would be prepared for it to get chilly at night since the heating in the house isn’t the greatest. Other than that it is a perfect place and great location in glenwood. We would go back anytime!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Instructions should have included how to lock the door with the code. It was much different than our coded deadbolt. We had to contact the host. Also felt the description of the cottage was somewhat embellished. Great quiet location, but sometimes had to worry about parking. Host was a great communicator!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, would return."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place close to downtown! Easy in/out, walkable to the hot springs, and close free bus rides to areas further out. Great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay if you want to walk to restaurants and the hot springs. It was perfect for what we wanted in Glenwood Springs.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house in a super accessible part of Glenwood Springs! Easy access to the hot springs and some great restaurants in the area! Would highly recommend :)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was pleasant. Also a thought provoking experience staying in the original tiny house of 1800s. I would recommend it to a friend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple and easy.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is everything! Very walkable and super clean, easy door code entry, but a late 1880s home downtown Glenwood comes with a few caveats. No parking except blocks away in free public lot, some noise outside due to traffic & restaurants, but overall a funky, sweet, updated, enjoyable 19th century stay for us. We have to cook our meals (pro athlete) so the fully-stocked kitchen was a huge win. Easy indoor storage for our mtb bikes. Heat is wall-hugging baseboard setup + one electric oil radiator. LOVED IT. leelikesbikes dot com"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location for a Glenwood Springs getaway. Walkable to EVERYTHING in the downtown area--including amazing restaurants, shops and attractions."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Old Yeller was cute, well appointed, very charming, and an easy walk to everywhere downtown. The hosts responded quickly, were very friendly and helpful. We usually found a parking spot on the street, and only had to go to a free parking lot one time, but it was super close. All around enjoyable stay!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little space. Perfect for three people. I especially enjoyed how close it is to local restaurants and entertainment. Definitely worth the price!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is really outstanding! Very easy walking distance to Glenwood's best restaurants and shops. There's no dedicated parking but parking close was easy and free. The place is cute, but I think ""completely remodeled"" is a bit overstated. The kitchen is small and functional but nothing special. The bathroom is modern enough but very tiny - there's barely enough room to hang one towel. It would help to have some additional hooks or even a towel bar just outside the door. The WiFi and TV are fine. There's a drawer full of DVDs but the player would not work. But we had no problem streaming from Hulu. The place could some updating of lighting and furniture. For example, there's a good old vanity and mirror but no good light near it. The bed isn't bad but could be a lot better, plus needs better lighting. Considering the total price for 2 nights with fees & taxes was over $300/night, I'd say it's a decent value, particularly if you take advantage of the kitchen to save on meals."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific location, a block from the train station, and everything downtown was 3 blocks away at the most. Nicely updated space; perfect for a couple."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time I’ve stayed here and hope to visit again! Perfect little home base for your trips around the area.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walkable to everything downtown including bike trail. Comfortable for 2 of us and good kitchen to make to make all your meals for a more budget focused vacation."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ol' Yeller was a lovely home away from home for our family on our recent trip to Glenwood. Couldn't beat the location! Would recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Old Yeller. Perfectly placed in downtown Glenwood. Hosts were amazing and made us feel right at home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for an incredible price! Lots to do in walkin distance!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming cottage in great location, walkable to almost everything. Best for guests who appreciate older, historic lodging. It got cold at night, we tried to use the space heater, but it put off fumes so we had to turn it off. The kitchen had everything you might need if you wanted to cook in. A bit pricey for what you’re getting, but worth it for the location. All in all, a charming place to stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic location that is amazing for the value. The place is perfect for anyone staying in Glenwood springs who wants a simple place within walking distance from tons of stuff.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciate how quiet the house felt Especially given how close it is (1 block) from busy grand ave. Huge that we can park for FREE only a few blocks away.
FYIs - be mindful of electrical! Can't run the microwave AND the toaster without blowing the breaker. Fridge seems off - everything froze or had ice crystals. Front door doesn't auto lock - dot forget to turn the knob and hear the lock. Only 1 full-size drawer available and small closet hanging space. No dishwasher (no big deal). Pillows are pretty uncomfortable (wish I'd brought mine from home)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place in walking distance of coffee, restaurants, and shops. The street was so quiet and lovely! The house had old charm but was modernized and very clean. My daughter and I greatly enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! The home is clean, safe and close to restaurants, coffee and shopping. You are walking distance to Glenwood Hot Springs pool and Iron Mountain Hot Springs. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Old Yeller was the perfect central location for our Glenwood Spring adventure. We rented a car but really didn't need it except for when we drove to the Hanging Lake trail. Definitely recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location. So close to absolutely everything! We walked everywhere. The parking garage is down the street and it’s free and has a ton of spaces. The house is cute and matched the description, although we didn’t realize it was a duplex and there was someone else on the other side of the wall. We were very confused when we heard people talking and making noise through the wall."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little studio house! Perfect for the two of us. Close to a lot of things. Parking is kinda a pain when all the downtown spots are taken, but there’s a parking garage a couple blocks away."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! It is in a very convenient location and is perfect for two people and a quick weekend trip.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice small place to stay... parking could be an issue if you were planning on walking around town... we got up early and was gone most of the day fishing and site seeing so 2 hr parking during work hours was not a problem for us.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Old Yeller was very much enjoyable. The quaint, bungalow style house was exactly what we were looking for."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, cozy little house. It was great having the kitchen available. The location was great. Easy walk into town and to most of the local restaurants. The place was clean and well-organized. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Hosts were friendly and amiable. Would absolutely stay again. Thank you so much!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay! Will definitely book again if we come back to Glenwood Springs:)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is so cute and cozy. We were able to walk to downtown within minutes. We were able to find a place to park on the street with very little issues, we only had to move our car a couple times for the 2 hour limit n front of the house. Right across the street there is street parking with no time limit if you can find a spot. The size of the place is perfect for just 2 people. We had plenty of towels and blankets. The small A/C does a decent job of cooling off the place. We relaxed on the porch chairs and watched all the people in the active neighborhood. The door lock is easy to get in and out of. Greg gave us some discount codes for some of the activities close by that we took advantage of. Grocery shopping is very close; which made it easy to buy our own food for meals in the house. Everything we needed to cook was provided in the kitchen. We enjoyed our stay in Old Yeller and look forward to our next stay."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This a great little place. Great location. Parking is tough. I would recommend this place for sure. Thanks Greg!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ol’ Yeller is a easily accessible home in the city of Glenwood Springs with Hosts who are amazingly responsive and pro-active with everything we required. They provided wonderful places to eat and the cost was a bargain particularly with the time of year we visited. We hope to use the house again in the future. I highly recommend any available openings the hosts provide.
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I liked Greg, he was friendly and responsive. I didn't like it that I had to ask for the door code and got it last minute.
The house was old, dingy, and very small. Basically one room. total. The toilet is 3' from the bed. The house rules were kind of weird, don't use the pillows on the bed etc. The cleaning fee seemed really high for such a small place, especially since we were asked to do a lot of cleaning before we left, (which we always do).
Front door frame needs weatherstripping badly, AC is an old window unit- if you are worried about security, that could be a problem. The parking is a problem, we got a ticket for parking on the street and there is no driveway.
The kitchen and porch were very nice. The location is great- you can walk to downtown easily, a real bonus in a town without enough parking. The street is pleasant and quiet."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage right in the heart of town. A very walkable area with great restaurants and shops. The place was clean and as described. The host was responsive and proactively helpful. Overall a great place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location couldn’t we better! The front patio table was great to hand out & have a relaxing beverage at the end of the day.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Within walking distance to shops and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot to stay. Easy walk to main st
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home base while visiting Glenwood Springs being right in the heart of town in walking distance to everything! Highly recommend this place !
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location super close to everything. Clean, good communication- will stay again!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb didn’t get my cancellation confirmation and the host wouldn’t help. Don’t know if it was Airbnbs fault or owner but either way I was stuck with a cancellation I canceled.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,House was a perfect location to downtown and the springs. Always nice to have a comfy bed too.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect. It is less than a 5 minute walk from the train station. You are walking distance to everything. We arrived by train so walked to all the sites and things to do. It is a very walkable town. There are a number of shops and restaurants nearby.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved the cabin! It was perfect for us for the few days we were in town. Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance! We are looking forward to coming back!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Old Yeller. The location is killer - just a block or two walk away from tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping. Check in was easy, and the house provided all the basic amenities needed for our trip. My only issue with the house was that it was listed as a 1 bedroom but was a studio - there is no separate room. This was disappointing as we have a toddler who goes to sleep early and would have enjoyed a separate room. We told Amber about this, and she said she would be updating the listing. As an added bonus, Matt and Amber's daughter was able to babysit for us! If you're looking for a studio in the heart of downtown Glenwood Springs, give Old Yeller a look."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm in love with Old Yeller. Just imagine the perfect little, quiet bungalow that somehow still manages to be in the middle of everything. I paid for two nights what I would have paid for one at a local hotel, and this was sooooo much better! The neighborhood was adorable, the property itself, immaculate and well appointed, value and location were unbeatable! Greg was very responsive to the one or two questions I had. Despite needing to park a block or so away from the property for overnight parking, it was still very close and manageable! In fact, had it not been for the little parking lot walk, I would not have seen the Episcopal church selling homemade pies as a fund raiser!!! Perfect stay in Glenwood Springs, with a wonderful apple pie to go! I can't recommend Old Yeller enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Easy walk to shops and restaurants, cute little house that's very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little house in the middle of Glenwood Springs - it was a perfect stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for walking to some of the best restaurants in town. Front porch was nice for enjoying a cup of coffee (remember to bring your own Keurig pods or grinded - filters are provided). The bed was especially comfortable and the bathroom was clean and updated. Parking in front was nice if you get lucky, but parking was well described for free lots close by so not a big deal. Enjoy your stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure! Cute place for a couple, right in the middle of everything. Great restaurants and shops close by, easy walking to the pool and vapor caves. The house itself was charming and clean. Very comfy bed and sofa. Lovely place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a nice place to stay. So adorable. The lilac tree was in full bloom and the patio was lovely. We used the sofa sleeper and it was surprisingly very comfortable. Downtown restaurants bars and shops were just a short walk away and the local attractions were close. Parking was easy. We really enjoyed the getaway!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with a great location! I would highly recommend it to anyone.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute little place super close to downtown Glenwood! It was really quiet and comfortable. Highly recommend for 1-3 people!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg’s place is perfect for a getaway to Glenwood Springs. It’s right in the heart of town and walkable to many restaurants and bars, but still located on a peaceful neighborhood street. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking, it came with extra towels for the hot springs, and was very comfortable. I would stay here again!
One note, there’s a coffee maker but you need to bring your own coffee."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BnB was so close to all the shops uptown, but far enough away we didn’t hear any traffic. It was such a cute little home. If we ever travel to Glenwood Springs again we will definitely be staying at Old Yeller."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend in Glenwood Springs at Greg's place. It's quite cozy, but matched our expectations and was convenient walking distance to downtown."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little spot in the heart of Glenwood. The bed was very comfortable and the place had everything we needed for a long weekend stay. We did contact the host because we hadn't received the check-in email in advance, but the host got back to us right away and everything was very straight forward after that."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute cottage located right in the action of Glenwood Springs. The photos do not do the space justice. The location is just one block from great restaurants, shops, and bars. The house feels cozy and roomy at the same time. The kitchen, bathroom, and flooring have been nicely updated with modern materials. There are multiple free parking lots extremely close by if you have a vehicle. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location, could easily walk to all the nearby restaurants and shops. Host was very responsive during our stay, would definitely stay there again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Old Yeller is a fantastic place to stay. It's comfortable and within walking distance of all the good restaurants and shops. I highly recommend you stay here. It's so much better than Hotel Denver and Hotel Colorado.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best of Airbnb! Walking distance to restaurants, shops, and parks. Perfect place if you want to enjoy the springs or skiing. We loved it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully Walkable downtown Glenwood! Its for sure more of a studio with no bedroom door so great for a couple. I do wish the seating area was not staring right in to the kitchen as it was not a great space to hang out, but with all GWS has to offer it was a great home base for us! Parking was a bit challenging but there are lots of lot options just a short walk away! Overall wonderful stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really great! Location is perfect for dining and the hot springs! This is our second time staying here and we will be back.
Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Old Yeller was super cozy and a great place to come back to after a day on the slopes! Greg was very responsive and the location is absolutely perfect, within walking distance of town and tons of restaurants! The house is quaint and has the bare essentials, but don't forget to bring your own coffee, sugar, and oil for cooking."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location if you want to walk around downtown.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So walkable with a comfy mattress!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was was such a great place! My husband and I wanted to get away for a few days of R&R and this was perfect. Within walking distance of lots of great restaurants, shops, Hot Springs and the train."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was in a great location. It was very quaint and cute. As mentioned in another feedback, this was more of a ""studio"" than a 1 bedroom as there was no door. In addition, it was perfect for 2 people, but the pull-out sofa was EXTREMELY uncomfortable with springs pressing through thin mattress. In addition, the chairs were very uncomfortable. The bed was VERY comfortable. The stove smoked/smelled when we tried to make dinner, so we had to eat all meals out. We got a home with a kitchen so we could save money on eating out, but that didn't happen. Because of those reasons, we would not stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little place. It is conveniently located to Train and Bus to Aspen/Snowmass, just use Ride Glenwood to VelociRFTA (BRT) line. Also convenient to great restaurants and the Hot Springs pool. The place is warm cozy and clean, with enough room for one person to spread out. I loved that I could watch Netflix or Prime without having to log in to my account, that is a first. The only tiny issue, I would have liked is a kettle to boil water and make my pour overs. I made due with a pot, I could have asked I am sure, but didn't. The kitchen is equipped with a coffee maker and a Keurig, but being the coffee snob I am, I LOVE my pour overs with Peet's coffee and do not leave home with out my stainless steel pour over unit! :). Thanks Greg for a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect, close to every restaurant downtown. The Hot Springs is nearby."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place in the world. Lovely views every time you step outside and so much to explore on foot. The house was comfortable and warm, considering the age of the property we stayed cozy inside on cold (for us) fall days."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Oldyeller is located close to downtown restaurants pubs just a fun place centrally located to all the fun.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Location was great. Everything is within walking distance. Would stay again.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, it was right near the beautiful mountainous views of Boulder, CO. Kind of expected it to be a detached unit or studio, not on the side of someone's home, but it was otherwise quite private and quiet (save for a few creaks now and then upstairs). Nice library and warm heater."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very pretty place in a good area in glenwood springs! Close to downtown, and in an ideal location."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot to enjoy downtown Glenwood Springs. It was super-easy to access with everything we needed for a weekend trip.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! It was perfect size for 3 sisters, it was more of a studio than one bedroom but it was pretty roomy! Loved how adorable the house was, very clean and the renovation made it even better. Easy communication with the owners/property manager. Finding a park spot was little rough but manageable. Definitely would stay there again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The house is was the perfect size for 2 people. The location is great just a block away from the train station if you arrive by train. It is the best location taking 5-20 minute walks to everything downtown and across the river. If you are looking to have a weekend get away in a relaxing town this is the place to be.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location so close to everything we could just walk! It is a cute and cozy cottage and we loved staying there!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Old Yeller was a great place to celebrate our first anniversary! We wanted to enjoy a relaxing, refreshing weekend and Glenwood Springs was perfect for that. The house is cozy and close to literally everything, walking distance to shops and restaurants and about a 5 minute drive to the Hot Springs (we enjoyed the Iron Mountain Hot Springs). Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little house was perfect for our needs in Glenwood. It was close to 2 of the hot springs soaking pools and close to the adventure park and all the fun things to do and see downtown. The house was extremely clean, the patio was nice to be able to sit outside and enjoy dinner. This is a great place to stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described, Old Yeller is a nicely renovated, little old home. Best shower we had this trip (clean, plenty of hot water, good pressure). We could find parking within a couple blocks during the day and we were able to nab a spot in front of the house for unloading/loading. Had an immediate response to our one question."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy access, very clean."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My finance and I spent a lovely weekend in Glenwood Springs with Old Yeller being our home base. The property is well appointed, has an abundance of charm, while providing the comforts of home. The very well organized hosts made check in seamless with all pertinent information readily available regarding parking,
Wi-Fi, local businesses and more. Truly a pleasant experience all the way around. The location could not have been more convenient, with quick and easy access to countless shops, restaurants and the hot springs. I highly recommend this hidden gem!
With gratitude,
Dayn"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable home in a great location! Close to all attractions so very walkable. Check in and check out were smooth and instructions were easy to follow. Greg was an attentive host. Ample street parking or public lots were close by for convenience. Next time work takes me to Glenwood Springs I hope to stay here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, walkable to everything in downtown Glenwood Springs. Small but efficient space with everything we needed. highly recommend The Pullman for dinner... just around the corner."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts. Very Clean. Small but just enough room for two in my opinion. We loved that this house was close enough to walk to local pubs and restaurants in downtown Glenwood Springs. It's a short drive to most all the attractions including but not limited to the Glenwood Springs adventure park, hot springs and more. I'd definitely stay here again!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little yellow house on a quiet street within an easy walk of the pool, and many restaurants and shops. We enjoyed not using the car most of the time, and didn’t have any trouble parking very close by. Good size kitchen that is generously equipped. Very comfortable stay for a family of three with one on the pull-out couch."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would recommend this place to anyone! The kitchen and bathroom were immaculate, the mattress was super comfortable… and the location?! Unbelievable! Walking distance to the hot springs resort, the Doc Holliday trailhead, the Amtrak station and downtown (restaurants, shops and coffee). There’s a table and chairs outside and a quaint porch to chill on. We were so grateful there was a window A/C unit and fan. Greg was quick to respond and someone available at all times to address any issues, of which we had none. We had a great stay."

Check-in was easy and there was plenty of free parking nearby. Also, the sheets were nice and soft, which we truly appreciated when we came back from the hot springs sunburned. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're planning a trip to Glenwood Springs!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a cute house. We loved how close to everything it was. There is a hike/bike trail called The Scout trail a few blocks away which has a beautiful view of Glenwood and you don't have to go very far on the trail to enjoy it.
There are so many restaurants and stores literally around the corner so we didn't have to drive much.
We did end up driving to the Glenwood Hot Springs pool because we had a lot of stuff but it's not far of a walk over the bridge. We appreciated the pool towels because otherwise you have to rent them there.
The house is very homey and the kitchen has the basics you would need for a simple meal. Fyi, bring your own coffee though as that wasn't provided.
The house is really quiet and we didn't hear any outside noise. Parking was pretty easy and
we could usually find a spot out front or within a 2 min walk at the most.
I would highly recommend this house for a couple or very small family. My 10 year old son and I very much enjoyed our little home away from home :)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is very convenient to everything in town! Instructions were very helpful as well. Both the bed and sofa bed were comfortable (loved how soft the sheets were!). The outside patio table and umbrella were nice for relaxing too.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little spot to stay - a block or two away from the main drag, meaning it’s easy to get to restaurants and stores but you’re not right in the middle of tourist traffic. If you come via Amtrak as we did, it’s super-convenient. Just a short walk down the street to/from the station. We loved sitting on the front porch or at the table in the yard. Very homey all ‘round. The Hot Springs are a short walk away via the pedestrian bridge, and we appreciated the nice towels provided for our use."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house close to everything in Glenwood. The owners have done a great job remodeling this old home. The house is very small, but it was perfect for my wife and I. The area is quiet and beautiful. As the owner mentions in the description, even though there is only parking in front of the house from 6 pm - 9 am there are plenty of places to park within a block of the house. We were able to find a spot less than a block away across from the bookstore on the corner."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time in Glenwood Springs and so much of that was due to our stay at old yeller. The location was simply perfect. It was tucked just enough away from downtown to offer some quiet yet close enough to be incredibly convenient. We walked everywhere. Just two blocks to lots of great restaurants and the river walk. It is super close to the river walking bridge so we were able to walk to the hot springs. My husband also brought his bike and was able to enjoy going on great rides specifically “4 mile rd.” Check-in/out was a breeze. I would stay here again!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a find. a whole house (though a small house) in downtown with easy access to restaurants, the hot springs and the central business district. Check in couldn't be easier, and the place is completely furnished. The house has everything reasonably needed for a comfortable stay. The hosts are very responsive and helpful, even having some discounts for some of the local attractions. Can't wait until my travels take me back to Glenwood Springs and the ol' Yeller House."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"'Old Yeller' is a great place to stay for a winter getaway in Glenwood Springs. For something different, we chose to take the California Zephyer from and to Denver Union Station. 'Old Yeller' is a couple of short blocks from the train station which made it perfect for this trip. We used Lyft to get to the Iron Mountain Hot Springs and took the short walk across the bridge to the Glenwood Hot Springs Pool. 'Old Yeller' is also just a block from great restaurants and fine shopping. We really enjoyed the quaintness of a house built in the 1880 during a time when mining, agriculture, and trains were the way of life in this historic city. 'Old Yeller' gets 5 stars from us. Enjoy!"

This place was a perfect place to stay for my first time in Glenwood springs :) would stay there 1000x more!"
,,,"Unfortunately, I did not feel safe during my brief visit to this Airbnb. As a solo female traveler, safety is paramount for me, and the location's isolation, lack of privacy, and dim lighting outside exacerbated my concerns. Despite my efforts, I couldn't locate the key box, and upon arrival, discovering the RV door open only heightened my unease. Ultimately, I made the decision to prioritize my safety and booked a last-minute hotel for the night. I hope the host takes steps to improve safety measures and provide clearer instructions for future guests, especially solo female travelers."
