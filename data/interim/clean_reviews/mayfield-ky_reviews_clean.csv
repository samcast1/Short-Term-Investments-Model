2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emily was a great host! I messed up our dates and she quickly helped me get things sorted out.

The house is very comfortable, clean, and convenient. Most anything you would need is there . If you like ice in your beverages like me- stop and get a bag. Beds are comfortable. I would highly recommend Emily and the house. Don’t hesitate to book!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Emily was a fantastic host- she worked with us to check in early and check out late. Quick and responsive. Was just what we needed for a weeklong stay. Note that the beds are very soft (in our opinion) which wasn’t to our taste and was a little uncomfortable- however we’re thinking maybe this is common in Kentucky as we had a similar situation elsewhere and so that really is just a personal preference. If you like soft beds and cushy bed toppers - we think you’ll love it!

Main level has no bedrooms but one bathrooms. Lots of deck areas and a gazebo. It has a nice dock and 1 canoe and several kayaks. Has a bq, pool table with bar area. It has lots of taxidermy and is like a hunting lodge. We loved all of it.
The only problems we had were a dozen or so dead stink bugs in some areas. More that were alive came in from time to time. I guess you have to expect that in the woods. I did not get response from the host at times that were not in the beginning or near the time of our stay, otherwise communication was good."
2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"The stay was great. There were a few issues with some stink bugs, but nothing out of the ordinary for the area at this time of year. There were also some water leaks around several of the windows, but Michael took care of them as quickly as possible."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danae’s RV stay was something we wanted to try out and see if we could handle living in a space like this. With that being said, she was fantastic in helping us out in anyway she could. Provided us cleaning equipment and always made sure the tanks were dumped for us. She was super friendly and even gave us flowers for Mother’s Day (I travel with my girl and daughter) Even has recommended us places to stay. Absolutely great stay. And continues to be fantastic!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This worked out perfectly for my daughter and me. We spent our days in Paducah. We were able to get right out and headed north to Paducah each morning. Owners were quick to respond to any questions we had.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sadly we just had an overnight stay, but we can’t wait to go back for longer! It was raining so we didn’t get to enjoy the pond but well worth the stay. Great value compared to what you’d pay at an upscale hotel in the area and a much better option!! Variety or snacks, cereal and milk was a nice surprise. The coffee options were great for a coffee lover like my husband and I. We had way too much caffeine but wanted to try several and they were all wonderful. Kim was helpful and pleasant, very neat and tiny place! ❤️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite place to stay when in Paducah! Cozy, comfortable cottage, with beautiful and relaxing surroundings! Kim is a fantastic host! Can't wait till we can visit again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful scenery and wildlife. Nice patio area for grilling outside. Bed comfy and lots of space for unpacking and storing luggage. Close to town but out in country. Worth the drive. Parking right on site. Unfortunately, we did have thunderstorms and power was out a long while, but not anything the owner could have foreseen. They helped by giving us candles."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim and Rick are very helpful and responsive. They go far beyond other places we have stayed. Her decorating is joyful and we were very glad that ROKU was included.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very relaxing place. Felt like home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most beautiful Airbnbs I have ever stayed at. My daughter is a super host in Oregon so I appreciated all the extras- snacks, flower seeds (love to garden). I wish we could have stayed longer to explore the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as advertised. Kim was very quick to answer any questions we had. We will absolutely use the host again!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best most well kept place we have stayed at so far. Kim puts a lot of love into keeping things nice,clean & perfect for her guests."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is easily the nicest airbnb I've been in yet. Everything was spotless, they had recommendations for everything and some. Perfectly spotless and incredibly homey. We are looking for excuses to come back to the same airbnb. If only I could rate it higher. Super host easily and very well deserved."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This beautiful home is just as delightful as advertised. Very cozy and private. Also, it's very reasonably priced. The host is responsive and helpful in every way. We would recommend this location."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kim's place is a favorite of ours to stay in when we travel. I am always happy when it is available. Her place is very inviting and peaceful. I would definitely recommend!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, close enough to attractions/shopping/restaurants, quiet, peaceful, comfortable, all the amenities of home."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim was great! We enjoyed our stay very much!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this space. A lovely, beautiful and comfortable place. The host has provided all the modern amenities as promised. 5 star attention to detail. The view of the pond in front, and the private patio in back are so peaceful. You can just sit and listen to the wildlife. Very private."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful cottage. Everything was perfect. It was well stocked with everything we could possibly need and then some. The interior was so thoughtfully decorated and homey. It looked even better than the pictures. It was so nice to sit out front and read by the pond and later sit out back by the woods with the tiki torches and lights all around. Took a long hike through the great trails in the woods enjoying all of the sights, smells and sounds of nature. They even offered some flower seeds that we took home to add to our own garden. It is also only a short drive to downtown and the riverfront. We will certainly stay there again in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Okay, I can't say enough how much my family and I loved this place. Kim put so much thought in effort into everything, from leaving us a few plants to plant when we returned home, to leaving us tide pods for our laundry. The place is so tranquil. Far enough away from the hustle and bustle of crowed town/city life but close enough to every amenity one could ask for. My daughter absolutely loved catching fish in the little pond out front of the cottage. I would recommend buying the tiniest hooks you can though, it makes catching the blue gill a lot simpler and especially for kids. The place is so much bigger on the inside than you can see from the pictures. My only complaint and this isn't even a complaint just more of and open ended suggestion. This is only going to apply to some of the population and is in no way a ding toward Kim. I'm a big big guy and with the exception of the bed all the furniture was uncomfortable. For most folks it would be fine, but us big fellas not so much."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage was the best place we stayed at during our trip. I highly recommend it!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place to stay. You look out onto a peaceful bond in the front and have woods and a secluded patio in the rear. The space inside is perfect for a couple- open and comfortable and well laid out. Kim had a bunch of local recommendations and also had plenty of nice touches for staying in. We only stayed for a night passing through the area, but I would definitely entertain staying for much longer. Everything was clean and it felt just like home!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a nice place to stop on my way through. Restful and comfortable.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have used Airbnb quite a lot and this is by far the best place we have stayed in. It is just sooo clean, the decorations are very thoughtful and seasonally appropriate and everything is just very welcoming.
Kim also put a lot of thought in the details. Things like a welcome snack box, cereal and milk, as well as a great coffee selection was a very pleasant surprise.
We were also provided with seed packets from her garden, which I will happily plant among all my other plants. The property is very quite and we enjoyed listening to the great horned owls in the woods.
I can highly recommend this place for anyone staying in/near Paducah, that prefers nature when waking up."

It's private and remote with beautiful surroundings but close to the city. You can park and unload two feet from the front door, which makes loading and unloading easy. Kims' place is my top choice when staying in Paducah."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was outstanding. I have stayed in many Airbnb and motels over the years and this is my number 1 rated stay. Kim is a great host but there was literally nothing I needed to contact her for. We only stayed one night but I could have stayed the entire week!!

We booked it because it was a cute little home on some land with a pond. It actually snowed for the time we were there and the pond had frozen over, but it was absolutely beautiful to be out there and we enjoyed every bit of our stay. I would definitely recommend it to others! Thanks again Kim!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just stayed with Kim twice in the past 2 weeks. And, overall I believe these were our 4th and 5th stays. Our ""go to"" place when traveling through Kentucky. I can't say enough about Kim. Candidly, she could give clinics on how to be a great host and set up a property. Everything is fantastic. Unit is quiet, clean, laid out well. Has tremendous amenities. One of the best showers in our travels. Kim makes the place so special. This year around the holidays it was decorated so ornately...It felt like home. Our biggest regret with this property is that the stays for us are usually short, overnight for traveling. But we are blessed to have found it. If you are considering this unit, don't hesitate at all."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience using AirBnB. We were super pleased with our experience, start to finish. Kim's place is well stocked, super clean, and very cozy. The photos and descriptions are 100% accurate. The back patio is a great place to hang out when the weather is nice, and the view of the water on a rainy day was very relaxing for us. There's two TVs with plenty to watch if you like to have a lazy day or two on your vacations, or just for generally relaxing bed. There are some board games and a deck of cards provided as well. The Internet is plenty fast for anything you'd need to do, and we never had a hiccup in the service. There is a full fridge/freezer that had tons of room for our leftovers / snacks / drinks. The location is also perfect as you're just far enough out of town that it's quiet and relaxing, but close enough you don't feel like you can't run out for food or entertainment on a whim. We will definitely be coming back!!"

The home was amazing. Simple open air layout. Cook dinner and watch the tv while your brain goes into shutdown mode. Very convenient, minutes from town but you don’t feel like you’re minutes from town. Peaceful neighborhood. Noisiest thing in the morning was the rattle of my diesel engine pulling out of the driveway. The decor was excellent, simple without being over the top. Just felt comfortable.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Jonathan's studio for one night while travelling. Let me tell you, the word studio does not give the place justice. This was so roomy and so cozy it is perfect for a romantic getaway. We got in late but was able to get in with the code, no problem! The house has everything that you need, cooking utensils, pots and pans, coffee maker and they provide some single serve kcups. The bed was comfortable and so was the couch. This place is close to the Land Between the Lakes recreation area and would be a perfect place to stay to hunt, fish, or head to Patti's 1880s Settlement."

The area around the house and the neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet, and they have provided comfortable seating outside to enjoy the outdoors. The inside is cute but modern and is well stocked with a full kitchen and large bathroom. The bed and couch are very comfortable as well. They even sent me their website with suggestions of things to do around town. I went on one of the walking trails they suggested and it was very nice. Such a nice place with great hosts. I will stay here again if I am ever in the area."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, didn’t get to enjoy the property longer, as it was just a stop on a long journey. But the hosts are very good at communicating, and the spot was lovely ."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The house has a comfy king size bed, a really nice shower, and plenty of space. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook some simple meals. We visited in the heat of summer and were pleasantly surprised by very high quality AC. The house also has very fast internet, which we heard from some locals is not common in the area. Check in and check out was easy and communication was great."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is amazing! Super clean, wonderfully decorated, comfortable furniture, amazing bathroom... everything! Quiet and relaxing for a weekend getaway for sure.

Johnathan is a great host and I would not hesitate to come back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great week in Hutchinson. My toddlers loved playing on the path and with the rocks. Hubby enjoyed the back patio for grilling. The older boys appreciated the spacious living room and the TV. I liked the layout of the house and the two patios that gave us a space for the twins to play safely while my husband cooked on the other one. The location is ideal for going to the dam or into town or to the Lake.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. There was places to eat close by. Super quiet and clean! Would stay again if we were in the area! Highly recommend!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jonathan & Megan were the kindest, most responsive AirBNB owners we’ve ever dealt with. We stayed at their house for an entire month while we were house-hunting and absolutely loved it! Super clean, spacious, comfortable, quiet and private - everything we could hope for during a stay of that length of time. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with all the supplies we needed for cooking our meals each day, the shower had nice hot water, the AC units worked fantastically and were super quiet, the laundry room eliminated the need for us to go to a laundromat during our stay. And the patio out front was perfect for sitting in the shade and relaxing every afternoon. We would sit and listen to all the birds and watch the woodchucks come out of the wooded area to nibble on clover. It was so peaceful and relaxing. Even our dog didn’t want to leave at the end of our stay! If you like peace & quiet, if you are a clean freak like me, and if you love to cook, this is definitely the place to stay. Out in the country but real close to the 641 to get to wherever you need to go. You won’t be disappointed!👍🏻"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was for the purpose of holing up and getting some work done, so I didn't check out much of the surrounding area! For my purposes I liked the spaciousness of the place, the fireplace, and the multiple seating areas!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderfully quiet retreat with lots of windows and double doors. On cool nights it was wonderful to fall asleep to the sound of the crickets and wake up with the chirping birds! Open the windows and enjoy God‘s beauty 🌷

This was our second stay, and it won’t be our last 😀"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was just what I needed for spring break! We were able to take some great day trips, and also spent a day exploring Murray. The spot was secluded enough to be really peaceful, but was close enough to get out and do things as well. I really enjoyed the brewery in town, Hop Hound! Jonathan was a great host, and very responsive to messages. I cannot recommend highly enough, and am thinking of planning another stay to do the things I missed this time."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little house with everything you could need. Really appreciated being able to bring my three dogs along with us on vacation.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You'll love this place. It has a lovely common area with lots of room for seating if you have guests while you're there. It's fully equipped with anything you might need while you're there. You're a few miles from the grocery store and there is a convenience store (Dollar General) not far. There's a nearby church. You're not far at all from the Bison and Buffalo Preserve and other Kentucky Lake sights. I would highly recommend staying here. We had a wonderful 10 days there.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Burkeen’s space (as many other reviewers have said) is so much larger and cuter than expected - it was perfect for two because of the studio setup, but certainly had the space, amenities, and supplies for plenty! It was so nice having the quiet back and side yard areas which were perfect for the dogs, and we kept the windows open at night to enjoy the nature sounds. We were there two weeks and they saw to whatever was needed for a long stay. Thanks!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and private! Spacious and comfy for one couple. King size bed is comfortable. Pet friendly is a great perk!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan and Megan's house is absolutely gorgeous and was perfect for our socially distant family vacation. Spacious, clean, well decorated home with outstanding appliances and amenities. The washer and dryer, king-sized bed, Keurig and huge TV made it feel like we were in a fancy hotel. The quiet, peaceful time spent on the porch was priceless. We spent the days at Kentucky Dam Beach and the nights either cooking in the big kitchen or trying the local food. My husband, son, pup and I could not be more grateful."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful studio. So spacious! The bed was incredibly comfy, and the couch was too.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! Loved everything about this place! The shower was awesome. Enjoyed lots of porch time and although there are houses around they are plenty far enough away. House is set next to a wooded area so it feels like you're out in the country but you are still very close to town. We recommend taking the side roads into town as the drive is beautiful! Everything you need to cook, which we did."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful location with a nice covered patio.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adored the house and our stay! House was spotless which is super important to me. It felt very comfortable and like home away from home. Would absolutely recommend staying here & will do so myself next time I visit the area.

His place is as incredible as all of the great reviews! It is clean and beautiful and spacious! I would definitely stay here again!!! One of the best!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you to the Burkeens! This studio has a stylish interior with plenty of room to spread out and relax. The wifi router has ports for wired connections if you require it, and the directly overhead shower is almost worth booking the studio on its own."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about this home. I know the reviews are great, but even reading them (and this) will leave you amazed at how great the space is, how accommodating the owners are, how serene the environment is, and how much you’ll enjoy staying there. It was my favorite Air B&B ever and I’ve stayed in some on vistas overlooking oceans. While there’s nothing that can compare to a seaside environment in Murray, KY, being in this Air B&B was so refreshing, calm, and comfortable that it did not feel at all as though I were away from home. There definitely cannot be a better place to stay in the area!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much. It was quiet, spacious-feeling, well-supplied, good shower and bed...and it didn't hurt that there were muffins! Communication was excellent. The space heaters were a little off-putting at first and had a bit of a learning curve to their operation, but they were very effective and the gas fireplace gave an extra special ambiance to the place!

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan and his home are simply the best. Everything was present at the home needed for a great stay- and then some. It's located close to every spot you could possibly want to go to in Murray and is very peaceful. The house is cozy and adequately heated. Furthermore if help was needed, Jonathan answered us extremely quickly. He is very forward about what he expects from his guests as well, although this is really nothing. Simply be a clean and respectful person and you'll be set. Can't say thank you enough for this wonderful home."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot at an amazing price. Our stay was peaceful and very pleasant. The studio is very well decorated and outfitted; we lacked for nothing.

The surrounding property is spectacular and the location is wonderful. You’re close to the highway, but out in the quiet country, and only a short, pleasant drive to downtown Paducah. Just can’t say enough good things. If you’re in town for work, vacation, or just passing through town, I can’t recommend it more highly."

We can’t wait to come back! 🥰

It’s within a few miles of great restaurants and things to do which is what I was looking for when booking. The pictures and descriptions were exact and check in/check out was easy breezy! When we arrived, the host was thoughtful and had left us banana bread in the fridge. Tea, coffee, snacks, and bedroom chocolates made us feel like we were staying in a nice hotel! This space was super clean and clutter free. Daisy and Dozer were outside of the bedroom window when we woke up in the mornings, I just wish the weekend we visited wasn’t raining so we could’ve given them snacks and pets."

The kitchen has EVERYTHING you need to enjoy a shorter stay. Very functional use of the space. We were so pleased with our choice. And don’t forget to bond with the hairy friends out back!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at Tiffany’s for a little Christmas retreat. It was perfect. Probably the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we hoped for! The fire pit was a highlight, we spent several nights there. The set up is superb! The place was very cozy and friendly. We appreciated the snack and coffee bar, not to mention the s’mores kit basket along with blankets to use at the fire pit!

This place is perfect for 2 people wanting to getaway and unwind. The mini cows Daisy and Dozer were refreshing as well. 5 stars and beyond!

If you are a light sleeper, consider bringing ear plugs or use a sound machine on your phone. There can be some light highway traffic in the distance at times. I’m assuming more so in the winter while the leaves are off the trees, but that was a minor issue.

Overall, the home is in a very nice peaceful neighborhood. With a grocery store only a few minutes away. Our host Tiffany was very accommodating and friendly. We will be back for sure!"

If you aren’t aware of the area, there was a terrible catastrophe in the area a week before our scheduled trip. Jill was wonderful the whole time with communication and keeping us informed. She even made sure we knew the cancellation procedures if there was any amenities that would not be available at the home due to the tornado that destroyed the area. Everything was up and running by our trip, she even reached out during to let us know the town had lifted the boil water notice. The house was everything we wanted and the location allowed us to easily travel all over the Western Kentucky area. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we can’t wait until our next trip!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not their first rodeo, these highly experienced hosts have turned a charming 60’s brick rancher into The Ranch - a comfortable and beautiful home away from home. Soothing colors and decorative flair abound! Completely renovated, spotlessly clean and fully outfitted with everything you need to settle in, The Ranch sits on a large carefully maintained country property. Outdoors the deck, fire pit and lawn offer warm weather fun! We’re still savoring our morning coffee and evening wine around the fire pit. The living room fireplace and family size TVs are welcome indoor entertainment too. Easy and close access roads to the area’s towns and KY Lake recreation facilities. Communication with hosts is prompt and thorough. Looking forward to our next visit!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location is peaceful and quiet. The design is interesting - it’s like the footprint you would need to host family or parties for large get togethers if you owned an RV and traveled extensively but wanted to return to the area and host events while retaining the ability to tuck someone into bed if they needed that. The movie/game room layout was great. The place worked well for our family with young children.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The bunkhouse was great! It was clean and comfortable. It was beautifully decorated. We hope to visit again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Looked for a place to host my adult children to attend my youngest daughters college recital. This place seemed a little far out but seemed to have some entertainment value as well as a place to stay. It ended up being PERFECT. Drive to Murray was no big deal for anyone (15 min to the University) and the the queen bunkbeds were fun, accommodating and very comfortable.
The kitchen was a chef's kiss!!! So much space, everyone was able to help prepare meals while visiting and sharing stories.
The vibe was really cool and relaxing too!!!
They literally thought of everything!!!
We have 2 more big events planned at Murray and everyone was like ""Lets make this our Murray place"".
Loved it so much and will definitely be rebooking!
🥰"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow!! I cannot say enough about Jill’s place! I know I sound like I’m just repeating what the others are saying, but it’s THAT true!
I have stayed at many Airbnb’s from New York to California and this is by FAR the most stocked with supplies, cleanest and most user friendly place out of them all!
The pictures don’t do it justice, it’s far better in person. The deck was wonderful for our morning cup of coffee and a family dinner later in the evening. We weren’t far from our family in Murray where we come once a year to visit and attend a family reunion. I have 5 kids and a husband and Jill’s place couldn’t have been anymore perfect.
We cannot wait to book for next year!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Will stay there again! Loved the kitchen. Worked perfect for the baby shower.

Highly recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Bunkhouse is absolutely stunning. The pictures were exactly what we thought it was going to be and more. There was actually a lot more room than we originally imagined. Dream kitchen with all the amenities. Very quiet surroundings which made it all the better.
We thought we left something behind and Jill was amazing with helping communicate with cleaning staff and very went above and beyond to help us."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Bunkhouse was amazing. The location was close to Mayfield which offered a handful of local restaurants but nestled in beautiful and peaceful farmland.
The house was furnished with everything we needed and more. Our boys loved the pool table and the queen-sized bunk beds we fun for us all.
Jill's directions and description of the house were spot on.
I hope to visit again and highly recommend this house for rent or an event."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place very quiet really enjoyed the back deck area very peaceful
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jill’s place is nothing short of perfect. The bunks are open, but curtains make them feel private. Each bunk has a light switch and usb +Power. The chefs kitchen is huge and perfect for guests. We spent time out back grilling and hanging out near the fire pit.
So many good things to say about this bunkhouse."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our home in the area is under construction and we needed somewhere to host an informal, small family gathering. This location saved the day and was enjoyed by all. Great space. Very comfortable and well appointed. I’d definitely stay here again and recommend to others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place is wonderful. We went there for a graduation at Murray State University. It’s about 15 minutes from the university. The place looks brand new. The views of the countryside are amazing and relaxing. This is a first class place that would make for a great family reunion or get together. We absolutely loved it!!!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Bunkhouse is AMAZING! Perfect ladies weekend getaway for the four of us. You can believe the pictures. Property is just as you imagine from the pictures. We had everything we needed. Very clean and inviting! Jill was super fast with communication. We would definitely stay there again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came for Quilt Week and wished we could just stay longer. Good location for getting away from it all amd for decompressing.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jill's place was amazing. Check-in was easy, the entire house was spotless, beds were comfy, has everything you could need during your stay. We really enjoyed the pool table and the peaceful, beautiful surroundings. It was even better because we could bring our little pup along. There are so many great perks both inside and outside. Great communication from Jill and very clear instructions for everything. I would definitely stay at the bunkhouse again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was awesome. There is not enough words to describe
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have traveled extensively throughout North America and Western Europe. Many of the places we have stayed at never lived up to their description. The bunkhouse is the opposite. What an amazing place this was. We felt at home the minute we walked in the door. From the movie theatre reclining chairs to the pool table to the amazing kitchen this was the coolest place we have come across. Often times we prefer to be in the heart of a city however this trip we just needed some peace and quiet and down time. Whether for a couple looking for a quiet get-a-way or a large family reunion this place can handle it all. If the weather was nicer we would have spent more time on the large outdoor patio. The bunk beds were very comfortable. We were not sure about the no actual bedroom scenario and ended up loving the bunk beds. We contacted the host Jill for a couple of questions and her response time was immediate. We highly recommend staying here.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,not far off the highway. chicken barns near by only smelled them once😁😁 five stars for sure

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I needed a place to stay to visit friends in the area and attend a retirement ceremony. I’m so glad The Bunkhouse was available! We loved the location and the accommodations. The place was spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed keeping warm in front of the fireplace and sleeping in the surprisingly super comfy bunk beds!!! The kitchen was spectacular. We would highly recommend The Bunkhouse to anyone wanting a place to stay or a venue to host an event!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Clean, spacious. Enjoyed the pool table. Would definitely stay again. Looks like it’d be good for small events too."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jill’s place is amazing! One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. The pictures don’t do it justice, it is beautiful, modern, and very spacious. Wish we could’ve take full advantage of the amenities but it was a trip for a funeral and we were out and about with very little time to relax. I would definitely recommend the Bunkhouse if in the Mayfield area. We will be renting this place again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Talk about “Wow” factor - this Airbnb was a very special place. Designed to host a crowd with plentiful space and seating! Pictures do not do it justice.. no expense was spared in the design or amenities. Very high end kitchen appliances and a supplies - never used such nice kitchen knives! Beds were very comfortable and it was a fun sleep set-up. The place was spotless and Jill is very easy to communicate with. We had already stayed in one of Jill’s other properties so it was no surprise that everything went so smoothly and how the house was so well appointed. She has lovely taste. The place was big enough to host my son’s teammates for dinner - fun was had by all! Already booked a 2nd visit for the fall! Sunrise and sunset views were gorgeous! Thank you, Jill!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Jill was very accommodating. Would definitely stay again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rex and his family were very cordial and considerate. As well as helpful. He’d always check with us if he had something to do around the place to make sure it wouldn’t bother us. This place take the old saying of “off the beaten path” to a whole new level. Extremely quiet no interstates or busy highways. Just you and nature. I’d recommend it to anyone.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"such a beautiful home. we loved staying there. Luna, their black lab, was so friendly and always greeted us when we would arrive back. I can't wait to come back."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed at Rex’s place during a last minute trip to Kentucky Lake. It exceeded our expectations. Super easy check in, home is cozy and the area is peaceful and quiet. Beautiful yard and home with plenty of space. Rex is quick to respond to any questions you may have and gave great recommendations for food and fishing. We will definitely stay here again. **Bonus points for sweet Luna and the snacks basket on the counter, our kids enjoyed both!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rex and his family were so accommodating. This was our best experience yet using AIR BNB. The place was absolutely gorgeous, spacious and clean. They were such amazing hosts too, and we completely felt at home, and I say that with no exaggeration. Everything was clean upon arrival, and they even had a cute basket of goodies which our kids flocked to the second we opened the door! Their property is beautiful, you could sit outside and just have a sense of peace and calmness. We will be back for sure, no doubt about it."

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our daughter had a graduation at UT Martin, it was about 45 minutes from the school. The drive was peaceful and we had plenty of room for the family. The house was absolutely beautiful and I love how they had a modern and old decorations. Jill, was extremely helpful when we left something at the house after checking out and needed access to the house to get it. We will definitely come back and I highly recommend this house."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in numerous AirBNBs before this one. But I cannot think of any that was more perfect than this precious farmhouse. It was so wonderful. I was with 3 friends who wanted this review to say awesome, wonderful, fabulous. It was just great. Spotlessly clean. More than ample amenities. Perfectly decorated. It’s an older home that has been completely renovated to modern but retro farmhouse. Extra things that were well thought out to make it even more special. I don’t know how to describe it any better. The setting is beautiful. Very quiet. Just LOVED IT!! Jill was the perfect host. Clear instructions. Very responsive. Perfectly wonderful!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Jill's and it was an absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. Jill is an exceptional host who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a memorable stay.
Firstly, Jill's home is stunning. The design is elegant yet cozy, with thoughtful touches that make you feel right at home. The rooms are spacious, well-decorated, and impeccably clean. It's evident that a lot of care and attention has been put into every detail of the house.
The setting of Jill's home is also perfect for relaxation. Surrounded by nature, it offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is ideal for unwinding and recharging. Whether you're lounging on the porch, taking a stroll , or simply enjoying the scenic views, every moment spent here is incredibly tranquil.
Jill herself is a delight. Her hospitality is unmatched, and she goes out of her way to ensure her guests have everything they need for a comfortable stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is a beautifully decorated, peaceful retreat with everything you may need (pics don’t do it justice!) It’s perfect for families! We visited Discovery Park of America from Memphis and the farm life at this home was a needed getaway.
The screened porch is great for gathering and there is a large backyard to play freeze tag with a fort playhouse and swings. The home is stocked with toys, games, and books. The pantry had coffees and teas. If you are into electronics, the TVs had Roku devices, there is a phone charger available, and a desk with keyboard for remote work in a bedroom. There is a cozy fireplace for cuddling up to read, a fire pit out back with an incredible view of the barn, and a sweet porch swing in front. It was close to town with a Walmart and local restaurants. We had Mexican food & sushi nearby. The kids loved the fun bed nooks and they said if they ever come to Kentucky again, they want to stay here.
Thankful for lovely hosts and a sweet neighbor and cat!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We have stayed with Jill in the past at another one of her locations and have yet to be disappointed! She is always very quick to respond when we have any questions! We are from the area so it’s nice to get to come back and visit and have a place to ourselves. the birdhouse was adorable!! Great secluded location with a wonderful fire pit in the back which was great for us to host our parents one night. Thank you Jill for always being a phenomenal host!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I loved the rural area and have decided that The Birdhouse is a place like we would like to retire . It is so quiet and peaceful and only a few minutes from town. We would definitely book again when we come to see our family in Ky.
Jill had everything so clean and spotless . The beds were so comfortable and we enjoyed hanging out together.
Just message Jill and she will message you back promptly."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt very comfortable and safe
In the book that explained how things worked, there is a mistake in the WiFi password and we couldn’t watch any tv. The b was capitalized and should have not been."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jill’s place was great. Very clean, well stocked and exactly as described. The location was also great and we’ll be staying here again the next time we visit our daughter in Murray!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"How do you capture a moment of rest for a busy family? Sneak away for a 4 day weekend after parent teacher conferences and head for The Bird House nestled among the idyllic rolling hills, fall colors, and quaint farms of Kentucky!
Serene and stylish, well stocked and thoughtful, it's exactly what we were looking for as a home base to explore the land between the lakes, Shawnee national forest, and Reelfoot lake state park.
The home itself has plenty to explore with cozy sleeping nooks and toys for little ones, board games, and piano (and tv) for older kids and screen porch and fire pit for us all.
I especially enjoyed the cozy master bed with the spectacular dawn views. Hubby found the kitchen to be very user-friendly. My 7 year old enjoyed exploring the tree house (and learning how to stay calm and gently shoo when encountering inevitable insects seeking shelter), and my teenagers loved roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over the firepit.
10 out of 10 for The Bird House!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was PERFECT! The kids loved it and didn’t want to leave! They loved the swing set, legos, and the outside fire pit! There was plenty of room for them to run around in the back yard. We also saw turkeys and deer right off the back porch! My mother in law loved all the kitchen cookware! We already have it booked again in a few weeks! 100% reccomend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Im not one to leave reviews, but The Birdhouse would get 10 starts from me if possible. This was the perfect house for our 2 small daughters. Jill has thought of everything, and all you need to bring with you to this B&B are your clothes and toiletries. Every detail was thought of- all the way down to toys, lotion, coffee pods and spices. As remodlers of older houses ourselves, we very appreciated the attention to detail and quality work that had went into the restoration of this farmhouse. We will definitely stay again if ever in the area. Very good locatiom in terms of proximity to Mayfield, Murrya and even LBL.
The owners where kind and helpful when the upstairs mini-split wouldn't work, and as a compensation for our toasty 2nd floor stay (that we didnt expect or request) refunded a portion of our cost! Woah!
Thanks so much Jill & husband (sorry i forgot your name lol) for the fabulous house, service and giving us a home away from home experience. 🏡"

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a lovely stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So first off we didn’t actually ended up spending any nights at this place. Jill notified us before we arrived that the power was out due to recent stormy weather. Jill did an excellent job of keeping us informed on the situation and ended up making sure we received a full refund as plans didn’t work out as we thought they might. All things considered if we ever are in a situation of needing similar accommodations in this area we will definitely consider booking Jill’s place again!

It’s so awesome that I can’t add anything further to all the 5 star reviews! The screened in porch with peaceful and beautiful views is the “icing on the cake”. What a relaxing country get away! Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bird House is a perfect place to stay while visiting this area —or even as a destination itself!! So many thoughtful details were put into this home to make it an awesome and comfortable place to visit! We were 3 adults and it worked great for us but the loft area and even the outside grounds would be great for families with children!! In the cooler temperatures, the screened porch and the fire pit area would be wonderful!! I would love to plan another trip here!! It is everything we expected and more!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, extremely clean, it was like being at home. My parents had never air bnb’d before and they couldn’t believe this was a thing you could do, especially for the price. Jill had everything you could ever need in the cabinets and drawers, which made for additional cute exclamations from Mom and Dad. Screened in porch a highlight. We were all impressed that it came with Paducah Sun delivery, but then were a little afraid later on that it might have been the neighbor’s paper (houses share a driveway)(sorry if so!! she was very sweet when she came to say hello). Jill was very responsive and helpful. Thanks for a great place to land this week!!"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time during our stay at the Birdhouse. It was perfectly appointed with all amenities, comfortable beds and a large bowl of farm fresh eggs waiting for us! The host was very helpful and responsive as well. Our kids loved the upstairs area with all the toys, books and games and were so excited to sleep in the loft beds. The upstairs along with the treehouse and swings outside made this a perfect place to stay with kids. The area is remote feeling and very serene, making it a perfect place to relax, particularly during a global pandemic. There are also towns within a 10 minute drive with anything you might need."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Birdhouse was amazing. It was so peaceful and relaxing. We caught the perfect sunset on the screened in porch. The hosts are thoughtful and kind. We would absolutely stay here again.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bird Nest was an absolutely perfect getaway for our group of four. The fully stocked kitchen allowed us to easily make meals while we were there. The screened in porch was one of our favorite spots at the house. Sitting outside drinking coffee while it rained was so nice. We used the fire pit too! The property was beautiful and we watched the most gorgeous sunset our first night there. The beds were very comfortable. There was plenty of room for us all. The house feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, but is a short drive into town for groceries and other necessities! The hosts were fantastic, too. We made pancakes to go along with our farm fresh eggs they gave us. We also grilled steaks using the charcoal grill. It was a wonderful stay! We hated to leave, but we will definitely return in the future to enjoy this little slice of heaven."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for the ""picture perfect"" setting and the quaintest house you will likely ever visit, then look no further!! The owners have lovingly thought of every detail. A week certainly wasn't long enough and we are already looking forward to staying again next year!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is private and in the country. I loved it and if you are seeking some solitude in an extremely pleasant surrounding this is it.

As we were sitting on the back screened in deck. We saw deer and turkey in the backyard. As for our 3 year old. He was in heaven with the tree house and all the toys and games that Jill had there. Jill, did a awesome job with the house and I wouldn't change a thing. If you're looking for a nice and quite place, look no further. Hope it's still available when we come back down next year."

2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a cosy quiet place to get away from the hustle and bustle of a fast pace life, then the birdhouse is for you. From the moment we stepped inside, it felt as if time slowed down. From the plush comfy beds to the screened in large back porch (where you can set and watch the hummingbirds play) the birdhouse is a great choice for those looking for some family time or maybe some peace and quiet. A warm and spacious cottage home with a modern twist. The host Jill is quick to reply and very accommodating. I highly recommend this property."

The hosts and the property are truly perfect!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was nice. Very quite. Great communication with Tiffany, great host."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful home. From the living room to kitchen, I was over satisfied with how well the residence matched the pictures. The home is beautifully and neatly decorated and situated in a nice quiet neighborhood. I thoroughly utilized the kitchen and found it to my liking. Our impromptu movie night was the best with the surround sound from the speaker.
This is a great home to travel with children because the master bedroom is on a different side of the house. Adults can have their own peace of mind with privacy you're able to obtain in the master bedroom. A beautiful stand-up shower is located inside this room. I enjoyed this stay with 4 children and their rooms being away from mine was a huge plus.
The gas fire pit! Was a bit difficult figuring out how to turn it on and worried I may be expelling too much gas, but once I successfully turned it on I was so happy I did. Beautiful beautiful views and warmth. Lovely calm ambiance. 9/10. Would definitely book again and recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. The host is very responsive and friendly. The home is clean and exactly what I want when booking an Airbnb. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and all the rooms had fans. The home is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of town but it provides a quiet and peaceful neighborhood which is preferred for my family. We will stay here again for sure!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place for our family to stop for the night. The fenced in yard was a great addition for our dogs!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was spacious and comfortable. Since there were 5 people, we could have used another chair at the table and another chair in the living room."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is away from the city center. The rooms were clean. The laundry worked but had Nate's stuff in it, & sheets still in the dryer. Not sure of the food left in the fridge? Used some. The dining table has tall bar chairs which my wife couldn't use easily due to knee problems. The front steps are high so she exited by the deck & gate into the grass as a workaround to avoiding those steps. Our shower was small, glass door didn't move well but many shampoo bottles to choose from. The TV worked well for movies but had a week of no sports :( Most of the enjoyment came from family time together in a quiet neighborhood. Great choice of blankets & towels. Also many plates, cups, & cooking items. My brother & sister-in-law loved the coffee. Would we stay again? My Brother & sister-in-law would stay again, as for me & my wife, no, as her walker doesn't work well with the carpet runners, floors & steps. Go see the Quilt Museum and other sites. Found good places to eat in town."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was just what we expected. Very clean with everything we needed! Thanks Again the place was awesome!

The rooms were larger than appeared in the pictures, and very comfortably accommodated our group of 5. Nate gave great directions, and we really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay there again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are 3 friends who try to meet in a central location to where we all live. I started searching Paducah locations because we are also quilters and needed a place to sew and shop. Nate's house was perfect for us.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and had a great one overnight stay after wife did her Quilt Shopping the afternoon before we checked in. Loved the outside fire pit and sitting area.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nate’s place was great! Exactly as described. He was very communicative, clear, and organized. His home was spacious, modern, and clean. We were so glad to bring our dogs with us & they loved the big backyard. That was SO convenient. The bedding was so comfortable. Location is a little far from town but nice to be in a quiet, safe neighborhood with plenty of space!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a very nice place to stay! Fenced in backyard was great for our dog! Would recommend to future guests.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I usually stay at a hotel in Paducah, but Nate's place was a welcome change! The home is spotless, with thoughtful details throughout.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nate is an excellent host. He is responsive and friendly. The pictures of the inside of the home on Airbnb do not do it justice. It is roomy, clean and inviting. I think it is a very good value for larger groups. The bathrooms are very nice especially the large shower in the master suite. There are plenty of very nice towels. The beds are all very comfortable with nice linens. The living room is large with a very nice TV. The kitchen is beautiful with all sorts of dishes and cooking gadgets. The Keurig is very nice and Nate very generously provided coffee pods. The fenced in back yard was nice for our fur babies. It was a bit cold to spend much time out on the back deck, but it was also very nice and I can imagine spending some nice evenings around the fire puts (yes 2…one gas and one wood burning) weather permitting. The neighborhood seemed very safe. It’s out a bit from the downtown area, but wouldn’t be a bad drive at all. I would definitely reserve Nate’s place again."

On the flip side, it’s in a quiet neighborhood."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! Clean, updated home in quiet area of Paducah. Comfy beds, awesome pillows, nice showers. Well appointed kitchen and outdoor spaces. We thoroughly enjoyed the peace and quiet and wildlife. It is away from downtown or any retail etc. but it’s an easy drive to whatever you need or want. Would definitely stay here again if we come back to Paducah."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,House and backyard are amazing. Didn’t realize how far it was from downtown until after I booked but it was ok. Communication was great!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! nice quite neighborhood

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nate’s place was perfect. It was beautiful, clean, and in a great location. The home was just as described and our dogs enjoyed the stay as well. Everything was smooth from checking in/out to plenty of space inside/out.
The wifi was good and my daughter was able to work from one of the bedrooms. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nate really provides a clean, spacious comfortable home away from home. The home is about 15 minutes from shopping in one direction; 15 minutes to downtown Paducah & the flood walls in another directions; national forests in another; Illinois in another… in other words- good location for being away from enough and close to what you need."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home! Enjoyed our stay!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable place. New/remodeled house vibes.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a good stay for our family of 7. If you're wanting something with a neighborhood feel and out of the city, its a great place to stay. Nate's home is very clean and minimalistic yet comfy. The back deck was a great perk along with the keurig coffee and water bottles in fridge. Side note: the 14 min drive to Red's Donuts is worth it if donuts are your jam! Nate has an informative binder with other restaurant suggestions as well.
We'd stay here again, but bring toys. Our kids always look for the box of toys and books and board games. We didn't see any here, so that was about the only bummer here!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The photos do not do this place Justice! The outdoor area was amazing and peaceful. The home was very spacious and comfortable. Will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a perfect stay for the weekend. Plenty of space for everyone. Anything you need is at the house. I LIVED on the beautiful back porch.

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place. Quiet, comfortable and plenty of room."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. No complaints at all.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nate's place is in a quiet neighborhood, maybe 20 min from downtown. The layout of 2 bedrooms that share a bath and one large bedroom with en suite was perfect for our group of 3 adults. The kitchen was well equipped, with coffee, condiments and some pantry staples. The back deck looked pleasant but we didn't really use it. Decor was modern and spare (uncluttered), spaces were very clean."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb I have stayed in so far, very clean, well stocked, comfortable beds, very accommodating host. Thank you Nate for a wonderful stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nate is a top notch host. I don’t think the place could have been cleaner or more comfortable. Definitely the cleanest short term rental (including hotels!) I’ve ever been to. We felt more than accommodated and safe at Nate’s place. He really goes above and beyond to provide everything you might need and in doing so creates the perfect “home away from home” setting. Don’t even get me started on the bed - best nights sleep ever! I also loved the personal touches he added throughout the home highlighting the best parts of Paducah. The guestbook is incredibly helpful with a plethora of recommendations for just about everything. I really wish I could give 10 stars. Certainly will stay at Nate’s again if I’m in the area and you should too!!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nate’s home was the perfect size and layout for our group of four and a very welcome home away from home after 14 hours in the car! I wish we had arrived earlier in the day so we could have spent time in the lovely back yard, but the walk-in shower and cozy bed were much appreciated! We will definitely try to make a reservation here again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nate's place is great - great place for a pit stop for a family traveling cross country. Much much better than getting two hotel rooms but for pretty similar price. If there were more places like Nate's I would never stay at a hotel again :-)
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We’ve stayed at Nate’s several times and each time has been great. He’s extremely easy to work with, and his place is clean, comfy, and lovely. We will always book a night with Nate when traveling south."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Nate’s house as a stopping point to sleep on our way to Georgia. It was quiet with very comfortable beds. Water pressure was great, there was coffee, creamer, sugar. Very clean. Would recommend."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described. We loved it and definitely will be coming back when in the area. Thank you so much.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay with Michael. We were in town for a friend’s wedding and his Airbnb was perfect for us. Very clean and easy to find. It was very well located for everywhere we needed to be for the wedding. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.
My only complaint was communication. We never received check out procedures or a check out time. I have stayed at many Airbnb’s, so we tidied up how we usually do and left at 10am. But it would have been nice to be more in the loop.
Thank you!"
