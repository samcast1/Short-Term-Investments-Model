2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place in great location
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my top favorite Airbnb stays! The location is perfect! The surroundings were beautiful with lots of roses and a neatly manicured property. The instructions on where to park were clearly marked. There was a fun hanging swing for two by the front door of the suite as well as a little nook on the deck to relax with a meal if desired.
The suite itself is awesome, with lots of cool and enjoyable amenities, such as a fantastic antique-looking gas stove fireplace which was easy to use and perfect for some warmth/to get the chill out when the temperatures dipped low at night and in the early morning. I got a kick out of the heated toilet seat and the toilet light too!
The kitchen was charming, and I admired the shower stall nestled between the bathroom and the laundry room--what a cute design! The bed was fantastic--so comfortable. I slept really well. It was a very quick and easy walk to the hotels/casinos as well as the river walk. I hope to be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for short and long stays close to the river walk I will be looking forward to stay again when in Reno.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My winning streak with Airbnb continues. This is a terrific little place. I absolutely loved the location, a very short walk from the Truckee River trail on a beautiful, tree-lined street mere blocks from downtown Reno. The place itself is small but it's cozy rather than cramped. Everything was clean and worked well, and communication from the owners was great. There's no television, but who comes to Reno to watch TV? I felt like I got a very good value here. Definitely recommended."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of my favorite places to stay in Reno!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place. Old neighborhood in Reno. Arrival and entry instructions are a lot but when you get there it all makes perfect sense!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and a bit roomier than what I was expecting based on the photos. I would stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, quiet and safe environment. Our 2nd stay"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nearly a perfect stay. Some small issues, but proactive communication made them ""no problem"". Location and price point perfect for what we needed. No television (maybe that's a feature, not a fault!) and perhaps a little loud (cats outside looking to hook-up, no fault of the airBNB). We'll definitely be back if we're ever in Reno again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at this lovely home. I have enjoyed it each time and will always look to see if it is available when I am in Reno. Super cute spot with all the amenities of home, right near the river with beautiful views close by, walkable to restaurants and things to do."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Close to the River Walk and many restaurants, bars, and activities.
Bed was very comfortable - I felt like Goldie Locks - not too soft and not too hard - it was just right.
Pillows were very fluffy and cozy. If you prefer a thin pillow I recommend to bring your own.
Easy temperature control and peaceful lighting.
It was a lovely stay."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa’s suite is clean and has everything a person would need. Comfortable bed. Quiet. Charming. Plenty of blankets and towels/washcloths/hand towels. The water at the bathroom lavatory gets hot right away. Has anyone else mentioned that the toilet seat is heated? Prrrrr. Lisa got back to us right away with any questions we had. The suite is a short walk (3-4 minutes) to the gorgeous river walk. Don’t miss it! And it’s a 5-6 minute ride to the train station. So convenient. We would stay there again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An easy walk to the Reno Riverwalk, which is outstanding! We were able to walk to a fine restaurant, and choose to walk the river walk each day.
They have done a great job of taking an old brick rambler and creating a sweet place to stay.
The bath and shower are modest in size, but everything worked well. My wife was appreciating the heated toilet seat, which was new for her."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My only regret is that I didn't get to enjoy this beautiful little hideaway for longer. My trip to Reno was only an overnight stay but this was the kind of place you could be comfortable in for much longer. Loved the accomodations and amenities. Thsi will be my first choice on my return trips and hopefully it will be available, would definitley stay here again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect overnight stay! thank you!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts provide so many amenities in a compact space! From a pair of cozy robes to ample K-cups to charging ports right at the bed this is a very well stocked and well thought out space. Only thing I didn't notice when booking is there is no TV but honestly the great assortment of reading material (both books and magazines) made that a non-issue! There's even a bluetooth speaker to play music.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Warm inviting space that not only was super clean but also in a walkable distance to the river walk and downtown. Definitely on the repeat list.

I will stay again if the scheduling works right."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location for visiting downtown Reno. Located in the block along the Riverwalk just far enough away ( 4-5 blocks) from downtown. I could be in the middle of all the activity in a ten minute walk .The house is a one story remodeled home from the 20’s split into two units. This house is on the corner and the outside of the property is beautiful. Landscaping and lighting is a delight for the eyes.The rear unit is a super cool studio apartment with everything you need. Off street parking right outside your door. A fully equipped kitchen with lots of pantry items. The interior is very nicely decorated. The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom has a shower stall and all the items you could possibly want.Washer//dryer off of the bathroom. The interior(just like the exterior)is so cozy and welcoming. Lisa, the host is nearby and responsive if you have any questions. I would recommend this space to anyone I know who is visiting the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa’s place is located in the Riverwalk District just a few blocks from the Truckee River, and a ten minute walk from downtown. I liked the parking spot right outside the front door, making loading and unloading a breeze. The unit was clean and comfortable, with a fully functioning kitchen. Lisa communicated in a helpful and timely manner. My only regret is that I stayed only one night. I would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for thinking of everything to the last detail! Lots of places to plug things in, great kitchen equipment, tons of towels, even shout in the laundry room! It was perfect. Thank you so much.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, very convenient spot. Would definitely recommend. The place was well stocked, and extremely easy to get to and from if you’re walking or driving around. Bars, coffee, food, shopping, river walk are all extremely close and safe to walk to. 5 stars all around."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a short stay. I was pleasantly surprised with the quiet and quaint neighborhood. One block from the Truckee River. Great coffee at Hub. 100% would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! I had so much fun & I am so glad we went to Reno. This place is very close to everything. I got to get on the Truckee river & float & raft! There was festivals everywhere & we went to the Legends mall! Such a great spot. Was clean & had everything. The ppl who host you & clean the place are so nice & friendly! I highly suggest this place. Most fun I've had since moving to Tahoe. The bed is so comfortable as well!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In the past few months of traveling, this location had the absolute best customer service. Very quick to respond and very helpful, understanding, and accommodating. This was by far the most professional, yet personable experience I have had. The apartment was beyond adequate and no detail left aside. They have thought of everything. If you are into cooking while traveling, no problem—kitchen is ready to go. The mattress was incredibly comfortable and the linens and pillows were top notch; easily competing with the high end hotels in town—in fact I’d say there is no hotel in town that has this level of comfort. The close washer snd dryer is always appreciated as I definitely needed to do laundry before heading out via plane for my next destination. This place was highly walkable and the river walk was 1 block away. What a great experience. Back to the customer service/hospitality, if your new to hosting, come stay here for a night to experience how it should be done. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is everything. I didn’t realize how close I’d be to everywhere I needed to go. The place was exactly as described, and clear instructions made check-in & check-out so smooth. Lisa was communicative throughout the process. & of course, such a cute space!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was just as advertised. It was close to the river and a very nice walk in either direction from the river area . The bed was comfy, the room was very clean, the amenities were nice. Two recliners were provided. It was very quiet. The yard was nicely landscaped with lots of flowers. How nice!
We did have some small issues with the bathroom sink draining and the stopper. It sort-of worked after a lot of tinkering. I suspect that will be addressed before the next guests arrive. The bathroom is quite tiny, as is the shower. There was an odd ""cat lady"" that came by at evening twilight to place small syrofoam bowls filled with food for the neighborhood cats. She placed these bowls under cars in the neighboring parking lot including in the landscaping around the room. This was somewhat entertaining, but not being a cat person, I would be irritated if I actually lived here.
At any rate, I would recommend this room to fellow Airbnbers."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cozy place! thank you!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I felt so at home here and as others have said the place has EVERYTHING you could want or need. Right down to every kind of sweetener for the coffee, earplugs by the bed, bottles of water, snacks and other little details. And it was clean - and I am picky about cleanliness! The hosts are very communicative and the instructions for entry were very easy to follow. Will absolutely recommend or stay here again myself!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful location! Can walk down the river to the downtown area. It was a pleasure to stay here. The host was friendly and responsive! Would stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place that was easy to navigate, find, and park as I travel back east. My only wish is I would’ve liked to have stayed longer to really explore the place but it was perfect and I got to do laundry!"

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"If you have an EV, there’s a Casino a couple of blocks away with both paid high speed and free slower charging options. This place advertises EV charging but really it’s just a 110V socket that you can plug your charger into for slow charging only."

I forgot shampoo and conditioner so that was so nice! The heated seat had us looking up where we could get one!! So many thoughtful touches! Would recommend to anyone needing a comfy, affordable place to stay! I also had to book last minute but everything went so smoothly! Lisa was great with communicating!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect size airbnb for my husband and I on our weekend trip to Reno. The kitchen had everything we needed and it was very close to walking distance to restaurants and bars. The river being so close by is also a huge plus!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value studio.
Pros:
- Quiet
- Good parking spot next to door
- Comfortable bed
- Fireplace stove heater is very nice
- Close to both downtown and midtown. Walk to river.
- Fairly well stocked kitchen
- OK water pressure
Cons:
- You have to take off shoes inside, even though there is no carpeting. Slippers are provided that are too small and result in cold feet. Bring a set of indoor-only warm footwear.
- There is an outdoor light next to the door that shines inside and can be disruptive at night; unscrew it to turn it off.
- No dish washer; you have to do your own dishes.
- The counter bar is very small; Might be tight for two people to eat.
- There is no surface in the bathroom near the sink to place a shaver bag.

The actual unit was very charming and had a great vibe both inside and out. Inside, I was greeted with snacks which after a long drive were very needed. It had everything I needed for my short stay but if I was staying longer, it was more than accommodating.
I did interact with Lisa in person and she was very friendly and made sure to answer any questions I had about the space as well as the surrounding area.
If I ever pass through Reno again, I will be sure to stay here as well as recommend it to my friends who may be passing through."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was just as described. Location was great, as it is tucked away on a nice, quiet street, close enough to walk to downtown. A very short walk to the Riverwalk as well.
Parking was a breeze. You get one spot in the driveway right at the front door of the place as well as plenty of street parking available.
Has keypad code entry which is great, quick, and convenient. I had initially received the wrong code which delayed my check in a bit, however my issue was resolved relatively quickly and the rest of my stay was really smooth.
Bedroom was comfy, good size bed with plenty of pillows and blankets, even extra blankets available neatly folded just a few feet away, and the kitchen was on the tiny side but seemed to have just about everything you could need for a relaxing stay.
No television in the room though, so keep that in mind too.
Overall, I'd recommend the place and would totally stay here again."

It is located in a quiet safe neighborhood & easy to find. My room was cozy & even had an electric ""radiator"" style heater, to make sure I was warm enough. The bed was extremely comfortable, & my stay was peaceful & relaxing, which was welcome after spending the days with my 2 toddler granddaughters. The home was very clean, and Lisa was friendly, welcoming, & helpful. She even had a Christmas gift for me. I visit my children every 3 months, so I hope Lisa's home will be available each time I travel down to see them."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa's place was lovely. Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend the night there because, after I dropped my stuff off, I went to an urgent care clinic to look into my abdominal pain. It turns out that I had appendicitis! Although I didn't spend the night there (I spent it at the hospital instead), I did visit Lisa's place, and meet her, so I thought it would still be appropriate to leave a review.

Lisa was such a wonderful and kind host and her place is so lovely and cozy and reminiscent of all the best hippy vibes from Berkeley/San Francisco! Definite plant inspiration for me. She offered me watermelon, honey, and went out of her way to find and lend me a beach chair for my meteor shower event! What more can you ask for from a host? The bedroom was clean and internet was fast for remote working, and apparently pretty soundproof as well since she didn’t hear my meetings (which were pretty loud). If you get to stay here don’t hesitate!
Thank you Lisa for your hospitality and for embodying the spirit of Airbnb hosting!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa is what makes this feel like the home away from home. She has created a beautiful soul warming space and provides you the time and comfort you need. Not only is she a gracious host, but also a loving puppy sitter and there was a party of 4 clicking their nails on the hardwood floor that would come in and visit asking for pets. If you’re looking for a reasonably inexpensive place to stay not far from the casinos (10-15 min drive), look no further. She’s close to a shopping center, shares her fridge and teas and also provides healing services to those with inflammation and migraines. If you’re not allergic to bees, deeply curious about eastern medicine and feel a connection to energy, definitely consider a session with her!"

I felt immediately at home, the bed is so comfortable, window AC unit, TV in room, awesome bathroom with a bidet attachment. Lisa is a healer and it reflects in her space. Lisa also practices bodywork and I was able to schedule a session of Apitherapy, please try out if you have time. There are two beehives in the backyard and Lisa spent time talking with me and pointed out some things to be mindful of on the way to California. I highly recommend."

The house is very clean, beds are very comfortable, kitchen is well stocked for a quick easy meal if needed. There is a park within minutes away to walk our dog. This is a very dog friendly house. The attention to details like dog treats, doggie bags and dog bowls being provided was very impressive. It was a wonderful home away from home stay for us. Location is perfect too."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts were extremely responsive, positive, and accommodating. The photos of the house were very accurate. This is a cozy home with all of the essentials. Great location and quiet neighborhood. I will definitely stay again when in the Reno area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed remodeled older home in a very quiet residential neighborhood. Easy access to shopping, UNR, freeway to Donner State Park, Lake Tahoe"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The house felt spacious and beautifully decorated. We especially were happy to have ample coffee pods and an excellent espresso machine! Michael’s communication was perfect and we would definitely try to stay here again on our next visit to Reno.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Where do I start ... WE LOVED THIS HOME! When reserving, I was not sure how far away the home was to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center where we needed to be all weekend for volleyball. It was PERFECTLY situated just 15 minutes away in the quietest, most peaceful neighborhood. I have seen the bad review for pets, and I will say that this house had NO signs of being pet friendly - it was deep cleaned, and we had no complaints. We brought our shih tzu, and she loved the backyard! Yes, the home is an older updated home, but we loved the updates and furnishings - very nicely done! The beds were so comfortable, and the kitchen was comfortably stocked. It was a bonus that a beautiful park is one block away!! Michael was an incredible host. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for your Reno stay!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"All in all it’s a very nice, comfortable, and well appointed home. There was a problem with the combination on the front door lock when checking in but Michael answered the phone immediately and sorted it right out. The only negative for me was that there is a lot of super inexpensive furniture and clearly amateurish construction. However, since I wasn’t buying the place or living there, it was probably just more of something that stood out to someone who made his living in construction. The quiet neighborhood is isolated from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area, yet has easy access to all that Reno has to offer."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place had everything you could possibly need! Great place to stay near UNR and downtown!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay here again and again! Michael was a stellar host with timely and excellent communication. Check in was super easy. So many things to share about what we loved about this home:
Gorgeous natural lighting
Very clean and extremely well organized
Decorated beautifully
Lovely coffee bar
Garage access for our car!
Sofa was comfortable with room for our family of 4
TV was easy to operate and watch
Washer and dryer option was wonderful!
Beds were comfortable
Master shower was awesome! Loved the water pressure
Water in the home warmed up quickly in bathrooms and kitchen -love that!
Loved cooking in the kitchen and having all the items needed there and easy to find
My personal fav: beautiful wine glasses!
I hope this authentic share is helpful for anyone interested in staying here 😍"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Michael's Airbnb provided one of the best stays I've ever experienced. In fact, I left Reno with the desire to buy a place nearby.
Its proximity to Lake Tahoe was what drew us in. We were looking for a place near Northstar with plenty of dining and nightlife options. Within a 15-minute drive, we found all-you-can-eat sushi, Los Angeles-tier cocktails, and a coffee shop that rivals what you'd find in San Francisco (think Blue Bottle but reasonably priced).
We also needed a place for our dogs to stay. Reno and Michael's are very dog-friendly. The kitchen has water and dog food bowls, the backyard has a patch of astroturf, and there is plenty of space for our 40-lb Goldendoodle. Down the street, a dog park stretches a quarter mile or so.
We're marking this Airbnb as a favorite and hope to stay here again next year."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a 3-nighter. No problems at all, and Michael was very attentive. Would stay at any of his properties in the future without hesitation."

The main room as you enter the front door is very open being the kitchen, living room and a dining table all together. This sounds weird but as others have commented the pictures don't do it justice about the over all size of this home. Mari had left extra towels to be used for the week I stayed which was a nice touch, thanks for that. Overall a very good experience with a very reasonable price."

We had trouble booking which turned out to be a problem with Airbnb’s website. Mari was fantastic in helping getting the problem resolved as we were driving through areas with no cell reception.
When we arrived the home was exactly like the pictures, beautiful and modern. Set back from the road in a group of 6 homes meant both privacy and no noise. The area is undergoing a transformation, turning older run down homes into lovely modern homes.

Would stay there again if back in Reno."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is definitely amazing! A true AirBnB through and through with cleanliness an obvious top priority and stylish comfort. The minute you walk in the front door you can tell this is a labor of love for the host. Beautiful decor and all brand new. Nothing was broken or needing attention to detail because it was all taken care of and helpful notes and directions around the house.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my first time renting an Airbnb and it was better than I had expected! We came to visit family that live in Reno. It was great to have such a nice home to stay in. Much better value than a hotel and enough room for us to spread out. We enjoyed going places but also enjoyed staying in at the house and just hanging out. The location is in a quiet neighborhood but close to the highway and other attractions. The host communicated in a friendly manor and even checked in (via text) part way through our stay. We had no issues but I’m certain if we had the host would have responded quickly. Hopefully we will be able to rent this house again when we come for our future visits to Reno!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures are great but the home is AWESOME!! My husband and I had a wonderful time in Reno and coming back to this home was a joy and very restful. The home is extremely clean, organized and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful even though you are in the middle of a busy city. We truly looked forward to returning home after spending the day out in the mountains or shopping in the city. We would not hesitate staying here again and strongly recommend this home to anyone traveling to the Reno/Tahoe area!!"

2019-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"Mari’s place was clean and stylish. The location is in the heart of mid-town and is bran new. The rest of the cul-de-sac should be finished soon, so no construction noise. Stay here, you’ll love the clean modern feel!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay very comfy and cozy
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Location location. House was walking distance from The Row casinos as well as the river walk. Nice park to take the doggo just down the block. The host Nic and his team were great. A couple of incidents arose during our stay however the main take away was that Nic and his team were super responsive and helpful. Will definitely be looking to stay with them again in any city they have rentals available.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable place close to downtown.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at Nicolas’ place and it was just as wonderful as the first visit. Highly recommend.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Reno. Neighborhood was quiet. Kitchen had everything we needed. Beds were very comfy. Great little patio. Very walkable to downtown. Two blocks from the Riverwalk. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nicholas’s place has a very playful and relaxing style. We made good use of the modern, well designed kitchen. Everything needed was there except spices, etc. Very comfortable sleeping, although we had to hang blankets in one large window that faced an alley with commercial night lighting. Second smaller bedroom was better in that regard. We had our pup with us, so the fully gated patio was great. It is shared with a business that has occasional visitors enter through this space which wasn’t a problem at all except they keep the entry gate open during business hours. Our pup doesn’t wander, but if someone had a pet with potential for leaving, there’s that. Potty area is a large patch of grass outside of the fenced patio, next to driveway. Worked okay for us. The location was great for walking along the river park, and to get to some restaurants and good beer. Just like a lot of city located places though, homeless folks also hang out in the space. No issues with anyone approaching us."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean Kitchen with all you need to cook. Large comfortable bed.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,3rd time and still a charm! Repeat guest and will book again next time in town!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place! This home is comfortable, spotlessly clean, and had all the essentials we needed. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a home downtown. Bonus for our stay was the amazing luxurious spa across the courtyard and additional 10% discount because of where we stayed. Would love to come back again and again. Our host made our stay the best by being so understanding and accommodating!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location with walking access to the river and town. Lovely place and really comfortable beds. Description and photos matched the experience.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was looking for a private place while being within walking distance to casinos, restaurants etc. Nicholas’ place fit the bill. Ample living space, lots of natural light, comfortable beds, pristine kitchen with all necessary amenities, and fabulous shower. Not only was the place perfect in almost every way, Nicholas was incredibly responsive and friendly. I plan to visit Reno again in the near future and will definitely book with Nicholas again. I highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy and comfortable space in a great location for a first time visit to Reno! Nic's instructions (which included pictures) made it super easy to find the house, check in, and immediately feel comfortable. Easily walkable to downtown Reno, and the beds were super comfy! Plenty of amenities and furnishings that would be a great addition if you have a multi-night stay. Just be aware if you're traveling with pups, that though the patio is fenced in, it's a shared space that is completely paved and isn't a great space to let your dogs out and roam off leash."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nic was extremely accommodating and ensured that we were happy with our stay throughout. Also extremely fast to respond to any questions we had.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyable stay at this spacious well-cared for property. Very responsive to our questions. Keurig and coffee was provided. Will book again if we have family with us. Two comfortable king size beds and meticulous linens.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean and comfortable home⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at this home! We visit Reno a couple times a year and always enjoy being near the river and downtown area. This is the first time we got an airbnb in the area (versus a hotel) and this home fit our needs perfectly. For a family of 3, there was plenty of room. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen was clean and modern. And the dog friendliness was definitely a plus! We brought our two dogs and it was easy to take them around for walks near the river and in the neighborhood. I would recommend this home highly! We would love to stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very responsive and great home. Very lovely and comfortable

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was an amazing stay everything was close by, would definitely recommend for anyone staying in the Reno area."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, safe, and convenient location -- just 1.5 blocks from the river. Easy walk to riverside restaurants. Very clean, spacious and tastefully decorated! Great kitchen! Our only negative was the noise of the heater/AC fan, which kept coming on even when the heater was off. I suspect Nic will have it fixed soon."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for a week, wifi was good during the week for work, very comfortable space. The unit is standalone, set behind a house that serves as a massage spa and you face that building from the main windows, there are random patrons sharing your walkway and shared patio space, but not a big deal. The unit is clean, a little dark but decorated nicely, owned by a few folks who own a few locations in Reno with the goal to crank out renters. We had an issue with our shower upon arrival and the host had a cleaner come by very quickly. Location is walkable to the river, and about 15-20 minutes walk from Midtown. If you go a few blocks in the opposite direction it gets a little dumpy but easy to avoid. We felt safe and we liked having the riverwalk to jog and walk the dog to. A nice place for a short stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place tucked into the world’s biggest little city. I highly recommend and would come back to visit!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a place to stay near downtown Reno.

Nicolas is an incredibly responsive host and would answer any questions we had. I would absolutely stay here again if I'm in the area."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled from out of state for our daughter’s freshman orientation at UNR. The house was as described. Super close to campus as well as close to all that downtown Reno has to offer. Nicolas was quick to reply and sent clear instructions ,so Self Check in was easy. Having off street parking available was convenient as we have a full size truck . The home is quiet, super clean & beds are very comfortable . We really enjoyed the stylish decor. All the basic amenities were avail and we really enjoyed the coffee station. We didn’t use it but there is a washer and dryer in the finished basement if needed. We look forward to renting this property again for our future visits to Reno ."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visited Reno for the first time with a close friend and Nicolas’s place was PERFECT. Walking distance to everything you’d want while also being a peaceful, quiet retreat. The place was clean and beautifully renovated and you can’t beat the price for this quality of accommodation! The unit is also behind a lovely spa that I took advantage of (and thoughtfully, a coupon was provided in the unit). Nicolas was also very communicative and reachable. He checked in on a daily basis to ensure we were enjoying our stay. WHEN I come back to Reno, I will certainly stay at Nicolas’s because I couldn’t imagine a better set up. I’d also tell anyone else who’s going to Reno to stay there!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved how spotlessly clean it was. Comfortable beds and lounge room furniture. Some very nice decor. We appreciated the toy basket. It was great to be so close to the beautiful river walk, which we enjoyed in both directions. Also easy to walk downtown to museums and shops. This was one of the nicer Airbnbs that we have stayed in."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house is so cute and perfect location. Host checked in multiple times to make sure everything was going okay. Quiet and house had everything we needed or could think of.

The kitchen was very well stocked and it is always very convenient to have good laundry washer/dryer machines right in the house. Would very highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the great place to stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 6 had an amazing time at Nicolas AirBNb. It’s location is amazing. The house is at 5 minute drive from all the casinos and there is a shopping center 7 minutes drive away, with an In n out,Starbucks, Mountain Mike, Chipotle and more. So no struggling to find were to eat. Also we took our kids sledding/tubing to a spot that was a 30min drive from the house and it was amazing the kids had so much fun. So if your traveling with little ones this spots perfect. Master bed room has a king size bed and spear room a queen and they also have a playpin available to use as a crib if you have an infant. They kitchen has all the necessary tools for us to cook breakfast for the kids. We will definitely be booking again."

We had some issues with the heater in the first night, but it was solved quickly. The communication is smooth and easy. The location is great too. Many good restaurants around and a lake nearby allows us to walk our dog easily."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and stylish spaces in a really central location near the nicer part of Reno's downtown- just 1 block off the riverwalk. Perfect place if you're traveling with a dog because the riverwalk and nearby parks are steps away, along with a bunch of really great coffeeshops."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nics Air BnB is in a perfect location in Reno walking distance to the casinos and restaurants. Great location to drive to the mountains as well and close to the highway. Place is perfect for 2-4 people, very clean, very comfortable and warm.
Will be back again for sure."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I live on the road in my RV and haven’t been in one place long enough to do some of the more mundane things like washing the van (first wash in 3 months). Other than that I had some custom upgrades done to the RV and needed 7 days in town just in case my outfitter needed extra time. I was able to get a lot of personal things accomplished as well. All in all, a productive week. Still a bit reserved going out in public (bars & restaurants) as long as Covid is circulating. So, this Airbnb was ideally suited for my needs, great kitchen! Personally, I loved the privacy of the unit in back with a wonderful brick courtyard. I didn’t need the extra bedroom but loved having the spacious living room…the internet was much faster than I’m accustomed to on the road and practically used it the whole time I was there. I recommend this Airbnb."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this house SO MUCH!! Everything about my stay was absolutely perfect. From the moment that I walked in, the house was even more beautiful and spacious than expected, and I kinda wished that I didn't have any plans so I could have spent more time enjoying it. I loved the location—a short drive to a bunch of hip restaurants, the furnishings are brand spanking new and gorgeous, the beds and linens were super comfortable, the kitchen was perfectly equipped, and the interior courtyard was ideal for my two dogs to have a safe place to romp for a bit. And Nic was ever the helpful host...making sure I had everything I needed and was readily available. I loved my stay here and will be looking to book again the next time I'm in Reno. Thank you, Nic!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place to stay!!!! Cannot recommend this highly enough. Super clean, really really well decorated and so comfortable. We absolutely loved our stay here. Really great location, just a couple blocks from the river walk and local coffee shops and restaurants. Felt like coming home. The kitchen has beautiful natural light and the living room and bedrooms are very cozy and inviting. The patio has a fenced yard which was great for our pup. The check in was super easy and Nicolas was very helpful and responsive. Unbelievable value for what you get!! Very clean washer dryer in the basement. If you are looking for a place to stay in Reno, look no further."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying here. A great value and had the necessary amenities. Great place to stop for the night. Also the neighborhood felt safe which was a plus!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying at The Dish was great. Highly recommend!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a pleasant stay! We were only there for a couple of nights to hit a concert and the venue was just a few minutes from the house! We walked to virginia street, it was a very easy and peaceful walk to midtown. 10/10 would come back again. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Levi's stay was a great little spot for our night in Reno. The area was quiet and felt homey and the hot tub was a great perk! We would definitely look this stay up the next time we are in Reno.😊

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Levi was an incredible host and quick to get back to us if there were any problems (Really the only problem was the power went out a couple of times but it was only related to the wind which is well known in the area!). The Dish was a cute and small house, perfect for 2 people. Date nights for couples (especially with the jacuzzi behind it), or maybe you have a concert to go to and live a bit away from Reno, like my wife and I (we live 50miles away) and you want a quick and easy place to stay. Or even just a weekend away in a relaxing and quiet neighborhood where you dont even have to leave the house. It's very close to Midtown and Downtown where there are so many places for food and romantic or fun activities. I would DEFINITELY recommend Levi and The Dish to anyone!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great find and the perfect place for a night's stay nearby Lake Tahoe, about an hour drive from Reno. Kenny was a great host. He gave helpful instructions and communicated well and also made the check-in and check-out process very simple. Check-in was very flexible, which was a huge plus for me.

He has awesome taste , skill sets and communication . He is the ""total package !"""
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would suggest reading other reviews, as all the information has already been shared by others. I just didn't read it carefully. If you are looking for just a place to spend the night and not spend any time in the room, this is the place. The tenants on the upper level would get noisy sometimes late at night (11pm and after), the walls are paper thin so you hear everything. This is not a high traffic area otherwise it would be much worse. I received clear instructions for check in/out, never had any issues so there was no need to further communicate with my host. There is NO hair dryer so come prepared for that."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Earle and Lorraine were fantastic hosts! Their place was absolutely charming, clean, and perfectly located for our needs. They were incredibly responsive throughout our stay, answering any questions we had quickly and efficiently.
The unit itself offered plenty of amenities and was conveniently located to The Convention Center. The only minor things to note for future guests, (and certainly not dealbreakers for us), were the stairs leading down to the unit, which were a bit long and on the steeper side, and the use of a traditional key instead of a keypad for entry. Unfortunately, one night we used the wrong lock and came back late from volleyball to find we locked ourselves out. Thankfully, Earle and Lorraine were very accommodating and resolved the situation quickly. Their hospitality truly went above and beyond!
Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Earle and Lorraine's place. They are fantastic hosts, and we highly recommend their charming studio."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to Lorraine for the quick feedback and the cozy room, feels like a second home during my stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while attending a conference at the Peppermill. This place is a 5 minute walk away, and I appreciated that it was comfortable and had a kitchen. Much nicer than paying ""resort fees"" and having to pay super high prices for food and drink at the Peppermill."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"This is someone home not built to be an apartment, hotel or anything else, the walls and ceiling are paper thin so you can hear there washer going all day and night (they usually keep it going all day and pretty late) and their bathroom is located somewhere over the bed so you can hear that too. The water heater isn’t big if someone else decides to take a long shower you have to deal with no hot water.
The fridge is horrible either everything is frozen or your ice cream is melting, no in between. Lot of noise from the apartments nearby, there was graffiti on there hand rail walking down to my front door, then once you got down there the shade covering the fence is peeling back in a few places just felt really trashy. And sorta disgusted me when my friends had to drop me off there. The two host were very understanding and nice and responded in a mannerly time. They provide everything you need to get through your stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, this was my second time staying there. They always respond right away and the bed is very comfortable. They also decorated for Christmas which was a nice touch."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, very responsive! The bed is very comfortable. Great area. The only down side is you had to walk downstairs to get to the room and I had heavy bags. It’s not a big deal if you have a small bag."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earle place was fine! The best thing I can say was the closeness to pepper mil resort like 8-10 minutes! I liked the parking place very much and it was worth it! Only problem was the stairs that needed concrete repair ! Thank you Earle
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I've stayed at this airbnb. The host is awesome and super responsive and the unit is clean.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, exactly as pictured. Great washer and good tub😉 12 long and wide steps in disrepair made it challenging for my short old legs🥴. Clean and cool in the 103 heat! Neighborhood unappealing. Good treats left for us😋"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first trip to Reno. I’m so glad I chose to stay here. It was a nice, cozy place with plenty of room for my needs. I really appreciated the option of a washer/dryer set on site, even though I ended up not needing it. The little offerings on the table and complimentary coffee were a nice touch, and I mostly enjoyed the smart TV and apps for my downtime spent in the room. It helped pass the time quite nicely. Room was centrally located to all the places I needed to go, and if I make it back to Reno, I will check for the availability here first. Thank you again for the warm and welcoming accommodations."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earle’s place was perfect for what I needed. There were some homeless folks sleeping right on the street where I parked but they were nice and didn’t bother me. The apartments next door were a little loud and I could h hear the people walking around upstairs all the time. I got the place because it was walking distance to Peppermill and it wasn’t expensive. Everything on the inside was nice and clean. He had everything I would have needed if I decided to cook. I would stay there again.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are a solo traveler and want a CLEAN place to stay that feels safe, this is it. Amazingly decorated, good smelling roomy airbnb studio. The giant bathroom is one of the best parts. Sometimes you hear the upstairs neighbors, but nothing obnoxious. It is more like normal life noise.
Great week-long stay. Thanks!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Easy check in and convenient location, great host as well."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot near casino. Comfy
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks for a quiet, clean place to lay my head. And thanks for the iron--I needed it for my wrinkly shirt. :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"VERY clean basic studio space with a comfortable bed and a great shower. The location was very close to the Peppermill, which is where I was attending a conference, although the neighborhood is a little noisy. It calmed down early for my stay on all but one night, and I would speculate it might have been louder to stay at the hotel. Host communication is good and you can tell they really care. Overall I would recommend (especially if you have things to do nearby), and I would stay here again if I'm ever in Reno in the future."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love the place, super clean, I love the bed 😉😉"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Earle’s place was super clean, the AC was life saving, and had all the essentials I needed. If I need to come back to Reno I will stay here again. My only complaint is that upstairs there is a dog that cries throughout the day/night sometimes but I’m a heavy sleeper so it didn’t bother me."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very clean and just like the pictures
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Earle’s place is great for location, accommodation, and relaxation. Secluded and quiet, will stay again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice and helpful. Made sure everything was great for my stay.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. Only if the internet was working, it would have been great. It was an inconvenience not having service or being able to watch tv."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Earle’s place was an adequate place to stay in for the one night I was in town.
Location was great for us as we wanted to be near the Convention Center and airport. The neighborhood wasn’t the best, but the unit was inside facing and quiet. I felt safe, but opted to drive instead of walk around the area.
Check in process was a breeze. There are stairs you need to go down to get to the unit.
Inside, the place was very clean and had plenty space for me and my husband. Shower, toilet and sink were a bit small in size. Overall it was a motel/basement vibe, and not in a bad way.
The internet was knocked out during our stay and our Verizon and ATT phone receptions did not work down there either, which meant we couldn’t use their Roku TV or our phones. They did offer to send someone over right away that evening, but we declined since we were only there for a bit.
There was an AC window unit that was pretty loud when it would click on at night and it didn’t work as hard as my husband would’ve like, so we didn’t sleep well even with me having ear plugs. I would recommend keeping the fan on instead of the ac unit for consistent white noise.
It’s unfortunate, but I think if there wasn’t a heat wave and if we had working internet our stay would’ve been more pleasurable, but those were just the circumstances we were given, and I bet this unit would’ve been a great stay otherwise."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great stay! Would book again. Thank you, Earle!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy check in clean room and good location. Host is very communicative and makes every effort to make sure your stay is good.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"was quaint and cozy, worked really well for a short solo trip!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient location to the airport. The unit was clean and felt safe. As a note, the window air conditioner is directly by the bed which didn't bother me except each time it kicked on, I had to turn the volume way up on the TV then way down when the AC would kick off. Other than that, it's a nice place."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very accurate description! Great location, very cozy, easy check-in and check-out, and great price for the listing! I was attending a conference at the Peppermill Resort, so this location was very ideal for traveling to and from the Peppermill each day (about a 5-10min walk). At night, the surrounding area seemed a little sketchy, but I did not have any issues."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Centrally located, comfortable bed, great place to stay! Will definitely stay here again next time I am in Reno!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place exceeded my expectations! Very cute layout and place, the bed was comfortable, and Sacha and Earle were very communicative. The location was perfect for what I needed, too."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay at Earle and Sacha's place. The location couldn't be more convenient and the studio is spacious and well equipped. Definitely far better than staying in a hotel room! We will definitely look to stay here again next time we are in Reno.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Will definitely book again next time I'm in Reno.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve use this residence as they have two separate units. Both of which are very comforting and I will continue to use this Air Bnb I’m given the opportunity. I would highly suggest taking advantage of this comfortable space.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy place. Very clean and quiet. Would definitely go back.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I love this place. Very close to Virginia Lake and a short drive to Lakeside Mall and Plumb Lane. A stones throw from the Peppermill for those who enjoy casinos.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and clean and pretty much exactly as described. I had business at the convention center during my stay and would just walk there. Took about 15 minutes is all so good location if your stay is because of convention center happenings. Also good if you don’t want to deal with casino obnoxiousness if you were to stay at Atlantis.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is very good value for the money and comes with everything one could need. My experience could not have been better.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place about a mile north of the convention center. Very comfortable bed, large closet for clothes to be hung up, and coffee provided was a nice perk. The neighborhood is a little sketchy though, right across from a trailer park (I was hit up for smokes from a stranger immediately upon exiting my Uber). Overall recommended, just be mindful of your surroundings."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A really great spot! Especially if you have to be at the Peppermill for a week but don’t want to pay the high resort fees! Safe! Nice! Private!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was attending a conference at the Reno-Sparks Conference Center and this was a great alternative to the noisy, glitzy, smoke-filled hotel/casinos nearby (okay, I know that's exactly why some folks go to Reno, but if you don't want to experience that 24/7 read on). It was a short 15 minute walk to the conference center and even closer to the two main hotels (Atlantis and Peppermill), so when I had enough of conferencing I could slip away to this nice, quiet island of comfort and serenity. The hosts were welcoming and attentive and the place was sparkling."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest place to rent for a weekend trip! I loved that it was very close to the strip but far enough away from the all night activities. This property is very up dated and clean! The Hosts are amazing! They made sure that they were available if we needed anything at all. We will be renting this property again!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Quick to respond to any and all issues.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place tucked away very close to casinos. Was as advertised and will stay here again.
,,,"This is a nicely remodeled house. It is labeled ""pet friendly"" and we have stayed numerous times in various places that are pet friendly as well with no traces of prior occupants. However, this house should be classified as ""Only for people with pets"" because we came into a residence with so much pet hair all over the house. From sitting on the living room sofa to getting into the beds, our clothes were filled with white pet hair. Reached out to the host and we were told around midnight that a cleaning crew could be provided, at midnight.... or another accommodation, at midnight.... Please beware, only stay here if you are willing and do not mind pet hair. This is not a home for those that want something clear of pet hair on their belongings."
