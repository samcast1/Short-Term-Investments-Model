2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at this place. It looks exactly like the pictures they posted , easy to find close to all major routes and closest to the Weirs beach which we loved , the rooms were big enough with enough closet space and bathrooms were clean and everything worked fine, the rooms were very spacious as well. It had enough room to fit 5 people easily with a pull out sofa bed . The kitchen was well equipped with all the necessities you can ask for. They even had a umbrella for a rainy day and also a cooler , beach towels and also a well equipped grill. They made sure everything was comfortable and easy to find. This property is right on the Lake which makes it even more exciting , they have canoes, paddle boats etc for summer fun !
The property manager and the owner are super prompt and get going to solve any problems and they are very easy to communicate. We had peaceful days around the lake and will not hesitate to book again !!
Thank you Manny and Kyle !!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great find for our short weekend trip. It was nice and quiet but close to anything you could want to do in/around the lake.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Manish was a wonderful host. What a beautiful stay! Great views, great relaxation in the hot tub looking out at the lake. Cannot wait to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Don’t hesitate. Perfect location no matter what the season and the greatest hosts. They have put a lot of work and attention into the details for these condo’s.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time with family and friends! Highly recommend this place !
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place and a fantastic caring, professional and friendly host. Will be going back with a much bigger group."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property on the lake. Incredible view. Very private and intimate community. The apartment is clean, new, and tastefully decorated. The host was very responsive and helpful. It’s perfect for couples and families with older children. The apartment is two floors and bedrooms are on separate level which made it a little concerning for our family with two young children but we made it work. Will stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time at Manish’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The surrounding is beautiful and quiet! Would absolutely recommend staying here!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at this cottage. It was impressively well-equipped, providing everything we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. It's the most well-equipped Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The thoughtful attention to detail was evident in the abundance of amenities and supplies, making it an ideal choice for families. The cleanliness of the place was impeccable.
What truly stole the show was the breathtaking, unobstructed view of the lake. It was a serene and picturesque sight, with nothing but lush greenery across the lake. Our mornings were spent sipping coffee by the lakeside and we roasted marshmallows around a fire pit at night.
The host was very communicative and responsive. Clear instructions were given and he was proactive - checking in with us to make sure everything was good.
We will definitely be back here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing views, brand new unit, very comfortable and beautifully designed. Had everything that we imagined from pictures of this listing."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful night at Steven's place. Absolutely loved the fire pit, sitting and enjoying coffee on the back deck, and the bed was very comfy. Laconia is a quirky little town that was cool to check out. Walkable from the apartment, but lots of parking downtown too, if you opt to drive. I highly recommend Trillium farm to table for a bite to eat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as pictured, a very scenic view from the backyard and very comfortable living arrangements inside. It is also easily walkable to town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven was amazing very responsive and understanding, helped me out with my situation."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Solid spot only 15 mins Gunstock. Host communicated well and gave clear instructions all around. Wasn’t crazy about the parking but it wasn’t anything major. Really nice, clean space on the waterfront. Would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed my stay with my two teen daughters. Accommodations were as described and very nice. Fire pit by the lake and dock was extra special. I may not have noticed in the description that the game room isn't heated so it's cold in the winter, but all in all what a great spot. We would return if we're in this area again. Thank you Steven."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very convenient to downtown, fabulous view and all round great place"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to retreat for a quick getaway. Having the river in the backyard was lovely, even though it was chilly and we couldn’t fully take advantage of it. We did take advantage of the backyard fire pit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This rental is in such a beautiful location--backing onto a little river with its own dock and fire pit right by the water. My wife and I took the provided kayaks out for a morning paddle and had a lovely time. The house is extremely walkable to the shops and restaurants downtown, too.
Inside, this rental is nicely furnished and comfortable. We had an especially excellent night's sleep in the larger bedroom, too. Thanks for a lovely visit, Steven!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful spot
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was very welcoming! We had so much fun playing pool and visiting in the area!!! Everything we needed was at our fingertips! Great stay even though we only were there for one night!!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This waterfront property was amazing! Checking in and out was very easy, and the host was very communicative. The nearby restaurants were fantastic. The outdoor area by the river was a real treat. Also, there was a great cat that came by a few times and hung out with us. Would absolutely stay at this property again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in a great location while myself, husband and friends were seeing a concert! Love the outdoor space the most!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Would stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the kayaking was great!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Loved the game room. Could just stay in there having fun for a long time
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. We look forward to staying here in the future.
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Could use more air conditioners. Room darkening curtains. Shower head leaked and left puddle on the floor. Broken handles on bureau. Outdoor furniture was old and dirty. Parking was not great. Kept getting blocked in.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve's place was perfect for our overnight after a concert at the Pavillion! just right for 2 couples. The place was spotless and modern, and the outdoor area was really nice. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to use the kayaks or take advantage of the fire pit, but everything was just as described."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, comfortable, clean space in a great location! Steven’s place was perfect for an overnight stay—big, comfortable beds, clean/updated house, right on the river and close to lots of things to do."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Steven was easy to communicate and the Airbnb was great! Definitely recommend :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great set up with a bunch of amenities on site--from a pool table, to a fire pit, to kayaks, to two nice porches, etc. What's included with the rental allows for a sort of self-contained vacation, with more than enough to keep an entire family satisfied. Steven was also very responsive/communicative. This place makes for an excellent get away."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Steven was responsive, helpful, and flexible. Anyone looking for a stay in the area should start here. Absolutely would come back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent location to Bank of NH Pavilion. House was welcoming, up to date, and had many thoughtful amenities (blankets for sitting by the fire and marshmallows provided!).
Well equipped kitchen. Great 3 season hang out room w/ pool table, games and huge TV. Only complaint- we only had time to stay one night. We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for two couples to stay and attend a concert nearby.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and location! Steven was great and had good communication.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was perfect for our needs 2 couples for a wedding overnight I reached out to Stephen about possibility of checking in early and he very accommodating. The house was beautiful and clean, wish we could have spent more time in the space."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second time here and it does not disappoint. Close to the NH Pavillion which is why we rented only wish we did two
Nights to exlploee the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun place. Close to downtown Laconia, but the leafy backyard faced the river and made it feel like you were far from the city. Kayaks and lovely outdoor seating were available but (unfortunately) it was raining during most of our stay, so we did not get to use them."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very comfortable and provided 3 outdoor seating spaces. A covered front porch, deck with umbrella table for 4 and the riverfront money shot. We chose this location because it is 15 mins from Bank of America Pavilion. We really enjoyed our stay. The king bed was amazingly comfortable and great linens. Nicely stocked kitchen which we definitely used. The cutting board is attached to the counter next to stove and wish there had been a loose one to sit and chop. The shower was a little tricky but water is amply Hot. We did use the outside grill which was fabulous. I liked the fridge with the water/ice maker. There wasn’t a pitcher to make Crystal light in and coffee situation is Keurig only. Four people can fit in the kitchen but not all at same table. Not a big deal in summer. Aesthetically pleasing decor and furniture. Although bathroom layout was different than expected. The light switches were a bit confusing but we had fun figuring it out. all in all a wonderful time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful river that flows through the backyard.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Everything was perfect, would recommend and stay again in the future :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED it here! Home away from home! Great that it was right on the water with ways to get to Opechee Bay by Kayaks (that are supplied)! Beautiful kitchen, updated bathrooms and a fun game room! Other than messaging him before I got there and him messaging we could go in a little earlier, I never had to contact him again. There were clear instructions or helpful notes around the house, so I never needed to speak with him. Not gonna lie, I kinda liked that! I would totally stay here again, but for longer than a few days! Thank you Steven!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"In general, this was a really nice spot and I would recommend it. Steven was a great communicator and answered all of our questions. The location worked well for us and the space was clean and well appointed. Minor challenges: The layout of the place is a bit awkward - you have to walk through the bathroom to access the back yard (you have to walk around to the front door if someone is using the bathroom to get back into the house). Reversing the crowded shared driveway is challenging. There are two window A/C units that don't cool the entire house, but sleeping temp was fine. The back yard space is nice, but quite close to neighbors (noisy) with a couple unattended dogs and a cat that came through to visit. The river was running high/strong - great to jump in and cool off, but weak swimmers should not let go of the dock. It is a very nice place, but maybe not quite as secluded or high-end as you might expect from the photos."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was in a great location, very stylish and perfect for my family and I."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven’s place was just what we hoped - a conveniently located (saw a show at the Bank of NH Pavilion), clean, and fun place (loved the pool table, dart board, and even the indoor basketball hoop!). Would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable accommodations. Very convenient to Bank of NH Pavilion.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Steven’s home was beautiful and we loved staying there. We were in town for a concert and wish we’d stayed another night so we could enjoy more time at the house! We’ll be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,House was great. The beds were comfortable and the gazebo area is lovely!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very pleased with our stay
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Steven’s place. We had a *very* unique situation in that it was crazy warm during our trip. Like in the mid to upper 80s F. We were also traveling with two small children.
Things that went great:
- Check-in - easy peasy, great communication with something that turned out to be a complete non-issue.
- Kitchen - everything we needed.
- 1.5 baths were great
- Washer dryer very convenient worked great
- Beds are comfortable
- Water was chilly but swimable
- Outdoor space was so nice for meals and happy hour
Things that were challenging:
- There is one window unit in the main bedroom but the house stayed at 80+ degrees all day and night. We were baseline really hot the whole trip. We all 4 had to sleep in one bedroom and couldn’t really enjoy spending time in the house. I totally understand that this is a unique situation given the weather.
- We had a larger rental car and had a little trouble navigating the driveway and felt bad asking neighbors to move their car"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, super responsive host! Would def return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish we had more time to enjoy this beautiful place. Definitely worth staying. Steven sent clear instructions, notes he left inside were very helpful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay with friends at Steven's place and would stay here again. We went to a concert at the nearby Bank of NH Pavilion and enjoyed the backyard fire pit, and of course watching the Red Sox beat TB Rays on the porch."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location on the water. Steven provided brand new kayaks that you could easily launch on the water. Grill, outdoor seating area, everything was great for an early summer weekend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location - really pretty river setting. The house had all the amenities one could need and was well-stocked and clean.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. So cute and cozy!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,the stay was great! the view was beautiful and the host was kind enough to leave us with everything we need to start a fire as well as ingredients to make s’mores. a lovely place to stay if you’re looking for a little getaway!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was me and some friends, for my birthday! We had so much fun, the place was clean and the pool table was great! Also the fire pit in front of the lake, very peaceful!! Love it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven's place felt so comfortable. Sitting by the fire under the pergola, right on the river in the evening was outstanding."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Excellent host.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The house is great for the vacation stay. All the amenities are as described. There is a beautiful sitting area with fire pit along the river. We didn't have enough dry fire wood so it took time to light fire but was an amazing experience. Steven even had smores ingredients and long fork ready for us. The game room was little chilly compared to rest of the house and Steven had a note about it attached to the door. But with everyone in the game room, the temperature was ok after sometime. We couldn't take the kayak out because it was raining but they are available for guests to use. Overall, quiet and cozy spot for vacation."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked the waterfront property for a girls night out with a friend from out of town. We spent most of our time sitting out by the river. The property was well kept, beautiful, had a lot to do and was perfect for two couples or two friends to share a peaceful getaway.
Beds were super cozy, kitchen well stocked, clear instructions (tips)all over the house, and close to a ton of places to visit. Steven was super responsive and a generous host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my fourth time staying at Stevens, and it’s become a yearly tradition! We love it here and can’t wait to come back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! We enjoyed the outside area and exploring the lake regions! Steven was a great host!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place and very nice time in your place.
Hope to see you soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very spacious house for 4. We had a lots of fun.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Will have to do it again
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. Plenty of space for 4. We had such a wonderful time. The outdoor area was amazing. Steven was quick to respond and super helpful when we needed it.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful home, Steven was amazing and incredibly responsive and accomodating, beautiful area. definitely worth the money and some!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was such an amazing Airbnb! Steven was very descriptive of the place and how to check in and out. The place was BEAUTIFUL, Steven was an amazing host, left us extra instructions, with some goodies to make us feel right at home!! Cannot wait to book it again in the summer 😊"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best air bnb’s I have ever stayed at. The house was incredibly clean and very big! The pictures don’t do the house enough justice. It may look a little bit smaller, but in person it is a very spacious house. I had my anniversary there and the host even left us a bottle of champagne and two glasses along with a note to celebrate. He also left us snacks and any amenities that we needed. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs it and is in the area! I will definitely be coming back in the summer, thank you so much Steven for an amazing stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for a ski weekend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the location and the place! Such a cozy spot and right on the water! Planning to go back next year :)
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Steven's place was super easy. We loved the pool table room and basically spent our whole time there. He has a heater fan ready to go which warms it up so it's not freezing in the winter. The LED lights around the room were sweet! Real clean house with plenty of dishes and cups to use, pretty much everything was there you needed. The beds were big and comfy. I can't say anything negative, the only thing to note is the house is shared with an upstairs unit, so can be a little on the louder side at times but it's very very faint, mainly just footsteps. We were also able to get a fire going with the set of wood he had provided for us."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Steven’s place was great — the location was perfect, the place was cozy & clean, and we wish we had more time there. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy house with a very nice kitchen and wonderful host. It’s on the creek near the lake on a slightly busy street but the backyard is very serene. A great stay for warm weather months but the room with the pool table was too cold to use during our stay in January. The beds were extremely comfortable!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place to stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Perfect escape!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely recommend staying here!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! If you’re looking for a stay in Laconia. This is a great stay! The house is clean, spacious, and the host was very nice. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here while visiting our family in Laconia! Beautiful spot right on the water. Would love to come back in the summer to use the kayaks!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have booked multiple stays over the past 4 years and this place was THE BEST by far! My friends and I get together for a girls' weekend every 6 months, and we all agreed this place takes the cake.
Steven's communication was quick and accommodating from the moment I booked. He was attentive to our needs, as he let us check in earlier than expected. While we were there, we didn't need much, because of the countless little details that were thought about. Here are a few: Poo Pourri in the bathrooms, duraflame and wood logs for the fire pit, blankets for sitting by the fire, and make up face cloths (black material-I've never seen these before!) At one point the can opener wasn't working and he dropped off a new one within minutes. :) There is also another hostess in case you can't get in touch with Steven, and seven she responded quickly.
The location was beautiful and just what 4 working moms needed to relax. We sat outside by the lake during the day and at night. The view was peaceful and serene. When we felt like a change in location, we went inside and played pool, sat on the front porch and enjoyed the halloween decor, and then sat on the side deck to sip coffee, eat dinner, etc. The possibilities were endless.
The beds and pillows were very comfortable- slept like a baby. There was a TV in every room, and even though we mostly agreed to watch The Crown (ha!), we did split up and have different viewing rooms. We obeyed quiet hours @ 10:00PM, however, neighbors didn't as they woke us up @ 2:30AM- only noise complaint. They were only outside, by the street bedroom, for a few minutes though.
We were able to park our two cars easily, however, my friend found it treacherous trying to back out as there were other cars lining the side of the drive. Not a deal breaker, but something to know if you have a larger car.
We didn't feel the need to go anywhere while we were there, however, it was very close to grocery shopping, breakfast at the Union Diner, and shopping at Chaos and Kindness. We even ventured out to Weir's Beach, but it was closed for the season.
In all, we cherished our time here, and would definitely definitely come back- if he'll have us!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay! gorgeous clean beautifully designed and very easy friendly host!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Laconia was a great spot to explore the rest of the lake area and we appreciated the close distance to downtown/restaurants. The bedrooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms were well stocked. Appreciated the coffee and creamer being stocked! We loved seeing the cat too!
Of note, this is the bottom floor of a shared house, so you can hear the upstairs neighbors at times, but not enough to be bothersome. Additionally, the only complaint I have was the fabric on the couch was worn and beginning to peel off on us while sitting. Everything else was great!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steven's Airbnb felt so cozy and the fire-pit patio along the water was perfect for enjoying the fall weather. We loved the close proximity to Laconia and zipping up to the Franconia Notch from the house was a breeze. The experience staying at this Airbnb was wonderful and we would stay again in a heartbeat!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steven’s listing is a great spot for a staycation. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the proximity to various hikes in the area and the local coffee shop + bakery (Wayfarer and the Laconia Village Bakery). There’s also a grill on the porch that we used to make dinner the first night. Would love to come back here again in the future!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’re repeat guests. Steven does everything right as a host and includes a house cat! We’ll see him next year! Salut Steven 🥂🍻
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Clean, safe, and great location!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic place to stay - beautiful setting and a lot of charm. A great location to explore the lakes area from. Steven was a very responsive host and had a lot of nice touches throughout the AirBnb. We loved the Smores and blankets and firewood for the firepit! Would recommend this to family and friends!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Great amenities including a billiards table!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven’s place is a gem! We loved sitting on the dock and watching the light change throughout the afternoon. The house is super clean, well appointed with thick towels and nice beds - lovely touches like marshmallows for toasting - everything was just great! Thank you so much!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is beautiful! Walking distance to downtown, the Cake Theater and several restaurants. But enough away from downtown that house is peaceful and quiet. The backyard overlooking the water was tranquil and relaxing. Firepit was all set up with wood, fire starters and even items to make Smores left for us in the kitchen! Everything was spotless and in perfect working condition.
Many Decorations were fall themed and was a nice touch."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a perfect Airbnb. I’ve stayed at many in the area and this place tops them all! Very clean, comfortable and a perfect location. Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tremendous place to stay for the IM Timberman 70.3!
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,Good location for events at Bank of New Hampshire Pavillion.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven was great, he was very responsive. Let us even check in earlier then check in time. Very clean and nice area to stay at. It was perfect for us since the concert we were going to was only 15 minutes away!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great. AC in the bedrooms make it a cool nights sleep. A short drive to Gilford beach for swimming, walking distance to the convenience store. Fire pit made for a great night!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Steven was really easy to work with. Would definitely book again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely clean and organized house. Everything looks brand new. Very spacious inside. We loved the fire pit out back along the river with access to kayaks.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a such a great time here. The house had games, a pool table, fire pit and so much more fun things to do! We would definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicely renovated antique home on the water in Laconia. Easy parking, comfortable beds, close to main roads and restaurants. Lots of room."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a small family hang. Very clean and comfortable outside and inside. We spent a lot of time chatting under the pergola, cooking, playing pool and swimming. The water has a bit of a current from the lock which made it fun exercise for swimming. Dogs had a blast! Even watching tv is more fun on vacation and we binge-watched trash shows in between."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steven's Airbnb is by far one of the best places I have stayed. Steven made the check-in and check-out process easy. The Airbnb was clean and well stocked. There were so many nice touches and felt homey. We will be back next year!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. It was clean and had everything you could ask for. Perfect location. Beautiful scenery. And again sooooo clean! The host was very accommodating and responsive. 10/10 recommend this place and would definitely come back again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean home right on the water. We enjoyed the use of the fire pit too
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven was a great host. He was able to accommodate us for an early check-in and gave us great recommendations in the area where we were able to go for lunch. The check-in process was easy and although we only stayed there for one night, it was perfect for our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer! It had everything we needed and then some. It was very clean and spacious, and had a lovely outdoor area right on the water. Would definitely come back again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a nice stay at Steve’s place! It’s a great setup if you are vacationing with another couple! We had plenty of room and did not feel like we were in each other’s way. Love the game room and backyard!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful property! Clean & well appointed. Steven reached out to us immediately on our arrival to make sure we had everything we needed. We enjoyed the kayaks, fire pit & pool table. Would definitely stay again. My only suggestion: Some cereal & soup bowls."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location and amenities!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! Gorgeous and spacious location right on the water. This home is close to lots of shopping, restaurants, and the concert venue was less than 15 min. Thank you Steven!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! & Peaceful spot in the back on the water.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for kayaking.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very old home that was re-done in a old, sketchy part of town (lots of recovery centers) & wanderer’s. The neighbors used more of the yard deck and driveway than we did and there was very little to no privacy. We saw roaches in the house! Lots of cats roaming around… The kayaks were nice & the bedrooms were spacious. Well stocked. Owner was nice & available."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property with a ton of fun activities within the home. The waterfront channel is perfect for kayaking and the four of us had a ton of fun. Definitely a lot of value for the price and a ton of space to make memories! The host was super helpful and we ended up trying a couple of the places he recommended! The host also left some fire starter and wood so we were able to make a beautiful fire and s’mores! 10/10 :)
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"loved the fire starters and blankets that were provided! very spacious and looked just like the pictures. the lake is pretty clean so we were able to swim/float which was a great plus! well thought out details and great job by the host. it is a two unit home and we didn’t realize that until arriving, but other than that it met all expectations!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven’s home was beautiful, right on the water, and well kept. The check in process was simple and the home was close to the concert venue (which was our reason for our stay). I recommend Stevens home to anyone!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven’s place was great and very conveniently located to restaurants, breweries, and Bank of NH pavilion.
Check in was extremely convenient and Steven was responsive during our stay.
Would recommend if youre looking for a weekend getaway on the water!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at the waterfront. Although we were just there for one night and didn’t have time to enjoy all the property offered we were very happy with the space. Both bedrooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The house was clean and fit our needs perfectly. We didn’t have time to enjoy the game room, but would have if we had more time. And we only briefly had a chance to enjoy the outdoor space which was lovely. Wish we had time to kayak! The only thing to note is is that if you come and go through the back door you have to cut through the bathroom to get to the main house, not the end of the world for us, but worth a mention.
Overall we had a great stay and would come back again and recommend to others."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, we would stay there again"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a good stay at this location in Laconia. The house is extremely clean, comfortable and well stocked with linens, games etc. It made for a very relaxing stay. The host is very communicative and responds very quickly to requests. Highly recommend!
A couple of minor issues - one of our family members is allergic to cats and the property has two very friendly cats who like to get close when using the exterior spaces. That caused a minor concern for us given the allergy issue but, again, the host was responsive in trying to do their best to restrain the cats.
Light switches in the kitchen area (behind the umbrellas), living room, and bedroom are not immediately apparent, but of course available and working well."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven made this weekend feel like we were home, always checking in, making sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay to the fullest. Can’t wait to come back!!!! Ps we love maverick"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little spot for sure! Would definitely like to come back when it’s warmer out so I can enjoy the kayaks
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best host we’ve ever experienced. All of the extras that made this visit perfect. Welcoming cat, comfortable beds, make up wash clothes, full game room, fire starters, Tylenol, AC, too much to remember. Quickly answered a drunken text for takeout/delivery. We’re looking forward to booking again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful immaculate home. Cozy beds, wonderful three season room, amazing host and gorgeous waterfront area. Thank you so much! Highly recommended!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This bnb is fantastic! The playing space is full of fun and two bedroom, kitchen and living room are all clean and spacious. The host is friendly and respond really quickly to help you. Overall, highly recommended."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and great property!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stevens place is always a favorite for my friend and I. This is our third time staying here and it’s basically out home away from home at this point. Clean, & great communication"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time! Everything was clean. There’s so many things to do here and we appreciated all the little details for a fun/comfortable stay. Only thing that was bothersome was the upstairs neighbors who sounded like they were moving furniture at 1am, but I think this was probably just a one off! Other than that we really enjoyed our stay"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it! Best value out there!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steven's home was clean and comfortable. We slept like babies as the king bed was wonderful. The game room was a lot of fun.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,👍
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space right on the water. Walking distance to coffee shop, food, shops, etc. Steven was very responsive. Would stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent. A great place to stay for a nice relaxing weekend.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Steven has thought of everything for this place. What a spectacular spot to stay with friends or family. Honestly he has thought of everything that you would need. I recommend staying a few nights!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful gem on the river. This home is very quiet and extremely comfortable right down to the beds. Full of interesting decor and details, Steven’s place is charming and stylish. Highly recommend. The personal communication went above and beyond."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home could not have been in a better location to everything we needed. The outdoor space is so serene, and we will definitely book again once the warmer weather arrives so that we can fully take advantage of all of the amenities. The home itself is super spacious, very clean, and even more beautiful than the pictures! We had a blast playing in the pool room, especially because we were traveling with a 7 year old. There’s truly something for everyone here. Steven was super communicative and accommodating! Checking in and out was a breeze."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot! We were only there one night and it was too cold to spend time at the firepit or in the kayaks, but we hope to return for a longer stay in the summer!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5 rating for the host and stay! We arrived earlier than check in time but host tried best to let us in. Kids and dad had great time in the 3 season play room. Room was clean, and kitchen had all the utensils we need. I asked a few questions to Steven and he always responded within a few hours. He also make suggestions to the place to visit. Neighbors were polite. Easy access to the river and deck. One small catch is 3 reason play room's wifi is pretty slow but it was very useable in the kitchen area. Highly recommended."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful house- the neighborhood was nice and pretty quiet. Wish we could’ve stayed longer to use the fire pit. The attention to detail didn’t go unnoticed. Thank you!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment, close to town. Very comfortable and super easy check in/out!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! The game room and fire pit made our stay extra fun!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location only complaint would be that it wasn’t noted anywhere that you couldn’t use fireplace. Other nice clean place.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect apartment for a getaway weekend. We loved the view of the river and made good use of the fire pit. Location was great and easy to get to restaurants and outdoor activities. Steven was easy to communicate with, very thoughtful and prompt with responses. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steven's place is great! The location is awesome. My family and I stayed here so we could spend some time skiing at Gunstock. Plenty of restaurants and a well equipped kitchen made meals easy, too. The apartment is well stocked, and the beds were super comfy! We had a great time."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks so much for the lovely place. It was so cozy and just as described! Would recommend. Location is amazing also
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic launching point for skiing at Gunstock and walks to downtown Laconia! The pictures of the place are accurate, and the backyard firepit on the river is gorgeous. We had a great stay with our seven year old, who learned to ski and play pool on this trip, and had a comfy bed to collapse into every night. Steven's place is clean, with thoughtful touches throughout--we would definitely come back as a launching point for adventures in Laconia, at Gunstock, or on Lake Winnipesaukee."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for a ski weekend at gunstock!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven's place was the perfect getaway. All modern appliances and TV's galore. The game room was exceptional and provided many hours of fun, even in the winter. Communication was fantastic, especially with check in/out and where to enjoy some local food. Sal's is a must! Would love to see what the area looks like during the spring/summer months. Would absolutely recommend this rental!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! Great location, beautiful setting, well-maintained and full-stocked. This was truly a home away from home. The host’s communications were timely and accurate - everything was explained and well-laid out.
The space was comfortable and inviting, the kitchen had everything and then some, and the entertainment room was a such a bonus. Would definitely recommend and visit again when in the area. Five stars!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the best Airbnb to date, this was an amazing and updated lovely place. It was snowing and cold but it was warm and cozy, thank you Steven for helping us and answering any questions so quickly! Beautiful Laconia and just the most perfect stay! Thanks again, we will be back"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Stay was excellent. Summertime would probably be even better.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Stayed for a weekend and skied Gunstock. Easy access. Skied the day, went back and cooked dinner, then returned to ski again. Fun place to kick back and relax. Great host"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as beautiful as advertized. We arrived a bit early but that was no problem. Can only recommend Steven's place for a good time in Laconia!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven went above and beyond with this charming space! When you enter the property you immediately feel at home. All the updates, stainless steel appliances, and little extra touches made the stay extra sweet! We had our best nights rest because the mattresses were perfect for us and the sheets were so soft! Steven answered all the questions we had promptly and even recommended some great places to eat or visit while we were there. We stayed in the winter and luckily it snowed, because it only added to the charm, but this space looks amazing for every other season as well! There are so many amenities that you can only use during warmer months, and we hope to be back to do just that!"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Steven’s place was nice and exactly as pictured. Good communication and easy check-in / check-out. We really enjoyed his selection of games and activities. The one watch out is on cleanliness - it seemed the bed sheets hadn’t been changed from the previous stay because we found hairs in ours. Other than that, good place!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steven’s place was amazingly beautiful well decorated for Christmas. Very clean, stylish with lots of lovely touches and everything you needed. Steven was very accommodating and helpful letting us checked in earlier than the regular time. When we walked in found a birthday balloon with some chocolates from Steven, what a beautiful gesture. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lot of fun at the property. The Firepit area was a amazing. We got sometime to do some s’mores and enjoy as a family. Steven and his crew came to our rescue to help us get the fire started. We cant wait to go back again someday. :)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute house! We loved the 3 season room with the pool table. We bundled up and played for hours. Steve was very responsive and helpful before and during our stay. Added bonus- Maverick the cat!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Host is communicative and helpful
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay!!! Everything was wonderful, and lots of thought out details!! We had a bottle of wine and a balloon greeting us for our anniversary trip from Steven!! The location was perfect for a quiet weekend on the lake!! Everything was super clean and Steven was great at communication with us!!! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic experience all around!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We (four adults) had a great time at Steven's place. The outdoor space is wonderful and the game room was a perfect space for fun.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place with so many amenities. Beautiful sitting area outside with a fire pit overlooking a river, very peaceful. The fire pit made a great addition on a cool night!
Fully stocked kitchen. Comfortable beds and furniture! Close walking distance to town."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great, easy to get to, immaculately kept house. The fire put is wonderful and coffee on the dock by the water is excellent too!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s beautiful house in a perfect location.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven was a fabulous host and the house was super cute. So many things to do just within the house setting (pool table, fire place, grill, kayaks etc). He was super attentive - We needed some extra fire wood one night and within 30 minutes there Steve was with some new logs. I would highly recommend Steven’s house."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was cute, beds were very comfortable and the game room had a lot of fun stuff to do. However, I’m of the age that I need air conditioning every night and the ad said they had it. Unfortunately this wasn’t true. I guess they normally have window units that were already gone for the season so I feel a bit bait and switched. It was still warm there and impossible to open the bedroom window because the street was loud. In addition, the ad made a big deal about all the nice TVs there but all they had was utube and HBO. We sat down to fire up the local news and footballs games but he had no cable….something I never asked about but now I will on future rentals."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house for a vacation and Steven was readily available and very responsive. We especially appreciate the grilling area and all the cooking tools provided. Lots of outdoor space and things for the kids to do too. We really enjoyed our stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Steven's place! The house is spacious, modern, full of amenities, and has a fantastic outdoor space. We loved playing pool and lounging outside while our daughter napped in the afternoons. The house is located close to downtown and we enjoyed walking to the local bakery and coffee shop. Steven was a great host and we would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would live here! Clean, comfortable, older home but feels so fresh and airy. Used the kayaks, fire pit & comfortable seating at it, pool table and porch. I wish we stayed longer, the bed was so comfortable. Great location, short drive from Meredith and Weirs yet quiet area. Let me know of early check in and had clear easy self checkin."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven has a great house in a nice location, close to town. The game room rocks! We had a great time."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. We loved playing pool and darts and spending an evening by the fire on the patio. Steven even provided everything we needed to make S’mores! There were two kayaks that we didn’t get a chance to use since we have two small children but the dock looked like the perfect launching off point. We were less than 15 minutes from Weirs beach, which was great for the kids."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stevens home was wonderful. He reached out to us the second it was available to check in to let us know we could come in early. He has everything needed to have a great weekend with friends and family. Very responsive when I reached out mid stay with a quick question. Gladly stay there again!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay here, literally not a single complaint! We went away for a long weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary with our 3 little kiddos and upon arrival we were so happy we chose to stay here at the Waterfront! Steven left us Champagne and a balloon and left the kids bubbles! Everything was so clean and in great shape and the little details were amazing! The location is perfect and so close to everything! Highly recommend staying here whether you are a couple or a family! So accommodating!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying at Stevens place and it’s was just as great as the first time! Highly recommend his place
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfy bed and fun place to stay. Very close to Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. I’d return in a heartbeat."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is as advertised. Very cleab and modern and river is right there. Nice deck facing the water. Beautiful firepit area . House is close to others houses.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time at Steven’s place! The fire pit was amazing, and the view of the water was outstanding! We had such a relaxing time! We also loved playing pool and darts, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We had an awesome time cooking, grilling, and enjoying the kitchen! Thanks for a great time!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steven's home is amazing! Very clean and tidy with lots of character. The fire pit area is very relaxing right by the water and lights up at night creating very nice ambiance. There's multiple grills on the property for you to use, so if you wanted to grill something at the house or by the water, that's available for you. The game room was a hit with our 3 year old who got to try pool out for the first time! Oh, and the beds were very high quality and comfortable with high quality sheets and bedding. The house is just a short drive to all the good restaurants and about 10 mins from Weirs Beach. We'll definitely stay again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thoughtful touches, bathroom sprays, makeup towels, games and marshmallow stuff made our stay really special. Thank you so much! Such an incredible value we didn’t even use the deck and second bedroom and still felt like a great, comfortable value ."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in the area and look forward to coming back at done point in the future. Thanks again Patrick!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Blueberry is small but clean and cozy. The bathroom is sparkly clean as well. It’s perfect for a short stay. We could have used a bench for our bags in place of the provided dresser- but there’s counter space in the kitchen area we used. We went out to eat the first night and brought food home the second so we could sit outside and enjoy a simple lakeside meal. There’s a coffee pot and toaster we used for a quick breakfast too. Patrick is a great host and we got to meet him when he was on site for another matter. We appreciated his great area recommendations!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location, extremely clean and Patrick was very responsive. We will definitely be back!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cottage, tastefully renovated and right by a small private beach. Patrick was very professional and everything went smoothly. The only thing to consider is that it is a popular place with bikers, and a good number of them think they should make their engine and exhaust as loud as technically possible (not only during bike week)."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little stay on the lake. Lake front and close to Bank NH pavilion where we had a concert.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay! Patrick is the best air band b host we have had. Great comfortable space with beautiful views of the lake and sunset. The boat traffic is awesome, Great people watching. Can’t wait for our next stay!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here. Travelled with my two sisters and we really enjoyed the space. There is no full kitchen, but given we only stayed for 2 nights we had no problem and appreciated the fridge provided. The views of the lake from the room are beautiful, and access to the private beach was perfect. Easy walk to restaurants and Weir beach. We had never been to the lakes religion of NH and now we can’t wait to return!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful studio, amazing views, and wonderful private beach."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Proctors Lakehouse. Patrick was helpful and very quick to respond to any question we had. He checked in on us by phone to make sure all went well upon arrival. There is a nice private beach. Great for families with kids! If you like boats, this is a place for you. Many, many boats passed through the channel as we watched from the beach. Its a short walk to Weirs Beach and the downtown area if you don't mind walking or don't want to pay for the parking meters."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot within walking distance to Weirs Beach. Patrick was very responsive and a great help!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was so happy with this find! The private beach area was perfect and quiet. We were close to everything and Patrick was great to work with. We can't wait to go back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect fit for our little family. The ""Blueberry"" studio had all we needed. We loved the location, having such close access to the lake/ small beach/ dock was perfect for our needs. Having picnic tables, chairs and outside dining areas was just perfect too. We enjoyed being able to watch the boat traffic, sunset and even the music in the PM coming from a nearby resort was fun (it was not an all night thing!). Our host Patrick was wonderful and available if needed. I am sure we will be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great property in a prime location. The room I got was perfect for our purposes. The room was clean and the view over the lake was exquisite. While we were there in the off season there wern't really any other guests. The private beach would be great in the summer for kids to play and to cool off in. Patrick, the proprietor, was exceptional. He was available for all my questions, and even though everything was in perfect working order I am confident that if should there have been an issue it would have been resolved without any hesitation. I look forward to returning to this property in the future, and I have already told friends and family about my great experience."

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great place! We went for a weekend and had the best time! So much hang out space on the water. Beach is private for only those renting. So while there is others there, it’s often quiet too. Our son even made friends. We swam, fished, grilled, used the paddle boat and of course relaxed. There’s a nice sun deck to hang out on as well. The owners are around working here and there and are super friendly and helpful. We were even bumped to a bigger room right before arrival.
This is a great place to spend all your time or use as a base to check out the area.
We would love to come back and maybe try a cabin next time!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I've lost count of how many times I've stayed in one of Christine's two apartments. She is a wonderful host, very friendly, always available. She leaves me fresh home-made cookies on arrival and the kitchen and fridge are thoughtfully stocked with beverages (sodas, juices, carbonated water, half and half, English muffins, butter, peanut butter, oatmeal, bottled water and more).
The place is always spotless."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect place to stay in Laconia. It was better than the pictures and the description. Truly, a wonderful find and gem in the area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in Laconia for one night for a concert. I didn't expect to feel so at home, so quickly in Christine's cozy apartment, with great views, and everything I could want to hand. This is the kind of apartment I wished I could have found after college to launch my independent life. Christine makes it special with her homemade chocolate chip cookies, a great selection of teas, juices, sodas; coffee and English muffins for breakfast. IMO the photos don't convey how great you will feel if you stay here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Christine is great! and the place was adorable! be careful if you're tall though. the bathroom door is short!

She was able to help accommodate me with last minute reservation things due to a snowstorm coming. There were plenty of drinks provided in the fridge as well as homemade cookies (which were delicious!) would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I think AIRBNB needs a new category for Christine. She goes beyond Super Host. Her place feels like home, extra details and care and a warm smile always make the experience just perfect. Just lovely."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great experience staying at Christine's apartment! She was extremely kind and accommodating! I could not recommend staying with her enough. When I come up to Lanconia again I plan on staying at this airbnb if it is available.

The apartment is even nicer than photos. Highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was perfect for a stop on the way to the white mountains. Pictures are accurate. Loved the fresh flowers, homemade cookies and drinks available. Thank you Christine!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic 3-day stay while snowboarding at Gunstock. The apartment was clean, adorable, very well-stocked, and private. Christine was generous and very friendly. We hope to return for another trip!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,x
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine is always helpful and responsive. The fridge is stocked with beverages, English muffins, etc. Homemade cookies greet us each time we arrive. An excellent location in a quiet neighborhood, just minutes from my father's assisted living facility. We always enjoy our stays here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine was the perfect host. Her home and the apartment we stayed in within it was lovely. The apartment was very cozy and very well appointed with everything you could need for a comfortable stay. She also provided some very thoughtful items like coffee and cream, juices and English muffins for breakfast. A very clean unit and homemade chocolate chip cookies, couldn’t ask for a single thing more. We will be staying with her again in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Between arriving late and leaving early we did not meet Christine face to face but she answered every question quickly. She is easy to work with. Loved the town. We asked if there was a place she recommended for dinner. Local Eatery! Do not miss this! Amazing food. And for beyond great entertainment and encouragement go the The Cake! Thank you for the great stay in your amazing town.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed with Christine several times and always find things ready and absolutely clean. The fridge and cupboards are thoughtfully stocked so that I could easily make my own breakfast each morning. Did I mention the home-made cookies that always greet me? ;-)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"wonderful stay , loved every bit of the vibe and decor. would have loved to stay longer if we had time on our hands , appreciate the free supplies and clean apartment! thank you , Christine !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was such a cute little apartment-i loved it-the neighborhood was nice too-felt very safe.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! The place was cozy and the neighborhood was nice. We were able to walk down to the lake to watch the sunset.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying a Christine's place was wonderful. My sister and I were on a road trip and had spent the past 2 nights in adorable cabins with out houses. It was nice to get a hot shower (with fantastic water pressure) and sleep in a comfortable bed. The apartment was clean and cozy. Christine gave us helpful advise about the area and we were able to find exactly what we were in town to see. We will be staying with Christine when we return to the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home with such a short walk to an amazing view! And the Airbnb kitty is a must meet!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She was a very kind host, super responsive, once we were in the driveway we noted that the parking sign had our name on it, and she was outside to greet us. There was orange juice and apple juice, water, tea, coffee, etc. in the refrigerator for us. She has used a label maker around the house for clear instructions. She had a cat named Tiger who was cool as a cucumber and so friendly. Located a block away from a cute little lake, peaceful morning coffees there were peaceful!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really liked the house and the area was excellent, so quiet and peaceful.
We liked the size we had available, it is so much better to spread out after so many days living out of a suitcase.
Whilst everything worked while we were there (apart from a couple of light bulbs), we thought that the internal space could have been better utilised. There was a lot of dark wood furniture which was in the way. If we could have had a large wardrobe, things would have been better. Also, the front door at the top of the stairs kept sticking and I had to use force to get in.
The TV was rather small. I found watching sport on it was hard work. I know a washing machine was not listed, but would have made a difference if it was available. We found Christine's mom Anne helpful and friendly but never spoke to Christine although she had been very helpful and responsive before our arrival.
Overall good, it could be excellent"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I truly could not have been happier with my stay at Christine’s. It is quite possibly the homiest, quaint and calming air bnb I have ever stayed at. It truly felt like a home away from home. Not just the space but Christine and her mother as well. They were both extremely attentive and welcoming. Upon arrival I had my name written on the garage door as well as entry to the house to guide me as to where to go (despite the thorough instructions already). I woke up to the smell of baked goods in the air and upon departure I was greeted with warm chocolate chip cookies. The place was pristine and had everything one needed and more. Light breakfast items, coffee/tea, drinks, chilled water, all bathroom essentials and a very comfy bed. I left wishing my stay was longer. I don’t come through the area often but I’m already thinking of planning another trip maybe just to get away and stay in such a cozy space. Thank you so much Christine!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Christine's home. She could not have been a more gracious host and was incredibly helpful when we had some last-minute changes that made our stay complicated. We could not have asked for a better place to stay in Laconia; it was peaceful and quiet with a lovely view of the trees. 5/5 stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,So our host was great!! She met us out front to let us know that we needed to park where she hung our name. How fun we had our name on a chalkboard on garage and on front door! it is up 3 flights of stairs which was great for us as we didn't have much luggage. a quick walk down the road and you are at the water with a concrete dock that we watched one of the best sunsets ever! She had a bag of chocolate chip cookies on the table and some drinks and English muffins in the fridge for breakfast. It was a nice touch for an air bnb to have. Would recommend to book and would stay again if we came back to Loconia.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. The area was very spacious and clean- would definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Christine was very nice and responsive.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"By stay in Laconia was primarily 4 attending a show at bank NH pavilion, but after seeing the accommodations that Christine provides (wish that I lead been staying for several days instead).
The apartment was spacious and well-provisioned, and I would look forward to staying at this location again. The value of the stay far exceeded my expectations...."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine’s place was everything that we could have hoped for in a relaxing and quiet get-away.

A true highlight was getting to take the kayaks out in the lake one misty morning to really take advantage of the gorgeous lake views. We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable stay in lovely area. Thoughtful amenities - cookies! Only stayed 1 night but would definitely stay again if go back to area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christine’s places was a 10 out of 10. Quiet neighborhood, very clean, off street parking, comfortable bed, coffee and creamer. Very responsive to all of my messages. Even though we were only there for the night it worked perfect for our concert at the meadow brook pavilion. Her place is about 15 minutes from the venue and very easy to get to. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay to enjoy the Laconia area and especially for a show at Meadowbrook! Close to everything that you could want. The neighborhood is very peaceful. Christine is SO helpful, and super thoughtful with all of the little amenities included with your stay. My daughter and I had a wonderful time, it’s a perfect space for a little get away. We would definitely stay here again! So much better than a busy motel!! Thank you so much for everything during our stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time my girlfriend and I have used Airbnb and it was way better than any hotel we’ve ever been to in both price and hospitality, cleanliness and an overall at-home feel away from home. Would definitely stay again if in the area. A 110% experience as a first user. Thank you very much Christine!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay! Exceeded expectations. This is a very spacious and comfortable apartment. Very clean and nicely decorated. Fully stocked kitchen plates, pans, glasses and utensils. Christine also stocked the kitchen with coffee, filters, complimentary drinks, and snacks. We enjoyed looking from the 3rd floor bedroom onto the maple tree leaves and hearing the leaves rustle at night. We will definitely try to book again if we return to the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My daughter and I were absolutely impressed with the location and the cleanliness of this place. It felt so much like growing up when I was a kid. Just absolutely loved it. Thank you so much for opening your home to us. It was a pleasure.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Christine’s for one night while attending a Sublime concert nearby and we were VERY pleased with our stay!! The apartment is quaint, cozy, and the perfect place to get away to. She had a whole coffee/tea area, drinks in the fridge and some breakfast items too! The bed was very comfortable, and the street is quiet and very safe feeling. 10/10 would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet getaway. Will 100% be returning for another stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine’s place is great. Great location, seems like everything to do is 10/15 minutes away.Very quiet location and great value. Tiger ( the cat) is usually available to greet you in and out of the property, super friendly. We will be back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed at many AIR BNBs . Christine’s place was exactly as listed, ABSOLUTELY SPOTLESS and literally squeaky clean, very clear instructions, super easy to get inside. We had everything we needed with plenty of linens. We were only 2 blocks off of the water and took a walk to look at the pretty homes. Downtown is about 2 min by car or walkable and WAYFARER coffee is highly recommended. If I’m ever in town for another concert (6 miles away) I will absolutely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd time staying at Christine’s , we absolutely love it. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christine was super nice, an excellent communicator, and clear with directions and her listing!
She was flexible with both our check-in and check-out times. The apartment was quiet and private in a beautiful lake neighborhood and it was clean. This was my 3rd experience with AirBnB and by far my very best experience! I hope to stay there again :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine was friendly and welcoming. Also Insistent on offering to help if we needed anything. Christine's place very accessible, immaculate, with private entrance and within literal minutes of the venue (Bank of NH Pavilion, Gilford, NH) we attended. Christine's suggestion for dinner, (Fratello's) was spot on. So very, very impressed from the moment we arrived. Already said ""We will spread the word about her place and will be returning the next time my Wife and I want to attend another concert. Thank you, thank you, thank you, from Chris & Bonnie Burnett"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my third time staying at Christine’s place. She is the best! I always feel welcome. Her place is spotless and in a fantastic location! I will definitely be back!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay in Laconia! We didn't have the chance to meet Christine but we did meet Anne with whom we had great conversations. She was an amazing host, very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.
We went kayaking on the lake with their 2 keewees and it was lovely !
Thank you again Anne!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked Christine's place to attend a concert at Bank of NH Pavilion, and we're glad that we did! It was less than 15 minutes to the venue. The building was a charming older home and was clean. We appreciated the complimentary drinks and cookie snack pack, since we basically forgot everything. We would not hesitate to stay there again, and we hope it's available the next time we're in town."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed several times at Christine’s. It is immaculate, well stocked, very homey feel. But the best part is her friendliness and just a great host. We will be back!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifull and clean appartment in an old house, just what we wanted. Christine and Ann made us feel at home and what can I say about the homemade cookies and blueberry muffins. Absolutely wonderfull. I would return without hesitation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite AirBnBs. The house was situated perfectly between public lake access and a nice downtown with a coffee shop, thrift store, and record shop with a bar. Also a short drive to the concert venue in Gilford.

With a large kitchen, living room, and bedroom, the apartment is spacious. While the bathroom is relatively small, it is large enough. The third floor windows allow nice views of Lake Winnisquam, which is one block away. The furniture, including the queen bed, was comfortable. A functioning TV and wifi were available. The bathroom was well-stocked with soaps, towels, etc. The kitchen has updated appliances and was well-stocked with virtually everything you need to cook your own meals (e.g. cooking utensils, dishes, butter, condiments, etc.) as well as coffee, tea, juice, and sodas. English muffins were also in the fridge for a light breakfast. Check-in was easy with Christine’s directions to the apartment and instructions for entering the Victorian and the apartment through a private entrance. The bottom line is the stay was a pleasant experience and a great value."

Christine wrote my name on a Little chalkboard placed to indicate the right door to Pick so we weren't lost ! We loved the very calm private place! I recommand it!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute place, stayed one night to go to Gunstock and it wasn’t too far. Christine was really sweet and was plowing and shoveling what seemed like all day and night when we were there to make sure we would be able to navigate the area as we got hit with a bit of a storm. Place was pretty cozy although the “emergency exit” was creepy because it was just this long hallway and didn’t seem like there was actually a way out. The water took a while to warm up which could have been tough but we didn’t shower there and it didn’t affect our visit enough. Christine was incredibly sweet and left cookies out for us as a welcome gift."

He wanted a relaxing week in New Hampshire and the stay was exactly as described. The house was absolutely beautiful and felt brand new. The beds were comfortable and everything was very clean. We were notified before arrival that the oven was not working but that was no issue as we had no use for the oven. The location was great and the view of the lake was fantastic. Matthew was very hospitable and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. We will definitely be staying again once it is warm and everything is open for the season.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This area is returning to our home of 33 years so we are very familiar with it the area and things to do. We picked this unit because of location, location, location.

Efficiency at its best… enough space for the two of us to be very comfortable and a screened in porch to watch the sunsets and enjoy coffee in the morning. Spent our first day just floating around in the cute beach area while watching all the boats go by on Paugus Bay. Dinner on the porch then enjoyed the football season opener on the large TV. Day 2 breakfast on the porch then back to the water before enjoying a late lunch at the NASWA Beach Bar la few minutes up the road (directly on the water). Great live music rounded out this last minute getaway.
The space was clean and bright and had everything we needed in terms of appliances, utensils, etc. Definitely on our “places to return ” list!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much, the place was very clean and view from the porch was perfect. It is a small space but is perfect for a couple, well stocked. The owner was very good about responding when we had a question and was helpful in guiding us to places to go for item we needed. It was priced on the high side, but I think that is because it was prime time and on the water. I would recommend this if you like a waterfront view and don't mind paying for it."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great... right on the lake. The ""Condo"" is very clean and was great for my wife and I. The only issue we had was finding the building, the right parking spot and room. We arrived when it was dark so that didn't help. The parking spot is on the left side facing the island (not island on the lake... parking lot island lol). There are several buildings in the area so finding the right one, for us, was tricky. The room numbers are above the door and so we had trouble seeing it. That was the only glitch we had however, we would definitely stay there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for such a lovely stay! Everything was just as it looked in the pictures, beautifully bright and clean. It was the perfect size for two of us and had everything we needed. Sunsets on the balcony were a gorgeous bonus. We would absolutely love to stay here every time we're in town."

Stayed for 3 nights and if there was availability, we seriously considered cutting out the last leg of our trip and staying here a few extra nights. This place is just as advertised! One of the most clean and accurate stays I’ve encountered. The property is very chilled out and relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed the incredible views from the balcony and the beach area. The owners were so quick to respond to me. This property had everything we wanted and we would definitely come back if given the opportunity."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Location is ideal, between Margate area and Weirs beach area. The room is clean and comfy. There is a screened in porch that offers a beautiful view of the lake, and its so peaceful to eat on or read on. The swimming area is adequate.
Excellent communication! Very kind and helpful host! Bed is very comfy!!

Not to mention, the place was super spotless and we felt right at home. In particular we really enjoyed the little old-school style radio and listened to that the entire time we were there!
The area was really peaceful and lowkey and there is a lot of great restaurants nearby that we really enjoyed. It was nice getting a little taste of Laconia before we potentially come back for bike week in the future! We would highly recommend staying here!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a family wedding and looked for a lodging nearby. The first reason for choosing Paula’s place was its location…literally walking distance from our relatives home. But upon arrival, we were taken back by how quaint the home was! Well furnished with everything (including hair dryer and an iron/ironing board). The kitchen had all the little appliances, coffee maker, microwave, and all the necessary cooking utensils. The single commode down stairs was helpful for the 5 of us who stayed, which was in addition to the nice full bathroom upstairs. We loved our stay and will check here first on our next visit to the lakes region!
Paula was a great host! She was responsive to our questions and requests. And somehow, she even gave these Southern Californians a beautiful light snowfall one Feb morning that made our trip even more magical as we watched it from the 100 year old foyer."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, others in my group had a problem and we didn't make it t the house. I was very disappointed. Paula was very understanding. I hope to be able to stay at the house later in the ski season."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paula's house was perfect for us and our dog. So great to have a fenced in yard which is a rare find in the Lakes region! The house was implacably clean and comfortable, and Paula was a very responsive host. We would definitely stay again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Another great stay at Paula’s place! Clean, bright, quiet comfortable, pet friendly and a perfect location.
We are so appreciative for her accommodations her when we’re visiting family in Laconia🙏🏻🍁"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for a weekend hiking trip. Laconia is beautiful and the Airbnb was so cozy. We loved our hikes but also loved going back to the Airbnb with the big beautiful windows we could sit at and look over at the lake. Would absolutely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughters and I absolutely loved staying at Paula’s beautiful home. As a designer, I truly appreciate the character of the home. It is absolutely charming. I slept in the first room at the top of the stairs and the bed was very comfortable. My girls slept in the upstairs living room that had the tv. One girl slept on the pull-out couch and the other on the sofa and they were very cozy and comfortable. The thermostat for the upstairs is in this room and it heats the upstairs nice and warm and quick. The downstairs thermostat is very responsive as well and it gets warm quick which was so nice since we were coming in on a blustery, cold day. The neighborhood itself is noticeably very, very quiet, yet the location is close to everything. The front sunroom that faces the water view is bright and beautiful. When we arrived, the sun was starting to set and the golden glow off the water beamed into the sunroom. It was glorious. I can’t wait to come back again and stay longer next time!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Paula’s house is charming and clean. It’s located in a beautiful neighborhood walkable to the lake and town center. Would recommend Paula’s place to anyone visiting Laconia.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place. Older home with a Great FRIENDLY neighborhood. Bedding was spotless. Very roomy. Little fenced in yard. Hot powerful shower. Safe. Quite at night. We needed early check in for business and host was very accommodating. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a stunning home and only a block or so from downtown shopping and restaurants. Quiet and beautiful neighborhood, easily walkable. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed here for one night, but wished we could have stayed for longer! Will definitely be back if we’re in the area again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We checked in late after dark so didn’t have a chance to appreciate the vintage home or lovely neighborhood until the morning. Wish we had more time, but enjoyed a clean, comfortable stay. Thanks Paula!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paula’s. The home is very inviting and comfortable. In the morning we sat in front of the large windows downstairs and in the evening we hung out in the upstairs sitting room. The bedrooms are cozy and spacious and the kitchen is great, although we didn’t do any cooking. The neighborhood is very walkable with friendly neighbors and the orange kitty from across the street will come to check you out and it was a great at spot to start off a drive in any direction for leaf peeping."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paula’s home was awesome. We really appreciated all of the attention to detail. The area is very quiet for being in the middle of the city. It was only a 4 minutes walk to the lake. Beautiful sunsets everyday.
We would recommended this home to anyone who wants a comfortable quiet place to unwind and relax."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a short stay, so we didn't explore the area much. The place is clean, Paula is very responsive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our family of 4 stayed for a quick overnight at Paula's home this past weekend as we were attending a concert at the Bank of NH Pavilion. While we had hoped to arrive in the afternoon to relax before the show, our plans changed somewhat last minute and we did not arrive until after the show (around 11:00 p.m.) It was a quick ride from the venue, and although arriving late and tired, we were thrilled to step into Paula's lovely home and immediately felt comfortable. Everything was just as we needed and we had a great night's sleep and a quiet morning before heading home the next day. We would absolutely look to stay again if we return to the area, and will hopefully have more time to enjoy this beautiful place! Thanks Paula!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Paula was incredibly responsive, approving a last-minute, same day rental. Her instructions were clear, and her property was exactly as described. This is a lovely home that has been tastefully decorated and is appointed with comfortable, memory foam beds. I would absolutely return!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paula was extremely accommodating, very quick to respond to concerns. Her home is beautiful and has what you need for any length of stay. Was great to have the garage to tuck away the motorcycle from the rain. Would definately stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5/5 stars from me. Location is great, 2 minute drive to the lake and to downtown yet very quiet at night. Kitchen is a dream. Rest of the house had everything one could need."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with my boyfriend and another couple for a concert a couple weekends ago and we loved it! House was clean and cozy, looked just like the pictures minus the top torso female statue that the boys were looking forward to admiring (insert eye roll here). What I really loved most was the ""oldness"" of the house, it reminded me of my grandmothers house that I grew up in and recently had to sadly sell and say goodbye to, so I immediately felt right at home. It was near everything we needed and less than a five minute walk down to the lake and got a nice swim in. All in all a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again.
Another fun perk was meeting Tigger (aka the mayor)! He's the neighborhood cat who clearly runs the whole street and had us obsessed and spoiling him the second he introduced himself to us. There was another younger ""protégé"" as well but Tigger didn't seem to want to share the attention LOL."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Close to great activities and we enjoyed being close to the Bank of NH Pavilion for a concert.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"The home is lovely! The two real issues we encountered was No wash cloths or bath towels. And, there were only two AC window units. Both upstairs in a bedroom and in a den.
Overall it was a very nice experience"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paula's home is lovely and the location was perfect for visiting the Lake Winnipesaukee area and attending a concert at the Bank NH Pavilion. We would stay there again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an outstanding weekend at Paula's place. It is within walking distance of a couple of restaurants, and a local pub. Her historic house was really quaint with a mix of old and new. The kitchen was well appointed with a nice stove with a convection oven. There is a cozy living room downstairs, and upstairs has a cute living area with couches and a TV. We enjoyed that there were so many activities nearby. The weekend flew by and we were sad to leave so soon."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house! Love the antique stuff, perfectly located for our concert and lots of other things around! Will be back in the future hopefully for longer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I had a wonderful few days in Laconia. We felt right at home and the neighborhood was lovely to take early morning walks. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed, the beds were comfy and we were a short drive or walk to downtown. A quiet and safe area to spend a time away. I highly recommend Paula’s lovely home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was spotless and cozy. Paula was a great host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Paula’s place is a gem! Everything was clean and comfortable. Her house has so much charm.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Paula’s home was so beautiful and comfortable! She had all the amenities that we were looking for to make our short stay extra special. We especially loved how comfortable the bed was and how soft the blankets were! We would love to stay here again when we are in the area again:)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was a perfect stay for us and not far from the concert venue. It was clean and our host Paula answered all our questions promptly before arriving. I would absolutely stay again
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"I was very happy with Paula’s house, the photos matched the house exactly, it was very clean and inviting and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend! Great value for the money."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was perfect for our stay. Perfectly located and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow!! What an amazing charming home. I will be coming back to spend a week here! Perfectly located near the water and a beautiful neighborhood. Very quick walk to the cute downtown as well. The home was clean, just like the pictures. Checkin and out was easy! Paula even went above and beyond saving a sentimental water bottle we left behind. Can’t wait to come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fun home with quaint architecture. Convenient for walking downtown and for a beautiful lake vista. Neighborhood felt safe for walking. Clean and we appreciate so much that Paula allows dogs!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful spot to relax! The property is in a quiet neighborhood but also close to a bunch of local shops and restaurants that are walkable. It's situated in a nice, drivable distance from lots of other places as well. the home is lovely and welcoming, exactly as pictured! We really enjoyed our stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at Paula’s! Her home is beautiful, clean & peaceful. The lake is right at the end of the road & the neighborhood is nice and quiet.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There were four of us traveling (family two teenage boys)
Everything corresponded to the photos.
Very nice old building with a lot of space.
Great wooden flooring and impressive fitted wardrobes.
Very well equipped kitchen. Enough storage space for our belongings.
Only the king-size bed is a bit outdated and creaks when turning around.
Quiet, beautiful, green neighboring juice. You feel very safe search.
Overall highly recommended.
Paula always responds very quickly and helpful to questions.
Walking distance to the lake.
Place for great trips."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house has a good amount of space for the price, and is in nice neighborhood (quiet, safe, and near the lake for a pretty walk!) We had a nice stay here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paula’s place was even better than the photos! We loved the charm and the decor. The location was perfect and we found the best place for coffee within walking distance!
We were able to have our dog with us which is so important. Hopefully we will be able to book this home during Bike Week again next year!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paula’s home is a beautiful place in a beautiful peaceful neighborhood within walking distance to the lake. We loved the house and the neighbors kitty cat tiger. Laconia is a beautiful place to visit and this old style home was just the right place for us to stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paula’s place was perfect, fresh flowers greeted us on the dining room table and the house was just as described. The beds were comfortable, the shower has great water pressure and the kitchen is fully equipped for anything you would want to whip up. I can not recommend this spot enough and would love to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paula's lovely home was perfect for a weekend getaway, and I wish we could have stayed longer! When we arrived, the weather was above normal temperatures, and the AC units weren't in yet. Paula had been away. However, she came right by within 15 minutes and was in and out. The upstairs stays perfectly comfortable in the hotter weather! We appreciated it very much. It is in a perfect location! We walked around the beautiful neighborhood every morning and into town and down to the park. It's close to everything yet feels away from the busy! The sunsets every night down the street at the lake were amazing! Definitely looking forward to going back some time! Thank you so much for sharing your home, Paula!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean, quiet. Located in a nice neighborhood. Close to the NH Pavillion, the outlets in Tilton, … We plan on going back in the future."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed Paula’s house.
It was comfortable and had everything we need.
Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, peaceful environment. We stayed in the home because of a local death in the family. We needed a place of refuge, this was perfect."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house, great area, so peaceful. Just what i Iwanted and needed. My dog enjoyed the walks to the lake right down the street. I would definitely highly recommend. Would love to come back with my mother, she would love it ❤️. thank you Paula"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Paula’s house so much that we didn’t even feel like going out to dinner and cooked in her functional kitchen, which has a beautiful slate sink. The living areas and bedrooms are very nice and the beds have comfortable mattresses and soft sheets. The whirlpool bath was also nice and relaxing. The house is located on a quiet block and the lake is just down the road. We saw a beautiful sunset there. One of the best airbnbs I’ve been to, highly recommended."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming perfectly sized get away with a view of the lake. Close to town and skiing. I really want to come back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming home that offered everything we needed. Paula was always responsive and offered ideas on activities, local restaurants. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed here once before, and we had reason to come back for another stay! I'm simply in love with this place its adorable and always clean. The host, Paula, is always responsive and her place is always very organized and clean. Her price is extremely reasonable considering what you're getting is a whole house, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, full kitchen with plenty of cooking utensils and pots and pans, cute sitting areas for feeling welcomed, including the room upstairs with an easy to use smart tv. For god's sake theres hotels everywhere that charge so much more per night to just simply have a room. A simply easy and good choice!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Paula was an outstanding host. Responsive and helpful and friendly. The place was comfortable and clean and spacious. We had a great stay and would stay there again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Paula's place was very convenient. Only 15 minutes away from Gunstock Mountain Resort. Besides skiing we stayed in cooking and hanging so we didn't get to explore Laconia but theres many restaurants and places around. Very handy location. Would totally recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Paula was extremely helpful and friendly. I sincerely hope I get a chance to stay at her Air BNB again as it feels like home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, nice and quiet."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay
Felt like we were at home. Paula’s house is comfortable, homey and beautiful. Paula decorated for the holidays and it was lovely. Well furnished house, walkable to downtown. Lake access at the end of the street. Extremely happy with this rental."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Feel right at home
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paula’s accommodations were just perfect for us. Spacious, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was good for walking our dogs…the lake at the end of the street was an unexpected perk! So walkable for a Laconia stay, we didn’t realize that when we booked and it ended up being great."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paula was an amazing host! I look very much forward to booking with her again soon!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and great location! We would highly recommend this Airbnb. Paula is a great host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A classic New England home located in the middle of the lake district. We would stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for hosting us in your home. We were very pleased with the home and loved the neighborhood. Your home was very comfortable and clean and everything we needed was provided. We were able to take walks into town and found everything really close and convenient for us. We will definitely consider your home again when we are in the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised. Clean, quiet house within walking distance to downtown Laconia."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It's nice to get away and visit a beautifully decorated home. I don't think our timing could have been better to see new England color. The 2nd week in October was just right for us. We went to nearby Frankin and walked the Winnipesaukee River Trail. We found everything we needed. The microwave door occasionally needed some pressure at base to enable a start but over all we were very pleased. In the past I would look for a stay for much less so this was an experiment for us.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paula’s home is absolutely charming and in a perfect location! You can walk to several lakes as well as the main part of town. We had a nice dinner at the Brick Front Restaurant and breakfast at the Water Street Grill - both within walking distance to the house. Paula’s kitchen also had everything we needed to cook a few meals. The wifi was fast and the tv has access to several different streaming services - no blu ray/dvd player. We had a wonderful weekend seeing the foliage. 10/10!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Paula is awesome and verybresponsive to messages. It's location is central in the lake region and there is plenty of room for a family or 2 couples like we were. the kitchen is well appointed and the dining and living rooms were comfortable. All in all, a terrific experience."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place. Great location
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay in quiet neighborhood and not far from most things you were planning to do in the area. This house has everything you need and was very clean. We highly recommend as it will be on our list of places to re-visit!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic, clean, spacious, and solid home with good infrastructure and kind and responsive owner. Paula was quick to respond to any and all questions. Loved the home and area and would book again."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very well maintained old house. Walking distance to downtown in a nice quiet neighborhood.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paula is an amazing hostess! Very responsive to questions & the house is so comfortable. We've stayed there previously and it was just as lovely as I remembered!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rental property was easy to locate in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. The home was beautiful and charming. Paula’s listing included everything we needed to know and made the process incredibly smooth!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Paula was a great host. Her knowledge of the area helped make our trip memorable. The house was clean and comfortable. It’s in a quiet neighborhood and close to everything you’d want to do when visiting the lakes region. We would have no complaints staying here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location with all the amenities very close to the lake. The fenced in yard was great for the puppy to roam around.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful home and a great location. It is about 15 minutes away from all the places we visited which was perfect for us. The house was very cozy and clean. I would definitely book again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was as described! Excellent place
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house, clean and exactly as per the ad!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Paula’s house is charming, clean, tastefully appointed, and in a great location to take advantage of all the great stuff the Lake Winnipesaukee area has to offer. The photos of the kitchen don’t do it justice; the woodwork and the craftsman touches are really beautiful. We also appreciated the fenced in backyard for our pup. Its also in a quiet residential area, which is a bonus.
There’s just one caveat on the place, and it wouldn’t be an issue in the winter, and probably wouldn’t be a problem in the spring or autumn either. We were a bit disappointed when we realized that the entire home wasn’t air conditioned - as the amenities listing implied. There were two room AC units: one in the bedroom with the double bed, and another in the living room with a fold-out bed. My husband and I are used to a king sized bed, and while we get by with a queen size when we travel, we knew we wouldn’t be able get a good night sleep together in a double bed (and we didn’t want to risk our backs on the fold out), so one night he got the AC room, and pup and I slept in the queen bed in the room with just a fan, and we switched it up the next night.
Again, it’s a wonderful home in every other way, and Paula was incredibly accommodating (we got the check-out hour wrong, and she was as understanding as could be as we were not on the road when she first came back), but if you’ll be staying there during the summer months, the lack of AC in both bedrooms might be something to keep in mind."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, great host-perfect location!"
2022-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,No major problems. Questions addressed as needed.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Place is nice, location is great!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family loved the house and had a great time in Laconia
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value, excellent location. Home was very clean."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Large beautiful house with everything you need. Close to lake and to the town. Perfect safe parking. Great shower. Beds a bit old and lumpy. Porch area as shown in the listing did not have screens in so it was very hot in there and couldn't be used in the evening to chill. AC unit in one of the bedrooms (smaller of the two) and the other one is in the upstairs sitting area. Master bedroom had a small stand up fan so was hard to sleep in the hot weather.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Paula's home is in a great location, but we found it noisy with summer late night neighborhood activity with the windows open as only one bedroom has air conditioning. The home was clean, but didn't feel as comfortable to us with the worn furnishings, especially at the $250+ night price."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paula’s house is truly exceptional. It’s comfortable, and so homey. And Paula thought of everything! It really felt like a home away from home, which was perfect for us.
We were in Laconia for a show at the Bank of NH pavilion, and the location was great. Only a 15 minute drive to the pavilion. And it was very close to so much more. We honestly couldn’t have been more pleased."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Paula’s house is in a lovely neighborhood, quaint and quiet. The house is spacious and well equipped. Paula graciously let us check in an hour early and access was very simple. The location is ideal to explore the Lake District and neighbouring towns like Wolfesboro and Meredith. Downtown Laconia wasn’t very exciting, but there were plenty of places to day trip to."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location was amazing - easy walk to the town center, easy walk to Opechee beach, great access to Lake Winni! Everything we could have asked for and more. Then, add in that the kitchen is a stunner and so light! All in all, an amazing vacation locale, and we would return again without hesitation!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and responsive!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great house and the location worked well for us. We will definitely be staying there again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent choice for a space that is very well appointed, beautiful and fun artwork and decor. Fenced in yard area is so welcoming and sweet. My dog loved it too ! Great neighborhood with sidewalks throughout to walk about safely and with ease. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paula’s home is clean, quiet, pretty, and the entire experience was great. The small, gated yard was perfect for our dog and Paula was very responsive to questions. Perfect location. A+"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice cozy rental. Quiet neighborhood. Felt safe for the kids to play in the yard with the fence. Took us only about 15 minutes to get to Gunstock and Weirs Beach. Coffee stops and breakfast locations that were nearby had good food and friendly service. Overall a perfect house for weekend to fit our plans.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house and convenient location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value . Very convenient location, close to everything you need yet set off the main roads in a nice quiet neighborhood."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Nice older home with lots of character in a beautiful location surrounded by big mature trees. Very quiet neighborhood, close to downtown."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice home in a really great location. Paula was extremely responsive and helpful!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Paula was extremely helpful from the process of booking to arriving for my trip. I recommend this cute little cottage for anyone who would want to have a relaxing and enjoyable stay!

Set in a quiet location, it was none the less just minutes away from Laconia and about an hour away, Littleton, NH. -home of a Polly Anna statue (good luck) and the world's longest candy counter. A charming little town to visit. To get there you pass through some spectacular scenery.
As I visited the area for the Pumpkin Festival & Halloween, Dave's entire house was decked out accordingly. That was pretty cool for someone who loves this time of the year.
So, no matter when you come to the area, be it for the lakes/summer, fall colors or skiing in the winter, Dave's apartment is a great base to stay & come back to at the end of a day. I can highly recommend it."

The place is beautiful, up-scale and very clean- even better than the photos. I enjoyed sitting on the peaceful and private back deck, drinking my morning tea while watching the lovely fall colors. The desk space and good wifi in the second bedroom let our daughter-in-law work remotely. It was great to have so much space that we could really spread out, especially when my daughter-in-law was packing up all the antiques she bought. For us, the location was perfect - quiet and convenient. I would highly recommend this place."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If I could give this Airbnb 1000 stars I would. This was one of the nicest AirBNB’s we have ever stayed at. It was absolutely gorgeous. Everything was so clean and well kept. We loved all the little homey touches. The location was perfect. Pretty much in the middle of the state, about an hour from the white mountains in one direction and an hour from Portsmouth in the other direction and on,y a Chile of minutes from a Walmart and a Dunkin Donuts. The apartment was not only well stocked with the normal pots and pans and things but our host included all the condiments you might need in the refrigerator, Ketchup, Mayonnaise, Mustard, Relish, and even Butter for cooking. It was such a nice surprise not to have to buy those things. There was also plenty of coffee and sugar.
Another really nice thing, we have sometimes stayed in AirBNB’s that only have one roll of toilet paper. It was really nice to know there was plenty of toilet paper and we didn’t need to worry about running out. The beds were super comfy and the linens really soft which was super nice. It was also nice to have cable TV and not have to worry about signing in and out of our Netflix account on their TVs.
On the mornings that it wasn’t raining we enjoyed having our coffee on the little porch that’s off of one of the bedrooms. All in all this was one of our best AirBNB stays ever. If we go back to New Hampshire again we definitely will book another stay at Dave’s place!
Thank you to Dave for being such a great host."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,David’s Airbnb is beautiful. Very spacious and comfortable. The place is as set up nicely and had everything you needed. The beds were comfortable. David is a great boast and was quick to reply when I emailed him. I would definitely stay here again.

It actually looks bigger than the pictures (in past rentals, the pictures always looked better than reality). It had everything that we needed. David was a great host and even asked if we needed more towels midway through the stay. He was available throughout our stay. Checkout a breeze as well.

The privacy of the deck was amazing! It was so quiet, private and tranquil. The greenery of New Hampshire is stunning and relaxing on the deck talking and having drinks while staring out at a thick sea of green was something we looked forward to daily to start and end our days!
Like other have said...this Airbnb is all about location, location, location!!!  The nearby Walmart, Weirs Beach, hiking trails and concert venues were just a few places you'll enjoy easy access to while staying here!
David was super available but 100% leaves you alone. David is also super considerate! He even texted and asked us if cutting the lawn would disturb us.
The place is also decorated and furnished in a classy, charming and cozy open air fashion. All the amenities, dishes, sheets, towels etc... were all extremely good comfortable quality!
I'm really happy David allowed us to occupy his Airbnb. It was by far the highlight of our trip! I hope to get back soon.
Thankyou!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely, peaceful 5 night stay, weekday M-F nights. Spacious, sparkling clean everything you need for light vacation cooking. We had a 3 day heat wave but we were cool thanks to AC.
Very safe for quarantine times. Our hosts helped us with lake swimming, which is what we wanted to do. Comfy sleeping, nice shower (big tub if you like baths) Nice cross breezes after the heat passed. Laundry- nice to unpack clean clothes when we got home.
Very good WiFi. Saw some Perseid meteors from the deck.
Enjoyed mornings on the deck over the back yard. Lovely."

The living room ac and large fan cooled down the entire apartment, so it was comfortable day and night. The kitchen has every appliance and utensil you could need, there are flatscreen tvs in each room, and the bathroom has a very deep tub. The couch was huge and super comfortable and they had a ton of extra plush blankets, overall we absolutely loved our stay. The only comment I have is that the water smelled strongly sulfuric. We’ve never stayed elsewhere so I’m not sure, but that might just be common up in that area. We just used bottled water to cook and brush our teeth, so it didn’t bother us too much. Just something to note if you’re not expecting it and are sensitive to smell like us. Didn’t take away from the five star experience, we will definitely come back!"

All common areas in the building were clean. He was very responsive!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third summer we have stayed here, and it is still a nice place to be. It had all the amenities as advertised and it was in a fabulous location to enjoy Lake Winnipesaukee. This time around, we wanted to just relax, go to the beach, and eat. We hung out at the pool part of the time and watched TV and played some of the games that were in the condo. We just really enjoyed our time. Mike was a terrific host. He was very quick and responsive to all my questions upon check-in and his write up on the site was highly informative. The location was very close to Shaw's for a quick shopping and restaurants were not too far from the site. Weirs beach is about 5 mins away and we spent a couple of afternoons there enjoying the weather, sand and swimming. I will definitely be renting from Mike again in the future."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting Concord, NH for only a day. We were going to stay in a hotel that was close to where we needed to be, however we jumped on AirBNB and found this gem! It was cheaper than a hotel and quiet. The pool is under renovations, but it will be amazing once it is completed mid-July. I think we will be back next June just to visit the pool  . We had a view of the lake. The AC works amazingly. The condo looks brand new when you open the door. The stores that are under the condo building are a MOST see! It is absolutely its own city down there. Great for inclement weather too! 5 Stars for that added bonus."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and very clean. Will be staying again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place was perfect for a bike week stay, 2 miles from Weirs, there is a restaurant/bar and a breakfast/lunch restaurant in the condo complex, and some shops too, even a golf specialty store. Those were a bonus, but the location is a perfect kickoff point to explore the lakes and hills nearby. The condo itself was well equipped and super clean. I would definitely recommend this space right across from a beautiful lake. Oh great happy hour bar/restaurant on the pier, it's part of a hotel across the street, but open to the public was great too. A+++"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it thank you!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Airbnb 🙂
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On arrival because of prior instructions from my host Mike , I already knew which side of building, where to park, and how to get to the rental unit, which made me comfortable and seem like I had been there before. Entering the unit was a pleasant experience, clean, open and after reading the guest check list I was completely informed of expectations and property amenities locations. Everything that was needed to make cooking and food preparations was available. Our host Mike reached out to us on a couple occasions during our stay to ask if there was anything we needed, yet not in an intrusive manner, he seemed like a nice guy and appeared genuinely concerned with our stay. We definitely enjoyed our stay and our pleasure trip was peaceful, thank you to our host Mike and Airbnb for their help with our trip. Hugh Jacobs"

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Love the lakes area, so many scenic spots. Definitely hike Mount Major at Alton Bay for the views.
The condo is lovely but unfortunately the bed sheets weren’t clean which we discovered at half 11.
Found (clean) spares in the room so could change them ourselves.
Mike responded straight away, very apologetic and refunded the cleaning fee.
His cleaning team dropped a clean comforter off the next day and took the old sheets away.
There was a dirty sock, earrings and coins in the bedroom too.
The condo has a comfortable living area, full kitchen (washer/dryer in the building), bedroom and bathroom. There’s also a balcony. TV has Netflix and Hulu. Free parking too, you just need to provide car details before arrival.
We visited in October so the pool was closed for the season. No issue though, we were out visiting Weirs Beach and Alton Bay so only needed the condo for relaxing at night."

This was the perfect spot for us to remember some good old times, and make some new memories.
Centrally located to Laconia Beach, the drive-in, Funspot, Gifford shopping, and plenty of dining and grocery shopping opportunities, this condo was perfect for us. We were really happy to have stayed at this clean, full of amenities, condo instead of a dated motel room.
For your money you will get an attentive host who checks in on you, explains the process (even to a newbie), and sleep / stay in a well decorated, modern, CLEAN, condo. Also special thanks for the board games that were available, my toddler now has an obsession with the game of Jenga!"

Donald provided all the information we needed to get there and get settled. I'd stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice place. Very nicely located in relation to the lakes! Lots of nice restaurants close by and the drive to the lakes was very reasonable. Very nice place; very spacious, clean and overall a great spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent experience! This apartment is beautiful, clean, and cozy and in such a convenient location. 5/5 would absolutely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was immaculate! Beds were very comfortable. Only slight issue was that Netflix wasn’t available as promised.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice spot for a weekend in Laconia or the surrounding areas. Very close to concert areas, restaurants, fishing spots and ice cream shop on same property! Apartment was very clean and had everything you could need for a nice stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. The condo was clean, comfortable, and located in the heart of the area. On top of all of this, the host mailed my glasses that I left behind the same day we left and I had them the very next day! Very much appreciated! Next time we are heading up that way, we will check availability here before anywhere else. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the weekend. The apartment was perfectly suited for us, clean, had everything that we needed. The only drawback was the road noise. Once we turned on the ac unit that white noise masked the road noise so problem solved. The apartment is convenient to a lot of activities and was a perfect spot for a fun weekend away. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great apartment, close to beaches and lots of other attractions. Short drive to Gilford for a concert!"

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and spacious! Outside noise was better with a/c on.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is spacious and clean, the location allows easy rides to the sights of the region, but the apartment is directly on a large street and very poorly insulated and also the air conditioning was very noisy, even the floor creaks when running - so nothing for sensitive ears."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donald was excellent with communication. His place was extremely clean. Very close to concert venue. Outlets were a quick drive away. Bonus was the ice cream place downstairs, ice cream is delicious!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location and space. Very comfy, clean, and easy to access. Although I didn’t need to, the option for to do laundry in the building was also very convenient and something that would be very valuable in future trips here. I’d 100% stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, everything was amazing. The place was super clean and at a convenient distance from the concert venue. Lots of restaurants around and a pretty peaceful neighbourhood. The only thing I wish we had is some type of oil to cook."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Who could say anything bad about a place that lets you live above an ice cream shop? The space looks like the photos provided and was clean and neat. Everything was nicely updated. Parking was never an issue. If I needed to say anything negative, it would have been the traffic could be heard clearly through the window air conditioners, but we are early risers so it was not a real issue. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others as it was a great value."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay in Laconia! We felt safe, and at home. There was no noise from the ice cream parlor, just a bit of noise from the roads. Nothing too bad. The apartment was pristine and smelled lovely. Had everything we needed. The owners went above and beyond in sending something to us that we left behind! Thank you for a wonderful place to stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this Airbnb above an ice cream shop in a beautiful resort town. Totally private and extremely clean two bedroom apartment. The only issue was with the crazy roundabout staircase which was a little scary but turned out fine, just go slowly! Host recommended a great restaurant and everything was great. Would have loved to have ceiling fans to move the air and for sleeping comfort but we made due with inexpensive fans we purchased on our way there. So spanking clean! We would stay there again for sure! Felt very safe!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was roomy and very comfortable. The special treat was being over Happy Cow ice cream shop.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean and the beds very comfortable. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with essentials.

Bonus is ice cream shop that was still open in November right below and a three minute walk to the 405 Grill and Bar."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A unique, but convenient, location in Laconia. Clean, neat, and functional. If you're looking for the basics and don't mind being on the main street, this is your place. If you're looking for a place to take the kids for a vacation I would look elsewhere."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was easily accessible super clean and roomy
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, roomy and clean apartment. Beds and linens very comfortable. Good central location. Nearby ice cream parlor is an added bonus. Only drawback is busy street and traffic noise, so if you are a light sleeper would not recommend."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, big space, great location, and effective communication. Exceptional value overall. Two things to consider: location is above a small engine repair shop, so there is sometimes a pretty strong small of gas and oil. Also, the SmartTV is slow and unresponsive at times. These things considered, we would definitely consider staying there again in the future."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great airbnb with everything you need for an amazing stay. The place is much bigger than it looked in the pictures too and the hosts were great!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was super cute and perfect for my stay to see my family. As a local from that area, I was used the traffic on the main street but it otherwise was quiet. Overall greatstay and would definitely stay again!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being our first time using Airbnb for renting a place, we had a great experience. Our host had the apartment ready and waiting for our arrival. Instructions were easy to follow for arrival and departure. The apartment was very well kept, clean, and inviting. Our host was quick to respond to any questions we had. We would recommend this host and place to anyone looking to enjoy time in the Laconia, NH area."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the amazing stay! The apartment was just as cute as it was on the site. Some of my friends who stayed with us loved it since they play Pokémon go and the ice cream shop below the apartment was a Poké stop. The ice cream was also delicious.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean apartment. Spacious, well designed. Fully stocked kitchen. Has everything you need for a short stay. Right above an ice cream shop but was relatively quiet location. Overall would recommend!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and spacious unit.
Can get a little noisy due to passing traffic on the main road, but otherwise a pretty and well-stocked unit.

I'd stay here again!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a concert and the apartment was less than 15 minutes to the Bank of NH Pavilion. It’s also super close to fast food (McDonald’s, Taco Bell), coffee (Dunks, Aroma Joe’s), and gas stations which was very convenient. We also walked to the restaurant next door for some apps and a beer. It was in the 90s during our stay but they had the air conditioners on and the apartment was cool when we arrived, which was very appreciated. We had a nice stay and would definitely book it again for the next concert we attend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location and value for our weekend stay for a wedding in town. Very clean and comfy.
Ice cream shop on the first floor!!"

Great value and cheaper than a lot of the competing stays near by."

Denise was prompt with communications as well as accommodating. She adheres to strict protocols for cleaning. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The TV is streaming only so that may be good to know in advance."

Also no hairdryer. Bathroom is spacious and clean. But the apartment is very comfortable, very clean, and perfect for a few days. Communication with the host was easy and efficient. The apartment faces a rather busy street, so there is a bit of noise from traffic. We had a great time, it's a great value for the price, and we would certainly stay there again."

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect little nook to escape the heat in! AC in each bedroom was the perfect place to end the day with. Ultra clean and modern, but a bit of a walk to get up a windy staircase. The ice cream place below is AMAZING — try the “dirty water”! Denise was an amazing host — responded quickly and even let us check out later so we could sleep in after a long night out on the town. Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a convenient location in Laconia. Very clean and spacious.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denise is a great host! Great value and clean apartment.

2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and great value above a charming ice cream shop.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Calise's place is roomy and comfortable. We cooked a couple meals during our stay, and streamed a football game from my laptop, so having a smart TV was a perk! The place was immaculately clean, and I felt comfortable there during a time where staying at other people's spaces can be concerning. The location is nice, and the restaurant right next door had great food too. In response to a different review concerning parking, I actually appreciated parking in a separate lot than the one shared by the business, it was nice to know my car was safe and it's only a few steps from the entrance. I would 100% recommend staying here."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, super clean apartment in a great location. My friends and I had a lovely weekend visiting the area and glad we stayed here."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PRO: this place was super clean. Not a bit of dust or dirt in the apartment. I have never stayed in a place so clean.
AC in each bedroom.
Shampoo, Conditioner and body wash in bathroom.
Had night lights.
CON: we had to wait in ice cream line (on a summer night) to tell someone we were there.
We were told, to load, unload and park in a dark, dirt parking lot to save room for customers while we were paying by the night.
No basic cable and internet was slow for Netflix.
Couch was not comfortable at all.
Bring your own shampoo. Stuff supplied wasn’t that great.
Night stands on each side of bed would have been great.
One bed was solid but the other was wobbly. First night, very time my partner moved, I woke up. Second night in other bed was fine."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stopped here on our honeymoon. It was such a clean and neat apartment, while also feeling homey. The place was in a great, central location to a lot of sites and restaurants, and better yet, right next to a DELICIOUS ice cream place. Definitely recommend this place!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Surprisingly nice place. Check in was fine, and it doesn't hurt having an ice cream place downstairs!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for 4 people. Spacious, two bedrooms with AC, and a big kitchen/living space. Right behind the ice cream shop where we got big $5 ice cream sundaes! It was not loud or invasive whatsoever being near an ice cream shop. It was local to a lot of things we were doing, so it was a great spot to come crash!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was perfectly appointed for our family, including our two young kids. It was clean and spacious for us. The kitchen had just what we needed to make some simple meals, and as many have said, the ice cream was a delicious bonus! The beds were comfortable and the towels were soft -all wonderful details. We enjoyed the location as it was close enough to drive to Weir Beach, and we also explored different areas and state parks that were pretty close by. Calise was incredibly responsive to any of our questions, and we would be happy to stay here again."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Clean, spacious, stylish little apartment! Perfect for 2 couples or a family with older kids. We found it quite noisy for our little kids as the place is set on a main road, with motorcycles driving by often. The place is at a great location for everything the lakes region has to offer! The ice cream shop did not disappoint!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts and impeccable place
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I enjoyed our stay here. It was very spacious for two and would definitely comfortably fit two more guests. The apartment was clean and tidy, and the kitchen included tools for simple cooking. The location was convenient for getting to the nearby lake beaches. We also drove out to the coast and to the white mountains — lots of options! The ice cream shop downstairs was great. I also recommend Laconia Local Eatery for a delicious upscale meal and Goody Good Doughnuts for breakfast (get there early!) Both are within walking distance."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"apartment looks EXACTLY like the photos! Clean, spacious, quiet and best of all above an ice cream shop with DELICIOUS, large and great priced ice cream!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little spot, that was perfect for a getaway up north. My wife and I will definitely head back up another time!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and above an ice cream shop. Very quiet even with people below us. Quick response from the owners! Will use this whenever we are in town visiting the family!
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Calise's place was great for a weekend stay. The apartment was incredibly clean and the check-in/out process could not have been simpler. There was more than enough room for myself and a friend with the two bedrooms and ample common space.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Calise’s place was great! Super clean, nice bedrooms and shower. Great location! Ice cream shop below was a plus. Would definitely stay again."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful! We weren’t able to arrive at the schedule time, so Calise made all the arrangements for us to arrive later. The house is extremely homely and everything was super clean. Lovely place, happy to stay here again in the future!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Calise was great at communicating, and the space was perfect for our needs. Of course being above such a sweet ice cream shoppe was a bonus!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great apartment great location easy check in and check out! Very clean!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean and comfortable. We wish it didn’t rain, but nothing you can do about the weather"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. It was very cute and accurately described. The rooms are very spacious and decorated nicely. The beds are very comfortable but quite noisy. Lol I would absolutely suggest staying here.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Calise's place was great for our weekend getaway with friends. The apartment was clean, spacious, and had all of the amenities we needed. The ice cream shop below, which Calise owns, was an added bonus."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is really clean and we loved being able to wash our clothes and to cook the things we wanted. There is also nice furniture in the apartment and the bathroom is great. It was a bit creepy that customers of the ice cream shop below came upstairs in order to use the restrooms besides the apartment. In one of the bedrooms there was the bad smell of motor oil or something else but altogether it was a great stay!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed spending Labor Day Weekend at Calise’s place! The apartment was very spacious and sparkling clean. We appreciated the AC in both bedrooms, Netflix and Hulu, fully appointed kitchen, and Calise’s warm hospitality. Check-in was a breeze despite an unexpected travel delay we had; Calise was very flexible and accommodating throughout. The apartment was in a very convenient location, too, just a short drive from from the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion, the Tanger Outlet mall, and Lake Winnipesaukee. The delicious ice cream shop below was also a plus! I’d highly recommend this Air bnb; we can’t wait to come back!"
2019-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment's interior is as advertised. A few things to consider, however:

- It's situated on a fairly busy thoroughfare. You can expect noise early in the morning and fairly late at night from large trucks & motorcycles
- The apartment is on top of an ice cream shop. I had read in the comments before our stay lots of positive feedback about the shop being so close, but didn't realize it was the same building, and that caused us a few problems. The first being that the employees of the shop have the entrance code to the apartment's smartlock. One of them opened up the apartment and gave us the code. We weren't exactly at ease leaving our valuables in the apt during the day knowing they could enter, especially considering the employee bathroom is in the same hallway, just one door over from the apt entrance.
- Another issue is people loitering around the building entrance at night. On two consecutive nights, upon returning to the apt after spending the day out, we had people sitting in front of our door. And not from the friendliest of demographics, to put it kindly. This main door is only locked after the ice cream shop closes, so there's the potential for meeting people inside the building just outside your door.
- We had problems with ants the whole time. As we were spending several days at this place, we decided to pick up some groceries after dropping off our luggage in the rooms. We had brought along some cookies for the long ride from NYC and left them on the counter when we ran to the supermarket. Couldn't have been gone for more than an hour as the store is right down the street. When we got back, the counter, and our delicious cookies, were covered in ants. We did our best to kill them and clean it up, then contacted the owner. She was responsive and came the next day while we were out. But we continued having them in the kitchen and bathroom.
I think if you stay here in the cooler months you'll have a really fine stay. Ice cream shop will be closed (or reduced hours + fewer patrons), nobody hanging around outside until late, fewer motorcycles and closed windows, maybe no ants."

Ice cream shop being downstairs was definitely a plus too!! Definitely would stay here again."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond expectation! Calise was very quick responding, the place was sparkling clean and the ice cream below was the best touch! Beautiful spot for what we needed- access to the lakes, with a quick easy rise to weirs beach and much much more! Highly recommend"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This spot is so cute! The ice cream parlor below is so good and the location is amazing. So close to everything you could want to be close to. I would totally stay here again!!!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Easy access and great ice cream right under the apartment
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a long weekend for a wedding we were attending. The place was just right for us two couples! With the ACs running in the bedrooms we didn’t hear any traffic or noise.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Calise was a pleasant host and the apartment completely met our needs for a brief stay in Laconia. She was easy to communicate with, the apartment provided all the necessary amenities we needed, and the location was just a short drive from the local attractions. We had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this comfortable and affordable home!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is and awesome two bedroom apt. Decorated nicely and equipped with all the necessary amenities for a stay. My wife high fives me and said “Good job Joe” when she saw the place. We were very happy. Zero complaints.
Thank you again!"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Calise is very responsive and helpful, and the apartment is comfortable and quite spacious. While there is some street noise, it was minimal and not disruptive. Plus you can't beat the commute to ice cream ;)"
2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very convenient, clean, and cozy apartment. 1 adult and 2 teenagers and the apartment was just perfect for us."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay - especially for the price. You have far more room and privacy compared to any motel lodging in the area this time of year. We were able to stay for 2 nights at Calise's place at the same price as one motel night. And absolutely lovely inside as well. Centrally located to all areas of the lake. Will definitely stay again.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and excellent accommodations. Great value!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roomy and clean! Just upstairs from some excellent ice cream!

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, fun place to stay in Laconia to enjoy the town and lake."
2019-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Big, clean, quiet place to stay"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is above the happy cow ice cream shop. So if you love ice cream, there is no better place. Period.
Check-in:
Calise and the staff at the happy cow ice cream shop make checking in a breeze.
Location:
There are pros and cons to the physical location of the apartment. The pros are ease of access to anywhere in the area and a perfectly convenient parking area. The unit is just off Union, the main street thoroughfare of the region (the local part of the 3). The cons are that the apartment is right off Union and therefore subject to the noise of the traffic. However, only the bedroom closest to the traffic suffers from the noise.
Space / Decor:
Great, simple, modern, full kitchen. There's a great couch/sitting area right as you enter the apartment and it's a perfectly relaxing spot... I almost liked lying there more than in the bedroom.
Price:
Excellent value. 2 bedrooms (1 full/queen bed each) and one couch (not sure if they let you sleep one person on the couch, but it is comfy)
Overall:
Calise is very friendly and the location/value was perfect for me... I came on my own, so I'm not sure how a larger group would manage, but it'd probably be just as good for them."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place, very clean, and excellent host."
