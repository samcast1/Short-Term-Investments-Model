2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place. Jimbo was proactive. Would stay here again no questions!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What can I say? Beautiful loft located in the middle of where all the action is. Jimbo is a wonderful host who was very responsive and went way beyond the norm, providing exceptional accommodations and accoutrements. Can’t speak for my puppy, but I had an awesome time and will be back! Thanks again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbos home was probably one of the best Air bnb stays ive ever experienced. Flexable chexk in an check out. The home was stocked with brand name beer an sparkling soda. We were left a $25 doller drink card for the bar downstairs. Then the most awesome part, We were offered a free breakfast around the corner an let me say it was a wonderful breakfast. The server or manager was so awesome an attentive. This place is not just a stay........ITS AN EXPERIENCE."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely terrific. Awesome design, great location, and a tremendous host who hooks you up with several food-related deals in the city.
It's definitely a 'wow' experience. When stepping in, me and my traveling companions' jaws hit the floor. We could not believe we snagged such a wonderful place last minute at such a terrific price. Hats off to Jimbo, who seems to be well loved throughout the city."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's apartment was absolutely beautifully decorated, very eclectic. He was super responsive and made the check-in process super easy. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spotless. We were sad we did not get to enjoy his place for long. I would definitely stay again!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What can I say about this Airbnb, it’s exactly what everyone else says. The best! No hidden agenda here just a great little place for a weekend stay or overnight. Jimbo was an amazing host. We had clear instructions and was also texted photos. The place was spotless. Fridge even had some beer, ciders, sparking soda and even red and white wine for us to enjoy. Talk about going above and beyond to ensure his guests are comfortable and can start their getaway off with a bang. He owns the restaurant underneath (don’t worry it closes at 9 pm and unless you like to sit in silence it had no effect on us) and gifted us two complementary cocktails at the bar. We also ordered dinner and dessert and let’s just say we are going back. He also owns the coffeehouse and bistro around the corner to which he also treated us to breakfast and coffee- what a generous host. I cannot even put our experience not words but I know where we are staying each time we want to stay over in Astoria!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was the highlight of our trip! The experience was in the details. We ate breakfast at the recommended restaurant and it was fantastic!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Unique. Beautiful. Relaxing. Warm. Cozy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the artistic decoration in the loft. The location is so handy for exploring Astoria. We wanted to attend the Seafood and Crab fest and a shuttle came right across the street. That was so handy for getting to the festival and back. We also enjoyed the friendly and talented staff in the bar downstairs.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give Jimbo and his place more than five stars, I would. He had possibly the best hospitality I've experienced from any host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Host went above and beyond. Will definitely book again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in downtown. This place has a good vibe and we would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jimbo has created a unique and wonderful space here. One of the more interesting Airbnb places we've stay at. He was a great host, and the location was nice and central. We will definitely stay again. Highly recommend staying here on your next visit to Astoria."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The location is great! We were able to come and go easily to venture out on the town. Tons to do in walking distance! We didn't need to drive all weekend long so we parked a few blocks away in a spot without the 2hr time restriction.---but it was easy to unload in the 2hr parking in front of the building access door. Be sure to bring shampoo & conditioner (unless you use 3:1 products) and a hair blow dryer if you need that sort of amenity. I stopped traveling with those things when going to AirBnBs/VRBOs/etc a while back, but every once in a while, I kick myself for not packing it! You can hear the sounds of the restaurant next door but fortunately they close at 9pm and clean up crew is quite by 10pm."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We will be back! This was a wonderful place to stay and Jimbo is a great host.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is what defines an amazing Airbnb. Location is second to none, and host goes above and beyond to make it an amazing experience. If you want a super quiet and secluded spot it may not be for you, but the noise from the restaurant dies off very early in the night and adds a great touch to the stay. We had a baby and a dog with us and wasn't an issue at all. The space was clean and gorgeous, and we loved being able to walk anywhere in town with ease. Can't wait to visit again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome, easy to get to, central location. Jimbo hooked us up with some local beer and wine, cocktails at the restaurant below the apartment and breakfast/coffee at an awesome little cafe. My wife and I try to get out to Astoria a couple times a year and this place was easily our favorite place we’ve stayed at yet, including the cannery. 10/10 would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loft was very accommodating and comfortable. Its location is wonderful and allows easy access to local options downtown. Jimbo stocked the fridge and provided free breakfast nearby, which was amazing. The coffee and food were the best we had in the city. We were totally satisfied. Jimbo was attentive and prompt in his response before our arrival. Overall, we had a great experience and would highly recommend! Thanks Jimbo for a great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Jimbo’s very unique stay. Great location, easy to walk to all downtown Astoria spots."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In the heart of downtown Astoria, close to everything! Generous host, excellent value! We’ve stayed in several of the commercial hotels in the neighborhood and non of them were as well appointed."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only have one word to describe this space…stunning!!! From start to finish Jimbo as a host thought of everything. I’ve never stayed in such a beautifully furnished Airbnb. It was quant, quiet, clean, and cozy, everything you want when you visit a beach town. The restaurant downstairs was delicious as is his bistro. If I could give more than five stars I would. I cannot wait to stay here again. Thank you Jimbo for sharing your space! I wish you could come decorate my home! 🖤"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carruthers Loft was an absolute gem! From the very stylish décor and excellent location to the many thoughtful touches throughout the stay. Jimbo is a solid host and my wife and I look forward to booking again next time we're in town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fun and comfortable place to unwind, with easy parking and access. Lots of options for food and drink within walking distance"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This fantastic Astoria Airbnb is not to be missed! The location can’t be beat, and it makes an ideal home base from which to explore the town and wider coastal region.
It was warm, cozy, interesting, inspiring, and extremely convenient. Jimbo has curated a fascinating art collection from around the world, and you can tell that so much care went into every detail of the space.
He also happens to be the most genuine and generous host we’ve ever had. This place couldn’t have been more perfect for our weekend away."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"one of my favorite Airbnb places of all time! too much to list...great host, cool place with lovely lighting, and fun/unique decor! parking was easy, lots of restaurants and coffee nearby, couldn't have had a better experience."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,What a cute place in the perfect spot!! The photos don’t do it justice and it’s so cozy!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a lovely space! We enjoyed being right in the middle of town and Jimbo was a wonderful and thoughtful host.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here celebrating a big birthday and it was beautiful. Great interior and it included complimentary breakfasts at one of their cafes as well as a complimentary drink. Amazing hospitality and a great place to stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This spot is a treat! You couldn’t find a better location to ditch the car and enjoy walking around. The decor is a hoot and the whole time it just felt really cool and special to be staying there. Jimbo went above and beyond making sure we felt comfortable and happy. I would love the opportunity to stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was an INCREDIBLE place to stay in Astoria, so cool we hardly wanted to leave the apartment! In a great location and the host Jimbo was incredibly generous. Thank you for everything and we can’t wait to return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jimbo's loft is spectacular!! Larger that it appears in the photos. Wonderfully appointed decor and furnishings. The extras were a nice bonus. Calling the bathroom spacious is an understatement. The mirrors are on the shopping list for my own home. The location with the view down into our fave restaurant Carruthers sold my wife and I on booking. Big shout out to Jimbo as my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We shall book again in the future and most definitely recommend to others for their visits to Astoria.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Top Tier. Would stay again and absolutely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful space! The decor was amazing, great location and our host Jimbo went above and beyond."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a cool apartment in Astoria - we will definitely be back. We felt very well taken care of and also thought the decor was so cool! Like a hip loft in Paris!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's loft over Carruthers restaurant is more than just a place to stay overnight...it's really an artistically decorated, cozy, well-stocked, secure home-away-from-home that just happens to be very close to great restaurants/bars/activities in charming downtown Astoria. The ability to walk all over town vs having to drive was a major benefit to the location. Noise from the outside was not an issue. The complimentary cocktails downstairs at Carruthers was much appreciated on our first night in town and led to a delicious dinner at Carruthers. Breakfast at Astoria Coffee House & Bistro was perfect since we had our choice of many food items to start our day. Jimbo knows hospitality and style which made this Airbnb experience exceptional."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's place was amazing! I was in town with a friend and we were very happy with our stay. It was extremely well equipped, Jimbo's instructions and communications were clear and friendly, and the amenities offered were unbeatable. I'd stay again in a heartbeat!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jimbo’s place is amazing, close to everything in town, there was hardly any reason for us to use our rental. Complimentary breakfast and drinks, great atmosphere with great people close by. We definitely made some friends while we were here and can’t wait to come back and visit. Thank you for having us Jimbo!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautiful loft space, nice decorations, nice location. Couldn't ask for a better place to explore Astoria. Jimbo exhibited amazing hospitality."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was great for a quick weekend in Astoria.
It’s larger than it looks in the pictures and the space is very open which was nice.
The art and decorations alone will give you plenty to look at, but if you make it outside, you’re just one block from the river, upstairs from a cocktail lounge and within walking distance of restaurants, breweries and all types of shopping.
It was a really nice stay .
My only complaint is that I booked such a short visit.
Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. The place was decorated beautifully. Great location! 10/10 would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, super generous and caring!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at Jimbo’s place. Conveniently located in walking distance to many bars, restaurants, shops, and the local farmers market. Jimbo also had the fridge stock with an array of beverages, not to mention complementary breakfast at Astoria Coffeehouse Bistro and drinks at Carruthers Restaurant. Hard to find a better spot in Astoria, I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Loft is absolutely fabulous! It’s in the heart of downtown’s vibrant culture. The space is filled with stunning eclectic art that feels so warm and inviting. Our schedule only allowed for one night in this beautiful space but we’ll definitely be back for at least 5 nights to fully enjoy the Loft and Astoria.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's always a treat when I can book an Airbnb that brings the sense of adventure and novelty to my digs while traveling. I knew from the photos that I was already going to experience something more maximalist and delightful than my typical style, and I was more than won over by the treasures inside Jimbo's place. Since I was in town for a wedding and its attendant events, I didn't have much time to explore the downtown Astoria area as I'd hoped. But Jimbo's place was well situated to do so, and I'm glad I could step out from the building right into the Sunday Market the day I left town. Incredibly central location, a very fun apt to explore (including the peek-a-boo windows above Carruthers), and an intriguing but much appreciated number of fans to keep air moving. I appreciated all the fun touches and tasty libations Jimbo left for me. Do note that there isn't a traditional closet, but I'm sure Jimbo would provide hangers if necessary."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars! We had a great stay at Jimbo's loft. The decor is quirky, and the lighting is luxe. We really enjoyed our visit to Astoria and exploring the nearby breweries, restaurants and of course the Astoria Coffee Bistro. Jimbo was such a friendly and generous host. Highly recommend booking here if you're in search of a place in Astoria."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing this place is an experience itself added so much to the trip
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in Astoria many times and can honestly say this was the best experience I’ve ever had! Even with this being a spontaneous last minute booking for a birthday getaway, ( 1 hour before check in time) the owner still went the extra mile for us! The whole process was so effortless and I was very impressed and appreciative of everything that was included with the stay. I truly felt like a VIP of Astoria and had an amazing birthday. I will continuously look for this charming & unique spot anytime I’m staying in town now. Thanks for the experience Jimbo!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,jimbo was very accommodating & gave several recommendations for the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Jimbo’s loft in downtown Astoria! The loft is beautifully decorated and the location is prefect for exploring. Jimbo went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay, including complementary drinks at Carruthers below the loft and breakfast at Astoria Coffee House & Bistro a block away, both of which he owns and were fantastic! Thank you Jimbo for your great hospitality, we will definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay at Jimbo's place. Excellent location (near restaurants, art galleries, walking trails and incredible views of the Columbia river!). Jimbo is the consummate host and is super responsive. The apartment is so wonderfully eclectic that I felt I was staying in Paris!
Can't wait to come again. Very much worth it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's place was immaculate. Every piece of art and every decoration seemed perfectly curated for the space and for the people who might stay there. It was so unique and fun! I've never been to a place quite like it. The furniture was comfortable, there were personal touches that actually made all the difference! He was a responsive host, and very accommodating. The breakfast we had at the cafe the next morning was a thing of beauty! This place made my coastal getaway a dream come true. I will stay here any time I'm in the area if it's available!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t say enough great things. Amazing and unique place! Honestly better than what we imagined. Easy to find and great location. Walkable to anything downtown including restaurants, bars, and the pier. The fridge was stocked with complimentary drinks and a complimentary breakfast was included which was delicious. Jimbo left easy and detailed instructions which made finding the place a breeze. Definitely will be back and will be recommending this find to family and friends. Don’t miss out!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jimbo was an incredible host and the place was great. The complimentary cocktails and breakfast was such an awesome touch. He also left us drinks in the fridge. Best host I’ve ever had with Airbnb.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I could write several things about this very unique and interesting Airbnb but I will just say this. This place is the best place we have ever stayed in. If you pass up a chance to stay here and decide to go elsewhere in Astoria you are making a mistake.

Thank you for making our first time in Astoria and this stop of our PNW trip rememberable!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Caruthers’s Loft. We love staying there. It’s clean, comfortable, very well appointed, and has a artsy vibe. We’ll be back. Jimbo is the best."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I could not recommend this stay more! It is stunningly curated & thoughtfully designed with great attention to detail. The location does not get better for exploring downtown Astoria. Jimbo is an incredibly thoughtful and communicative host. And very importantly an insanely comfortable bed! 10/10!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was EVERYTHING! Loved the decor! Loved the area! Loved the amazing bathroom! Loved the welcome drinks in the fridge!
SO many thoughtful touches. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a unique and fun find in the heart of Astoria. Jimbo was an excellent host. Everything we could have wanted for a couple of nights -- and more!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a place so awesome I was compelled to take a video to show my friends. Indescribably cool. Also, when you show up there are some essentials (coffee, beverages) and little touches everywhere that make it very apparent a lot of thought was put into making the space fantastic. I literally recommended this as a staycation location to an Astorian friend because of how awesome it is. Thanks, Jimbo!"

Jimbo was incredibly helpful prior to checking in with instructions for getting in and parking. I definitely recommend this place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, too many good things to say about Jimbo and his unique little loft! Highlights being walkable to just about anything you need in Astoria, an incredibly eclectic and unique loft space with decor and a view into the restaurant below. Complimentary drinks for said restaurant, a fridge already stocked with a variety of beverages, and breakfast included at a local bistro. For the price, location, host, and extras…it can’t be beat.

The spot is a touch pricy but definitely worth it if you’re looking for a better experience, everything was awesome"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a perfect place to stay in Astoria in the heart of downtown! Jimbo had everything set up to make us feel accommodated. The aesthetic was so unique and kept us interested for our entire stay. We got very detailed information and had no issues figuring everything out. Everything was a breeze! There is a nice kitchen setup with a full fridge, sink, dishware, drinks, and more.

I parked my car and walked everywhere else. The space itself is really cool. Lots of cool decor and the bathroom is HUGE and so nice. It is next to the restaurant so I did hear some slamming doors and noises as they closed but it wasn’t bad. There’s a lot of space and plenty of seating. Jimbo communicated well and was very kind. I had a great time walking around the area, checking out the breweries. Amazing place to stay. So I glad I booked it. Definitely would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!!! This has been the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. The location was perfect. The place itself was eclectic, modern and chic- just like in the photos. We were left with some drink cards for the restaurant below and ate their twice because of it! Delicious!

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Fun place to stay, great location, very clean! The apartment was a little bit warm and only had one window. It’s an old, beautiful building so that makes sense. The street was a bit noisy, but overall great stay."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most interesting and creative spaces I've stayed in. Jimbo was so easy to communicate with. His restaurant is directly below and provided us comp wine and beer, and great recommendations in Astoria. We ate breakfast at his coffee shop and the lox bagel did not disappoint. Check it out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,comfortable stay. relaxing yet stimulating to look at all the fun decor. great walking heart of downtown
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome unique place to stay. Close to city attractions, wonderful restaurants, and beautiful Columbia River. Good communication, easy free parking, and great location benefits."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great centrally located place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Host was very easy to work with.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place. We enjoyed our stay and we were impressed by all the amenities. Location was awesome - easy access to river walk, restaurants, etc."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’d give 6 stars if I could!
Jimbo went above and beyond in a lot of little ways to make the experience awesome. Will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the Loft over Carruthers for just one night. Jimbo was the most amazing host we've ever experienced on AirBnb, and we've stayed at quite a few. Not only are there refreshments and a fantastic, unbelievably creative space upon arrival, but the listing also includes free cocktails at the fabulous Carruthers restaurant and breakfast at the Astoria Coffeehouse and Bistro just around the corner. All at a more agreeable rate than any other place in town. This space is even better than the pictures show. You have to stay there to believe it. Jimbo has a tastefully creative artist's eye for decor and the amenities and details are an artistic experience too detailed to write about in this small space. We will definitely go back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jimbo's place was great. The host was very responsive, stocked the fridge with some drinks for us, and even a treat for the dogs! The place was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint that we have is that it was pretty hard to find a place to park on the street that wasn't too far away. It was a holiday weekend though... Overall, I would stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Another fantastic stay at Jimbo’s place. As always, check-in was seamless and the apartment was pristine and beautifully decorated. Thanks again for making my stay in Astoria a great one!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! Can’t beat the location right in the heart of downtown Astoria. Host is awesome, very responsive and provided a lot of extras that we enjoyed. Would highly reccomend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Decor of the apartment was quite amazing, not your ordinary Airbnb! Lots of fun stuff. This apartment is in the commercial/downtown area, and not in Leave it to Beaver's neighborhood, but fairly quiet. We were traveling back home from cruising the Oregon coast, and only stayed one night. Well equipped with supplies, and the bed was comfy."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far the best AirBnB we have ever stayed at! The host was so helpful and clear with communication. The space was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The windows looking in to the restaurant were so fun. Host was so kind and generous in offering drinks at the restaurant, a fridge stocked with local drinks and non-dairy milks for the coffee (also provided) and a complimentary breakfast at the coffee shop around the corner. We had a delicious dinner at the restaurant and breakfast at the coffee shop and enjoyed strolling around town too. Thank you for a fabulous stay! I wish we were there longer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful stay! Beautiful place, aesthetically pleasing. Close to all the restaurants/ coffee shops, and the piers. We had everything we need. Thank you so much, what a memorable time we had."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time at Jimbo's place. Jimbo was super helpful and responsive via text. The location was stellar: the middle of downtown Astoria, perfect for a couple in my opinion. The interior decor was amazing, you can tell Jimbo has put a lot of work into furnishing the place. I also thought the bathroom was amazing. The hospitality was great and I would HIGHLY recommend staying at this Airbnb! Thank you Jimbo!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fun Loft! Lots to do in the area. Love the dog friendly atmosphere. Would come back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome stay—great location in downtown Astoria with easy access to riverfront and all the best restaurants.
The space is eclectic and engaging, lots to explore in the apartment itself! We’d be lucky to stay here again. Thanks Jimbo!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My absolute favorite BnB I’ve ever stayed in! Astoria has tons to do, the space is private but quickly accessible. I loved it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Jimbo’s and will definitely be looking to stay here again next time we come to Astoria!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was possibly our favorite Airbnb we've stayed in. It was immaculately dressed with eclectic decor and Jimbo stocked us with local beverages and provided a level of hospitality we did not expect. We will absolutely book here again, and hope to, in the near future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed a couple of nights here touring around NW Oregon in our rental car. This place was exactly what we needed - it was super walkable to anything we wanted, had all the amenities we needed, and was super affordable. We had a parking spot out front for free the whole time, super easy parking and access. The bed was SO COMFY. You do hear some noise from neighbors and the restaurant below, but nothing too disturbing. You can also hear traffic, so just be aware if that sort of thing bothers you. The place is eclectic and fun. There’s WiFi and a TV with all the apps you could think of to stream. Plenty of nice fluffy towels and lotion/body wash if you need it. Jimbo left us some VIP cards for complimentary drinks in his restaurant downstairs and offered complimentary breakfast at the coffee/bistro. This was really the ideal place to stay in Astoria."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Stunning is the only appropriate word to describe this spot. We LOVED staying here. Is the perfect walkable space for all things Astoria. Can’t recommend this rental and the owner enough.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough great things about our stay here. The place was beautifully decorated, clean, and in the middle of downtown. I could go on, but just know this is a 5 star experience, all around."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous interiors, funky vibe and right in the middle of lots of fun shops and places to eat. I loved that you can peek down into the restaurant from inside and get a friendly wave from the bartender if he spots you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Would hands down recommend staying at Jimbo’s place! Space was amazingly decorated. Jimbo was very responsive. Next door/overlooks a restaurant/bar that Jimbo gave use complimentary drinks to. (Great drinks and try the Brussel Sprouts!!) There was also a coffee shop around the corner where we could get a complementary breakfast too!! We loved Astoria and loved checking it out while staying here. Honestly, my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a wonderful spot for our stay in Astoria. Jimbo's style and decor was so eclectic and interesting. Furthermore, his suggestions of places in town (including some drinks on the house!) were impeccable. We loved every minute of our stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This might be our favorite Airbnb ever. Jim is a fabulous host -- kind, personable, and quick to respond. He made us feel like VIPs, which was extra special since we were celebrating my birthday.
The loft itself is funky and fascinating, with lots of character and charm. It is spacious, clean, and well-stocked, and we loved examining the art and collectibles. We had a blast peeking down into the restaurant below! Occasionally, someone would catch us watching, but each time they'd smile and return our friendly waves.
The bed was comfortable, and the kitchenette included many lovely little extras. You can't beat the location -- close to so many restaurants, stores, breweries, and museums, you name it, it's right nearby. We met lots of friendly locals and felt very much at home.
The size of the loft, its closeness to everything we needed, and the fact that its dog friendly made it the perfect place for us in every way. We can't wait to return."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely LOVE this loft! I was a bit nervous about our daughter getting crazy with the furniture and decor but she was so in love with the whole place. The restroom was beautiful, the mirrors were our little ones favorite thing she spent most of her time sitting on the tiny stool in the restroom. The decor was incredible. I loved the descriptions on some items, the quirkiness of the home was so unique and we had so much fun. The free drinks at the restaurant below and the free daily breakfast was a nice and unexpected addition to the stay. We loved the small town feel and how close everything was. We will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The place is decorated is such a unique and stunning way. We loved it!!
We also loved the location, lots of great restaurants and bars in easy walkable distance. Easy to walk along by the river.
We will definitely be back and highly recommend this place. Thank you Jimbo."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I will definitely be back. This place is so unique and fun and decorated to perfection. Walked downstairs to the restaurant, Carruthers, it was delish (have the cauliflower!)! The breakfast at the Astoria Coffeehouse and Bistro (that they provide), was also great. So many great little treats within walking distance. My dog was welcome too, and he had a great time sitting in front of the little “turn on” fireplace.
All in all a wonderful place to stay!
Highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's loft was more spacious than the photos let on. We didn't bring our large dog, but there would've been plenty of space for her. When you enter the building, there are ~12 wide stairs, and it was nicely lit inside. The bed and couch were comfy, heat kept us warm, and the many lights gave a nice ambiance. The only complaint, which is out of Jimbo's control, was the noise. We awoke to repeated thrashing outside around midnight, more repeated noises around 2:30am, then the neighbors were up and chatting around 6:30am. Walls are very thin, and a few times a neighbor would say something so clear we thought it came from inside the loft. All things considered, we'd still stay here again! The location, decor, and complimentary items were unmatched. The bartender at Carruthers downstairs was excellent, too!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My son and I had a wonderful time at Jimbo's loft. Staying above a fancy restaurant where you could ""spy"" on them though a window above the bar was exciting enough but the decor and amenities absolutely sent it over the top. The place is drop dead gorgeous and very well appointed, from the extra linens/blankets to the fridge full of wine, beer and sodas.
The location is great as well, we were able to leave the car parked in the same spot the whole time and walk all over town.
Jimbo was super responsive the whole time, texting the check in info as well as answering any questions I had within an hour.
Oh and I almost forgot one of the best parts, there aren't 100+ cleaning chores for check out! Not always easy to do when checking out with small kids. I definitely made sure to tip the housekeeper and so should you!
All in all, 5 stars across the board! Thanks again Jimbo!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible! We felt spoiled. So wonderful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jimbo's place was a definite 10/10 would recommend. Exactly as described and Jimbo was one of the friendliest and communicative hosts I've encountered. Astoria is a super adorable coastal town and I really enjoyed my first visit there. The restaurant this rental is above is a quiet upscale place, so you don't have to worry about loud bar music or rowdy guests. Go ahead and book this place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much about an airbnb rental is in the responsiveness of the host; Jimbo is exceptional. I had to cancel an earlier reservation 36 hours before checkin because of COVID, and he was wonderful, so I rebooked almost immediately. Everything I needed to know was inside the room when I arrived, and Jimbo is so well known in the downtown area that I was directed where I could meet him, and I did so. He owns the restaurant that this loft apartments peers down on and at least one other property in town, plus the coffeeshop a block away. What a great host. The apartment is eclectically decorated, but you can see that in the pictures. I had no complaints at all."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an amazing stay! Parking was simple to find, and the instructions were very clear. The place was super quirky and had lots to look at! We really appreciated the complimentary breakfast and recommendations for local spots :) Jimbo was very responsive and proactive, and even contacted me when I had forgotten my sandals! 10/10 will most definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This Air BNB was perfect for a weekend getaway. You are right in the middle of down town and an east walk to anything you want to do! The compliments breakfast and cocktails was a nice touch too. We would definitely consider booking here again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a maximalist fantasy. Every corner has something to look at and appreciate. The quirky elements, like windows that look down into the neighboring restaurant, are what make this place an experience. The host was responsive, thoughtful, and helpful. They even provided complementary cocktails at the neighboring bar (have the prickly pear margarita!), and coffee at the coffee shop down the way—an unexpected treat. All of this set in the picturesque backdrop of Astoria! Would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely staying at Jimbo’s if available in our next visit to Astoria. Loft as described, very responsive host, he left complementary drinks in the fridge, and the complimentary breakfast was excellent, you have to try the French toasts."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! Great central location, with local favorites within walking distance. The Coffeehouse on 11th was amazing. We will be booking our next trip based on the availability of the loft. Thank you. Jimbo!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! It's an absolute gem of a place to stay! The place itself is beautiful, and it is conveniently located downtown and in walking distance from most of the attractions!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was in the perfect location! We had a great time staying here, and the free breakfast at the coffee house was such a nice addition to a great stay. We would love to stay here when we come back again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at! Super cool space and amazing location.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jumbo’s place ! Even though we didn’t arrive until the evening, I appreciated that the check in time was at 1pm and had the option to get in earlier to drop off luggage etc :) In the midst of all the action and walkable to everything in the heart of downtown Astoria. The place was extremely clean and had cool features as well as a comfortable bed and plenty of extra pillows , towels and blankets.
The included breakfast option was sweet and the cafe it is served at provided great service and delicious options!
10/10 recommend staying at Jimbo’s, thank you so much!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with fun eclectic decoration. Very responsive host provides all you could need. Lively downtown location above a fine dining restaurant. Come here for nights out in Old Town Astoria, rather than a quiet getaway. We greatly appreciated a pet-friendly space, where our old Labrador could rest in the afternoon after hitting the trails or beach in the morning. Recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a dream! Absolutely perfectly cured interiors, cozy bed, and everything you need to feel at home.
The location couldn't be better. There are a ton of excellent shops and restaurants within a couple minutes walk.
The sweet extra perks are such a nice bonus, too.
I'll be looking to book here again, and again."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This loft fully lived up to all the great reviews and pics. Fun decor, super clean and comfortable, thoughtful touches made us feel very welcome. 100% will be back and HIGHLY recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My brief stay at Jimbo's loft was absolutely spectacular! I really loved the moodiness of the place. It was extremely clean, had so much warm ambient lighting and provided the perfect amount of necessities. Additionally,Jimbo went the extra host mile to provide different types of beverages in the refrigerator. Furthermore, the Loft is right in the heart of downtown Astoria and you can walk anywhere. There is a restaurant directly below the Loft and if you like crunchy french fries you're going to want to get the house fries!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jimbo's loft was amazing, definitely the best Airbnb I've stayed at. The area was cozy and clean, and the decor was so unique and interesting. We took advantage of the complimentary drinks offered in the restaurant downstairs and breakfast at his coffeehouse nearby, and both were great. On top of all of that, I left my purse at the restaurant below and didn't remember until the next day, and Jimbo was very responsive and helped get it back to me before the restaurant opened. Overall a great experience and would definitely stay again if I'm in Astoria."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Didn't realize breakfast at the nearby cafe was included when we booked (at least at time we rented, suppose it may change). Made the stay really worth it! Super cool apartment - and yup, two windows looking down at (and up from...) the downstairs bar. Very spacious and clean bathroom. Bed is OK - comfy pillows."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t beat the location or the amenities!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Location was ideal. Host was quick to respond. Would highly recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Jimbo’s! We will for sure be back. We felt right at home and it was such a fun, funky, and awesome vibe. Jimbo was super responsive. We cannot wait to come back! Make sure you take a walk on the docks and look (and listen for seal lion friends)!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious loft space with unique and comfy decor.
Location means some extra noise at times but did not detract from enjoying our time there."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel to Astoria often but this flat introduced a wonderfully new experience. We instantly felt at home. Jimbo clearly has an eye for art and design and has carefully curated the most interesting ensemble of artistic furniture and decor. Thoughtful touches such as wine/beer, complementary breakfast and cocktails were just cherries on top. The apartment had everything we needed and the location was superbly located in the heart of downtown. We can’t wait to visit again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jimbo is so nice, extremely responsive (literally minutes when I texted him), and the little touches were so appreciated: the lights were on when we arrived and it felt so welcoming, he left drink tickets for the restaurant downstairs, the heater in the bathroom was so nice since we were wet from all the rain and he even left drinks in the fridge that we enjoyed. It’s unheard of to allow dogs in such a beautiful place! This was the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My fiance and I had a fantastic stay at the loft. The location is perfect, being very walkable to shops and restaurants.

I'd highly recommend staying here for your trip to Astoria."

The loft is located in the perfect location, right in the center of downtown Astoria. If you are traveling with a dog that’s finicky about where to go to the bathroom, you can find grass a few blocks away to the east by the trolley.
Such a great stay! Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Probably one of the coolest places I’ve ever stayed. Everything was clean, easy, bed was comfy, place was cozy. Shower was warm with good pressure. Free breakfast was banging. Would absolutely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’ll join the chorus of raves for Jimbo’s place. Exactly as shown/described, it was clean, everything operating perfectly and well stocked. Jimbo should be Superhost 2.0 with great communication, drinks in the fridge, free cocktails downstairs and complimentary coffee and breakfast. It was a tad noisy in the early am with workers in the kitchen below but it didn’t diminish the great time we had. If you’re after a fun and funky place for a great romantic getaway, Jimbo has the place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second stay at one of Jimbo’s Airbnbs, and just like my first stay, it did not disappoint.

Highly recommend!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Jimbos place was ahhhhmazing! His style was eclectic & we absolutely loved it. He took care of every detail. The bed was so comfy & the loft was spacious. He answered every question we had quickly & kindly. Location was perfect! His restaurant below was just as impeccable. Mikayla the bartender made the perfect sidecar & the buffalo cauliflower was to die for. Breakfast the next morning at his place was the icing on the cake! Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was clean and has very interesting style. bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper (the restaurant is directly below you). also, in case you're allergic, note there are lots of down feather pillows and wool blankets.
The place came with a lot of goodies and treats. breakfast at a nearby cafe was included."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This loft stay was amazing. Warm and welcoming. Jimbo provided everything one would need for a relaxing time in Astoria. Having the best restaurant in town (Carruther’s) right next door is a huge plus. Conveniently located to many shops and the waterfront. Would gladly stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Caruthers loft is absolutely beautiful and unique. It was the perfect apartment to celebrate my birthday weekend and the location couldn’t get any better. Jimbo was also the most accommodating & communicative host. We will definitely be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The decor is every bit as fun as the photos suggest, and the unit is quite roomy. The location is perfect, within an easy walk to restaurants, bars, and points of interest.
The complementary breakfast was substantial—not just the continental brekkie I was expecting—and there were plenty of choices. The complementary drinks were the icing on the cake.
I’ll be back!"

Jimbo was also super generous and had the fridge stocked with local beer and wine, gave us complimentary drinks at Carruther’s downstairs, plus a continental breakfast at his local bistro & cafè.
The loft was also super clean and stocked with everything we could have needed. Street parking was also a breeze (there were a lot of limited hour zones but we didn’t have any issue leaving our car overnight).
Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had to date!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here - this is why we use AirBnb. It is so fun to see other peoples unique vision and style. Very fun. We just wish we could have stayed longer, but we will be back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful cottage! In an age of over priced, disappointing accommodations which seem to litter Airbnb this cottage is amazing. Simple, cozy but full of warmth and everything you need for a quick getaway from the city to the coast. Everything thought of, everything you need, incredibly clean! Just can’t say enough. Kelly was super forth coming and timely with communication. We will definitely be coming back! This is a magical cottage!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot to explore Astoria and nearby ocean towns along the Oregon coast! My husband and I found the cottage to be cozy and welcoming with many thoughtful amenities! Host was quick to respond and provided local tips. We would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Probably the best AirBnB I've ever stayed at.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Kelly’s was wonderful. The house was cozy and filled with everything we needed! The location was great, peaceful and yet a short drive to the restaurants and shops in Astoria as well as great State Park trails. Kelly was a great host, very friendly, and quickly responded to our questions."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the best AirBnB we've ever stayed in. It's small but incredibly sweet and had literally everything we needed, and many things we didn't need but loved having. (Record player! Baby wipes! Toys for kids of all ages!) We brought our 1yo with us and felt guilty making her leave at the end of our stay. If we ever come back to Astoria (which we would love to do, as it was way cuter and had way more things to do than we anticipated) we will absolutely be staying here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time at Kelly's, and it was just as awesome as the first. The location is very secluded and makes the stay that much better. Thank you for another great stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay at the cottage! It had everything we needed plus more. You can really tell how much genuine care Kelly puts into her property and her guests. There were plenty of local recommendations for things to do and restaurants, which was super helpful for us! Kelly was also great with proactive communication on instructions and when the cottage was available for check-in. We unfortunately were just passing through for one night, but now we wish we had more time at the cottage and in Astoria!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely little cottage, very clean and quiet. Kelly was incredibly helpful and kind. The amenities were above and beyond our expectations."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was extremely thoughtful for Kelly to leave my wife a birthday gift ! The place was cute and comfortable and not very far out of town at all. This was extremely reasonably priced for what was provided.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was kept super clean and well organized and it looks really nice. It felt very homey and cozy, and is in a great location right outside of Astoria. Loved our time there. Kelly was also super nice and communicative, we didn’t have any issues at all."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay! And look forward to visiting again. Very cozy! Thank you for hosting us!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed with my 2 kids, and it was such a great little cottage to stay in, it has seaside coastal charm with updated amenities. Great WiFi, TV, heat and air conditioning. Kelly was gracious and very accommodating."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very close to town without major distruption of peace. Loved the cottage, fits perfectly for 2. 3 or 4 may be a little small depending on the guest size. l
Loved it here"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed about a week,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Kelly’s place until the end.
We have been accused of burning holes in her house and taking items. We are also being accused of having more people in the home than what was listed. I find it absolutely ridiculous that the host, Kelly, would think someone took a “hidden stick from behind the washer” and burn “9-12” holes in their home. Let alone several. It’s absolutely nonsense.
We took nothing from the home, and we even left toilet paper and air fresheners behind. The trash can that was at our disposal was already full when we got to the airbnb on the 3rd of April. According to Kelly, she had to “take two car loads of trash” away from the home.
It saddens me that we are accused of damaging such a cute little cottage. It also saddens me that we took the extra steps to clean and replace toiletry items for the host and she still had the audacity to tell us “items are not appreciated”.
I have all messages if anyone wants to know more."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed to get away from home to catch up on some writing and work projects, and this place was perfect for that. I didn't want to leave when my time was done. The decor was cute and homey. Everything was provided that I needed in the kitchen and bathroom. There were helpful notes about where to find things that reminded me of my mom and made me smile. The heater/AC was easy to operate which was nice because the temps really fluctuated while I was there. It's right off a highway, tucked back a bit from the road, and I'm not used to road noise, so I was grateful for the sound machine by the bed + the ample plugins for my devices. I'm planning to return for my next getaway. I truly love this area and have stayed in many places in this town. This was a great deal and gave me a lovely respite."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a small getaway.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the cottage. Kelly’s attention to detail was amazing! The cottage was clean and comfortable too!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelly is an exceptional host! The photos and description of the cottage are clear and accurate. It was immaculate. It is warm and cozy and so well appointed with everything we needed, and more. There are lots of extra blankets and pillows for the sofa beds. The bathroom was so well stocked with towels, TP, body products, and sundries. I mentioned to her that we were going to celebrate my birthday while we were in town. Kelly left a beautiful gift bag with homemade blackberry jam, a sweet spring kitchen towel, and a packet of green tea for me. I was so surprised. She was very friendly and a grat communicator. The guest book in the cottage has great directions on how to use and care for things in the cottage and she has all kinds of menus of local restaurants. My husband and I loved our stay and highly recommend the cottage! Kelly is a kind and genuine human being and her love is reflected in her sweet cottage by the bay! =-)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent stay. We have no complaints about the cottage. It exceeded our expectations. It was so cute.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly was an all star host—she was responsive, kind, and elaborate. The airbnb was easy to find, and just perfect. I had high expectations, yet somehow she exceeded them. From the moment we walked in, we felt right at home. I mentioned to Kelly that it was my birthday trip and she left the cutest present for me on the table. From the streaming services, the countless amenities, the cute lil vases of flowers scattered throughout the place. This is the perfect place to have a relaxing and joyful get away with a couple of friends, a partner, or even in your solitude. It’s apparent that Kelly cares for guests and thinks of everyone’s needs. Thank you again, and I hope to return someday!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolute wonderful stay here. Kelly is amazing and friendly. Lots of things to do, very short drive to restaurants. We loved the coziness of this place and definitely plan to stay here again in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cottage was just perfect. I didn’t want to leave! I’d say it is better than the pictures. Just so dang cute. Our 9 month old had plenty of space to crawl around. Well stocked bathroom was helpful too! Kelly was really responsive and on top of making sure we had everything. Astoria is a great place for a quick getaway. Hope we get to come back soon.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's little yellow cabin is adorably shabby chic. It's homey and clearly we'll cares for. Kelly was exceptional at communicating about the potential for early check-in, sharing restaurant recommendations, and more.
I will note that when Kelly says there's a ""big step down"" to the bedroom and bathroom, she's not kidding! It was fine for me, but if you have mobility issues it's something to be aware of.
I would happily stay again the next time I visit Astoria!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about this cozy cottage, it was so adorable and nicely decorated, had a well stocked kitchen perfect for making home cooked meals, and the beds were all comfy. The bathroom is stocked with all the soaps and lotions you could need, and there was a sizable TV with Netflix and other streaming services. Lots of board games too, and an awesome record player! One of our favorite Airbnbs ever, can’t wait to come back again 😄"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable cottage made us feel very cozy and at home. Kelly has so many special touches here, and the privacy and view across the water was just lovely. We were busy with FisherPoets Gathering activities, so this was a lovely sanctuary to recharge."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, very clean and very nice owner! We’ll be back again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy comfortable spot to stay. Loved it!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly is INCREDIBLY responsive and friendly. She was very helpful. We were in Astoria for a festival and she offered to give us a ride back which was incredibly above and beyond.
Bathroom is very well appointed. The kitchen had nice pots and pans and knives. There were good dishes. It's a small house (which is reflected in the price) but it is well appointed.
Would heartily recommend this to other people."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 out of 5! My wife and I stayed here for Valentine's Day, and we were extremely happy with everything all around, but a few key items to mention:
*As owners of a cleaning company that services STR, the level of cleanliness is very important to us. This place was spotless! From the baseboards to no cob webs anywhere, and every area of the home in between, we were very pleased.
*The communication from the host as well as the thoughtfulness that she put into leaving us a gift for Valentine's Day, is unheard of. We appreciated that very much!
*The home was just as described. You'd think this would be a no-brainer, but we travel quite a bit, and in the past- we've been disappointed to not receive what the hosts are essentially selling to guests.
*Amenities that are left are wonderful! I can't express enough how frustrating it is to always bring my own TP when we travel, because the typical brands that hosts leave are inadequate. This host also leave q-tips, flossers, feminine products."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Kelly's cottage was very comfortable and we liked that it was a very short drive to Astoria. We felt like we were visiting a grandma's cottage. We were very impressed with how well equipped it is and you can tell that the host has put in a lot of thought into it. Bed was comfortable and we had a great stay. Appreciated the easy check-out. Way better than staying in a boring hotel! :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was clean and had a spacious living room, nice kitchen, and bathroom which fit our needs perfectly. we had a great stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Supper cozy. Host responded very fast and was very kind

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing little cottage! Super cozy and looks way nicer inside than imagined! Would definitely recommend to others.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's place was perfect for the two of us. It was clean, organized, cozy, and had it all. We cooked multiple times, and the kitchen was stocked with every utensil we could've needed, all in great shape. The attention to detail was immaculate. There were notes around to help with needs, extra toiletries and bedding, and coffee for the mornings. Kelly was a wonderful communicator and even allowed us to have a late check out. Another huge bonus was the record collection..very impressive! Would definitely book again. Thanks, Kelly!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I needed some time away from the big cities we live in. Kelly's cottage fit our needs perfectly. It is convenient, well appointed, clean, and comfortable. We would visit again. Thank you."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"So cozy! So many details that made this cottage homey :-) a comfy bed, plenty of towels, blankets, pillows, extra toiletries, kitchen supplies, and instructions to make it easy. And even a visit from a bald eagle 🦅 right across the street! If you’re a light sleeper (like my partner) you might be impacted by logging trucks and their Jake brakes early in the morning…me personally, I slept right through it. Turn on the sound machine and you should be OK. Superior communication with the host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly’s place was a charming and relaxing place to rest for a weekend away in Astoria and the coast! Would definitely recommend to anyone!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and studying for finals and celebrating the end of the term! Great place, great host :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I just finished a seven nights stay at The Cottage by the Bay.
This was my first experience using an Air B and B. I was not disappointed.
I absolutely loved it. It was everything Kelly described.
Charming, cozy, immaculately, clean.
There are so many positive points to this property that I cannot begin to explain what a lovely place it is.
The personal amenities she provides are beyond expectations.
It’s a perfect location for a couple who’s looking for a quiet, private getaway. It would also be very comfortable for a family with one or two children.
I will definitely return the next time I am in the Astoria area.
I think Kelly has spoiled me."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time at Kelly’s charming cottage and I was sad to leave. My son and I had a wonderful stay - the cottage is cozy and so clean. Beautifully appointed with everything you need. Kelly is a very responsive and kind host. My favorite AirBnb experience.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Kelly's air b n b. It was convenient to Astoria. Although on a highway the location was quiet. The house was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our get away. It is set in a great location very close to the Astoria column and a quick trip to Warrenton. There are SO many extra touches in the house such as lots of bathroom shampoos/lotions/even dental floss! The kitchen is set up with everything you need and games for kids. Lots of extra blankets which some places do not do! Extremely clean and great communication. I would definitely return.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I love Kelly’s little house. The bed is very comfortable. She has it decorated so cute. The kitchen and bathroom have all your needs.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelly was a gracious host, she was very responsive! Very friendly. Her home is very cozy!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So charming!!! we absolutely loved it!!!!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This house is pretty comfortable and super adorable. It’s almost exactly as described, though the bed was not as comfy as people commented (too soft for us). We absolutely loved the record player and the mix of music.
The only slight annoyance was the sound of the cars so close, but we appreciated the noise maker at night. I was also hoping for water access to walk to but it looks like all the land in that area is privately owned.
The price of the house is amazing! The crazy high fees (that are not associated with the owner) are not amazing. But our awesome host gave us a slight discount because the fees were almost twice the cost of the house!! That’s great service for ya!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything, had everything we needed. The other half said it was great but wished there was a slightly larger TV, otherwise it was the perfect getaway. Kelly was awesome and very responsive."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"So cute and such a sweet home to stay while away from home. It was private, warm, cozy and a place to call home while on the immediate outskirts of town.

The area is quiet through the night."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing stay at the cottage. it was perfect for my solo getaway. Kelly has created a fantastic space to relax and feel at home. The bathroom is stocked full of different beauty and hair care supplies! it was like a mini spa. To my great pleasure there were little creamers in the fridge so I didn't have to think about getting milk for my coffee after a long day of traveling. Kelly was very responsive to my questions and very friendly. I definitely would recommend staying here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this cottage! It’s like staying at grandmas…there’s everything there that you need. From fluffy blankets to good shampoo AND lotion. It’s all there.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Kelly and Drew have created a beautiful and comfortable space. We loved the little cottage. To say that Kelly was very responsive, is an understatement. Our communication was typical at first, you know checking in, all is good etcetera, however when our car broke down and required to remain at the garage during our stay Kelly went over and above our expectation. She kept the lines of communication open, she was so helpful and generous of her time. She made sure we were taken care of. She is a true gem. We will be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place! We felt very much at home here.

Super cute and very clean place with lots of thoughtful amenities (lots of shampoo and conditioner, a hairdryer, lotion, a noise machine, a table fan in the bedroom). This is a beautiful area and pretty quiet considering the house is right off the highway. Not a walkable location into downtown Astoria.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great place, I love the decor. very cozy and peaceful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelly left us an email saying her home was ready for us. What a peace we felt entering the enclosed porch, then french doors into your charming home decorated in teal and warm furnishings. The bedroom was full of character and the bathroom was very well-stocked, as well as the kitchen. It was delightful to eat and play games at the kitchen table while listening to provided albums. We enjoyed our favorite restaurants and the sunset from up on the hill above Hwy 202. The summer view of water is limited due to deciduous trees but a quick drive offers a gorgeous view! Loving it so much, we booked a two-night stay in October. Thank you so much!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stop on the way up or down the coast. Property across the street from beautiful water. Comfortable stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was very clean and fit the budget well. It is very small, however, exactly as described. The best part was the swing outside. My kids adored it! My two little people slept in the bedroom and I slept on the single fold out bedroom. It was really comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve stayed at Kelly’s cottage. My favorite Air Bnb by far! Kelly’s attention to detail and thoughtful hosting is always so appreciated. Looking forward my next visit!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two wonderful days at Kelly's cottage! The house is adorable and stocked with all those things that can make for a memorable stay. Everything is very organized and at the same time comfortable, comfortable and delicious. My youngest child would never have wanted to leave! Astoria is a magical city."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Kelly’s little cabin. It was completely clean, cute and well stocked. She has thought of everything you may need. The cabin is perfect for two and was easy to find. We cooked our own meals and made lunches and breakfasts in her kitchen. Bed was comfy. Thanks Kelly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very peaceful location, comfortable Airbnb with everything you need for a few days away - and so much to see in the area!
Thank you, Kelly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a amazing hostess. We had a great stay and will look forward to returning to this darling cottage next year. Highly recommend!!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice little airbnb about 6 minutes from downtown Astoria. Kelly stocked it with everything you need to have a good stay - really nice shampoos and conditioners, even feminine products! The pullout couch was surprisingly really comfortable. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was beautiful and we were so happy to have been hosted by a such a lovely host. Super close to key places but enough privacy to fully relax. 💞💞💞
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's cottage was the perfect home base for us as we explored the Astoria area. We loved the darling interior and amenities- so many kitchen and bath amenities were available. Kelly even left me the sweetest tint bouquet of wild flowers and a birthday present of handmade soap. We loved the place and will be back! Thank you, Kelly."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After camping for over a week arriving to Kelly’s was a little bit of heaven! Once parked I realized I was in a bird haven area! There were SO many robins right in her yard all singing! Then bald eagles arrived flying right over!
Once inside I found a record player with a very nice selection! Johnny Cash was my first choice!
Kelly’s eye for decorating is exceptional and shows she really cares about her guests! The little things is what caught my eye and made me feel right at home! The cottage is older and holds its charm very well! I loved everything about it!
Thank you Kelly, your home is so beautiful!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was so cute. A snug little house that was just as amazing as the pictures. We only stayed for a night but it was just what we needed on our road trip.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelly was super nice and made sure that there weren’t any big fragrance smells as I can be quite sensitive to that. The place was SO clean- really appreciated that as well. The house is next to a road so you can hear the occasional car and because it’s an older cottage, it makes little noises here and there- I kinda spooked myself but honestly it was super super safe. The restroom is not connected to the room so just keep that in mind if you frequently get up to use the restroom at night. Thanks again Kelly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here! Small but perfect for wanting to escape and explore around Astoria. Would 1000% come back here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly’s place is a hidden gem. Close to downtown, Young’s River, and the 101 (for exploring).
It is decorated with a warm inviting beachy-vibe. The living area is comfortable with seating enough for four. Every necessity for away-from-home living is in the cupboards and drawers in the kitchen and bathroom. PS. The water pressure in the shower is great."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible little cottage!! Private, cozy, homey- the decor was lovely, all very well thought out and beachy but not too-beachy. Some other airbnbs have very... kitschy decor... and this one was done tastefully, I kept finding new details everywhere I looked!! Loved cozying up on the couch with the provided blankets, making coffee(both drip and french press) with the local ""Just Love"" roast... some of the best coffee I've ever had actually! Making little pots of tea with an amazing selection to choose from... The shower was great, appreciated the collection of toiletries so very much. Bed was comfortable, perfect amount of bedding. And the binder of attractions was amazing!! has already planned lots to do, but got even more ideas from that. Love that a parking pass to the column was included! Truly a must see. I have nothing but good to say about Kelly's cottage by the sea, I would absolutely stay here again, and hope to plan another trip just to do that soon! ❤️❤️"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage on the Bay is so adorable and really was a perfect weekend stay. I took my gf there for her birthday and we were so amazed at how cute the cottage is, how close to Astoria but far enough away so it's quiet, all the amenities the host has in the cottage, the directions, check in etc etc. We'd give our stay 100 out of 100 stars if we could. I've stayed at many AirBnBs over the years, and this one is the best experience I've ever had. We can't wait to come back, it was honestly perfect in every way. Thanks so much!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin. Above and beyond our expectations with amenities and accommodations. We slept with the window open and the nature sounds were an amazing add on to the already beautiful set up. Very thoughtful way to make it helpful to get around and great instructions. They provided everything needed for our stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing Airbnb! So cute and comfortable, easy to check in, and feels just like home. Kelly has thought of every detail and it shows! The cottage was pristine when I checked in and had anything yogi could think of to make you feel right at home. The kitchen had all the essentials to cook, there were extra sheets and blankets, if needed, and the bathroom is fully stocked with anything you might need from soap to qtips. The bed was comfy and the surroundings were quiet. Kelly left clear instructions and super helpful recommendations for food and activities around Astoria. I can’t recommend this place highly enough and can’t wait to visit again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time, the place was very cute and cozy. Host was very responsive and had good communication with us. Would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, very cute little cottage right on the water! Suited our needs perfectly."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Kelly’s cottage. It was even more cute than she described and had great amenities. She really thought of everything, and we only have good things to say. The cottage was clean and inviting, and we will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage was just what we wanted. Super cute and super clean. Kelly answered all questions super fast and was pleasant in all interactions. It was the seafood festival which we didn't know about and Kelly was apologetic about traffic but we didn't find it bad or noisy at all. We were far enough away from the main part of Astoria to make it peaceful while at cottage. We had a wonderful time and I will go back I'm sure.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this cottage! It was perfect and cozy. So close to everything in Astoria. Probably our favorite Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in- we would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As always our stay at Kelly’s property was lovely. Wonderful host and lovely cottage. See you soon!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't begin to describe the hospitality this host has. When the tv remote died, batteries were dropped off within 15 minutes. The small things matter to me that's going above and beyond. The house was clean and comforting. This was my first ever airbnb, and with this experience, i don't plan to ever go back to hotels. I only wish we could have stayed longer in this comfy cottage."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are return quests and love this sweet little cottage. Kelly has thought of everything you might need and more. The property is always very clean and welcoming. Thank you for being so hospitable and such a thoughtful host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved this cottage. well stocked and beautiful. lots of fun stuff to do around the area and kelly had plenty of info on everything. will stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place on the Oregon coast, we were very happy to be able to stay there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a good place for us. Quiet out of the way and worked well. It is a bit small so we filled it pretty thoroughly with 1 adult and three young kids, so pay attention to that. We appreciated the fast responses by the host. She was always quick to respond and let us know details. I appreciated the quiet area even though it was near the highway, I could hear it a tiny bit but not much at all and only when I tried.
Overall I would recommend it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect cottage for a quick stay in Astoria. Very clean, comfy and cute!
Will definitely book this cottage for another stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly was a great host and check in was very easy. The cottage is bright and decorated with unique pieces that fit the place perfectly. The place has a very nice ""feel"" to it and we felt at home right away. The cottage is stocked with everything you can think of and some things you probably didn't think of.
It is fairly close to the road so you do hear some road noise but it didn't keep us awake at all. We really enjoyed the wonderful view of the sunset.
Will absolutely see if this place is available next time we visit. :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time at the cottage on the bay. This place has such a magical ocean cottage feel. Kelly is a wonderful host! The place was spotless, and full of everything you could need, including laundry which is awesome! it's peaceful and quiet with a great view. can't wait to stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best AirBnB's I have found! Kelly was a wonderful host. The cottage is adorable and well-equipped with sweet little creature comforts like a record player with some great music and a candy machine! Great toys for kids, and surrounded by green and blackberry bushes. It is close to all the great places to enjoy along the coast. The instructions to get there were very clear, and there were helpful notes around to make the stay even more pleasant. I highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! Easy location to find. Adorable little place with all of the extra touches that you could want or need. Would absolutely recommend and would book again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little yellow cottage is absolutely adorable! So very clean, all the extra linens you can ever need, bathroom very well stocked- even has tampons available in case you find yourself in a situation! 👍🏼 Weather and season permitting there are tire swings and blackberries which she encourages you to enjoy ❤️ The ONLY drawback whatsoever that I would mention is the sofa is not very comfortable to sit on - the cushions are very thin and if you have a “ boney bottom “ as I do you might find it a tad uncomfortable 🥴 however, I just put a folded blanket down 😀 Our party was my husband and I and 2 of our best friends- ( not a couple) so they got the couch and fold out chair. .. Would be ideal for same situation /one couple/ couple with 2 children 👍🏼 I absolutely recommend a stay here and hopefully will get the chance to come back in the summer! Thank you Kelly , you and your family have made an awesome place to stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cottage. I will definitely stay here again. Clean, warm, and well decorated with many amenities. Beautiful sunsets over Youngs River."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kelly's. It was a small charming house with a set up to comfortably fit four adults. We loved the extra touches like the record player, decor and amenities in the bathroom. It was a quick 5-minute drive to Astoria and even closer to the column. We would definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very delightful cottage. CLEAN!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very kind host who provided everything we might need. We loved this place!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Kelly’s place was too cute!!! She really did a great job of making her little cottage feel like home! It was very clean (my favorite part) and the view of the bay was lovely!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay in this very attractive getaway. Kelly seems to have anticipated guests’ every need. We were accustomed to a different bed, so it lowered our rating from great to good, but as retirement age people that’s an expected adjustment.
We’re grateful for Kelly’s prompt responses throughout the check in and checkout process."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was exactly as describe, and even better! Kelly is a very kind and responsive host ehich made checking in a breeze."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this sweet little cottage. Kelly thought of absolutely everything we could possibly need or want during our stay. Love having a washer and dryer and the bed was extremely cozy and comfortable. She is a gracious host and we will be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly was very easy to communicate with and returned messages promptly. Also, the home is very peaceful with a great view."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, and it was fun, exploring the Astoria area, which we had never been to before. We had fun exploring a little bit around Long Beach, in Washington, too! We ate in some great restaurants, and most of all just enjoyed relaxing and reading in the adorable, cozy beach cottage!! Everything was just wonderful and we would highly recommend this area and this wonderful beach cottage"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly was quick to respond to messages, and is very friendly!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was clean, cozy, and very well equipped! A big wind storm resulted in a power outage, but Kelly and her husband took good care of us - lots of blankets, ice blocks for the fridge, flashlights and candles, and a propane space heater, as well as generator power for an electric space heater. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we could need, and the place was very clean. It was a great value, and a nice spot to call home for a few days while we explored the area."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I just stayed right after Christmas when a huge storm came through and a power outage, Kelly had clear instructions, flashlights and candles provided. To that, she had every amenity we could need. The cottage was very clean, warm and so cozy. We played provided games and listened to records and had the best experience. Highly recommend and we plan on this being our Astoria stay in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly was a great host and the cottage is really nice. Clean, comfy, lots of thoughtful touches! Highly recommend this spot."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly has done an amazing job of making this sweet little cottage a home away from home. My number one priority is a clean space and it was spotless! She responded quickly, had instructions for various things, brochures & menus, lots of towels & wash clothes, pretty much every amenity you would need, a filtered water pitcher full of water in the fridge and I loved the various quotes on pillows and hanging plaques. I had my friend over for one night and she loved the place as well. We will both be recommending Kelly’s cottage to friends & family. Kelly is even mailing my rain hat to me, which I left behind. She is so sweet. Thank you Kelly for a wonderful 4 night visit!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy, charming cottage! Beautiful location on the bay, and really thoughtful amenities. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cozy cabin. Especially loved the full kitchen. We were there for thanksgiving and were able to fix a feast. Shower is hot hot with great water pressure. Loads of extra towels, and blankets. Location is great, close to town but with a country feel. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a late fall/winter weekend at Kelly's cottage and had a great time. It's not right in the center of town, so is private and you can look out at the water (across the street) from the yard. There's plenty of space to stretch out and also to have your meals and the kitchen and bathroom had all we needed. For other non-summer travelers, what also was great was that the cottage warmed up quickly even when cold outside. We'd definitely visit again next time in Astoria."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous little cottage. Amazing location. Super comfortable. This was our favorite stay on the Oregon coast.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,My trip was full of much needed R & R. Kelly's quick and early communication made that possible. I will definitely look up the availability for future trips to the area.

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was not only a great value and a very private venue; it had all the amenities of home. To include a full size refrigerator and stove/oven; which is great for all the yummy seafood in the area you'd like to cook for yourself and to take home. Thanks again Kelly!
-Mrs. K"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cottage, a little outside town but it didn’t take long to get anywhere. Well stocked kitchen, generous amount of toiletry items, and very clean. Kelly responded quickly to my questions (she even came to my rescue when I locked myself out). I’d definitely book this again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family loved our stay here! The cottage was immaculate clean and comfortable. My son played on the tree swing and we played some of the board games. It was perfect for us.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,small but a good use of space makes it not feel claustrophobic. host has taken a lot of time adding personal touches to the place. it was perfect for us.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kelly's cottage is very cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed the convenience of the location and had no trouble finding her place. She provided everything we needed and noticed lots of amenities we wouldn't have even thought of. We would highly recommend staying here and would love to visit again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's rental was cute and clean with plenty of personal touches to make you feel at home. Everything you might need to cook, bathe and sleep warm was there. The only thing I would change was the location; it was a bit far from downtown Astoria and the drive at night was challenging. Otherwise I give it a thumbs up!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, quaint and quiet.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this cute little cottage. It was very comfortable for me and my son and had everything we needed and much more! I don’t think I have ever seen a vacation rental so well stocked. The location was close to the Astoria Column and close to downtown and except for a bit of traffic noise it was most relaxing! The only thing I need to mention is that the couch is not very comfortable for sleeping. My son slept in the big sleep-chair. The bed was very comfortable. Other than that we loved it!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was hands down the best little Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The cleanliness and Kelly’s attention to detail as well as her flare for homey decor made us feel right at home. Nothing was left undone and we hope to be back sooner rather than later.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location to explore the Astoria, Seaside and Cannon Beach area. The cottage was super clean, cozy and comfortable. plenty of room to relax. Nice hot shower and comfortable bed, after our excursions. Kelly places close attention to detail."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very nice cottage in Astoria. The host has supplied it with everything you need, and it was especially good for our small toddler as there were a lot of toys and games at the house. There were also thoughtful notes and suggestions for local activities. Very good communication and very pleasant."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelly has thought of everything you could need during your stay. The cottage is older, but nicely remodeled, cute and clean with beach themed decor. Well stocked with blankets and cookware… shampoos and toiletries. Very cozy and comfy!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely give them 150 out of 100! Everything was well above our expectations and absolutely perfect for what we were doing. We were down there on a fishing trip and there was plenty of room for us to maneuver our boat around and be able to park it and they even had extra freezer space for our catch. Can't possibly say enough good about the place and the host we will definitely be rebooking with them next year
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was small but comfortable and clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay. Plus we had a little problem we left some thing behind Kelly was right on it her communication was excellent. We would stay here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleadure to stay in Kelly's house. The house is very well equiped and clean. There were even more than we expected with some toys for our kids to play, musics. There where tons of blackberries behind the house, and we even saw some deers in the garden. A lot of information were provided to visit the area. We recommand without hesitation. Liliane"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sweet getaway in a great location. Everything we needed was right there including washer/dryer. Set back from the road, it was fairly quiet. The two tree swings were a hit with the grandkids. I'd like to go back all by myself just to get away!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely adorable cottage. Kelly has stocked the bathroom with ample towels and a host of toiletries. The kitchen was stocked so nicely as well. We really wished we were able to be there more than one night!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely love Judith's place. So quirky and inviting. Very peaceful, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. There was so much information available on the area (the Goonies) and restaurant recommendations. Judith went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. If we ever visited Astoria again Judith's would be the only place we'd stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I just loved Judiths place. It was a gem for my husband to find. I wish our plans made it so we could have stayed another day or two. but it was perfect for the two of us and I loved everything about her space. it is a place after my own heart. Thank you Judith for sharing your space with us.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From start to finish, this was exactly what we needed. Quiet, comfortable, cozy and fun decor. Close to many different activities. From the short walk to the Gonnies house (which you can also catch a glimpse of from both driveway and backyard, to the distant barking of the sea lions down on the waterfront. Judith was warm and welcoming. She was readily available with suggestions and ideas for activities and dining around town. We are already brainstorming activities for our next stay with her. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, close to downtown Astoria, easy to find, and has a beautiful view from the front drive. We made some fun discoveries nearby (good coffee!) and liked that we could walk to town via the river walk. Our host was incredibly friendly and accommodating and made us feel right at home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a gem and Judith was very lovely! The pictures are just like the place but even better in person! We did not expected that we would be staying right on Goonie street and the views of Astoria was astonishing. The inside was filled with beautiful decorations and Judith’s custom acrylic wind chimes which was amazingly beautiful. 110% would recommend if you are looking for a getaway at the coast! We will be back later this summer for sure!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at this magical little cottage. Lots of interesting decor, a variety of books on local history and whimsical topics, and tons of information on area attractions and resturants. Our hosts were very friendly and always responsive."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very quiet, nice and cozy. Close enough to town, coffee shop within walking distance. I would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judith's place is even more charming than it appears in the photos. Even before we arrived Judith made some very helpful recommendations for places to go and delicious seafood to eat! Everything was clean and ready to go when we arrived. The neighborhood is very charming and just a short drive from downtown. We will definitely stay there when we're back in Astoria!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciate the beautiful vibe in this cottage. No beige, ""live, laugh, lake"" Home Goods pillows. A true artist's kitsch. Locals who have embraced the Oregon film history and unique small town strong hold that is Astoria, (not Uh-storia) is what I strive to find. Just enough communication from our host, hands off or on, whatever you need. I loved sipping coffee on the porch, listening to the distant sea lions and gazing at either the bridge over the bay or the Goonie house up the hill. We would definitely come back for another little getaway."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second stay at Judith's. The space is lovely - not plush but homey and peaceful. It has everything you need to be comfortable and has a welcoming retro vibe. The location is close enough to walk to town and once you cross Highway 30 it's a nice walk along the waterfront. We will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a wonderful time in this little cabin! It was very unique. The wood beams and skylights were awesome and the setting was very peaceful. My daughters and I loved seeing the kitties too. Would definitely return and recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't recommend Judith P.'s cozy cottage enough! First of all, Judith is a very talented and lovely person, and made us feel right at home! Getting to the address was a breeze, and all the instructions were very clear. What a unique and plain gorgeous place!
The cottage itself felt very private, but was also not too far from downtown! There were so many options for things to do inside the cottage, provided by Judith. I couldn't have asked for a better, and more considerate host.
We had such an amazing time in Astoria and in the cottage. 10/10 would stay here again!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was quaint and the natural light made the accommodation everything we expected and more.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of three (one parent, two kids ages 9 and 11) absolutely LOVED staying at this quirky and comfortable cabin … okay, maybe not technically a cabin, but it felt like one! The place was exactly as described and matched the photos - a lovely, artistic space! The hosts were friendly, communicative, but gave us our space. Close to Pier 39 - we walked down to Coffee Girls and to see the sea lions. Kids loved being close to the Goonies’ house and Kindergarten Cop school! Quick drive to downtown, although you could bike or walk on a nice day. We would definitely recommend this spot and come back again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Judith’s place was a very homely and spotless place to stay. Everything you needed and more including a full dossier on where to eat and what to do locally! Judith is naturally warm and welcoming and was the perfect person to be greeted by after a long drive. She’s very passionate about Astoria and its community spirit and her local knowledge shines through in recommending the right places for her guests to eat at or visit. The fact that you can see the Goonie house from her driveway is simply awesome!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I finally was able to fulfill my Goonies adventure. Hotels were a little pricy so I checked Air BnB and found this enchanted cottage. 2 min walk to the Goonie house, 2 min walk to Astoria coffee, 5 min walk to the Columbia River and the river walk. The cottage had a private entrance, had my own parking space and the cottage was warm, cozy and quiet. Judith, the host, is a Superhost. She provided a binder with many local restaurants and another full of local attractions. She also responds quickly if you have any questions. If Astoria is your destination, this cottage is for you."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Justin and I fit right in. We definitely would have loved to stay longer at Judith’s lovely cottage. I loved the warm and comfy space, small kitchen with coffee/tea supplies and a microwave to heat up our leftovers. Check in is easy since Judith responds very quickly.

And don't skip the pie! good water pressure and nice and hot and a gas heater stove that kept the place plenty warm. comfortable place outdoors to get fresh air and sit and visit. don't be afraid to check out the yard art. everything's for sale and pricing is very reasonable. took home a little something as a reminder of our trip.

You can LITERALLY see the Goonies house from the front door of the Air BNB space!

2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,Judith was nice but very busy with the art walk when we arrived in the afternoon so we didn’t have much interaction with her. The cottage was not ready at that time for check in. The lighting in the cottage was very dim at night which was when we “checked in” and brought our things inside which created a challenge for us. Overall the cottage was cozy and comfortable.

If you have the opportunity to stay here, don’t hesitate to make a reservation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judith's place was a great find! Very welcoming and helpful when we arrived, but also privacy respected.

This was an amazing start to our drive back home to Orange County- you will not be disappointed! And we will be back to stay with Judith-we fell in love with the area and it all started with her! Thank you Judith!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 / 10! Judith and John were great hosts, and very accommodating when we had a last minute arrival time change.

Our hosts gave us suggestions for local attractions and provided notebooks of information. We will definitely return!
A bonus is the owner’s own artwork in the yard and in the cottage. There are sometimes fumes though, from melting of the acrylics used to make the art and I chose to close the windows then."

May our futures be as pleasant and peaceful as Judith’s Astoria home. :’)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Astoria , your cottage, I am guessing we both have Master’s in Art Degrees.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judith and John were great hosts. Fantastic communication and willing to work with our schedule. We were going to be early and our check in time was about 3 hours AFTER we would be there. I told Judith that we would be there around noon and would explore the town during the wait but we were a little apprehensive about that as we had all of our gear and luggage in the car, Judith came through for us and allowed us to check in and unload early. Everything was ready and in place. Highly recommend for a peaceful weekend or even one night. The location is awesome and their food recommendations were spot on (Give Geno’s a try) and we couldn’t have been happier. Thanks, Judith and John!"

Judith greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick orientation. There was also information in the rental about things to do nearby and local restaurants. If you want a good walk you can easily access both the river walk which takes you to town or the Astoria Column. Good location, cheerful surroundings and a perfect dry weekend at the coast. We all agreed we would gladly stay here again."

Judith was warm, kind, and responsive! She made everything incredibly easy and we loved staying with her."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re a Goonies fan (or Kindergarten Cop!) you can’t get a better stay. Right on the block between both locations, and Judith knows all the history! She was super flexible, letting us check in early, providing a great list of activities and food options. The house is eclectic, all sorts of fun and interesting decor, sprinkled with her own art in a variety of media. There were also interesting books full of regional sites, a comprehensive listing of food and a fun movie tour of Astoria. Judith met us and was so friendly, and helpful, we could not have asked for a better host. The place is small, but it had all we needed and we were out exploring most of the time. Loved loved loved the location, would recommend to anyone going on a movie tour 😁"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely a great place to stay. The location for us was surprisingly magical. The cottage is a visual daydream and comfort cozy. Inside, their efforts in thoughtful details shine and help to communicate everything regarding the stay from cottage use tips to exploring Astoria. We wish we could have stayed longer. Perhaps next time😉."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We Loved our stay here. The decorations and atmosphere were exactly what we were looking for. I loved that this location felt private, spacious, and a 2 minute walk to the Goonies house. Very charming, good value, would recommend!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a truly magical stay at Judith's spot. She was friendly and helpful and didn't give advice we didn't need. The 20 hours we stayed are a day that will stand out for a long time in my memory as an adventure of growth and reflection in a cozy and beautiful environment. We hope to come back and meet the kitties!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place to celebrate our anniversary! I love when an airBB host makes touring a new town thoughtless and Judith had all of Astoria at my fingertips in folders ready for us to explore! We will be back!!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks to Judith and John’s warm hospitality and adorable guest cottage, our (too brief!) visit to Astoria couldn’t have been better! We loved the convenient location, cozy furnishings, and Judith’s artist’s flair inside and outside (and John’s welcoming backyard oasis!)! We can’t wait to come back to spend more time exploring and enjoying this lovely spot!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Fun place to stay in beautifully town. There were lots of tarot cards and witchcraft decorations around the cottage. If you’re uncomfortable with that I’d recommend finding somewhere else. Judith was very kind and really helpful! We loved the column in Astoria and exploring the coast.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judith and John's absolutely darling cottage far exceeded pur expectations and truly made our fabulous visit to Astoria an especially memorable joy! the space is utterly charming, mindfully and artfully appointed in whimsical, eclectic, and cozy fashion. Every detail is clearly so intentional and imbued with joy. The space was immaculately clean and fresh and neutral... it did not smell of cleansers, nor anything else! just fresh and completely clean. Their information binder is amazingly thorough and really helps to orient you to the town and region. Judith was very warm and welcoming and all communication was prompt and helpful! her artwork really makes the entire property fun and playful. Beds and bedding all super comfortable. We will definitely stay here whenever visiting Astoria! Much Gratitude!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10!! Place has so much character and is peaceful. Judith was friendly, responsive, and just lovely. So close to great food, pubs, and river walk.
Will stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great stay - I hope to plan another trip soon. Very clean,comfortable and a relaxing chill vibe - the sound of the sea lions in the harbor was great.
Both recommendations for Genoa’s and Coffee Girl were winners!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t recommend this place enough. Judith was kind, courteous, and generous with her time. The grounds are stunning, with a vista view of the Columbia river and mountains nestled on the other side (as well as the Astoria must-see Goonies house). The lodgings are quaint, filled with charm, and nestled away on the back of the property so it’s easy to enjoy your time and forget the world. We had to move on after one night, but definitely will stay here again next time we’re in town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a FIND! WOW! While the pictures do a great job showing you what to expect, it’s the rest of the experience that really puts this place up and beyond.
From arrival, we were able to talk to our host Judith about Astoria and the whimsical art work she creates. We were pleasantly surprised to find her place is within walking distance (and eye sight) from the Goonies house. Down the hill is a great coffee shop, and across the way is Pier 39 with great views, food, and brews. The town of Astoria was well worth the drive and Judith’s place is a quick drive from the city center.
Chatting with Judith was our favorite part of the stay. She’s delightful and cares highly about her guests. You’ll love everything about the stay and the whimsy of this place.
We look forward to our next stay with Judith on the Oregon coast!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was the perfect place for a getaway weekend in Astoria! It's located about a half hour walk from downtown, and had everything you need including tea and coffee for the morning. Loved the curated bookshelf and fireplace heater."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasure staying in Judith’s cottage. Very private setting, cozy little cabin with lots of character and beautiful neighborhood. Seals and seabirds in the harbor can be heard from the cabin which is music to the ears for someone visiting from the upper Midwest. Looking forward to more visits in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in Astoria. Sweet host, comfy enough.
Only a kitchenette, but good food is nearby.

I'll go back next time I'm in town."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith and her cozy cottage were amazing!! Such a magical place with fantastic energy! Every time we look somewhere, there was some new little detail or thoughtful touch to notice. Judith was super responsive, had great local recommendations when we first checked in and she put a lot of thought into her binders that covered everything from restaurants to hikes! I can’t wait to see the yard in full bloom during the spring and summer. We will definitely be a regular on our trips back to Astoria. Thank you!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the cozy beds & thoughtful, quirky touches. Host is very welcoming & friendly. Thank you!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judith's place was a colorful, cozy and well equipped island in a wintery Astoria. Communication was great, lots of things to do, lots of great suggestions. We felt very much at home and would like to come back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judith was a wonderful host and gave us lots of ideas on how to enjoy the best of Astoria.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith's charming cottage was exactly as she described it. We appreciated that she greeted us in person rather than self check in.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith was so amazing! And her partner, they both agreed to have us stay an extra night because the weather was so bad!

Plus, Judith is extremely helpful, going so far as to alert us of a road closure the morning we left home. She has a binder of local recommendations and restaurants, including menus and hours, and is generally a top-notch host in all regards."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts met us and gave us a brief rundown of helpful hints. Was warm and cozy when we got in. Great fireplace made the whole place warm and comfy. Great beds, very comfortable. We were only a block from the Goonies house and a few blocks from Rogue brewery. We walked into town for breakfast. Great location. Safe. Would recommend for anyone visiting Astoria. Thanks to the hosts."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just loved our stay at Judith's comfy cabin in wondrous Astoria!

We felt like we had plenty of privacy and also felt welcome to reach out if we had needed anything."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith is the perfect host: friendly, warm, interesting and engaging while simultaneously being conscientious about giving my husband and I plenty of space. Judith is also an artist, and her gorgeous sense of color shows up in her craft (which decorates her yard and lights up her neighborhood) as well as in the cottage. We enjoyed our couple of days with her immensely and can't wait to come back for a longer stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judith and her property are delightful. Great location, perfect, cozy home with artistic touches, and Judith was welcoming and kind. An all around perfect stay!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique and wonderful place, with an artistic and eclectic Oregon Coast vibe! Great for friend, family, a single traveler or a couple.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our time there. Judith has great tips on places to visit and restaurants, too. The distant sound of seals in the harbor added to the fun (and was soft enough in the background that it didn’t disturb)."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith's cottage is simply perfect. It's private and has some nice amenities, she has thought about It all! We will be back, we loved our stay here"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My daughter and I loved our stay at Judith's cottage. It's colorful and cozy and warm. We didn't have a need for turning on the fireplace but I'm sure it would be very inviting in the cool weather. The cottage is kept very clean and Judith's artwork lends a lot of color. There's really everything you need for your stay. The location is fantastic. You can do a lot of walking from the cottage or walk down to the trolley trail and ride it into town. The check-in process was very smooth. Judith greets you and shows you to the cottage. Extremely quiet in the neighborhood at night other than the constant sound of the sea lions! I don't think there's any escaping that! They're part of the charm of Astoria. We definitely want to go back for another stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay! Judith was very responsive and the cottage was amazing. We had everything we needed and wish we could have stay longer. Would recommend to anyone.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay! The location was close to lots of things to do in Astoria. Judith was incredibly friendly, and was super willing to help.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, lovely hosts, great access to local sights and food, will be back! Highly recommend"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s going to be hard to do the accommodation and hosts justice with these words, as I need better ones to describe how amazing our stay was at Judith’s and John’s guest house. If you think the pics of the guest house look great, just wait until you see it in person.
The location is amazing (especially for Goonie fans). You can literally see the house from Judith’s house and it’s a one minute walk. The second you get there, you are met by Judith, who greets you with a wealth of information on Astoria and things to do. If that wasn’t enough, all that information is available for you in the guest house along with such a cozy peaceful space, along with everything you need for a nights stay.
We loved our stay here so much that it will now hopefully become an annual stay for us."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"All the wonderful things people have said in the reviews are true😀 Judith has created a warm and happy place. We had everything we needed, and she is an excellent, attentive host. She made our short visit to Astoria a memorable one!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There's so much to like about this ABB.
Great hosts.   You're on the same site but you have complete privacy.
Very clean.  Fresh breeze easily moves through this space.   Soaring ceiling, lots of light, plenty of space.
Very comfortable bed and bedding.   Quality linens and towels.
Great coffee!   Small and functional kitchen 'area' which perfect for breakfast or take-home dining.
Beautiful porch and garden area.
Neighborhood is great and the location is in the best part of town for a visitor, easy to walk down to the river walk, go out for coffee, or enjoy dining at a few nearby eateries.
A nice TV (which I did not use) with Netflix, games.   Decor has interesting art/objects.  Eclectic collection of books!   
This is a great home base from which to enjoy Astoria or the area.... or just settle in and enjoy spending your time in this very well designed and thoughtfully curated space.   
A bonus was hearing the faint sounds of the sea lions!   If I return to Astoria it will only be when I can stay here again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place to stay. Host was very friendly and informative. The place was comfortable , felt like a home away from home . Definitely recommend staying here.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute stunner of place. Beautifully decorated and comfortable. Great touches like complimentary snacks. Centrally located from where everything worth doing is walkable. Wendy's place is the best airbnb we've stayed in. We can't recommend it highly enough.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The decor is delightfully quirky and the location in the heart of downtown made an easy walk to galleries, eateries and all places of interest. Wendy was super responsive and very kind. If you need 2 comfortable sleeping spaces this may not be ideal. The couch might not fit your comfort needs but the bed is very comfortable. Fun space."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the space and would definitely stay again - Wendy was helpful and the location was perfect!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved Wendy's place! Super easy to find. Great, central and walkable location. Super cute decorations. Comfy bed. Super convenient parking - people were in the assigned spots but Wendy let us know where else was fine to park until they left, and we had no issues there! She was super communicative overall and always got back to me in just a few minutes! Would love to come back (but hopefully on a less rainy weekend and maybe without our dogs, even though they were welcome!)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute room. Very cozy. Nice bed and fluffy blankets and amazing towels. .Had everything we needed. Was a bit noisy but that was advertised. Nothing too extreme. Would stay there again. Had our dog with us, and it had lots of furniture for his ball to roll under, lol. Under the bed was very dusty. But on the surface everything was spic and span. Nice coffee shop right across the street. Had vegan options and was delicious."

If you want to visit Astoria, I recommend this place 😀"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute and so close to everything. Sofa is not comfortable for sleeping, but good for lounging. Plenty of room for a twin size air mattress if you have a third person."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place absolutely SURPASSED our expectations! We’ve stayed at several Air BnBs across the US - but this one was BY FAR the best! Absolutely the cutest decor, comfy and welcoming, and right in the heart of Astoria. Couldn’t ask for anything better- and can’t wait to come back. 100% recommend!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place that captures the essence of the town. Clean, fun and right in the thick of this amazing city. One of our faves!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our favorite place to stay on our two week honeymoon! The location is perfect! There is a parking lot next to the apartment that is easy to park in and the apartment is easy to find (the front door has official AirBnB on it). The space was clean and well decorated! It was so much fun to look at the decor. There were complimentary snacks, drinks, and toiletries. Everything was labeled so that made it so easy to find where everything was (including lights). There was a sound machine and fans. We didn’t hear too much outside street noise (even without the sound machine). It was cozy in the apartment and the bed was so very comfy. We were able to walk right out the door and get to bars within less than 30 seconds. We absolutely loved our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Outstanding location and cool place that was every bit as advertised. TV was a bit challenging but we didn't book to stay in and watch TV.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our overnight stay at Cloud 254. Great bed and shower. Fun location in the heart of downtown and a fine coffee shop right across the street. We'll definitely stay here again and look forward to having more time in the future to explore Astoria.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This spot was great for a quick getaway for my son and dog. Right downtown, we walked everywhere and didn’t need to worry about parking. The space was cute and well stocked with everything we needed. Host was easy to communicate with and let us check in early. I’d highly reco for the location, cost, interior and reserved parking."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! I grew up going to Astoria, my grandparents lived in Naselle WA, I always loved the feel of the downtown atmosphere. This place is in the heart of that! The cozy moody feel inside the dwelling was perfect for the typical PNW rainy day and the close proximity to shops,food,bars etc made the walk a breeze. Bed and linens where great seating area was comfortable the perfect weekend getaway. Definitely will be returning!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay here and we hope to stay again every time we visit Astoria! We love the location, parking, walking distance to everything, and the suite is sooo cute! Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy’s place was as-described, in the middle of downtown Astoria. It was a great home-base for everything we did (day trips to the coast, and lots of food!). It got fairly loud at night with the proximity to local bars, but we were provided with a noise machine and ear plugs. We didn’t end up needing them, but it’s worth noting if you are a light sleeper. We loved stopping in to Xanadu for a beer, and Winekraft for some low-key live music!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendy's place was a great respite. I highly recommend: close to local restaurants and shops. The Liberty Theatre is a special treat!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely and fun stay in a prime location downtown ❤️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this rental. By far, the best features are the funky decor and the location. Right across the street from our favorite cafe/bar and gift shop and a block away from the water, the location can’t be beat. If we could change one thing, we’d upgrade the queen sized bed to a king, but everything else was perfect."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My brother and I had a great time in Astoria thanks to Wendy! The place was so close to all of the things we wanted to do, and despite the rain and wind we were able to get out and do a lot! I loved that there were heaters because it was so cold coming in out of the rain. Bed was cozy and there were plenty of extra linens for my brother to use. Also the reserved parking made it great for loading and unloading the car and for having peace of mind while we walked around and did things. I would love to come back to Wendy's place again next time I visit!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a really lovely stay! the nautical themed room is super cute and cozy. bed and sheets were next-levrl comfy from typical Airbnb spots I've stayed in, which was a big plus. very walkable and lots to do right outside your door."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place with a great location in downtown Astoria! Everything was easy to operate (locking, tv and gas stove). Very comfortable bed. It didn’t hurt the weather was exceptional. And had my first meal at Busu which hadn’t been open on my last visits."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was in the perfect, most walkable part of Astoria and was exactly as expected! Truly a lovely spot, highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"wonderful space, right in the heart of Astoria"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space in a great location! Perfect for a trip to Astoria.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This “crabby” shack made us anything but crabby. 😋 We loved it! The location couldn’t bee better for exploring Astoria, and yet, once inside it feels very private and secluded. It’s obviously an old building, but it’s decorated so cute and cared for so well. Feels very homey. There are a few boutique/adorable hotels in Astoria, but our friends who were staying at one of them came to visits us and were so jealous. They said they’ll definitely seek this place out next time they visit. We couldn’t agree more and would gladly stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Would definitely stay again. The place was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. The only thing to note is that the sofa is not a true sleeper. It’s a modular sofa that can be arranged as a bed. Loved the location, and the off street parking."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fun and funky space right in the heart of Astoria, close to everything! We loved it and would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right in downtown Astoria. Comfy, spacious suite with lots of thoughtful touches. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome spot downtown, extremely walkable and not cookie cutter like the rest of the offerings you find elsewhere."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We've stayed in quite a few spots around Astoria and this one is by far in the best location - amazing! Super cute space with all the details covered, and right in the heart of downtown. Steps to everything - great food, great beer, beautiful walk along the water. Dog-friendly, too! The street noise was barely noticeable and there's a noise machine just in case. Incredibly comfortable bed. This is the perfect spot for enjoying Astoria."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place to stay, it was decorated so well and the bed was extremely comfortable. Loved that everything was in a comfortable walking distance."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Wendy's place for a weekend getaway in Astoria, and it was perfect for what we needed! It was so central in the downtown, everywhere we wanted to go was more than walkable (and that is coming from a 34 week pregnant lady!). Even though it's located in the midst of business and shops, the noise level was completely fine and we were never disturbed. The decor of the place is eclectic and charming and really makes you feel like you're staying in Astoria. There were plenty of items to make our stay comfortable, including some complimentary snacks and drinks which was very nice. The reserved parking spot came in hugely handy, since we didn't drive at all and therefore didn't have to worry about moving the car. A fabulous stay!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about this reminded me of home away from home!!! Loved every minute!! What a great relaxing getaway! Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is very comfortable and in an ideal location among scores of restaurants and coffee houses and near the Astoria Riverwalk. The parking space that is provided and the ease of entry and exit were really appreciated. Wendy was immediately responsive to the few questions we had. We would choose this spot for any future visit we make.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are going to Astoria and you want to be right where the action is, this is the place. I walked to everything I did from this property. It is in the heart of the town. Despite being in the center of things, it was quiet at night. The bed was very very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Astoria."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay right in the center of downtown, extremely responsive host. Only issue was the sofa bed, friend had to sleep on the smaller sized sofa that was not really a sofa bed."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was in a great downtown location. We enjoy walking to breweries and restaurants. Fort George, an amazing brewery and great pizza, was just a short walk from our location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute and wonderful decorated place. We loved the vibe. It was right downtown walkable to a lot of spots. Would recommend and would stay there again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy went above and beyond in her timely communication and thoughtful hospitality. The space is poifect for a small family with far more tiny gestures of local love and neighborhood flair than we expected even from the spot on photos. Mere seconds and minutes by foot to all of our favorite spots in town, dedicated parking space, cozy and warm, spacious and private, cute and comfortable. 10/10 would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great property as advertised!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our quick birthday get away. The location is great! We were able to walk to most places. We will definitely stay here in the future and will recommend to others.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of downtown. There can be some noise from the street in the living room but it was only a few times. Small inconvenience was more than worth being steps from shops, our reserved parking space, etc.
The sofa isn't super comfy but better than a pull-out couch. Bed was very comfy, bathroom was just right, and the whole place was decorated in such a fun way."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot to explore Astoria! Hope we can book this one again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wendy provided a beautiful airbnb, being centrally located with easy access to restaurants, bars, and shops adding so much more to the experience. Comfortable and cozy interiors, along with cleanliness, definitely made for a wonderful stay.
The combination of thoughtful interior design, coastal vibes, and a romantic ambiance created a unique and inviting setting.
I highly recommend that you don’t miss out staying here!
Xoxo."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love Astoria! So much so that we’ve stayed in a ton of Airbnb’s and hotels in the city. That said this was the best space of em all. What a gem, I’d like to keep it a secret but I’ll tell everyone this place is great. You’re right in the heart of Downtown and I loved the little touches like the decor and thoughtful free things.
Great TV, cozy feel with the fireplace and once again you can’t beat this location. Will book again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best of both worlds choice for Astoria. It was pretty amazing to be steps away from the bustling downtown activities and then walk in, shut the door, and feel transported to a cozy nook perfect for resting up. Wendy has thought of all the details that make a stay a memorable and comfortable one. Absolutely would recommend it and visit again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"fabulous apartment centrally located in downtown Astoria! All of the amenities you need and cozy as heck, would definitely love to visit again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is an excellent space and Wendy was awesome! Couldn’t have been better! Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Central to everything- extremely walkable! It’s a converted business space, so it feels odd walking right into your stay- But hey, it’s part of the experience! I would say this place is better for a couple, maybe 3 people tops. The couch was just ok to sleep on. Lots of cozy linens and was toasty warm even on a rainy weekend. The decor was fun and definitely enhanced our visit to the artsy town of Astoria."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wendy's place was awesome. Loved the decor and the provided snacks so we weren't hangry lol. She was super responsive and a great host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Great host! Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have visited Astoria several times before, but this was my first stay in the downtown area. It was great to have a private off-street place for my car and be able to walk to all of the attractions and restaurants that Astoria has to offer. The block is busy, but with the noise machine and doors that close to the sleeping area, I did not have any trouble sleeping. The apartment is very clean, with a unique nautical theme; very appropriate to Astoria. I highly recommend this AirBNB for those visiting who would like a central downtown Astoria experience!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendy offers a wonderful little space nestled just steps away from all the great shops and restaurants in downtown Astoria. Parking was easy and so appreciated. We are already talking about returning and will definitely book this little gem again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location, right in the heart of Astoria, can't be beat. There are so many great spots surrounding you. The space is cozy, convenient, and dog friendly. We loved it. There were snacks and drinks, which we really appreciated. Wendy is a great host and was super quick with her communication."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendy’s place was fantastic! It was perfect for me & my fiancé and such an amazing deal for how centrally located it was. Wendy was easy to communicate with and we really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to explore the beautiful town of Astoria!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed the style of the place. I would call it nautical-industrial. Wendy was responsive to questions about dining and dog related activities. The complimentary chips and ale were a hit. The neighborhood was perfect with shops, restaurants and bars all in walking distance. We would definitely stay again if in Astoria."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cool decor and great location!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely awesome place! Right in the heart of downtown Astoria, within walking distance to everything!

Very communicative and nice host!
Loved this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is exactly as described and pictured.
The location can’t be beat. There is a coffee shop/bistro/bar directly across the street and multiple places to eat within walking distance.
I would definitely stay here again if I should ever find myself in Astoria."
2023-10-01,2,Stayed one night,"I didn't give the exact information about the accommodation, and the contact wasn't smooth. I responded exactly 2 hours and 48 minutes. It was the worst experience I didn't want to remember."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wendy's place is well located right in the middle of downtown Astoria. It's an easy walk to much of what you'd want to do - the waterfront, restaurants, bars, etc. And the parking spot was convenient.
The space itself is well decorated and comfortable. And Wendy was helpful and communicative, answering my question at checkout nearly immediately. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great unit, great location, great host. Wendy is very responsive and has thought of every detail to make your stay as comfortable as possible!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an exceptional stay at this Airbnb! The cleanliness was impeccable, making my stay extremely comfortable. The accommodations were top-notch, easily one of the best places I've ever stayed at. The host was incredibly responsive and even accommodated an early check-in, which was a great convenience. I highly recommend this host and their fantastic space for an outstanding Airbnb experience. Can't wait to return!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot, perfect location! I loved the decor and space so much. The location is amazing and wish we had planned better and spent more time in Astoria. Wendy was helpful! Really appreciated the parking availability! Thank you for having us!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Would 100% come back to this Airbnb whenever I’m in Astoria! It looked exactly like the photos, was very clean, and a very walkable area. The parking was also a plus!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place. Plenty of space and can't beat the location. Would stay again, loved Astoria in general and the host experiencewas great.
My only note to other would be bring ear plugs if you're a super sensitive sleeper. It is downtown after all, so occasionally sound of traffic is audible. Didn't bother, and the convenience of the spot can't be beat."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it! Great location for exploring the town on foot. The place was super cozy and the bed was so comfortable! Parking was close and easy to access. Definitely recommend the stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great location! We enjoyed being able to quickly and easily grab a coffee and breakfast across the street first thing in the morning. Incredibly easy to get around and we had no issues parking in the designated parking spot. The Airbnb is located in the middle of downtown but we had no issues with noise or any privacy issues. Wendy accommodated us with whatever we would need during our stay! My favorite part during our stay was the Sunday farmers market. Astoria is a neat little coastal community and I highly recommend staying at Wendy’s place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was great! much more than what we expected. We would love to return again sometime.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot! Fun, interesting decor, close to lots of good food/drink. Looking forward to visiting again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Wendy’s place is in the heart of downtown Astoria, and the dedicated parking spot is a godsend. We were able to park the car and walk all around the city. You’re just a couple blocks from the Columbia River, across the street from a great little coffee shop/bistro, and across the street from an awesome movie theater/bar. The best part was that the Astoria Underground Tour is right around the corner, and you get to walk under your AirBnB and learn the history of Astoria! The AirBnB was great! It’s clean, surprisingly quiet, and very spacious! We had a full living room, bedroom, and bathroom. There is a little kitchenette in the bedroom for basics like coffee and snacks and a mini fridge in the living area for leftovers. Wendy stocked the fridge with beers and water too. There are so many amenities throughout the whole space, and the bed and couch are super comfy! I highly recommend this spot if you want to explore the city!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place to stay in the heart of downtown Astoria. Very walkable, lots of places to check out, we couldn’t take it all in!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! The parking spot was a great bonus. The suite was spotless, charming, and very well appointed. Wendy was a very responsive host. I will absolutely stay again, and highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Wendy’s place. We really appreciated the goodies left for us, and the a/c and fans provided were greatly appreciated when the temps were in the high 80s. Her place is wonderfully comfortable in the heart of downtown Astoria."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was just as Wendy described. The room is in a location that you would not typically expect, but it was perfect! We absolutely loved the time we had there and would definitely come back again. There were many little touches that made staying there special."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wendy was great. The place was super adorable and cozy. We had everything we needed in walking distance as well.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot right in the middle of town. Kids loved the arcade across the street. Was remarkably quiet at night considering it’s right downtown. Slept well.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Wendy’s place in Astoria was a magical experience, I feel like we just spent a day in Miyazaki’s movie. The place is well decorated to reflect the rich history and culture of the town. Wendy was super responsive to all of our needs. I could not ask for a better stay. Clean place, great location, and easy parking."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This charming space was perfect for our overnight stay in Astoria.

Super clean, friendly and very responsive host, and the parking situation was amazing."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy’s place is in the middle of downtown Astoria! Great for walking to the coast, local restaurants…anything that you would want to do in Astoria. We had a great time!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Crystal’s Cloud 254 was absolutely wonderful! It is centrally located to anything you want to do in and around Astoria. The ride from Portland Airport was easy. We loved everything about this space from the decor to the cute and functional bathroom to the comfortable bed. Coffee shops and restaurants surrounding the location were great. Astoria is a quaint and picturesque town and the Goonies fun was outstanding. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so cute and even more convenient for Astoria. Right down town and walkable to everything but still private and quiet. Parking was easy. Would definitely stay here again. I loved how it felt like an experience - not just a bed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wendy’s place was outstanding! Bright, cheerful, HGTV style, and a great vibe. Comfortable, roomy, great towels and linens, and amazing complimentary items. Having a parking spot included was nice and convenient. We just wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had the best time staying at Wendy's cozy Astoria apartment for a wedding weekend. From the charming crab neon light to the perfect location in the center of town, this Airbnb was exactly what we were looking for."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cool place! So much thought has been put into this home. We loved all the snacks and local craft beer in the fridge. Great location with tons of restaurants. I don’t know what Wendy uses for washing sheets/duvet covers but they are the freshest/cleanest smelling linens ever!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time at the location, was very clean and super close to tons of things to do! Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed with 4 people for one night and although it is small we made the couch work out perfect for our sleeping arrangements. This Airbnb is in the perfect location for Astoria! It is walking distance to all the restaurants and right by the water. The parking spot and complimentary snacks was also very nice to have. :) Would definitely recommend to others.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this unit. It was right in the middle of all of the Astoria action. We were able to navigate back home to unload items purchased at the farmer's market and shops without wasting any time. This is the perfect place for a couple. We are already talking about our next visit to Astoria and will return to this place again and again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was clean, the check in instructions were clear, and it was a cozy room for a very affordable price. The location was within walking distance of just about everywhere. Would return in the future if/when we travel to Astoria again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay! Wendy was so helpful and responsive- even left lovely complimentary snacks and local drinks. The location is incredible- right in the heart of Astoria. There were too many options for cafes, bars and restaurants to walk to that it was hard to choose. I highly recommend staying here :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, eclectic furnishings, great amenities. Great location, walkable to many city attributes...Loved everything about it....will definitely return for another visit! And thanks, Wendy, for going above & beyond to return our jackets we left behind. Appreciate your kindness!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this stay! Everything in Wendy's place was so well thought out and functional. I can tell she takes a lot of pride her service. I enjoyed staying here very much.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay- it was so cozy on a night passing through Astoria. It was super walkable to the shoreline, and we watched the sunset at Bowline before walking back to the Airbnb! Great areas around it to grab coffee and enjoy the local scene of Astoria- also walkable to the Sunday Market! Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying at Wendy’s place. It was clean and fresh. The location was great; we were able to walk everywhere. Wendy thought everything and anticipated all of our needs. We had plenty of towels and linens, the bed was comfy, and the snacks were a nice touch. We’d happily stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great studio apartment in downtown Astoria. It is so close to everything and you can just walk most everywhere. The reserved parking is very close and easy to get to. The drinks and snacks provided by the host were a fun little plus too!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot close to many bars and restaurants and short drive from cannon beach!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Wendy’s! She was very responsive during our trip. Astoria is truly a magical place and the decor matches the seaside aesthetic. The unit is walkable to points of interest and there is dedicated parking (yay!). We walked over to “Dead Man’s Isle” for delicious tiki drinks the night we arrived. The next morning, we walked along the harbor to “Coffee Girl” out on the pier. Highly recommend Wendy’s place—like a dream!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"If you want to stay right in the middle of downtown Astoria and walk to things, this is a good choice. We had some difficulty going around the one-way streets to find the correct way into the parking lot. All the parking lot spaces designated ok for us to park in were taken so we had to wait awhile for someone to move. But once in the unit things went pretty well. The bed was comfortable for me, and the unit is well-appointed. My daughter slept on the movable couch sections and did not find this quite as comfortable. Overall I liked the unit pretty well, but the one thing that I had difficulty with was space and lighting in the bathroom around the sink area. The lighting in this area is quite dim and there is no place to set down items larger than a toothbrush except on the floor."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy has curated an adorable place to stay that looks EXACTLY like the photos, but even BETTER in person. Well appointed is an understatement…shampoo, conditioner, lotion, tooth brushes (if needed) not to mention much needed snacks, waters, and COLD beers on arrival. The location is super special and walkable to EVERYTHING Astoria has to offer. The themed decor is super fun and educational. The bed, bedding, and bath towels are on par with any luxury accommodations. Wendy truly is a SUPER host!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Very clean. Extra amenities; beverages and snacks were perfect after a long trip! Wendy was very responsive. She even allowed the use of her private parking spot for the day so we can see the town after check out. Thanks Wendy! Couldn’t have chosen a better spot in Astoria!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great little place if you like walking around town. Wendy adds soooo many complimentary things it makes the stay even nicer. She was extremely responsive and provided a lot of information right off the bat. If you are looking for a great hidden gem in downtown Astoria you can't find a better one.
Thanks Wendy!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great central location.
Excellent bedding and everything needed for comfort stay. Loved it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wendy's place was full of character, and felt really comfortable as soon as we walked in. So much of Astoria was right on our doorstep, and we could walk to all the antique stores, restaurants, breakfast/coffee shops, and seafront within minutes of stepping out the door. It was pretty quiet at night - at least, we weren't disturbed - and if (when) we come back to Astoria, we'll certainly be staying here. Lovely place, can't recommend it highly enough."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything went smoothly
We enjoyed the place and our stay there"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place right in the heart of Astoria.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We are traveling without our kiddos and love to find unique spots that we can walk to shops and restaurants so this was perfect! We got in late and we’re exhausted so Wendy’s snacks were a lifesaver. The decor was eclectic and the space was very clean. We would stay again for sure!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! I was very comfortable and it is close to everything. You will get some noise from the street, but the unit has an air conditioner, white noise machine, and fan to mask it quite well if you are sensitive to it. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy’s downtown Astoria location is a wonderful spot to start your trip to Astoria! Close to all the local haunts and easy to come and go to the downtown restaurants, bars, and shops. Loved the urban feel in this small town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location. Wendy is a great host- excellent communications and very friendly. She was extremely helpful. Would definitely stay here again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy has thought of everything. The space is both effective and esthetically pleasing. It is impressive how she curated the space for comfort and needs. There was nothing left unpredicted. The location was perfect. All your vaca delights right out the door. I’m not sure how you can find anything better. There is no water view, but you don’t need it. All the view you need is right out the door. Thanks, Wendy!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay, it was right downtown and walkable to everything. The coffee shop/cafe across the street was AMAZING. You are right downtown and there is traffic, so just know before you go so you don't have other expectations, we were fine with it and didn't bother us because we loved being close to everything. We'd definitely go back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing location and a perfect stay for a couple! We had a great time at Wendy’s place, right in the middle of downtown Astoria. Everything is close and lots of restaurants that one can choose from. Parking was also convenient and exactly as described in the booking. The place had such an eclectic feel to it, we would love to come again. Thank you Wendy."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fun airbnb with plenty of creature comforts and full of personality! We were two adults + one child and felt the size was cozy but manageable. The central location felt safe and was excellent for exploring Astoria. We found the bed extremely comfortable and made with pristine linens. Would stay again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great jump off spot to explore Astoria and the coast!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Wendy’s place! Being both right downtown and so close to the pier was a win-win for us, and having a reserved parking spot at the ready was great to have. Perfect spot for a couple! I thought it would be more noisy than it was, but the fans provided did such a good job at masking it I hardly noticed it at all."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place, great location. The linens were perfect (fluffy towels/comfortable bedding) and the place was spotless. Wendy was extremely responsive to all questions and went above and beyond when I realized after getting home that I'd left an important personal item behind. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place right in downtown Astoria. Easy to get to everything. Would definitely stay there again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy's place is the PERFECT little spot for a weekend getaway! It is right in the heart of Astoria, walking distance to everything. Her place is neat, stylish, and very clean! I would highly recommend her place!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at Wendy’s place. Great location and it had everything we needed! Easy check in and it was so nice to have a parking space right there. Perfect for a quick overnight stay in beautiful Astoria. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was absolutely lovely. The perfect small location, lots of cute nice restaurants right around the corner. Sunset walks along the pier was so amazing. The night time was perfectly themed with the crab neon light, me and my bf loved it so much. Perfect little antique shops across the street and around the corner to check out. Such a cozy place, will definitely stay here again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, super cute decorations, snacks are a lovely touch"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful experience all around.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cloud 254 was a fantastic starting point for our vacation along the Oregon Coast. Great spot with many amenities in walking distance and very close to the River boardwalk. Also very good use of the space and decor was great fun. had a great stay for myself and my daughter.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest air BNB! Exactly as described, location can not be beat. Wendy was friendly and quick to respond. The bed and linens are so cozy. Wendy left very well thought out touches that made the stay feel super welcoming and comfortable. There was a sound machine to drown out the inevitable sounds of being in downtown, umbrellas for potential rain, snacks and drinks, toothbrushes, etc. We will definitely check to see if this spot is available for any future trips to Astoria!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for our quick stop in Austoria. Very walkable to dining and entertainment.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! You are literally among the shops and we had a great time walking all around Astoria and relaxing back in the apartment!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay right in the middle of Astoria. Everything within walking distance and space was just what we needed. Wendy was very responsive and nice to communicate with
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described! Super cute and so walkable. Enjoyed my stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect little sport to stay in Astoria. Close to all the shops and restaurants. Definitely would love to stay again next time we come.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay and it felt like you were home. It was centrally located which is a bonus and everything was in walkable distance. The place was clean and comfortable and truly appreciated the snacks and beverages left by Wendy. That was truly thoughtful. Overall a great place to stay and would recommend to everyone if they want an amazing place to stay in Astoria! Thank you again Wendy for providing such an amazing place to stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute unit in a unique location in downtown Astoria. Check out the awesome restaurant directly across the street for excellent Japanese takeout. We loved people watching and the curious passers by wondering what this place was all about. Once it was evening time and lights out we felt cozy and there was privacy with the blinds. The parking is super close by and easy to locate. Wendy has lots of thoughtful amenities like utensils, paper plates, snacks, toiletries.... The bed was soooo comfortable and so were the sheets and towels. We felt like we were in a boutique luxury hotel only with way cooler decor! Big plus is you can walk everywhere. We loved the arcade right on the corner. A note: be careful with the plumbing, it is older and the toilet is easily clogged 💩🚽💩"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW. We frequently stay at AirBnb’s & this has by far been our favorite. Looks exactly like the photos, clean, walkable to all our favorite downtown spots, and the bed was the most comfortable we’ve ever slept on. Already looking ahead to plan another stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun little place to stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the quaintness of staying in this cute little place. It felt like it truly represented historic Astoria. It’s very well cared for—spotlessly clean.
We were minutes from the riverfront, walkway, and trolly and close to restaurants and shopping.
Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great lodging in a great location in the middle of Astoria. I look forward to going back. Wendy takes care of her guests -- great amenities, comfy space."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you like to walk around town and easily pop back into the place.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great AirBnB from which to launch a trip in Astoria. The location is centrally located with the bonus of your own parking spot. You are a block from the riverfront and a short walking distance from many bars and restaurants. It's well decorated and comfortable. The host also kindly offers snacks and water, which were welcome after a long drive. The only drawback is the noise. In the front room, the noise of downtown is hard to ignore. However, the host has tried to accommodate with a white noise machiene. Luckily, the sleeping area is very quiet once you close the interior doors. Overall, I would recommend this place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy spot and within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and cool shops. Also right by the water which was amazing! We booked super last-minute and Wendy was very accommodating and lovely. Will be recommending to friends going through the area!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy’s spot is right in the middle of Astoria’s downtown center. There’s plenty to do and plenty to eat within blocks. The space itself was clean and has plenty of room for a couple. It is situated between Astoria’s two busiest streets, and it’s an old building, so there’s definitely some street noise. But this only made us appreciate that there were earplugs waiting for us even more. This is definitely a great spot to stay for any Astoria vacation!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved it! And we will probably be using this place in the future! The host really put in effort to make us feel welcome, a couple of drinks in the fridge. Toothbrushes and floss in case we forgot ours. Great location within walking distance of a ton of restaurants and things to do. Overall a great place to stay. Two things I personally would have liked. A little more lighting. The lights that are there are pretty dim so the room seemed dark. And one more heater, even with the fireplace and one heater going we were a little chilly. But overall great place! Thanks Wendy!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location!! Lots of shops, coffeehouses, restaurants and the river walk - all within steps to few blocks of property. Three adults with small dog fit well in the space!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I was pleasantly surprised! Even better than the pictures. Location is perfect and the space is so fun. Host provides everything you could need. I would 100% stay here again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The linens were so soft and comfortable and the place was incredibly clean. They provided the accommodations needed for a comfortable nights sleep.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little spot for exploring Astoria! Love the decor!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for my partner and I for Valentine’s day! Such a great spot and we could walk all of downtime with ease. The inside was so cozy and well-designed with a great atmosphere and aesthetic. There were complimentary beers and snacks which we really loved and appreciated. I would say one thing that maybe should be added is a set of cutlery or silverware as we wanted to snack on some charcuterie but there were no knives/forks so cut up the ingredients. Otherwise, we absolutely loved our stay and would definitely come back again!
Thanks Wendy for the great stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay! Loved the unique decorations, thoughtful add ons and proximity to downtown.
We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone in the area."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay in this little apartment. It is right next to the boardwalk and lots of cute shops and restaurants, but was also private and quiet. Perfect spot for exploring Astoria."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice stay. It’s a good location close to lots of things. Convenient parking.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This air bnb was seriously the best. Was able to walk everywhere from the location and the parking was amazing! Just wish we could’ve stayed in Astoria longer!

I would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place downtown, owner is very responsive and helpful. Would go back again"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place- clean, modern and expertly set up from the furniture to the little dish of earplugs next to the bed. I honestly couldn’t think of a single thing that wasn’t provided. And the location- fantastic! Step out the door and your 30 seconds from good food, good coffee and a view of the river. Can’t say enough good things!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable and great location!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The suite was the perfect location to explore Astoria! You can literally walk out the front door to a coffee shop or a brewery! The bed was super cozy, and it was well stocked with everything you could need! It even had beer and water bottles! It was nice to have a fridge. A small microwave would be nice for leftovers, but it is stated in the description that this is not provided. Not a deal breaker by any means! We will certainly choose to stay here again next time we are in Astoria!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay here. We enjoyed being right downtown and able to walk the waterfront and all the shops downtown.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great downtown escape.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place in a great location! It was a comfortable and cozy stay. The mood lighting is lovely, but not always practical, especially for people with poor eyesight. We’d happily come back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay at Wendy’s place!
You cannot beat this location, it’s in the heart of downtown Astoria and we didn’t need to drive at all once we arrived. We enjoyed great breakfast & coffee across the street at Astoria Coffeehouse and a fabulous dinner at Silver Salmon which is on the same street.
The bed was very comfortable and the couch was really easy to turn into a bed. We visited during a very stormy weekend so we loved the electric fireplace!
The place was spotless and we had plenty of fluffy blankets and towels for all 3 of us, and appreciated all of the complimentary snacks and doggy bowl for our pups :)
The only thing that could be improved would be an actual door on the bathroom. We were traveling as a couple with one of our mother’s, and the curtains separating the bathroom made using the bathroom a little awkward!
We would definitely return to Wendy’s place if we were traveling as just the two of us."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy's place was right downtown which was really nice for us because we could walk to the downtown shops. We had a fun stay and would do it again. This spot is similar to a hotel room, there isn't a microwave or very much kitchen supplies, it worked out for us but if you need kitchen stuff for a longer stay be sure to bring it yourself."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location and walking distance to everything in Astoria! Also loved the exterior of the place very comfortable
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So amazing! The location is perfect and the place is so cute and cozy. I can’t wait to come back!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying with Robin and Garrett. So beautifully decorated and a great space for me and my family.

Astoria is a wonderful place to visit and we will be back since we didn’t see every thing in three days.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for sharing your beautiful, historic property with us. We felt so welcome and lucky to enjoy this comfortable & unique place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robin was great and we so enjoyed our stay. Her vintage collections - the dog, bird, travel themed rooms with fun vintage items made it a joy just to look at each carefully collected item. Loved staying in a 1903 historic landmark house. The birds chirps were background music. Great recommendations for things to do. Robin is a lovely person"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great evening and a very good night at Robin and Garett's house. Everything was perfect.
We regret not being able to enjoy this lovely house that has a lot of character. We delights into this somewhat retro atmosphere, with vinyls, DVDs, and decor.
We regret that we were only able to exchange a few words with Robin when we checked out. Robin and Garett are very attentive hosts to the details, you immediately feel at home. Nothing is missing."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,They were really great and nice! we had awesome hospitality! I recommended to my family and friends!

I would absolutely recommend this AirBnB, and if I’m back in Astoria I’ll be sure to look for this location!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The upstairs suite was impeccably clean. The kitchen had treats waiting for us. Each room was beautifully decorated with a theme. We also appreciated the friendliness of the hosts.

I just can't say enough good things here. You won't be dissapointed!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our third stay at Robin and Garrett’s lovely Airbnb. We especially love the living room and I love the bathtub.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful surroundings and the hosts are very nice. Just that the area itself did not offer as many things to do that matched our interesting. A good spot to stop in between Portland and Seattle though.

There are trails close to the back of the house which we did not have time to explore unfortunately. Robin and Garrett were very friendly. Check-in was a breeze. Love the neighborhood and workability. I would definitely stay here again. Rental is very clean, the beds were very comfortable with nice linens. The kitchenette had coffee, tea, hot chocolate, popcorn, and fruit snacks. Love this place and love Astoria."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Visiting Astoria is stepping back in time. The modern world feels so temporary, but this city reminds one of a time when beauty meant something. Robin and Garrett's home is filled with memorabilia of that wonderful, comforting time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay in Astoria, Oregon, was truly exceptional. Among the many historic homes I've had the pleasure of visiting, this one stands out remarkably. The decoration is stunning, complementing its thoughtful updates and meticulous maintenance. The shower boasted endlessly hot water—exactly to my preference—with the bathroom being both spacious and beautifully designed. The entire space radiated cleanliness and care. The bed ensured a comfortable night's sleep, and my room was the epitome of cute and cozy. This Airbnb exceeded my expectations, making me extremely satisfied with my selection. A heartfelt thank you to the hosts for creating such a wonderful haven for rest and relaxation."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing spot! Many thoughtful updates and a beautiful space. Bathroom to die for!!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a brief one night stay in Astoria for a work trip and was so happy to have found Robin & Garrett’s suite.
It was spacious, quiet, and cozy! Great night’s sleep in the king-size bed and the ample space heaters in each room went a long way to keeping comfortable in cold, rainy January. Perfect location with a short drive or long walk to town and the recommendations in the binder were helpful.
Finally want to shoutout the hosts for an easy, stress-free reschedule the day before my original booking. Portland, OR, was hit with a thick layer of ice preventing me from making the trip on my original weekend plan. Thank you Robin & Garrett!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool place! And great hosts too! Such an interesting house. The decor gives you so much to look at, and you can tell how much time, effort, and money was invested to make this a great living space. Beds were comfy, shower was spacious, well apportioned with appliances (washer, dryer, fridge) and just overall really well taken care of. Even some live plants. :)
Thoughtful touches like ice cubes and ice water in the fridge, Keurig was full of water ready to go, plenty of large towels and soap/shampoo/conditioner.
So much better than a stay in a nondescript hotel room! I don't see how you could go wrong staying here.
Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the most pristine airbnbs I have stayed in. It is clear that the hosts put a lot of care and thought into their place.

Great location and very unique. Highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in Astoria! Lovely space, great backyard balcony, and walkable to fun sights around. Highly recommend. Loved everything about it!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went mid January during an unexpected snow and ice storm The lovely hosts had put gravel down, put heaters in the rooms and turned them on, and even came out to greet us and make sure we made it inside safely. The place was beautiful with a lot of fun decor, they have a record player with a variety of vinyls, and the bathroom and kitchenette were nicely stocked. We met the hosts and they were wonderful. They even came out and scraped ice off the drivewayso we could leave during our stay safely. Another thing I LOVED is they have a ""take a book, leave a book"" little library. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would love to stay again sometime."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third time and wonderful as always. First nice the huge oce storm hit and we were stuck inside for 2 days They were so sweet and brought us some food and checked on us. Was the perfect place to be during the ice storm!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robin and Garrett were wonderful hosts! They obviously care about their guest's experience. They thought of every amenity that we would need, and every room was absolutely SPOTLESS! I don't recall ever staying at such a clean Airbnb. We really enjoyed the charm and comfort in every room. The record player and nicely curated selection of albums were a real bonus. We would stay here again in a heartbeat and certainly would recommend to others."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic time at Robin and Garrett's location!! They were so friendly, helpful and accommodating. The whole place is even better than the pictures.

We'd definitely come back!!"

The neighborhood was also beautiful and the home was easy to find. There’s even a cute little coffee shop that’s within walking distance to the house.
We will absolutely be coming back to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't have found a more responsive, kind, and helpful host anywhere on Air b&b. You can tell that Robin genuinely loves hosting.

The amenities for the price were incredible."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! This place was amazing!! We hardly knew the hosts were home, yet they were right there when we needed them.

There is so much to do and much of it is walkable.
Great record collection, super comfy bed, fantastic water pressure!, and they even provided snacks! They really thought of everything. Just looking around at the thoughtfully designed suite, it is so impressive. We wish we could have stayed longer!"

We stopped and grabbed food after hitting a couple of Goonies sites, and had a lovely QUIET dinner on the back porch. It was so relaxing and the view was beautiful. The Goonies brought us to Astoria, but our stay here was an added experience in itself. This was definitely the best way to start my vacation."

Lots of welcoming touches and Robin and Garrett were very friendly and accommodating hosts. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We felt right at home in the beautiful, spacious and neat apartment. So many extra things had been thought of as glasses in the freezer for an ice cold drink and the air conditioning and vans on on arrival which was nice with
the warm weather. Other than that, there were makeup wipes, granola bars, nice coffee and popcorn. Robyn is a very friendly host who does her best to make it as pleasant as possible for guests, that has certainly succeeded! We would have liked to stay longer!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Seriously beautiful suite; the hosts have thought of every detail. Thoughtful, lovely decor with some fragile items—if you have a Goonie in your group who, like Chunk, can be relied upon to break things, you’ll need to be extra careful. Shower was awesome!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute place. The fact that it was a shared house was never an issue. I never saw the host, and they made everything smooth. The back porch was amazing to sit on and stare out. Neighbor has chickens!"

I’ve never felt so welcome at an AirBnB, I cannot say enough nice things about these amazing people, and as a bonus to top it all the Goonies house was just down the street which I was not expecting, plus an absolutely gorgeous trail was just up the hill from their house, the Cathedral tree trail, beautiful."

Best sleep in years on the great bed! Great shower too. We appreciated the snacks waiting for us. R & G were fabulous with their communication before and during our stay. We had questions about best beaches and restaurants and they were happy to meet us in the peaceful backyard to give us the rundown. The sitting room/living room was spacious and peaceful for reading, relaxing, or watching TV. Like others who have stayed here, our only regret was that we couldn’t stay for several more nights. I can’t imagine a better place to stay in Astoria. It was a wonderful retreat to return to each evening after exploring the coastal beaches or shopping in town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another fabulous stay at our favorite Astoria AirBnb. This was our 4th stay here, and I can't imagine staying anywhere else. This is the first time we visited in May vs. March, which allowed us to enjoy the covered private balcony much more. This place has everything you could need and more for a stay in Astoria or the surrounding areas. There is nothing I can think of to change."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robin and Garrett are truly the most amazing hosts we’ve ever had.
Our rental car broke down at their house and they were so extremely helpful and so understanding about it all. They gave up so much of their time to work through the rental car issues with us and allowed us to stay longer than anticipated. Robin and Garret let us enjoy the morning in town while they waited for our roadside assistance to arrive.
On top of all this, the air bnb is absolutely beautiful. The location is incredible, the house is so well decorated and extremely clean. The hosts provide you with so much more than any other air bnb host has ever provided us before for example Netflix, snacks, toiletries, etc. They are just around the corner from the goonies house and the neighbourhood is so serene and quiet. I genuinely can’t say enough good things.
Thank you again to this wonderful couple, our vacation wouldn’t have been the same without them! Highly recommend!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, cozy home. Easy parking spot. Enjoyed the back balcony. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friends and I absolutely loved Tonquin’s Rest! Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in, by far. Everything was so nice and clean, and the decor was curated to perfection, meshing the historic vibe with modern comfort. Robin and Garrett thought of everything, even providing complimentary snacks by the coffee bar."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tons of space, very clean. Quiet and safe neighbourhood."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place. Very comfortable, clean and homey. I hope to go back someday"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Beautiful home in Astoria! R and G are wonderful hosts!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robin and Garrett are amazing, our favorite hosts, we love them! No matter the weather, we have the best time! We love just hanging out and listening to records in the living room, so relaxing. They are truly thoughtful. They care, and are always there if you need them. See you soon sweet friends."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It exceeded our expectations along with having a great price. The place was immaculate with highly comfortable beds, open sitting room, snacks, coffee, great shower, & relaxing whirlpool tub! We especially loved the old record player & albums. What a hoot! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great place & location to stay! We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"very beautiful property, loved our stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Robin and Garrett’s. They have a wonderful place that is so cozy, roomy and relaxing. A wonderful place for a getaway!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a beautiful place to stay. The back porch gave a beautiful view of the neighborhood.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! the space is so beautiful and well taken care of and we wish we could have stayed longer :) Robin and Garrett are very welcoming and accommodating and there is so much attention to detail in making the guest comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robin and Garrett were friendly and amazing hosts! The suite was very well designed and maintained, and perfectly matched the description. We will definitely be staying again if we find ourselves in the area again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow. We had such a great time. We didn't even want to leave to go to dinner. We really enjoyed the space, especially the living room and the balcony. Old house, intentionally decorated. Comfortable foam mattresses. Space heaters provided but in March the heat that was already set up was perfect. No kitchen sink FYI."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home and surroundings. Very comfortable and welcoming. Definitely plan on stayingagain when in town!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely place! We will definitely be back. Everything as expected except it was larger than the photos looked!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! So many cute, little touches to make us feel right at home!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so charming and beautiful! The details of each room are appreciated and the decorations are lovely and quaint! The guitar and record players were nice touches as well. We enjoyed watching the goonies film they had as the house is so close nearby. They were very friendly and greeted us and helped with everything we needed right away. The space is completely private from the rest of their home. When you walk in, it’s a staircase leading to a private patio and upstairs unit where you will have the two bedrooms, kitchen area, living room, and bathroom. The bathroom was amazing and the shower was very nice!! Could not recommend this place more. Close to restaurants and grocery stores, walkable to the water, can’t beat it!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with my daughter for spring break. It was a beautiful apartment. It everything we needed, the beds were comfortable, plenty of space, the bathroom was beautiful. We loved sitting out on the back patio and being able to see all the beautiful trees and beautiful scenery, I would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place!
What sold me was their bathroom with a big tub and jets.
The porch in the back is the loveliest.
Would love to stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Looks even better than the photos. Had a great time for the one night we were there! Easy to get around, enjoyed sitting on the back porch, and loved the room we slept in. Super clean and the well thought out decorations made us feel like we stepped into the past. The book with all the recommendations of things to do was super helpful, and gave us new ideas to check out when we come back next time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely historical home! A wonderful experience to stay in this home in this location. Would definitely stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a charming house with thoughtful touches. The decor is historically eclectic. And the sitting on the back balcony was serene. Plus the Goonies house is a short walk down the street :) Thanks so much!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An elegant and classy place to hang your hat. Highlights were the jacuzzi bath and comfy beds, esp after all the driving! Thank you Robin and Garrett"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely getaway in Astoria. Felt just like home!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It just keeps getting better!
More space inside and lovely deck out. We love it here, such history and great pictorials and art everywhere.
Also love the privacy
Thanks guys"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At the risk of making this lovely, spacious, comfortable, thoughtfully appointed destination so popular that I may never get to stay there again, I can only describe our two night mini-getaway to Astoria and stay with Robin and Garrett as a TOTAL WOW! If you want to treat yourself to a very cozy, comfy, restorative stay at the northern gateway to the Oregon Coast - STAY HERE! I'd tell you more, but there are some delightful little surprises waiting for you that every guest should get to discover for themselves...GO!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robin and Garrett were amazing hosts for our one night stay in Astoria. Very quiet neighborhood very close to downtown and good restaurants. We can’t wait to come back again! Also, the bathroom is amazing, especially the shower!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robin and Garrett’s place is fantastic! Much more than I needed or expected! Beautiful! I want to clarify, from other reviews, this is a separate private entrance that is not used by the home owners. It is your own space! Beautiful decor and amenities. The tub was awesome. I plan to visit with my kids in the future and definitely will rent here again if it’s available! Oh!!! You can walk to the Goonies house!!!!!! Thanks Robin!!!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin and Garrett’s place is as advertised and they are very good hosts. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have never experienced a more perfect AirBnB!
And it’s a really great price, especially if you’d share it and utilize both bedrooms.
For a Goonies fan, the location of course is key. Being able to walk the short distance to the Goonies house was very exciting. It’s such a cute neighborhood to walk through and it feels as if you’re in the movie.
The AirBnB is so well appointed and curated with antiques and unique finds combined with modern luxuries. I kept discovering something new and amazing every 5 min during my short stay.
I arrived late and woke up to a snowy winter wonderland and bay view from bedroom window in the morning.
Met Robin at check out and she was so sweet and helpful just how she was during the booking process.
I highly recommend staying here! And I want to come back and stay longer."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at this location, and it was just as lovely as our first! Kris is a great host, so accommodating and pleasant, and the room's view was as breathtaking as ever. Thanks for hosting us!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed the amazing view and the walkable area. We met many amazing locals while we were there. Astoria is a wonderful community. Thanks for Shari g your place, Kris."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location for a trip to Astoria. Stayed in the town a few times but the views here are awesome. Easy check in and responsive host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay here. Felt very unique since we were literally right above the water! I liked being able to open the windows and hear the sounds of the crashing waves, and it wasn’t too loud. The only improvement I could see is a softer mattress; it was very firm."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent one night in Astoria at Kris’s place. we didn’t need anything fancy, since we were arriving later in the afternoon, and planned to roam around Astoria before leaving the next morning. The apartment was clean, very quiet, and felt very private. Free parking on site, close location to restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops were a plus. we would stay here again if spending the night in Astoria. Watching the pilot boats head out from the docks was fun, and gave us extra interest in looking for them as we drove the Columbia River Gorge."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional. Just follow the instructions that Kris sends and everything flows like clockwork. The first thing you see is the spectacular view. Everything is comfortable and clean. My home is in a walkable area, but this place takes the cake. One of the most fantastic and affordable restaurants is literally downstairs and the others are literally around the corner. That means breakfast, lunch and dinner. And did I tell you about the outdoor activities nearby? Well, Kris will. His guide to the local area was very helpful. Thanks a million for making my time in Astoria exceptional in every way! Can't wait to come back!! Hopefully this review won't sell out your place, so I can have a spot next time!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a lovely stay at Kris’s. It was wonderful to wake up with the sun and watch the beautiful sunrise. We would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the view, but the unit was more minimal than expected. I should have read more of the fine print and the reviews prior to booking."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for opening up your space, couldn’t think of a better way to enjoy my time in Astoria!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at this amazing place and we hope it will not be our last. It is a spotless, comfortable room with an unbeatable view of the water. (Where else can you watch sea lions swimming right below your window?) The pier hosts an incredible Italian restaurant called Fede that is a must-visit if you're dining in Astoria. Additionally, the location is just steps away from the restaurants, breweries, and shops downtown."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesomely located and clean. Would recommend
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice views of the Columbia River. Quiet, easy stay in a clean place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had so much fun in Astoria. We were entertained watching the pilot boats run back & forth day & night right from our window. The boardwalk & shopping were great!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,simply perfect for us
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our brief stay at Kris’s in Astoria! The views were very nice!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another fantastic stay at a wonderful spot!
Thank you Kris!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Kris’ place and would definitely stay again. We opted for this over the more “luxury” options in town and were very glad we did. The views are unbeatable and the location is so close to the best of Astoria. Be aware that this is a spartan lodging option. The amenities are slim and simple but it worked really well for us.
P.S. We were bummed we missed the little Italian place on the other end of the building *They stop seating earlier than they close."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved this Airbnb on Pier 12. It was the perfect location, everything was so walkable and easily accessible. The view from the Airbnb is what made it though, perfect view of the river and the pilot boat. The place was very minimalist, but that’s what made it special. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, simple amenities, and wonderful views!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's true: the view is amazing! And, the location is great for walking around Astoria. Enjoyed the stay, thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, amazing view, perfect for a short stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Frequent stayer. Great place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay with a wonderful view, perfect location and within walking distance of shops and restaurants."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Pier 12. Having lived in Astoria a few years ago we knew it was crucial to be close to the piers and were blown away when we entered the apartment. The views were AMAZING. Even though we stayed during a very dreary, snowy weekend we loved being able to look out at the river, hills across the Columbia, and pilot boats. We spent the better part of the mornings just sitting by the windows reading and enjoying coffee. We even got to see a few pods of sea lions! We also loved how close we were to everything, we only used our car once to venture off the Cannon Beach and were close enough to walk to everything else. We knew we would be eating breakfast at a few of our favorite spots from when we last lived here, but it was nice to have a small fridge for left overs and a coffee bar to get the day started. Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to feel the Astoria magic. Thank you Kris for a lovely stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location and view is spectacular, especially since my father was a Bar Pilot and it overlooks the Pilot's office and all its goings on. Loved that. This unit is clean and quiet. Sofa and bed were really comfortable. Would have liked a microwave and a little table to eat at, but, otherwise, the 'kitchen' set up worked for us. As the only overnight accommodation in the building we had tons of privacy. The restaurant below is between owners so there were no worries about noise.
Super convenient to everything, half a block from all the restaurants, galleries, bookstores, shops and pubs. Off street parking was a real and rare plus so close in to town. We will most definitely come back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The host Kris was so responsive and friendly. The view was breathtaking, especially through the large and very clean windows.
So many places were nearby: a long and safe river-view walk, restaurants/cafes, museums, stores, and many piers.
You could see and hear the sea lions down just below from the unit (not incessant or annoyingly loud - just a distant quieter sound).
The place was spotless and free of extra noise, so we were able to hear the sound of the water (one Of the downstairs restaurants is indefinitely closed, and the other was just closed for the Sunday, so it was very quiet). The surrounding businesses on the same landing were also very quiet, including the ones outside.
Lovely bed, cozy linens, comfy couch, and great heating (it was only cold if the windows were open, which we preferred for the sound and sea air).
My child and I had a lot of fun here, and we were both blown away by the view as well as the lovely unit.
Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location right on the water in Astoria! Beautiful views. Very walkable to everything downtown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is in a great central part of Astoria right on the pier. We enjoyed watching the sea lions and ducks playing around in the river from the beautiful windows facing the water. Kris is also a really great host, allowed us to check in early, and had great local recommendations that we took advantage of. I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view and location is everything! We visit Astoria often and this was far and away the best accommodations we've experienced. Kris is a friendly & very responsive host and the space was just as described. Loved the feeling of being right ""on"" the water and watching river life happen with a birds eye view. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful view and a convenient walk to downtown spots.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view here is fantastic! The location is very walkable, which was super nice. Kris also had great recommendations! I highly recommend going to Bowpicker, the fish and chips are phenomenal!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view alone…
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great view!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing stay :) super cute super coastal!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Air BnB I've EVER stayed at.
The view is amazing."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was right on the water in downtown Astoria. Walking distance to restaurants, bars, breweries, museums, etc. Beautiful view! The restaurant downstairs wasn't loud and it had great seafood!!! I would absolutely stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wish I could give a thousand stars for location! It’s above a bar/restaurant so you do get some noise there but what a view! Bring binoculars! If you forget them there is a Big 5 in Warrenton. You’ll want binoculars to watch the sea lions, birds, pilot boats, other boats, houses on the hill and people on the other piers! The space is no frills but absolutely what you want! If you need a tv bring a laptop. That isn’t the point of this space though. It’s pure magic! Loved every minute of it! Texted my friends to book in the first hour! Excellent location. Everything walkable! Wish I had one more day to not leave the space! Walked to the local bookstore to get a PNW bird guide and enjoyed learning so much! Go to Xanadu for brunch!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The unit had a fantastic view and is in a great location. We'll try to stay here anytime we visit Astoria!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this space - the view really cannot be beat, and it was a nice, relaxing spot close to plenty of restaurants. Will stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Superb location on the pier and nice windows with a view of the water. The place is pretty minimalist so make sure to bring everything you need.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Astoria. Super unique setting over the water. Easily walkable around town. This is in a more office type building so on week days you start hearing other people around 7:30. Has one of everything you need. Very well thought through.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kris was very kind and patient with me as I had never used that type of key pad, and had typed in the address instead of using the link. Lesson learned. Gave really good recommendations ( Fede Trattoria for dinner and Broder for breakfast, both memorable).
The housekeeper Jennifer kindly called me promptly after I left to let me know I had had left behind my sunnies, so grateful!
The only bummer for me was no TV which I usually need to fall asleep to. Luckily I was so wiped out from the day it wasn’t an issue.
I hope to return, cheers!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kris’s place was top notch! As seafarers we loved hearing the water crash onto the pilings under the suite and watching the boats coming and going right from bed! Would recommend 10/10
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exceeded our expectations! Kris is a great host and made everything so comfortable and easy. This unique property is clean, comfortable, has stunning views, and is within walking distance of so many great restaurants and shops. We’ll definitely book again and look forward to our next stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to sleep in astoria! Great experience sleeping on the water!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great location! Views are great and so many things within walking distance.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,OMG amazing view. Great location. Wonderful visit. Luv
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to explore Astoria! Great location and views.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were super impressed by the location, over-the-water views and clean, comfortable accommodations. The views are mesmerizing. We enjoyed watching the pilot boat rolling in and out, the sights of the amazing ships anchored outside the windows and the excellent location made for an easy walkable Astoria visit. Thank you, Kris, for creating such a unique, cozy space in Astoria. We'll be back for sure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! The views were unmatched. The place was clean and within walking distance of several bars and restaurants. We enjoyed our weekend there.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't have enough great things to say about this lovely space. The room was spotless and comfortable, but it was the views and location that really wowed us! We loved watching the birds and sea lions go by as we lounged. There were tons of great restaurants, cafes, and shops within a very short walk, including the incredible Fedé, which is on the same pier as the room. We hope we get the chance to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an apartment in an wharf building. Just stunning river and town views out the windows. Constant low-key entertainment watching large ships line up for the high tide exit through the mouth of the Columbia.
Minimal kitchen, but a couple of means of making _good_ coffee were provided, as was half-and-half. Thanks for that.
While I wouldn't call this place noisy, it is adjacent to the river pilot's dock, and their boat will be coming and going, even at odd hours. I'm a somewhat light sleeper, but did not find this a problem at all. If you need absolute silence to sleep, you might consider elsewhere.
This was a super interesting place to stay. Thanks."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Kris's place. It has amazing views and is right in the heart of downtown.
He keeps it very simple and clean. If I am in Astoria again I hope this place is available."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely incredible space, with an even more incredible view. We wished we stayed in Astoria longer, 100% will return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing!
The location is in a prime spot in the most walkable areas of Astoria. The unit itself is quiet,secure and extremely user friendly. Kris was very friendly, communicative and accommodating. 10/10 will definitely be back!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Kris’s place!
The location was perfect! Not only did we enjoy being right on the water but everything you could possibly need or want was within a few blocks.
We would love to go back someday!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The view is beautiful from the huge windows. It’s great for one or two nights and if you’re on the younger side maybe longer. The location is awesome!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed two nights to celebrate a 60th Birthday. Loved the location out over the water and watching the big ships as well as the pilot boat heading out. We enjoyed some great places to eat in Astoria so didn't mind not having a kitchen. Coffee in the morning was enough. We loved how Astoria has grown and emerged as a quaint town on the Columbia. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this location to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and it was amazing. Central to many attractions, fairly private, and so, so beautiful. Kris' place is going to be a repeat experience for us!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place and perfect location! Instructions were super easy. Will definitely look to stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cool place, big giant windows looking right on the water, hard to beat that view."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and amazing views from both the living room and the bedroom!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this location and can’t wait to come back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place at Pier 12 in Astoria was perfect for our first time visiting. The choices for dining (all within walking distance) were fantastic! For that matter the 2 restaurants in the same building, very good.
I highly recommend this place and location when looking to stay in Astoria."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Pier 12 was a great walkable location with nice views of the pier and boats.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great time at Kris’s apartment. It’s easy to find, has parking on the premises, and is walking distance from many cute shops and restaurants. We absolutely loved the location! In the morning we opened the curtain and watched boats come and go. A truly incredible experience. I wish we could stay longer!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, nice and clean just what you need - and not what you don't :)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool pad Kris has curated on the pier in Astoria. Easy parking, right in the middle of all the action. Please try the Italian restaurant located in the same building — amazing! We intended on hitting the road early, but loved the space and views so much we stayed until the last minutes before checkout. If you’re on the fence, please book this place! You won’t be disappointed"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to Astoria to visit family and explore a little bit, and this location was exactly what we needed! Would recommend for anybody who wants to walk to bars and restaurants and be out in the town exploring!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very special place indeed. Beautiful views of the river, boats, birds, and occasional seal! Simple, tasteful furnishings. Appreciated the functional minimalism of the space, decor and amenities. Everything we needed was provided!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here. Woke up early to watch the sunrise and enjoying the view!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second time staying here for our anniversary. It's a wonderful little suite in a very unique spot with amazing views over the river.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice location. Coffee provided and good wifi. Bed comfortable. Astoria is gorgeous.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kris’s place was a wonderful place to stay and enjoy Astoria. It was comfortable, very clean, and loved the extra touch of having pour over and French press options for our coffee!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the Pier 12 space. Fun views of the water and pilot house. The space was clean and easy to get into with parking on site. You're right downtown which is great for walking around, but felt private enough to come back to at night for a peaceful rest."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is an incredible spot right on the water and walkable to everything you need in Astoria. Simple and comfortable with everything you need for a relaxed stay. Kris was very communicative and proactive during an unseasonably hot spell. I'm hoping to come back during cooler weather!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Great central yet quiet location. Very helpful have parking included. Kris provided restaurant recommendations that were great.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Location was incredible. The food in the area is amazing. Only thing is the bed is rock solid. Everything else was great!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed in a few places in Astoria. This one was amazing!! Stunning views, clean, quiet, walkable to lots of restaurants, breweries and shops. Great value, I feel like it was a hidden gem. Great host, will book again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location with great a great view.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Quintessential Astoria! Great place for a night or two. Such a treat to watch the light change and the boats go in and out on the water. The place has everything you need and nothing you don't. Do bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise. We'd definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment itself is pretty basic, but if you’re only looking for a landing place at the end of the day, it will have everything you need. Stay here for the beautiful views of the Columbia River and the convenience of the location. How often can you stay on a pier?!? You can watch the sun rise and set from this location, and it’s an easy walk to a variety of downtown shops and restaurants. We enjoyed dinner at South Bay Wild (the seafood fry bread is amazing!) and stopped for coffee at Sleeper Coffee the next morning. We would stay here again. The place was clean and comfortable, and Kris checked a couple of times before and during our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This trip was specifically meant to be peaceful and soothing for a friend who needed some comfort. This was perfect! I brought binoculars to take with us to the eagle sanctuary, and they also came in handy for watching the ships and wildlife on the water. If this was my place, I'd never leave. Thanks so much for everything."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with beautiful views. It’s central to just about all the restaurants and activities. Easy walking to most everything. Great views of the river and spacious but cozy place especially for peak season in Astoria!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures of this place do not do it justice! You have a stunning view of the pier/water. We absolutely loved our stay in Astoria! We did not spend a lot of time in the AirBnB due to being there for a wedding. It was nice having a separate living room from the bedroom. The bed was very comfy and shower was nice. Only thing I would just let others know is there is no TV or full kitchen in the space which we knew coming in and didn’t mind at all. There is still a French press and pour over for coffee. Also a small fridge to store leftovers in. I would recommend Kris’s place in a heartbeat to others looking to travel to Astoria!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place! Great location to local shops and restaurants. The views were great! The space was nice and clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying at Astoria’s Perch was an unforgettable experience! We can’t wait to book again one day. The view was incredible and the suite was comfortable and cozy—we’ve already recommended staying here to several friends!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kris's communication was great! The space is just as described in a cool/unusual location on the pier. The internet connection was outstanding. As several have noted, loved the amazing views over the water! We stayed over a Sunday night, so we weren't able to check out the Italian restaurant located in the same building that was closed on Sundays.
Even though the outdoor temperature was <70°F the day we stayed and the fans had been turned on before we arrived (thank you!), the temperature inside the unit was a bit warm and didn't cool off as much as we would have preferred for the night. Only two small windows can be slid open over the top of each large window and this didn't provide much air circulation/cooling. Some have noted that leaving the door to the hallway open can help with circulation, but we didn't feel comfortable doing that.
To close out, the mattress was quite firm, but I found it very comfortable with two different pillows for each person.
Overall, a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Utter magic ✨
Truly a most unique and breathtaking experience. We didn’t want to leave. Kris was but a dream to correspond with, helpful and always quick to respond.
Astoria at its finest."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place! what a treat to be right on the water, it felt so magical :) perfect size for two people, our one complaint was there was very little ventilation in the room so it got got very hot and didn’t cool off much throughout the night. would stay here again, probably during the cooler months!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the unique view of the big ships on the Columbia river. Great walkable location. Sun coming in a good part of the day warms it up, which I like. And by the time you climb into bed, it’s cooled right down.
Didn’t miss tv at all! Astoria’s history is so interesting."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Water view spectacular. You can make coffee with French press there, also has very nice mini fridge. Parking great. No problem with restaurant noise downstairs. Will probably stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an absolutely amazing place to stay! Great location, phenomenal views and overall perfect. The place was super clean and felt right at home. The host was very proactive and we felt very comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a gem! The views are obviously amazing, but the location is as well. You’re so close to all of downtown and can walk to all sorts of great shops, breweries and restaurants. My friend suggested a hotel down the block that charges more than twice as much for the same view and I’m sure this place has more privacy. It’s not fancy, but it has the basics and we were happy to find there was also a little fridge. We’d gladly stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great location with beautiful views and excellent walkability around Astoria.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Centrally located.
Easy to walk to any place in town or to take the trolly. Great view of the Columbia River. Would definitely book again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stay here and enjoy the most unique Airbnb setting!!! Right on the pier to watch boats, fish jumping and birds. We stayed a Saturday night and enjoyed the fabulous Sunday farmers market with fresh flowers, produce and local artists. Kris was very responsive and place was very clean and has everything you need."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! Enjoyed the water view and watching the pilot transfer tug. Walkable to museum, restaurants and yarn & book store. Excellent parking. Definitely hope to come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best location I've ever stayed at.
Thank you for the tips of places to go in town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing view of the river. Quiet, clean and within walking distance of restaurants and shops. We found it very relaxing and had a wonderful stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great gem right on the water! The views are incredible. The host was great, very communicative, gave plenty of recommendations, good instructions about getting there, checking in etc. Love that there were fans, mini fridge and coffee supplies. Could of been a little cleaner but overall was very nice. I love that there was parking and great location close to everything."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's grand being so close to river.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place! The views! The comfort! Absolutely perfect!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is within walking distance of many things and the view was great. There was never much noise.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We come down the coast annually, and this is by far the best day we have had in Astoria. Love you relaxing and beautiful. This will be where we stay from now on."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kris has an incredible place! Being right on the water, you have a spectacular view of the ships coming into the bay. The price of the place and location are very hard to beat! Next time that we come to town, we will be staying there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our more picturesque and unique Airbnb stays. We walked in to huge picture windows giving us an up-close view down the Columbia River. The windows did allow lots of sun into the room, warming it up on the two sunny days we had, but we cooled the rooms down with the provided fans and cool air from the hallway, and blackout drapes provided all the privacy we needed. Mornings we had the entire building to ourselves until the other tenants arrived for work. The location was incredible - easy to walk anywhere in town, but the most enjoyable part was admiring the view out those big windows. We really enjoyed Astoria's Perch!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first trip to Oregon and we knew we wanted to visit the town where Goonies was primarily filmed. To our surprise, they were having a Goonies week and were able to see the original film at the local theater. We got to enjoy the Sunday market and had an incredible breakfast.
The space was pretty incredible. Small, but it had everything we needed for an overnight stay to check out Astoria. I awoke to the most amazing sunrise and got to see the Strawberry Full Moon the night before. We loved hearing the water as we fell asleep. If we were to return, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Kris provided clear check in instructions, as well as lots of recommendations."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really cannot express how great of a hidden gem this was. Kris’s home is so splendid, an insane view, and amazing location. I will 100% be back. Thank you kris!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is easily the strangest-seeming location for any airbnb we've ever stayed in. I think it is the only apartment in a building that houses 2 restaurants and a few other small businesses. But the setting wasn't an issue at all. We had no trouble getting in. It was quiet. Except for the restaurant, none of the businesses had many visitors and all were closed by 5:00 or 6:00. The restaurant did play music until they closed at 8:00 or 9:00, but barely audible in the apartment, and wasn't bad music. Parking was very easy and convenient.
The location couldn't have been better. Views from both rooms of the apartment are stunning, just like the photos in the listing. It was cool to watch the harbor pilot shuttle boat come and go from pier 14, right next door. You can see the sun rise from your bed. And you can watch the sun set from the parking lot. Easy walk to many shops, restaurants and brewpubs (Ft George was our favorite). Ride the trolley - super cool. I want to come back already!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kris's place was amazing, just as described. The photos don't do it justice--the windows are *huge* and look directly out at the water! I saw both a small cruise ship and riverboat arrive watching from the living area couch, so fun! The space was spotless and I had everything I needed. This area in Astoria was hopping on a holiday weekend and there are so many good restaurants around. I would highly recommend Kris's place and I would definitely return!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Reserved stay for son and daughter-in-law for a birthday gift. They loved it! We also have stayed there and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super convenient, loved everything about this spot. Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again! Amazing views, everything you need is in walking distance, and Kris was a great host."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the second time staying at this location. It is defiantly one of our favorites and we will continue to return! Walking distance to everything you need, cute atmosphere and stunning views!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful view of the water.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing location. So close to cafes and restaurants, with some retail therapy thrown in.
Great to be able to walk/run along the river in the mornings.
Thankyou for the excellent coffee."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very walkable, and a fun place to watch the ships on the river. Music from the restaurant below added a nice background to our evening and the ship’s horns made for a couple of adrenaline rushes and laughs. We enjoyed ourselves very much."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Accommodating host. As described. Perfect place for a couple to get away and spend time in Astoria. Walk to everything in town. Beautiful view of ships and river through big windows.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Our third stay here; always very happy with this spot. Highly recommended!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space. Loved the large windows
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in the heart if Astoria. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, accommodation, and location with beautiful views."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kris’ place is great and quite unique! It is convenient and within walking distance of restaurants and shops. As someone who loves ships, I couldn’t ask for a better view of the ships at anchor and passing by the pier. I also enjoyed watching the pilot boat. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic stay in the beautiful Astoria! Kris’s unique stay was such an amazing experience. Cozy, and well stocked with coffee so you can spend your mornings watching seals and birds on the water! Perfectly located for walking in the area, close to breweries and shopping. We really appreciated the local guide with our booking as it gave us lots to do, and delicious places to eat.
It was rainy when we were there but just so much fun to listen to the rainfall as we watched the river!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, easy to communicate with, and will definately try to stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful view! Great walkable area to plenty of restaurants and shops. We loved our stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stay for our quick weekend in Astoria. You could not ask for a better location. It’s close to a ton of great restaurants, shops, and breweries. We ate dinner at the restaurant on the ground floor of the building, and it was really good! Highly recommend it if it’s rainy and you don’t want to travel far. The view from both rooms in the unit is beautiful, and we enjoyed watching the seals swim and play. Kris is a wonderful host, and it was easy to check in and access the unit. We will be back!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay during a visit to Astoria. It's in a great location, the place is simple and comfortable, and the view is amazing.
There are some issues with noise during the day but it is minimal and it's quiet at night, which is when it matters most. We actually liked hearing the music from the restaurant below in the evening. Sort of added to the atmosphere and isn't loud.
If you are a fan of good coffee in the morning, Kris has that covered with all the supplies you need to make it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Amazing view, host was very responsive and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. Right above two great restaurants, walking distance to all the shops."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, well cleaned place with two amazing full wall windows to the ocean. As someone sensitive to sounds, I did not hear a single noise from within the building inside the home (despite being on top of a restaurant)! If you're lucky, you may get to see the neighboring facilitie's boat come and go throughout the day. :) This was a lovely Airbnb that we would recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great spot with everyone as advertised!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot. Fantastic location overlooking the river and pilot house. The restaurant downstairs is great and we didn’t have any problem with noise. Could use a new mattress, though it was also too firm for us, which most people would probably like."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location you'll be able to see the maritime pilots in action and you'll feel like you're part of the sea lion community. Walkable to shops and restaurants.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t have asked for a better location. Kris’s place was the perfect place to stay for a weekend in Astoria.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place with an awesome view.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the coolest Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at! The view is absolutely amazing. We could have stayed in and watched the sea lions and boats all day! It was extremely walkable as well, we didn’t drive anywhere until it was time to leave."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect and look forward to staying there again!
Location is unbeatable and parking was easy. Reviewers say the amenities are “bare bones” but there is everything we needed. I guess folks get used to having a kitchen? The coffee/tea bar is spot on and the mini fridge was more than ample for our groceries.
And YES go the the restaurant downstairs. Twas dynamite!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent location, beautiful view, comfortable space. I am looking forward to a return visit."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place enjoyed the apartment. great views. my girlfriend really liked the coffee and the half and half in the refrigerator!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. It’s literally on the river. We wished we could have stayed longer. We had plans in Seaside and Long Beach but it was hard to leave the room in the morning because the view of the river and marine traffic was superb. WILL stay here again, soon!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here. The windows face the east so the sunrise was absolutely stunning. Will stay here again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful comfortable place for a get away. Awesome view and fun location.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing trip at this location. Out of this world view

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had the most amazing little stay. The view is unbelievable. Great little secluded corner. Loved every minute.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed for one night and enjoyed the lovely view and convenient location
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean. Super easy check-in/out. Centrally located on beautiful Columbia River. Walkable in all directions!!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kris’s home on the pier is…amazing. I can’t remember the last time I woke up to such a stunning view. The sight of the Columbia and surroundings are stunning. Kris’s home was immaculate, well appointed, and had everything we needed. The huge windows in each room are awesome, and you can darken easily if you need an afternoon nap! Would love to stay here again. Thank you, Kris."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely love staying at this place. The views from the room can't be beat, truly spectacular, from one window you can look out at the water and see the ships and seals swimming, a view of tongue point, and a lovely view of downtown and the column. This pier is centrally located with restaurants, breweries, cafes, and shopping all just steps away."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent spot! Very close to many things to do in town and wonderful views, watching the bay is an absolute joy."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As expected, this was an absolutely gorgeous location and so convenient to all the downtown restaurants and cafes. The apartment was exactly as described- very clean but also a little bare bones. We didn’t miss the kitchen but a few extra touches or additional storage would have made it feel more welcoming. It was very minimalist which is not a problem, but the price seemed a tad high when rooms at the hotel down the block were around the same cost. We did really enjoy the experience though and are looking forward to visiting Astoria again someday!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot. We loved the view. We would totally come back.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place had an awesome view and the coffee bar was great 👍 also the best Italian restaurant down stairs
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful place to stay and was definitely a unique experience getting to watch all the activity on the water. The conveniently located SeaCrab restaurant downstairs was amazing also!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! it is a super cute, unique space in an excellent location, close to everything, and it had everything we needed! The unit was very clean and nicely decorated, and the bed was really comfortable. Communication was clear and check-in/check-out process was really easy easy. The restaurant/bar below was ""lively"" during the afternoon and early evening, but, as the description stated, it quieted down quickly at closing time. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location; the view is unbeatable, on the water, right in the heart of Astoria life: stores, breweries, boardwalk, museums, restaurants.
The trattoria downstairs is one of the best Italian restaurants in memory.
The condo is charming. View of the Columbia river is breathtaking.
The condo was clean, pleasant, had a French press and all the coffee and tea fixings needed, a nice fridge for milk and whatever else needed. Definitely a place to return to."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay and watch the pilot boat come and go. Close to breweries and food in Astoria. Also great for just curling up on the couch to read and watch the boats go by.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was just as described. Fantastic location and clean nice room that was way easy to check in and all that. Kris communicated easily and everything went well.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. Tastefully appointed. Beautiful view. Amazing location in the heart of Astoria, with everything you need or want within walking distance. Only minor quibble was the harbor pilot’s tug shining lights in the windows while working at night. But it’s understood that it comes with the territory and it wasn’t bad enough to ruin our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an incredible place to stay, great views and Kris was an amazing host! Huge recommend, will stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great view and location!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the central location and the fabulous restaurant in the building.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great getaway with fantastic views, walking distance to everything. We agree with what others have said about the need for better cooling and ventilation. Then this little gem would be over-the-top perfect!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great view, Great location, comfortable bed! All arounf great stay!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous views from the huge windows, very centrally located and lovely to be able to walk everywhere from the room. Should note that there is no AC if it is very hot, but that did not bother us as it was lovely weather when we were there. Would recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Perfect for our stay! Communication was great! We would stay here again!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place, great location, plenty to do
only down side was no A/C"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, clear instructions, great views, prime location. What else can you ask? We truly enjoyed our stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyable stay, probably one of my favorite stays despite how ""bare bones"" it is. I think this room is perfect if you plan on being gone most of the day. My wife and I looked forward to coming back to this room for the evening. The view of the river was awesome. You can see container ships go past or anchor down for the night. There is a tugboat parked just outside that would get called out day and night. Plenty of wildlife to see like seals, jumping fish, various birds, etc. It was fun to watch and relax in.
Description was very accurate about the listing. To paint the picture a bit better, it's upstairs above the restaurant with a few other offices / businesses. There is an elevator and a short set of stairs to get in. It's tucked in the corner past the elevator somewhat out of the way, but next to a business (which was inaudible while we were in the room).
The music and sound of the restaurant IS noticeable, however with the provided fan running and windows open I didn't notice anything that kept me from sleeping. I'm usually pretty sensitive to noise and use a sound machine at home, but had no problems at this stay. Take that as you will, but I couldn't even mark it a con as it just added to the atmosphere of it all.
Overall, I'd definitely stay there again if another opportunity comes up."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Very accurate description. Even more modern and roomy than the listing describes! Great location! Great views!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is hard to beat. The views, proximity to downtown and the Astoria River Walk, and ease of access make this a top spot in town. We had the windows open in each room to head the boats come and go but had no issues with noise from the restaurant below. Great spot- highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, views and property. We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay again in the future."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I will be booking this spot again and again for years to come! Best location and views in town. Really enjoyed that it’s in walking distance of all of the great breweries and food places. The views were magical and I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Absolutely loved it! The view was amazing, the location is convenient and I'd go back today if it wasn't 2300 miles away from my home, lol. Communication was clear and easy and the unit was very cool and comfortable. I loved sleeping with the windows open letting the fresh air and sounds off the water in. I would totally stay here again if I was in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cant beat the location, very clean. No tv or any extras"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a little overnight getaway. I wanted to explore the beach and state parks nearby. This location was so beautiful. The sunset and sunset were magnificent. I made sure to be in my room to catch both and I’m glad I did. The unit perfect, clean, and comfortable. The communication was really great from the time I booked till the time I checked out. I was able to park my car on site under a bright light which was great peace of mind.
I definitely would revisit this place again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful Airbnb! Spectacular views, absolute perfect location & a fantastic and very helpful Airbnb host. Will definitely want to come back!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy walk to downtown.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here for five nights for a wedding at The Ruins at the Astor. It was SO close to the venue, and to most of Astoria’s downtown gems. I had my 9 month old with me and she did great in the rental as well. Kitchen was perfect for the light cooking we did and the unit pretty much had everything we needed. The heaters kept us cozy, and I loved daydreaming about the history of this place given it was built in 1890! The couch reclines in this particular unit which was a nice surprise. The hosts were super communicative, helpful, and friendly. You can tell they are really committed to providing great hospitality and I appreciated their efforts.
I am rather out of shape post baby and found the stairs at this rental a little tiring, but that’s not the fault of the host at all! And the cool thing about booking an upstairs unit with them is you get access to the adorable sun room. I wish I had the time to just sip tea in there and write a letter to a friend :) Overall I had a lovely stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for us. So close to great coffee, beer, and food. We have a young toddler and the second bedroom was big enough to safely use our pack and play for her sleep. Bed and pillows were super comfy. Heating was responsive and worked well. Kitchen was great and had everything we needed for the times we ate at home. The view was incredible as well - our kiddo loved watching the boats."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot in the heart of Astoria. Loved the period details of the apartment and had a wonderful view of the Columbia river. Would definitely stay again next time we visit Astoria.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came for the Fisher Poet Gathering. We were right in the midst of it. Such a convenient location for food, beer, and shopping, besides. We’ll be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed with Cindy last year and loved it! This year did not disappoint either! Will definitely come back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very enjoyable, would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful historic building right in the heart of downtown Astoria! I found it really convenient to walk to businesses downtown (you're basically down the block from Fort George), and the waterfront. The place itself is lovely, spacious, and full of character."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! It's probably the best flat in town and in a great location. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot in what is practically downtown Astoria if one is used to walking more than a block for things. There’s local bakeries for breakfast, breweries for dinner, and a lovely view of the Columbia river."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a great experience here! The view and location are perfect, and walkable to so much. Communication was friendly and prompt, accessing the space was easy, street parking was plentiful. The neighborhood felt totally safe. There was a perfect balance of historic charm and modern convenience in the apartment. Both beds were very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location in Astoria!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location in the heart of town, once you park you can walk to almost anywhere in downtown Astoria. We had no issue finding street parking during our stay. The unit was clean, cozy, had a beautiful view of the river and all of the amenities we could have hoped for (but we especially loved the in-unit washer & dryer and laundry pods). We visited with our baby and each bedroom had plenty of room for our pack and play, and we appreciated the sound machine that the hosts provided. The baby slept the best she ever has in this apartment! We realized when we arrived that the unit was missing shampoo but the hosts brought some to us immediately when we reached out. All in all, we’d love to stay here again, and hopefully for longer than just a weekend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Very close to the heart of Astoria. Great views of the river. Very clean and very convenient!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cindy's bnb was a wonderful place to stay. It has the old Astoria feel and makes you feel connected to the city.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,Our stay was great. The only minor complaining was that there didn’t seem to be any A/C so when we arrived it was pretty hot inside until we got windows open and air flowing. Otherwise excellent. Will be planning to stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to downtown, but also quiet. Bed was exceptionally comfortable - firm and a great night's sleep!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was so comfortable, great beds, loved sitting at the dinner table while visiting my daughter and son-in-law. We loved walking to the restaurant and the Sunday market. We will definitely be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s place is exactly as described. Great location. Highly walkable. Spacious and comfy. Lots to see from this location. Don’t miss Astoria Column a 20 min. challenging walk and Cape Disappointment in Washington, a short drive both with stunning views. Also Fort George Brewery is very good eats and beer is yummy."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location in Astoria! Our hosts were accommodating and communicative and the apartment suited our family well for a long weekend. Thanks for having us!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Got great use of the large dining room table for games.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Cindy’s place and our favorite Airbnb in Astoria!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay so much. The location is perfect for a visit to Astoria. (Everyone was so excited to be so close to Fort George!) It's an older home but so much fun charm and personality in the flat. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The kitchen was stocked with what we needed. It was fun to look out the windows & watch the ships go by. We even had some deer visit the yard. A great stay - we'll hopefully be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Cindy’s apartment. It’s super walkable to downtown Astoria and had a great view. We have a 2.5 year old and a 3 month old, and the space worked really well for us as our daughter took the second bedroom and the baby was with us in the larger bedroom. The beds were comfortable and we all slept great (even the baby!). We would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of those hosts who covers all of the little details that make such a BIG difference. Clean and plentiful linens, coffee/tea, well appointed kitchen with everything needed to cook when you don’t feel like going out and FABULOUS location!!! Close to such great shops and restaurants. Jake and Cindy were EXCELLENT hosts! 🙌🏻⭐️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a stopover in Astoria! Within walking distance of many restaurants, shopping, Riverwalk, and the Maritime Museum. I would definitely stay there again if I find myself back in Astoria!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"So I gave this place 5 stars all around. The location was great, it stayed nice and cool with all the windows opens, the shelves were stocked with cook wear and glasses/dishes and it was very clean and nice looking. The only things I will warn you about is the stove gets a ton hotter than we expected, so watch that closely, and the water for the tub never really got hot. We did do a small batch of dishes right before getting in but it was something we were really looking forward to and the water just never got warm/hot enough to fill the tub, even though 2 of us were getting in it. Would love to stay again though!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Cindy's place during our stay. It was especially nice watching the sunset out over the bay. The location is close to fun restaurants and downtown Astoria. Would love to re-visit some day.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love historic buildings, especially ones with original, working double hung windows! What a gem in a fantastic part of town."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and really enjoyed our stay! The location is great - within walking distance to downtown Astoria shops and restaurants. The place was clean and charming. Perfect for our family of three!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot to visit the town. Well maintained and very walkable and close to a lot. Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect home base out of which to explore downtown Astoria. It’s an older home but has lots of charm.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cute, peaceful, and historic flat is well worth the money. The flat was very clean and had all the amenities mentioned in the description.
The view of the river is amazing and the flat is in walking distance from the downtown."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and with a beautiful view of the Columbia, Cindy’s place was a great home base for a wedding weekend and quick trip to the beach. The location was super convenient, just a few minutes from restaurants, the waterfront, and several parks."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this place is amazing. Across the street from Fort George, which was the main reason we were there. Kitchen is well stocked and easy to use. We had a little mixup with the code and room number, but the owner responded in under a minute. Super fast response! Gladly stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in the middle of Astoria. Easy walking to shops, restaurants, and piers.
The small bistro balcony off the kitchen is the perfect sport for morning coffee and watching the bay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be one of my all time favorite places to stay. We loved the apartment, the location and the town. We would highly recommend this Airbnb. Charming, clean and great location. Everything was so easy."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cindy and Jacob were very responsive hosts. The Airbnb was super conveniently located with a great view! Would stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming well kept historic 2 bedroom apartment. Right in heart of Astoria, easy walking to shops, restaurants and riverside boardwalk. Had a great stay. Be advised there quite a few stairs to get up both outside and once in building to reach your room."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Overall the property was beautiful (beautiful hard wood floors) and laid out very well. Walking distance to many amenities. Great view of the water.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely wonderful apartment in an historical building. It's lovely and has an incredible view!
The beds are comfortable and firm, the kitchen is equipped with high quality pans and sharp knives. Everything is quite new.
Astoria has lots of good restaurants, breweries, and shops to peruse. There are many places to walk around and everything is within walking distance."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We planned a spontaneous, quick trip to Astoria and found Cindy’s place. It was everything it described. Convenient location, quiet and very cute. We would definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is stunning and quiet. The views are incredible, large windows, secluded, beautiful kitchen and living space/interior design, lovely loft area for work and close to downtown Astoria. This was the perfect Air BnB for our birthday weekend away!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alan was very responsive and the place is amazing. It is so quiet and beautiful. He has great amenities to watch the ships coming and going. It is very easy to get to everything town
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at Alan's Captain's View Guest House. We booked our 2nd stay immediately after our 1st stay this past March 2024 because we loved the home so much. The view is incredible. It's so interesting to watch the large shipping container ships and tug boats and coast guard drills on the Columbia River. The home is quiet, peaceful and modern. The king size bed and heated bathroom floors are luxurious bonuses. We used the kitchen every night and walked to town everyday. Great location for hilly walks and spectacular views!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Alan’s quiet retreat. It was peaceful, clean, comfortable, and a delightful escape from normal life.
As we were leaving we were given some personalized coasters with our name and a map of Astoria. Very cool.
The views from this spot were just as good as we remembered and we enjoyed our short getaway thoroughly!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Holy moly, what a view! We felt so lucky to stay here while exploring Astoria. The space was so clean and well-organized, yet homey and comfortable. Astoria is such a treasure, and learning about the history of the area and the power of the waters where the Columbia River and Pacific Ocean meet was so very interesting. The cherry on top was getting to stay in a place with such an amazing view of the river. Highly, highly recommend, and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed staying here, the view was absolutely beautiful! Alan was super helpful when something came up and resolved it nicely. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The absolute best!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan's place is better than 5 star because of its view, location, comfort and very caring host. The place is immaculate and very well set up for a peaceful and quiet stay. The kitchen is extremely well stocked, with cooking utensils, tea/coffee and basic spices. I forgot there is not an oven, but googled a perfect way to make frozen pizza in a frying pan which turned out just as good. I love the telescope and watching the river and sand bar pilots climbing up and down the large shipping vessels. This is my second stay here, and because I always experience a perfect and spiritually relaxing time, I'll definitely be requesting to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is outstanding. There are sweeping views of the Columbia River from the deck, living room and kitchen. The home has modern, clean, sleek furnishings. The bathroom feels luxurious with its large walk in shower, towel warmer and heated floors! The king size bed is so comfortable and the linens are soft. We especially enjoyed the peaceful neighborhood and walking to town (nice and hilly!). We plan on returning!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alan’s place was amazing. Nice amenities and gorgeous views. We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was absolutely beautiful here, great views and very relaxing. We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Alan’s place! Just as described and has everything you need for a relaxing stay in Astoria. We loved watching the ship traffic and it was only about a 5 minute drive to great restaurants and pubs. We plan to visit again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a view! Gorgeous vista of the river, ships, and town of Astoria. The property is at the end of a dead end road so it is remarkably quiet and tranquil. A ten minute walk will get you into town to enjoy delicious food and drink, Hint: go east and take the trail in the cul de sac instead of the way you drove in), but bring a grippy pair of shoes and a good set of knees for the near vertical section of (paved) road.
Alan was accommodating of my early check in, otherwise I didn’t hear or see anyone ( a good thing!).
You will not be disappointed!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply phenomenal experience from start to finish. I cannot recommend Alan’s space enough. We will definitely return!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great view of the famous bridge. amazingly clean space.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here to celebrate my wife’s birthday. It is fantastic; just close enough to downtown for a quick commute, just far enough up the hill for privacy. The view is amazing! We saw a bald eagle, the inbound ships and pilot onboarding’s were entertaining, and the comfort of the space is magical. Highly recommend Alan’s place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my stay. Alan was a great host and house was perfect. Thanks
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot with great views and cozy interior. The space is laid out really well, was quiet, and felt private while still being close to everything in Astoria. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view was wonderful and Alan's place was very clean. It's a very quiet sanctuary. We didn't need to ask Alan for anything as everything was effortless and well described, but he proactively checked in with us anyway. We would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING! All the little details were thought of and the view was mind blowing!!!! Absolutely lovely.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First off the bed is worthy of the price. View is excellent as is the shower.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views and a pristine, spacious apartment. There were lots of nice touches-heated bathroom floor, well stocked kitchen and Alan contacted us and allowed us to check in early which was so so kind. The apartment is above their garage, so heard the doors open/close a few times, but wasn't impactful. The layout worked well for us-bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and living room all on the main floor and then a loft with a desk and small couch. We didn't go upstairs besides once to check it out, but likely would be a great place to work for someone who can remotely. Walkable to downtown, but is a bit of a hill.
Definitely recommend and would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this spot is a GEM. no doubt i would return back to alan's place. it is super clean and very comfortable top to bottom. the view of the water and overall landscape are stunning. the wrap around deck that face the water, a huge bonus, even moreso in the warmer weather. the fireplace is great ambiance and provides extra heat if preferred in the colder season. parking is right in front and easy to access the home. alan is easy to get a hold of if needed, and a very kind host, he helped me retrieve an item i left accidentally in his home, thank you alan! the downtown of astoria can be viewed from his home, which means its just a short drive away to shops, eateries, and a cute downtown. a top 10 airbnb!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to watch the big ships and a big storm and the cleanest airbnb we’ve been in!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As everyone else has mentioned, the view of the Columbia River is fantastic . We called into a home warmed by the gas stove .So cozy and inviting! Everything was super clean, well appointed. We loved the bed and the towel warmer and heated bathroom floor. The kitchen was well stocked. The drive up and down is window g and narrow, but we found a walking path to town so driving was not necessary every day. It does get your heart thumping on the way back up hill, but there are plenty of opportunities to look around nd take your time. We highly recommend this home and hope to return soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay with a very beautiful view ! It is well kept and very clean!!! I’d definitely stay there again .
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Alan’s guest house— the views are truly amazing! We saw multiple rainbows over the river and loved watching the birds and boats go by. The space itself is cozy, immaculately clean, and very comfy. Hope to return soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was exactly what we were looking for. It was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the view was amazing. Thanks for hosting us! We had a great time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is worth all the five stars it has! I booked this for my in laws anniversary and I was on the phone with my mother in law when she checked it and it literally left her speechless. The view, the space, and even the beautiful bathroom. Everything was clean and the host was extremely helpful. If you're thinking about booking here, just do it! You won't regret it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable. Great view - loved watching ships on the Columbia River. Wonderful attention to details created a stress-free stay. Top quality!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a charming stay at Allan's beautiful home. The view was spectacular, even in the rain! It was an amazing surprise to wake before sunset and see the incredible lights on the ships in the water and below. The bed and living room furniture were very comfortable, and everything was spotless and pristine. The only surprise we had was the fact that there was no oven. It seemed like a fully equipped kitchen, with a great gas range, so we assumed there was an oven, and brought back a fresh chicken pot pie and garlic bread to bake for dinner, but couldn't do it. I am not sure if that was mentioned in the description of the unit, if not, it should be. But, now we know that we can plan ahead better, and can't wait to return! Thank you, Allan."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Airbnb!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view and cute little guest house. Everything was clean and tidy. My husband loved working in the loft area. It was quiet especially at night which is important to us. The view was the best part though!! We will stay again when we come back to visit family in the area. Thank you.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay - great location, easy check-in, accommodating host, nice and cozy home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan’s place was clean, comfortable, and had a spectacular view of the Columbia river. You can hear the sea lions from the deck. We would definitely come back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stellar spot! The view alone won my heart but the house is just delightful. I needed a respite just for myself for a few days and it was everything. I brought all I needed, stared at the water, and never left during my stay! Alan was responsive and kind. I hope to return there again and explore the town since I didn't quite make it this time.
PS A cute kitty lives in the main house and likes to stare out the screen door. It felt lucky when I caught a glimpse of them!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent two nights and found it to be very clean!! But what immediately caught our eye was the view!!!! It was amazing!!!
We only used the fireplace once - nice touch!
We also loved the heated bathroom floor and towel heater.
Communication with Alan was great- he even offered dinner recommendations for us!!
Loved the place and highly recommend!!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay there again. Very clean, organized and with a great view."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is very modern, clean and beautiful inside and out. The views as all other reviews have stated are spectacular. Alan was very responsive to any questions we had. The actual drive up to the property is a little challenging due to the windy narrow road, but well worth the effort."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home. Very well kept, beautiful view, and a very kind and thoughtful host. We were able to walk/bike downtown and to the trail along the Columbia. We were close to good Kayaking and bike trails, and overall it was a very fun week. We would definitely stay at this home again. It was a perfect fit for two people.
Thanks Alan!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described. Beautiful view. Loved it!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible views of Astoria and the Columbia River! Newly remodeled and modern living quarters. We would love to stay there again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was absolutely beautiful! Clean inside and out. The view of the Columbia River was breathtaking and having a telescope and binoculars was a nice touch.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It’s impossible to capture this view with a single photo - it really needs a video since the view is so panoramic. The front porch is built over a drop off that is running wild with local vegetation so it’s nice and private. Alan’s is truly a super host and a nice guy.
Inside, it’s clean and really well thought out. Towel warmers and a heated floor in the bathroom are nice add ons. There is a gas fireplace with a remote control that gave it a special glow and took the edge off the cool mornings. Gas stove top was a big plus (I can’t stand cooking on electric stove tops). There is no oven but Alan provides a little charcoal grill. You will need this to cook seafood since it’s not allowed inside due to the lingering odor. I would add a toaster oven but this might be one more thing to clean. I left an iron skillet to put on the grill - DON’T ruin it with soap!
Leather couch is great and if you’re under 6’0 tall and you snore - it makes a great bed:) Comfy bed & pillows!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location for a getaway to Astoria. The house is beautifully designed with everything you could need when away from home, and the views take your breath away.
Coffee in the morning and a cocktail in the evening on the deck overlooking Astoria and the water was a highlight of the trip!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let’s just start with the view….. wow!! It was breathtaking, every moment I spent awake at the apartment I spent looking out at that view!
Everything about our experience was amazing. Starting with the communication from Alan, we didn’t need any support because everything was so well communicated and labelled for us, but it was reassuring to know he was available if needed.
The apartment itself was stunning, it was so beautifully designed and laid out, everything was so carefully curated to make it not only practical and comfortable but also so stylish!
Lots of great places to eat in town we loved sitting on the rooftop of Fort George Brewery having the best pizza and craft beer then bring dessert back to enjoy the view!!
Ps I do t know what brand of bedding they use but it was soooo buttery soft 😍"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Alan's place! Spotless living space and peaceful, beautiful views, yet close enough to pop downtown for a bite to eat."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The captain’s cottage is an absolutely beautiful Airbnb, one of the best ones I’ve ever stayed in. The location and view was amazing. I highly recommend Alan as a host and this location to anyone."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just look at the picture. This is EXACTLY what you will see. Wonderful views with comfortable surroundings. We stayed in Astoria because of this place and would do it again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely adored my stay!!! Ohhh the views the million dollars views!!! I felt like an Eagle perched up on a tree watching huge ships boats and tugboats go by.
You really don’t need to go anywhere just stay and watch the views and you will be delighted(bonus)
The place is spotless and well designed and I felt at home the minute I stepped in.
Alan was kind and thoughtful with great communication.
PS: I’m partial to the mighty Columbia River I love this river as much as I love the Ocean
Thank you Alan"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and well maintained. We had one minor issue with the door lock and Alan took care of it right away. It was stocked with lots of amenities. The neighborhood is really quiet and within walking distance to some bars and restaurants. And the view is amazing. I’d definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Astoria.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Beautiful view. Giving 5 stars but just 2 thoughts - listing showed bbq but upon arrival, you have to ask for the bbq, which was just a little inconvenient and we decided to pass. Small thing. And on Sunday, my friend took the car into town and I wanted to spend a relaxing morning watching tv and taking a nap in the bedroom, however, there was a lot of noise with work being done in the garage under the bedroom and in the driveway. Things being pulled across the driveway and about 20 minutes of boxes being broken down under the window. Then a car being washed right under the window. It was warm so the window needed to be open. Even after closing the window, the noise was still enough to be less than peaceful. I live in a condo on a busy street and was looking for tranquility and quiet but this was a little less than that. Still giving 5 stars because I’m 100% certain it was on oversight. Everything else was perfection and I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Even better than the photos. The view was spectacular.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a dream stay. Looking at the harbor and river was divine. Quiet and peace we got from this stay were great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem of a property and location. The home is updated, modern and absolutely immaculate. The view to the mouth of the Columbia River is expansive with floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom itself is a joy with under floor heating, a rain shower head, beautiful tiling, and even a towel warmer! The home is close to old town Astoria with many attractions and restaurants nearby. We will definitely book another stay in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Alan's. Great views, modern décor and design, quiet location, very clean and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views were stunning. The property was easy to find and get into. The suite was available early and the host even messaged me to let us know we could arrive early if we liked. It has many little personal touches that shows thought went into this property. The photos on the walls were all views of Astoria, which I thought was neat since there’s some amazing views to see there. It was cozy and a perfect for a place to unwind and relax. And the bed was very comfy! I would highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily, one of the nicest AirBNB’s I’ve stayed in. The photos don’t do it justice. The daylight and views are incredible. I saw the host a few times and he was sweet and kind. The instructions were simple, concise and clear. The heated bathroom floor and towel warmers were so nice. We will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan was great to work with, friendly and accommodating. I will be staying again in the future. What a beautiful place with a great view.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Stunning views day and night with a cozy home base which was perfect for exploring Astoria. The bathroom was luxurious. The heated floors were such a treat. Really a lovely place to stay. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, bright, efficient. Unique view of the Columbia River and close to downtown Astoria. Great process and communication - will stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and view. Very clean and modern. Alan was a great host. Highly Recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend Alan’s place. The entire unit was impeccably clean and beautifully furnished and comfortable for our two night stay. I wish we had more time to relax and unwind there. The bathroom with its heated floor and towel heater was luxurious. The bed and linens were very comfortable and we slept very well since it was a quiet and relaxing house.The views of the Columbia River and all it’s activity were outstanding. Do not hesitate to book this place for your stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can’t describe how beautiful and relaxing the view is from Alan’s place.
We loved our visit to Astoria. Alan’s place was something we looked forward to after exploring the city. I’ll miss leisurely, low-key mornings sipping coffee from the comfy couch.
We slept like babies on the king bed and appreciated the crisp, clean white linens!
The heated floors in the bathroom were so luxe, and everything from the kitchen to the bathroom were well stocked.
Highly recommend Alan’s place and will definitely return!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an incredible stay at Alan’s! The views were spectacular and the place was immaculate. The heated floors and stone shower in the bathroom were a wonderful spa like touch. What a joy to wake up here. Do yourself a favor and stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"There are three outstanding things about this Airbnb: the host, the view, the cleanliness. Alan is very responsive, very friendly, and very invested in making your stay perfect. The views over the Columbia River are more amazing than even the pictures display! Every room and all appliances are extremely clean. I couldn't even find a crumb on a cupboard shelf. All three of these things made our stay ultra relaxing.
The Airbnb is situated on a hill so walking into town only half mile away could be challenging. The king size bed mattress is on the softer side, but for us allowed for a nice snuggled in feeling.
I can't express in words how wonderful is this place. I highly recommend
you stay here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this place! Everything was spot on. The views were fabulous...I could have sat in one of the chairs or couch all night long. The place is the perfect space for a couple or friends who don't mind sharing a very comfy bed. Everything was spotless and comfy. Amenities were great. Towels were clean and new, heated floors in the bathroom. WiFi worked great. The area felt safe and secluded. We only stayed the one night and the add on fees don't seem to make sense for that. However, spread out among a few days it wouldn't matter. These issues lie with Airbnb and not Alan. Just something I didn't think through, while I was clicking through the site confirming, maybe a tad too quickly. Still, it was such a fantastic weekend. Thank you for the great place, Alan!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning views in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood! Also the unit was super spacious, comfortable and felt like home. We especially appreciated the enormous windows surrounded by nature that looked out to 180 degree water views! And also loved that we were just a few minutes drive from restaurants and such a convenient place to stay for the Crab & Wine festival! We will be back for sure!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will enjoy your stay here. Beautiful views and an interesting watch on harbor activity. Alan has taken care to cover every amenity. Attention to detail is a plus. I would stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This amazing Airbnb is the kind of place you know you’ll come back to. The view was to die for. Everything was spotless, thoughtful, and clean."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is just a few minutes away from downtown and restaurants but away from noise and traffic. This is the perfect place for couples wanting to spend quiet time. You will not hear any noise at night. The view is unbelievable--make coffee or tea (available), sit down, and enjoy. Lastly, the review would not be complete without mentioning the bathroom amenities: heated floors and towels."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, cozy vibe, and a gorgeous area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay, exactly what we wanted from a trip to Astoria. Far enough to not be bothere by traffic noise/seal noise, but close enough that it was very central to everything you want to do in Astoria. And the VIEW was incredible! Truly an amazing spot, you will love it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would gladly stay here again. Alan’s attention to detail is evident in every aspect of this home. The bathroom is amazing, river rock shower, heated floors and a towel warmer, yes! Oh and the unobstructed view of the Columbia River is astounding. In the middle of Astoria, convenient to everything the town has to offer. Well done Alan, thanks again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Parking was a breeze and accessing the property was uneventful and smooth. The house was in a lovely neighborhood. We got lucky with the weather and enjoyed the crystal clear views of The Columbia River. We appreciated the comfy bed with an abundance of pillows. The heated floors in the bathroom were AMAZING. The gas fireplace was lovely! Everything was spotless clean and the kitchen had all the basics that you would need. We would love to stay here again! 10/10 = recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan’s place was the perfect first stay in Astoria. When I wasn’t being charmed by the town itself, I was relaxing and taking in the incredible views from the home. Comfortable and warm even in the coldest nights. Wifi great for remote work too"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan's place was beautifully decorated and had an amazing view. It was perfect for our quick getaway. We appreciated how new and modern it was. The bed was very comfortable and the heated towel rack and floors in the bathroom were an added bonus. The kitchen was nice, not set up for a lot of cooking but with all the great restaurants in Astoria there was no need to cook! It is located close to the breweries and shops, not really walkable unfortunately. But being up on the hillside afforded us the amazing view. We would recommend Alan's place to others."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was wonderful! Clean home, beautiful view and Jacob was very helpful with any questions I had."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous views. So quiet and comfortable. thanks for a great restful place to relax.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! It clearly is a new AIRBNB rental - the whole place is spotless. There are little notes all over the house about how to use the appliances. The towel warmer and heated floors in the bathroom were a piece of luxury! The telescope was fun to see all of the cargo ships go by. Our stay was on NYE, and the host left us a bottle of prosecco! :)
It's not incredibly walkable to anything, so look out for that. We went hoping to get away, but with town at a distance. Maybe 5 minute drive to all of the best in Astoria. Check in was easy, and the door code was custom to us as guests which felt extra secure.
We'd come back for sure. Beautiful little get away with some fun views!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing place to relax. Great views!!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an incredible gem right along the Columbia River. Astoria holds a wonderful small town feel with so much to offer for activities, and some super tasty food.
The apartment was perfect and I LOVE the heated floors in the bathroom.
If you want a spectacular view, this is the place to stay. I could watch the sunset, and also watch the storm coming in off the ocean.
I will definitely stay again and suggest this for any of my friends and family. 100% worth it!!"
