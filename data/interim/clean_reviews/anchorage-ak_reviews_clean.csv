The house was comfortable and well stocked-everything we needed and then some. We especially loved how much there was of everything-we didn’t have to worry about running out of towels or toilet paper or anything so we could spend our time exploring instead of making Wal Mart runs. :)
The house had a lot of fun and unique decor which we appreciated!

The bedroom was a good size, plenty of storage and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom had a nice shower with great water pressure. There were plenty of towels and space to spread out your toiletries. The kitchen had absolutely everything that I normally would want in my kitchen and then some extras. It is so nice that they had all the essential cooking tools. There is plenty of space easily for 2-3 adults since there is a couch also. There was even a small library of various reading material at your disposal. Definately plenty of TV streaming services to choose from. Biggest bonus, owners live right upstairs and are so gracious and helpful. Downtown Anchorage is 10-15 minutes where you can fund all kinds of great food. Anyone would be lucky to stay here."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have never been to Anchorage, this was our first time and Hennie & John’s guest house was a perfect find. It’s very cozy with everything you’ll need to prepare your own meals, or dine out at the many different restaurants close by. It’s centrally located, or at least for us it ended up that way. It’s close to beautiful parks and a lake. It’s also close to the airport. We stayed from New Years Eve 2021 and brought in the New Year surrounded by snow and beautiful mountains. One of the days we drove to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, it’s about 50 miles and a breathtaking drive. It’s hard to put into words the beauty that is Anchorage AK."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and feel at home. Hennie and John’s hospitality is unparalleled, providing everything from the basics to the unexpected. I had to sew a hole on my sweater and right there was a sewing kit!

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stephanie’s place is superb. Very comfortable convenient. Particularly for folks like my wife and I in town for some center downtown business. Super well maintained and outfitted. Unparalleled views! Great host communications. And the best lighting of any Airbnb I’ve stayed at. Neighborhood is a bit gritty and accessorized with street folk but did not feel unsafe ever. And with no car felt fine walking everywhere.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an excellent time! My partner and I would 100% stay here again. The hosts were lovely and even left delicious cookies and a letter that really added an extra layer of hospitality.

The living room is well laid out, and the kitchen is complete. The bathroom is functional and you are staying in one of the historic buildings in Anchorage!
I will stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much, Stephenie! Your condo was truly perfect for my short stay in Anchorage!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was excellent here in this lifted condo. The hosts had left a very helpful binder full of local joints to help us in our adventure. After a night out on the town, it was fabulous to come to a quiet, clean “home”.
The view in the morning was phenomenal to drink our coffee. It overlooked the open water and parts of downtown. Thank you to the hosts for sharing their space with us, our new home away from home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ok, so can Stephanie adopt us?!?!
This BnB looks exactly like the photos-- she made us COOKIES (that were DELICIOUS!) and wrote a personalized thank-you card for me & my boo that was waiting for us!
I had forgotten the code to the lockbox to close it, and a neighbor who was entering the building kindly stopped us from entering (and we were also kind and showed her the instructions and offered ID) which made me feel safe. She wasn't mad at us being BNB guests, and it was refreshing to just know that the neighbors were a safe and kind bunch.
The sleeping lady was literally right outside the window and there were so many walkable spots. The bedding and blankets and towels smelled fresh and amazing.
The building is an older building, but perfect. I didn't hear neighbors and honestly it felt even more cozy being a vintage building.
I ended up taking a bath and the water was SO clear and aqua blue!
100/100 I'd reccomend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was really a fantastic place and location for the price. We liked how clean it was and Stephenie made us some sweet treats! Parking was easy with the parking spot included. 5 stars all around!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephenie’s place is beautiful, but the view what the perfect cherry on top! She gave great instructions to her hidden gem, as well as local food/entertainment spots! Such a great stay, she had every necessity to cook & even had games for a fun date night! Absolutely would book her place again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at the Wolf Den! This Airbnb is perfect for a solo traveler or a couple and couldn’t be in a better location for visiting Anchorage. There were many food and drink options within walking distance (my favorite were 49th State and F St) as well as some shops. Having the parking spot ended up being a great perk and alleviated the stress of finding downtown parking.
The place itself was spotless and modern. I really enjoyed the view of the water right from the dining table.
Stephenie was communicative and replied quickly to all my questions. I highly recommend this Airbnb and would absolutely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely condo! This gem was a perfect date night getaway for my husband and I! We really loved getting to stay downtown for once (oh my gosh, the view 😍). It was very easy walking distance for dinner at our favorite Club Paris and a night cap at F Street. The space was immaculately clean with beautiful furnishings in pristine condition! We were very comfortable and found everything we could possibly need for our staycation. Stephenie was so friendly and helpful, we’ve already recommended this place for our friends coming to visit this summer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"You could tell this condo had recently been remodeled. Wow, it was beautiful. The bedroom had a comfortable queen bed, perfect for 2 people. The bathroom was sparkling clean. The living room had cushy couches and a tv. I loved that it was on the 3rd floor and you could open the blinds from top or bottom to let light in. We could see all the way to the inlet. It had all the amenities we needed for a night stay and we felt right at home. My daughter and I walked to 49th State Brewing for dinner right down the road and felt safe. It was delicious. Stephenie was a gracious host and gave us several different recommendations. What an amazing place for those who want to get a true north experience in downtown Anchorage. It’s located conveniently close to all the best the city has to offer. If we had been staying longer, the kitchen looked like it was stocked for everything you need to cook and a cute little desk that would be perfect to do work at. We will definitely book this place again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Burrow was all things lovely. It is close to the airport, and it is the lush forest side where you cannot hear planes unless you’re outside. The neighborhood trails were perfect for being able to walk my friends dog & let my son truly get his ya ya’s out As we were leaving, he was excited to see from inside the plane where we had walked to—trails near the road & a huge, clean dog park that is a bog & has a lake! We admired Jordan’s style inside, the unobtrusive framing on the TV, the soft afghans, beautiful kitchenware, and every choice of wood-framed art. It was perfect for our spring/summer stay with my elderly mother and young son."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had stayed in a place close to here and when the planes flew over they were loud and the house shook…at The Burrow you barely heard the noise and no shaking! What a GREAT relaxing productive stay❤️
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I was caught off guard in a pleasant way. The entire place has so much authentic detail in how it was designed. While I was only staying one night and didn't have much time to use many of the options available, I was still impressed by the level of creativity and beauty in this place. I recommend this place to anyone passing through."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gemma and Huey were great hosts. I stayed for a few days while on a work trip during which my work truck needed maintenance and I had to shuttle gear in and out of vehicles and the apartment. They were super accommodating and helpful. The space is quite large and eclectic, looks just as described. The bathtub was awesome, and they even let their cats visit (I am a huge cat person). The kitchenette is modest and best for heating things in the microwave and water as needed. Bed was comfortable. Good stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fantastic, very large, eclectic, and comfortable. It was certainly more than just a room to sleep in; it was a super fun place. The unique decor added so much character, making it a memorable experience. The space was impeccably clean and well-maintained, with all the amenities we could need. The host was incredibly accommodating and provided excellent recommendations for local attractions. The location was perfect, close to everything but still peaceful and quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a special and enjoyable place to stay"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Honestly one of my favorite airbnb stays! It has the perfect blend of comfort and unique charm.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow!! This Airbnb has so much personality and it was a fantastic, comfy, and fun stay!

I was looking for a local airbnb for my wife’s bday gift; somewhere close to just relax and get some great R&R… we both absolutely loved it! Most of our time was spent being super lazy in the movie room / theater. My bride LOVED everything about your place! Nightly soaks in the hot tub, the jetted tub, movies, chickens… most importantly was how great and hospitable they made us feel. This place has the vibe thats just right for relaxing! We will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,wonderful and Funky place to stay. Gemma had the kitchen and Apt fully stocked for all you could need on your stay.
2024-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"This rental is just like the photos! The hot tub was well maintained and inside was clean and had lots of personality. Check-in went smoothly, just like in the instructions. The basement feel was cozy but a little musty smelling, so we used a lot of Febreeze. The place is so many has cute, Alaskan things to look at, we enjoyed it all. The creaking of the ceiling/floorboards upstairs was quite annoying, and you can hear everything that goes on upstairs, so if you are looking for a quiet weekend getaway, this may not be what you are looking for. Lots of games and books and the movie room with the projector screen was a lot of fun!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very special Alaska Airbnb experience in Anchorage. Tons of local flavor, information and comforts. Highly recommended, they even have a movie room!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, private space that is perfect for solo traveler. Gemma and Huey were very responsive. The fresh eggs from the chicken were great!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gemma’s place is truly a place of style and fun. There are small pieces of instructions everywhere so you can easily find everything. The hot tub is superb and the morning quests for eggs are just rewarding. Would love to stay there again!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"We appreciated the early check in greatly as we arrived to Anchorage from Girdwood earlier than expected with weary eyes. The path to the back was icy and needed gravel and sanding, but they responded swiftly about where the gravel was for myself to apply as they were away.
Probably wouldn’t recommend this spot for older folks, hard to get the luggage down the path with solid footing but we managed. It was a beautifully creative artistic space, well designed for youthful and carefree travelers. If you require the v basics, it’s for you. The beds are fairly out of date and very sinking soft (I could suggest an update), but super clean new linens.
Unfortunately late night overhead foot traffic & chatter from 2am-5am left us sleepless BUT Gemma and Huey made it right with a full refund. We are thankful to them as our hosts & would recommend this for floaty young travelers who enjoy a unique funky hobbit hole to call their own for a weekend. Can’t beat the price for a hot tub included!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place me and my girlfriend loved it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely lovely space! Gemma and Huey were great hosts and have put together a thoughtfully curated Airbnb. Couldn’t recommend enough!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and spacious. The hot tub was perfect after a long day skiing. The AirBnb is only a short drive from downtown, the airport or the zoo. There was a coffee shop 2 minutes away (by car). And we loved the chickens! Would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay, very different, and hot tub was so relaxing!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was very unique and relaxing. Complete with curio shelves, an engaging and thoughtfully curated library, hot tub, jacuzzi, and a retro movie theater — I wanted to stay longer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Immediately felt right at home. It’s very cold outside, but was a lovely temperature right as you walked into the front door. It almost felt like a museum, there was so much to look at. Lots of brochures about Alaska, recommendations on where to eat. Gemma even messaged us before check in to let us know about the Fur Rondy happening in Anchorage that we didn’t know about! I would definitely stay there again. I saw a yurt in the back yard, it would be cool to stay there once it’s ready!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gemma's place was really neat. We loved looking at the chickens would""ve definitely fried some fresh eggs if we had the time. The bed is super comfy, and the movie room was really cool."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this place! Really enjoyed watching 90s movies in the theater room, hot tub, and a morning stroll in the snow. Hosts were very communicative and you can't beat all the details and cozy corner, books, and more. Reminds me of the amazing qualities of the first Airbnbs that have personal touches, original art, and authentic hosts that are available to help you enjoy the area. Highly recommend!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gemma’s home was BEAUTIFUL. It was our first stay on our Alaskan Road trip and it did NOT disappoint. There was such a homely feel to Gemma’s place. Facts and info about Alaskan was allll over the place and we LOVED it! It was incredibly easy to find, and so very spacious. The ONLY complaint I have, is we couldn’t stay longer 😭 Gemma was also so very thoughtfull and left up valentines decorations for us, on February 16th because it was as my birthday. So thoughtful and kind. 💜 1000/10 recommend Gemma’s place!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy place and so fun!! We loved the place and would definitely stay here again! The host was very responsive and friendly as well :)

Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Always love staying here!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gemma is a great host, and we will gladly stay with her again next time we are in Anchorage. The location is a wonderful retreat surrounded by woods while still being accessible to all in Anchorage. It was a great value and you can’t beat the hot tub! Gemma was an excellent communicator and helped us during our stay. 100% recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very unique & cute place, lots of entertaining literature and decor. Also very clean hot tub in great working order. I also appreciated the timeliness of Gemma’s response when I messaged her."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, clean, and welcoming. Love the whole setup and the hot tub was a nice treat after a day of playing in the snow! Gemma was very responsive and accommodating, thank you!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect winter couples getaway for us. We celebrated a birthday & relaxed. The location is right by everything! Groceries, Glaciers, Food, ETC. Only an hour away or so from most glaciers/state parks so we did a few of those while staying here which were BEAUTIFUL. They had birthday candles and matches which was perfect for our cake, and a ton of thoughtful little touches. There is so much to do and look at IN THE HOME that you don’t even need to leave lol. We watched Dumb and Dumber in the movie room and it was a fun experience. THE BED is probably the BEST airbnb bed we’ve ever had. Definitely something that stood out to us. We’d love to come back anytime we’re in AK."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Best anchorage BNB
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The forest floor apartment was a nice getaway from the valley. The hosts were very nice and very caring! Definitely recommend staying at the forest floor apartment!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,I couldn’t have dreamed up a cuter and cozier place to stay. Wonderful use of space and the outside area was even better than the photos. Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very fun place with quirky decor. Awesome hosts. Getting an egg and finding all the unique items around the place was great fun. We absolutely loved the theatre room!!! Watching old favorites with snacks in a cozy spot was wonderful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve been on airbnb for 7 years as a guest and this is the best place I’ve ever stayed. Gemma and Huey were extremely responsive leading up to and during my stay. Rented a car and felt the area was driveable while of course being cautious and careful. Drove to Matanuska Glacier and out to Girdwood from this place with no issues (only noting this bc coming to AK for the first time I was a little worried but it was FINE!!) Many restaurants within an extremy short drive. I bought bearspray to take with me everywhere but was also happy to see they provided a can for guests. This place was accurately described and had everything I needed. Loved this place, the location, and just everything about my stay, I slept so comfortably and felt at home the whole time. I hope its available when I come back to Anchorage one day!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved every second at this place. It was such a beautiful, aesthetic space. Gemma and Huey were so accommodating when I had to arrive earlier than expected. They were extremely thoughtful, too! They got the hot tub ready upon our arrival and offered to start a fire for us. The chickens were so cute and sweet, too. Everything was impeccable. I would love to stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place has such a charm and it feels so private. my favorite part was the projector and VCR but all of the other little quirks were so fun to look at. the hot tub in the cold was the icing on the cake! all in all, i would stay here again. it’d be everything you need to explore anchorage."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were locals just needing an affordable night away from the kids and Gemma and Huey's place was exactly what we were looking for. The clean, warm, and quirky interior made the night away both fun and restful. Great local recommendations too!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time here! We only got to stay for one day and night but would love to stay longer. There's so much to see and do in the house and yard (chickens, rocks and minerals, VHS projector theater room, walking trails, artifacts, books, hot tub) that you'll be just as excited to hang out at the air bnb as going out! Gemma was a great host and provided lots of helpful information in a booklet inside as well."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Gemma’s place was great for our family. The kids stayed in the movie room and watched vhs tapes which worked great for us. Good spot to return to after skiing hilltop and arctic valley.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Was just as described and Gemma was a great hostess

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I picked out Gemma’s Air bnb for my 20th birthday and I absolutely love it. The aesthetic and the things to do.

I would totally recommend the Air bnb and I will hopefully come back again! 😁"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for a weekend getaway! Tucked in a peaceful neighborhood close to all the action but with a private feel. The hot tub would've been great if we could've fit it into our schedule. Nice atmosphere, cozy bed, and awesome theatre room."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Loved the rocks and crystals… and the jacuzzi was a hit!
We would def stay again and would recommend to others ;)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although I never made it to Gemma’s location due to canceled and rescheduled flights and just a whole airport mess - Gemma was quick to respond at 9pm and got the space ready for me at the last minute. Knowing I had a place to stay at the drop of a dime was the only peace of mind I had that night. She is beyond friendly & understanding, and I will be making sure to actually make it there next time I am in anchorage!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I LOVE Gemma’s space. It is so charming, and felt as comfortable as home. Clean, well stocked, plenty of amenities, and easy to access. She was quick to answer all of my questions. I would definitely stay here again!"

The place was magical and so well decorated with tons of tiny details, we spent a lot of time looking around, admiring all the little touches in the space (pictures of the pet chickens, the rock collection, bookshelves). We loved the VHS collection too :)
The place was cozy and clean. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with all essentials needed for our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! A perfect place to relax between Alaskan adventures. Enjoyed the movie room, hot tub, and library. Also appreciate the availability of a washer/dryer. And can’t forget the chickens! Fresh eggs for breakfast was fantastic. Thank you Gemma!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Gemma and huey were very responsive and helpful ! This place is good if you want a quiet place near the airport
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the best AirBnb I have stayed at.
Cozy, thoughtful, quirky, and comfortable. I will be back next summer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gemma and Huey’s place was probably one of the coolest Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in! It was our 1 year anni and they made it really special by decorating it for us with flower petals and balloons. So sweet!
They also had a chicken coop in their back yard and welcomed guests to pet/feed them and take some eggs! We had those eggs for breakfast. It was a really cool experience. Our favorite chicken is called “Sexy” who loves chicken snacks haha.
Overall, Everything was thought out meticulously. Their movie theater, reading room, rock collection, decor… basically everything was super cool.
We only stayed 1 night and wish we stayed for longer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay. Everything about Gemma’s place was just as advertised. We loved the library and home theater. The chickens were very friendly. Though we didn’t collect eggs there was a basket for guests to do so. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet during our stay. We enjoyed our stay and would return in the future!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to start you Alaskan Adventure.. The place has everything you need (including organic eggs for breakfast 😀). Gemma and Huey have created a beautiful place which you won't wanna leave. Whether it's the books room with all the info about Alaska or the theater room with projector and lots of movies to choose from, it feels like you are in a studio. We had a really good time there.
Both Gemma and Huey are friendly hosts. They recommended several local activities and things to do (which was helpful because we didn't plan the trip much)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the the whole vibe of the place! Would definitely stay here again :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Very close to the airport! Very comfortable accommodation and Gemma is very helpful! Highly recommended!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, cozy, offbeat. We only stayed for one night but all the fun personal touches really made it stand out. My daughter loved the movie room and the chickens, and we got to introduce her to the dubious magic of VHS. All the books and Alaska history items were also cool, though I have to take exception to the decision to organize the books by color, though that's a personal preference. Quiet neighborhood, and if we had more time we would have loved to canoe the lake, but that leaves us something for next time!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place is absolutely beautiful, it looks even better in person. They have a selection of VHS movies and a small area you can watch it and makes you feel like in the 90s -00s.
The whole place has such a good vibe! let's not forget about the chickens as well and last but not least the place is so close to the airport and restaurants around. If you are in Anchorage, Gemma's place is a must stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot to rest for a night as it is so close to the airport. Comfy place with well placed signs to help make visit easy.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my favourite AirBnb I’ve ever stayed in! Every detail was so carefully decorated and it was so fun! My only regret is I wasn’t there longer to explore all Gemma’s recommendations.
Super close to the airport for an Uber. I enjoyed a hot tub while watching the chickens, then watched a movie in the movie room!
I hope I’ll be back :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this place!! All the little thoughtful details. Hot tub was pristine. Fluffy towels. Soft mattress. I would book again!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Gemma’s place! The space is amazing—cool decor and a cozy vibe. We loved the chickens and had fresh eggs for breakfast. The neighborhood is cute and was close to parks and other things in anchorage. We will stay again! Thank you!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute! Comfy and eclectic space. Chickens/eggs were such a cute touch. Movie screening room was cool too!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was my favorite Airbnb n b ever. Quaint and fun!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Forest floor! After days backpacking and camping in Alaska's outdoors it was wonderful to have a clean, dry, warm, and relaxing space to rest and recover. The hot tub was an added bonus to soothe our tired muscles! Everything was as described in the listing and we had no issues during our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very special place, tastefully filled with curiosities and art and books and a theater! Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Forest Floor space is the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in anywhere in Alaska!! The hosts are amazing and have thought of everything a person might need. The vibe is so completely chill, the decorations are so interesting, the amenities are first rate, and the location is so close to the airport but far enough to never let you know it. I would love for this space to be my “hidden gem” but it’s too darn cool to keep a secret. This is THE PLACE to stay in anchorage. Thank you both so much!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place. It was perfect for what we needed for our short stay. They even had bikes we could rent and a bike path close by to see the city. We loved the fresh eggs and hash browns in the morning and they even invited us to their BBQ on the 4th of July. I’m hoping that my son, who is studying geology, will visit Alaska and if so, I’ll be recommending this place to stay. So many great rocks and Alaskan history beautifully displayed. Oh and the bed was super comfy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed this place and highly recommend it to anyone staying in Anchorage! The hosts were very accommodating and we felt right at home!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place! So warm and comfortable. Bed was awesome, movie room was cool, and decor was so creative! Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Really cute place, you can see they have done a lot to make it nice. It’s was a pretty enjoyable stay, though I will say it’s very loud. There animals running around upstairs, and you can hear thorough conversations throughout the house. So it’s not a private as we hoped. They do let their cats down into the rental space, so if you are allergic this is not the place for you. Gemma was super friendly and their chickens are really cute☺️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the home! Wish we were there longer to enjoy more of the recommendations.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, spacious, and very unique. The hot tub was awesome and so was the projector screen. There were fun extra treats for us and unique personalizations. Really loved it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gemma’s place was perfect!!! Beautifully decorated and super homey. The hot tub was amazing!!!! Farm fresh eggs for breakfast was an added bonus for sure. Definitely would stay here again!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here. it was easy to get here from the airport and check in instructions were clear and easy. They had a cute welcome note for us and the place was decorated beautifully. We would stay here again and actually looked to see if it was available next month while we were in town but it was already booked. We would 100% book this next time we were in town
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"amazing find in a delightful and peaceful neighborhood!! what a fun & unique space. loved the eclecticness of everything! two things to note: as mentioned in the listing, you can hear conversations from the main house, but if you step into the bedroom- it's sound proof. also, to use the theatre room/ projector you will need to have a device with HDMI port (like a laptop).
great stay!! i hope i can return ❤️"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were pleasantly surprised with this stay. There was so much to see inside it was like being in a museum. The decorating and interior design was unique and interesting. Our favorite highlights were the swing chair, hot tub and chickens!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay at Gemma’s home. The space was beautifully curated with so much character. We would highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cool, fun decor in a beautiful location. A nice, peaceful place to stay while passing through Anchorage. I hope to be back soon!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! One of the comfiest and most unique Airbnbs we’ve stayed at. The fresh eggs were delicious!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great comfy spot, perfect base to visit Anchorage and region!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks for a great stay! Check-in and directions were super smooth, the space is well-decorated and cozy. The personalized note by the door was a great touch. I would happily stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely charming and cozy stay! Easy to book and access. The check-in was easy and welcoming. We especially enjoyed the movie projector and small theater feel. We didn’t see the chickens until the morning and they were so friendly and chatty. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you Gemma and Huey!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! It is so cozy and cute! There’s a library, cool minerals and crystals and lots of great information. We took a hike in the park behind the house and saw a moose! And we loved the chickens! They reminded us of home 💜💜💜. We were so glad we got to Anchorage early enough to enjoy the place before we flew home the next morning. Great place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Felt very cozy, unique, and cool. Definitely want to stay here again. You can tell Gemma put a lot of thought into making it a really special place."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and comfy place to stay... the jacuzzi was the best! Thank you.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Thanks for the hospitality and accommodation.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gemma and Huey’s place is a hidden gem! The vintage/maximalist interior has so many thoughtful touches and easter eggs. Speaking of eggs, they were great! And I loved being able to give my food scraps to the chickens and reduce landfill waste. PLEASE be kind to this historical space, it has such a lovely feel and the hosts are kind and open. Be sure to read the description about sound levels and water availability on site. None are an issue as long as you are prepared. They also had some wreckage from a deck collapse near the entrance so be aware of your surroundings. Anchorage got so much snow this year so it isn’t surprising. I’m sure they will have it fixed up once the snow melts! All and all, great stay, wonderful hosts."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"From start to finish, everything about Gemma's place blew me away. Firstly, the location was simply stunning. We were surrounded by beautiful landscapes and scenery, we spent hours walking around the area and taking in the breathtaking views.
The hosts were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I immediately felt right at home. They were always available to answer any questions and offer recommendations on things to do in the area. They truly went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.
And let's not forget about the hot tub! It was the perfect way to unwind after a long day of exploring. My significant other and I loved soaking in the hot tub under the stars.
This is an superb value for Alaska with hosts that truly care about the place. I hope to come back again soon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,I had a great stay! The place was conveniently located and exactly as described. Cristy was super responsive.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we are ever in Anchorage again, we would stay here again. We loved the location, the view from the cabin was gorgeous and we enjoyed how private it felt. The cabin was very cute and clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cabin. All the charm of a rustic cabin with the amenities of a newer construction (like a nice bathroom). Very soft and comfortable bed. Blackout curtains so we could sleep well in Alaskan summer. It's in an upscale neighborhood on the edge of town. One thing I didn't realize is that it shares a driveway with the owner's home - it's not out in the woods. Highly recommended!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Convenient and quiet, a lovely little place to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. Gorgeous yard, super quiet and lots of amazing wildlife."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the cabin. It felt very private and wasn't far from town. Rebecca gave clear and reasonable instructions for everything with check in, check out, and we had all we needed for our stay. We would love to stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place near the national forest trails. Very quiet and gorgeous view.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location is beautiful! On a clear day you can see the ocean from the upstairs bedroom. The cabin is in a quiet area while still being accessible to all Anchorage has to offer. It was a great middle ground for day trips to Whittier, Seward, Hope, and Palmer. It is about 25 minutes from downtown in our experience. The stairs are a bit steep so if you aren’t able bodied this may be challenging for you. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All in all an absolutely great stay. Hit all our key needs, and a few more. Price as with all Airbnb's I have experiencedwas a bit high, but it is to be expected otherwise no one would put their place up. Seriously great stay, and you can't beat the location and view. Thank you from our family's collective heart! Hat tip to the Hostess!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cabin with a view
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Loved staying here. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca’s place was pristine, cozy, and a perfect private getaway. The bedroom, upstairs room, and bathroom were very spacious. It felt like an authentic, and incredible, Alaskan experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca’s cabin was perfect for the two of us. Clean and peaceful. She was very responsive and friendly! Can’t wait for our next trip to Alaska!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, an amazing place to stay. It was absolutely gorgeous, no neighbors close by or any crowding, and just a spectacular view. There were a few things that we think would help others to know, though.
The water pressure for the shower is just awful. The heat is fine, but it's basically a trickle. You can still shower, but be ready to bundle up immediately afterward!
The size is cozier than we first thought. It ended up being great for a couple, but I can't imagine actually fitting 3-4 people in here unless you're all very close (2 on a bed, 1 on the couch, 1 on an inflatable mattress).
The stairs are incredibly steep due to the size of the cabin (not enough room to make them a gradual slope). I'd consider them more of a ladder than stairs. If you have mobility issues, it may be difficult to get up and downstairs (especially to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night).
Overall, a great stay. There was coffee, cooking supplies, and great heat. Honestly, an amazing place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet, amazing space, near a few great trailheads. Amazing host. Thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin was so perfect and cozy. It was also close enough to downtown Anchorage and many of restaurants, shops and so many parks to go hiking at. The highlight of our trip was seeing a huge moose in our driveway!!! We were blown away. The host was very nice and responsive. It was a great stay and highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot - beautiful, rustic and quiet and just what I was looking for!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin located in the hills of Anchorage. Great view from the loft window, overlooking the city!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"A great place to stay in Anchorage! This A-frame cabin is a guest house on the owner's hillside property, tucked away from the well-kept neighorhood roads in trees and foliage. Charming and comfortable; close enough to downtown to go ""out"" to dinner, but with a secluded, woodsy feel that made it relaxing to stay home and eat dinner on the porch, enjoying fresh seafood and watching the sunset. We saw a moose out and about in the neighborhood! The loft sleeping area was spacious and the bed was great, but note that the steps to it are widely spaced -- almost like climbing a ladder -- so it won't work for everybody. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place to stay in Anchorage. Will try to book here again if ever in the area!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was lovely! The cabin was extremely well-appointed, and went beyond my expectations for having everything we needed to cook meals, including quality appliances and cookware.
There were plenty of extra supplies available. Towels, bedding and bed were superbly clean and comfortable!
In fact, everything was clean and comfortable!
The stairs are not for the faint of heart...if you are elderly or have knee problems, you may want to consider sleeping downstairs on the futon or choosing a different location, but it worked just fine for us!
There were fans and heaters available for additional comfort and white noise at night.
The laundry machines worked well and detergent was even supplied.
I loved the fact there is no tv and we enjoyed perusing the vast collection of books and had some fun playing a little Trivial Pursuit as well ;-)
This was truly a darling little cabin in a nice, safe neighborhood! The view of the city and ocean from the upstairs window was delightful and we saw moose in the neighborhood on our way in...what a treat!
Thanks to our gracious, friendly, and helpful host, Rebecca! You won't regret staying here!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, well furnished and located in a quiet, suburban neighborhood in the woods. We had an exciting visit from a bull Moose that was great to see! Some infrastructure issues that I hope will be resolve soon: low water pressure in the shower, slow WiFi and noisy fridge."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and cozy place. Very comfortable, great views, and just minutes from multiple Chugach State Park trailheads. Has a very authentic log cabin feel while still being spotlessly clean and having all of the modern conveniences. We'll definitely be looking to stay here again on future trips to Anchorage."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome wood cabin. Cozy, comfortable and well stocked. Everything we need as home base for our Alaska adventure"

We were lucky enough to have 2 moose pay us a visit for a few hours! The cabin is a perfect home base for your Alaskan adventure. We browsed through some of the pamphlets in the cabin one day which gave us the idea to go on the Kenai Fjords cruise. So glad we did cause it was so beautiful. Rebecca was also very quick to respond to any questions we had. She always responded within 2-3 minutes! We will definitely be coming back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible stay at an incredible cabin in an incredible setting! Everything exactly as stated. Owner is quick to respond and offers any assistance needed.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"cutest and coziest cabin I've ever been in! Felt like we were in a gingerbread house. Rebecca was so accommodating and gave us suggestions of places to visit and things to do as it was our first time in Alaska. We were struggling with turning on the oven one evening, so she came over and helped us out. Definitely recommending this place for anyone who wants to stay in a quiet and private place that is surrounded by trees but within a 15 min drive of the downtown Anchorage. We even saw a moose in our driveway!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin made the perfect getaway for my husband's and my 10 year anniversary! It's a cozy retreat that has a beautiful view of the mountains and is close to many awesome trailheads. It's also far enough outside of Anchorage to give you that quiet feel yet close enough to be able to access any amenities in Anchorage easily. Rebecca, the host, gives you great advice and is super hospitable! We would highly recommend!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin very thoughtful set up amazing view/location. Bed was very comfortable, whole place clean and cozy would definitely stay here again wish I could have spent more than two nights here!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was absolutely more than accommodating. While we stayed at her log cabin we experienced an unexpected snow storm preventing us from being able to leave the premises. Rebecca went into town and delivered takeout!! Such a great hostess!
The cabin itself was cozy, comfortable, and clean. It allowed us to experience that traditional Alaskan feel we were searching for. We will be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing private location that felt like a treehouse and was much better than we even expected!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin is the perfect cozy spot for your stay in Anchorage. The cabin is tucked in the trees and has amazing views from the loft windows & the porch outside. There’s a washer & dryer, a ton of towels, dishes, shower soaps, large closet, fridge, pretty much everything you need!
It’s close to a ton of beautiful hikes, but also only 20ish minutes from downtown. We saw 2 moose just around the corner from the cabin! So keep an eye out.
We will definitely be coming back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca’s cabin was beautiful! We loved the location—the cabin was close enough to drive into town for any activities but far enough out to see wildlife. We got lucky and encountered a moose out front! This was the perfect place for us to stay for our visit to Anchorage, thank you!"

Having laundry on site to end our trip was perfect. We will love to stay back when returning to Anchorage."

Rebecca is a host that works with you, such a easy going process, I was given all the information I needed to enjoy my time in Alaska to the fullest. And the time there in the cabin was just wonderful, good energy surrounds you on the little comfortable hill. My time in Alaska was priceless. Thank you Rebecca!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great cabin. We had a wonderful time. Rebecca our host was awesome. Keep in mind that this is a loft space bedroom which was great for us but would be hard for folks with mobility issues. Highly recommended.

I highly recommend."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to Anchorage and want to enjoy a peaceful stay in a beautiful area, this is the BnB you want.

We loved our time here and cannot say enough great things about Rebecca and the cabin."

We used this as our jumping off point before heading south and it was perfect."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great. The host was super responsive and helpful.
The one and only issue that we had was the fridge. We needed to use it for our daughters formula and Everytime we opened it the whole place reeked. I’m assuming that someone used it for fishing or something but it was repulsive to open. If we didn’t open the fridge we otherwise had no issues. Would not have noticed it if we didn’t have a baby with us.Bathroom and bedroom were clean and accommodating."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing!

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic little cabin! It felt cozy and warm with the small “wood” stove in the corner of the room! Definitely will be staying there again!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy is the word. It's in the Hillside neighbourhood of Anchorage, which is where Anchorage-ites move when they make it big. The cabin has the promised excellent downhill (which are very hard to find in Anchorage), the photos really don't do it justice. There are also windows on all the other walls, looking out at the birch and evergreens around the cabin. It was dead quiet up there during our whole stay which was a pleasant surprise. Heat is controlled by a thermostat and the cabin was nice and toasty when we were there in late October."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"nice place, beautiful view. Fully furnished, clean and comfortable"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For anyone who can’t stand staying in a hotel or motel and wants to be a little off the beaten path where it is quiet with incredible views of the anchorage sound with the 14,000 foot mountains beyond and the smazing sunsets this is a place for you we loved the fact that we could hike right from her door less than a mile away. Aside from hiking it was an easy 10 minute ride to downtown Anchorage where there is good food and drink the biggest surprise that we had no idea which ended being a bucket moment, was visiting the anchorage zoo less than five minutes away from the cabin What made it so special iwas the exhibit with snow leopards. Although our paths did not cross I always felt secure that Rebecca would always be there if we needed anything so I am giving this place five stars plus"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful tidy cabin tucked in a nice residential area. Very private with beautiful surroundings. Quick access to everything and a very authentic cabin experience. Ladder to loft may be difficult for those with limited mobility but there is a hide-a-bed downstairs. Highly recommended.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rebecca is a wonderful host! We had more amenities than we ever expected (toiletries, hair dryer, books, games, etc). Her place is about 20-25 minutes from downtown Anchorage, so you can go into the city during the day and come back to peace and tranquillity in the evening. The deck has a great view and was perfect for coffee and a good book in the morning. I highly recommend her cabin!!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view really was spectacular and we watched the sun set over Anchorage and the bay both nights we were there. The cabin is upscale, with every convenience, and we found it clean and comfortable. The host provided a binder with the brochures of a huge number of trails in the vicinity to hike. A fantastic resource!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying at this cabin. It was clean, quiet, and convenient to hiking and downtown. We had excellent weather and made good use of the deck and enjoyed the views. A perfect home base for exploring greater Anchorage."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are planning a trip to Anchorage and will be doing your own adventuring or excursions, this is the place for you. The communication with Rebecca was outstanding and she offered lots of suggestions for things to do. The cabin itself was adorable and very well stocked with the basic necessities. We took day trips to Seward and Talkeetna and the cabin was perfectly located to make those trips super easy. The drive from the cabin to downtown Anchorage was very convenient as well. If we return to Anchorage I would book this cabin with Rebecca in a heartbeat."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay outside of downtown Anchorage, surrounded by the nature"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great cabin 20 mins from downtown. Warm, quiet, and homey with everything needed to enjoy a nice get-away. Stunning views from the cabin. Spacious deck. The ladder to the upstairs made going upstairs fun! Close to trails for hiking. Blackout curtains for the summer nights when it’s light out always. Host is fantastic and responds quickly. Lovely place overall."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca's cabin was a great place to stay. It has great views and lots of privacy. It's a great place to relax and I'd recommend it anyone looking to stay in Anchorage.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca is extremely responsive to messages. The place was very clean and in a good location. The bed was very comfortable, and she offers a lot of materials on great hikes in the area. We saw moose every night on our drive home in the neighborhood! I would definitely recommend this."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent place for my husband and I to stay. It's easy to get to, clean and was wonderful to have a whole cabin to ourselves. The laundry machine was also a nice bonus!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay
Amazing viewer"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming cabin is the perfect quiet getaway. The views are spectacular. We loved being close to all the activities and amenities we needed (restaurants downtown, a day at alyeska) and coming back to peace and quiet. Rebecca gave great directions to the cabin and easy instructions on how everything worked at the cabin. The bed is truly divine. I can’t recommend this cabin enough! We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rebecca is absolutely fantastic in her communication skills. We had some questions prior to booking and then again once we arrived. Within 10 minutes we received responses.
The log cabin is ideal for two people. The setting is fantastic-- very close to running/hiking trails. The setting is most peaceful. We really enjoyed our stay!
Blessings,
Tish/Mike"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very cozy cabin! Will come back!
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this cabin! It was right next to the owner’s main house, but still felt very private. It was an adorable space and was even decorated for the holidays! Such a sweet touch! It was also very close to a great hiking trail and about 20 mins to downtown. And had spectacular views of the city. It was beautiful!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is the perfect place to stay: 20 minutes or less from downtown, UAA, the waterfront, etc. Very accessible but also tucked away in nature and on the quiet, cozy side. Large bathroom and nice details (like the fireplace furnace) made this stay exceed already high expectations. Will be back!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for the outdoorsman, AWESOME host! Cozy cabin with great views of Cook Inlet!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a private little cabin to cozy up in or just as a home base to explore, we really enjoyed this place. Rebecca responds so fast with any needs. There's a little gas fireplace that will keep you warm and heats up the place nicely."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We ended our trip with a two-night stay at this private cabin because we knew it would be a great space. Our expectations were exceeded! It was a special treat to wake up to the Denali view on Friday morning, we weren't sure it would happen with the weather patterns that week. We were most impressed with the comfort of the bed and bedding. Perfect!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable cabin located outside the city area but within a 10-15 minute drive. We loved the isolated feel while being close to our planned activities. Rebecca is a wonderful host.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent two wonderful nights in Rebecca's cabin. It is a short drive from the airport and a short drive to many scenic trails such as the Flattop Mountain hike. The cabin was clean, cozy and very private."
2017-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking to disconnect from all of the hustle and bustle, this is definitely the place. It is very cozy and peaceful."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy cabin made in true Alaskan log cabin style.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin with great feel, great host. Very well maintained and located at correct location, little in the mountains and close to everything within 15 to 20mins driving distance."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca is an excellent hostess. She always responds to all inquiries and offers help. We felt she was reliable and open to any suggestions. The place is what is described and in pictures. It was clean with plenty of the necessities made available with the accommodations. We would book with her again.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect cabin. Secluded, beautiful views, has everything you could need and Rebecca is an amazing host. She's communicative, responsive, and welcoming. My husband and I loved our stay and would recommend our friends to stay here as well. Thanks Rebecca!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Beautiful cabin!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and private with fabulous views. The the rise between the ladder steps (to the bedroom loft with a comfy king bed) is higher than normal and the ladder is built so that going up or down, your back is quite close to the wall. This is fine if you're short (I'm 5'3"") but my significant other is 6'4"" and it was a bit tricky for him. The bathroom is very spacious and the cabin is well-stocked. We didn't meet Rebecca but via email and text she gave excellent directions to the cabin and was very accommodating."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in a very nice cabin. Super host. Really enjoyed the stay and would highly recommend.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's cabin was our dream cabin. VERY CLEAN, very authentic, not in a central location which is a great! It suited the purpose of our vacation, which is to be at peace. There are great walking distance hiking trails. Also, the views from the cabin are great. We would definitely be back!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rebecca is a truly dynamite AirBNB host, and her cabin is the perfect cozy, comfortable home base for an Alaskan adventure. We loved our stay there, and cannot recommend it highly enough for anyone who wants a charming, centrally located cabin to call home after a day of road tripping around beautiful Alaska."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Only 20 minutes from the airport. Small, cozy, and quiet place. Rebecca goes out of her way to make sure you feel safe and comfortable."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this cabin in March. Beautiful cabin with all the amenities you could need. Good location. Away from the city so you have some spectacular views, but close enough to quickly get to downtown Anchorage. We are already planning our next trip!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! The cabin is the perfect get away if you are in or around Anchorage. You can't go wrong staying here.
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was a great host. She helped out with a few queries early on and was friendly and informative. The cabin was very comfortable and warm, with everything we needed. It is worth noting that there is no Wi-Fi however mobile reception is good and you may want to escape from the internet anyway! The location is excellent - easy to drive into town, simple to find and close to the national park if you fancy some walks. A really enjoyable stay."
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was amazing, we really loved our stay there. It's clean, nice and cozy. We didn't want to leave, it was simply amazing... can't wait to go back. Thanks for everything."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and clean. It felt like we were in a ""home away from home"" and the view was FANTASTIC."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca was not kidding, the view of Susitna across the inlet is fantastic! While not close to commercial centers, the cozy cabin worked well for the rest and relaxation we needed."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a very well-equipped cabin with full kitchen, laundry, shower, nice flushing toilet. A super cool fireplace connected to temperature control panel. The second floor is bedroom which is compact but cozy. King sized bed is great. No WiFi but signal is good for ATT users."
2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about this cabin! At arrival, my girlfriend and I were promptly welcomed and shown to the cabin. From then, we had the luxury of privacy for the whole stay. You probably won't see Rebecca unless you unlikely need her. The cabin is quiet, stocked with a gas heating stove (works very well to keep it cozy), a full bathroom (bigger in person), washer and dryer, upstairs loft, and more.. We had a wonderful time and Rebecca's service was outstanding. We made our breakfast every morning with the provided stove and mini-fridge (bring your own groceries) and watched the city-view through the window. At night, we drove downtown (10-15 minutes) for dinner and entertainment. I can hardly complain about anything. Any concerns or problems were resolved in a professional and timely manner.. Great place. I'd recommend to any couple or single travelers."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin in the wood is simply amazing. We had a wonderful two night stay in this cozy home in the nature. The bed is huge and incredibly comfortable and the bedroom windows have beautiful views. It's a great place for romantic getaway or family vacation. Highly recommend!
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's cabin is such a wonderful retreat and home base for your Alaskan trip! :-) The proximity to the airport, grocery stores, etc is perfect for a hassle free stay! Yet, the woods, hiking trails and location of the cabin make you feel like you are away from it all! The views of the sunset are outstanding!

I highly recommend this wonderful cabin, and hope to come back again!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying in Rebecca's cabin! It was removed enough from the city to have some quiet and relaxation, but close enough to anything we needed. We were there a week while visiting family and touring the area, and this cabin was a fantastic and cozy home base. It was clean, with warm decor. Perfect for a couple. The cabin is situated on property next to a house, so not completely remote, but it feels like it when you're in the cabin! We had plenty of privacy, and Rebecca was an excellent and responsive host. We'd love to come back for another stay."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. It was super easy to find and very convenient and comfortable. Would stay there again. Thank you!!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My parents loved the cabin and its history. Rebecca, you should type it up and put it in the cabin with the guest book. Fascinating history that adds to the experience."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was very accommodating and had the place perfect for our arrival. The cabin was in a quiet area and exactly what we were looking for, we had a great experience here!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was immaculate with many cozy and thoughtful touches. The location is quiet but accessible to downtown. Beautiful views of cook inlet. We hope to stay there again! Rebecca is a sweetie!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cabin and a good example of Alaskan log home building. Quiet and off the beaten path. Good view across the peninsula from this hillside. Great host !
2016-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and enjoyed the quiet space. We loved the Fresh sheets and dark blinds. Bed was really comfortable. Beats the usual anchorage note hands down. Older people take note that the ladder to the loft is a little difficult to navigate. Also, this cabin is adjacent to a residence and in a neighborhood rather than isolated in the mountains. That said, we didn't see a single person while we were there. There is a fun covered porch in the front that has a nice view of Anchorage."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is truly a home away from home. My plane landed at 11:30pm after 24 hours of travel and when I arrived at “Unit C - The Polar Night”, I felt instantly at home. Every little detail has been thought of and is beautifully appointed. The apartment was recently remodelled so everything is brand-new, clean, perfectly placed. The bed was super comfortable! Location is fantastic for what I was after and I understand it’s close to all the major hospitals as well. Quiet neighbourhood, never heard any of the people in other units. Shared laundry downstairs was a very welcome convenience for me. Cute little veranda where you can see the mountains and have a wine, I felt very safe here as a solo woman traveller. Ample parking and lots of brochures and tourist information downstairs. Kayla is a very responsive host and very helpful, welcoming and caring even before I arrives. Highly recommend!! Thank you for the most wonderful stay 🎉"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"OVER THE TOP is how I describe our stay at Bridget and John's Portside Hideaway in Anchorage. What a perfect place to stay. Full kitchen with snacks and breakfast. It was just fantastic. The bed was amazing I want one. It was clean and privately located but close to everything. The backyard had a fireplace and wood but it was crummy weather so we didn't get to use the fire. There was a four person outdoor set to relax and watch the people on the trail below us. Real Flowers everywhere. Just beautiful! We were having trouble with cable so they came over and we visited with them for a while and could have talked to them forever. The cable company was having the problems. And the next day she brought me flowers for the inconvience. Didn't want to leave there. So much to do in Anchorage. We love Alaska and we love Portside Hideaway, We will be back... Thank you Bridget and John"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can not go wrong with The Downtown Portside Hideaway Cottage. The cottage is clean, quiet and perfectly located. We will definitely be back!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so fantastic, perfect location and chock full of amenities so you can really feel at home even for cooking a full meal"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is better than expected. I was especially struck by the generosity of the hosts. They provided coffee, creamers, drinks, breakfast items, spices, and’s much more. Even the bathroom was stocked with many items. It would be too many to mention but we can say we lacked nothing.
The king size bed was so comfortable and the shower was great. The WiFi was strong. It really did feel like home. The hosts gave us privacy but communicated with us to make sure all was well. It was! We didn’t want to leave."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very close to the center, which made it very easy to go for a walk.
It also has very easy access to main roads and about 800mts from the train station which for us was very useful.
The house has everything it describes, very comfortable and welcoming.
It has a lot of information and maps of the area that give you a lot of idea of what to do.
Bridget was always available to us."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay! As I have need to visit Anchorage multiple times each year, I’ll definitely return whenever Bridget’s place is available."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a hidden gem! This was my second time booking this location! I always check to see if it’s available when traveling to Anchorage. The views are spectacular and the walkability to all the best downtown restaurants is super easy! Perfect for a single traveler or small family getaway. Bridget always has the fridge stocked and lots of treats for your stay. Will definitely book in the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a amazing stay because its in downtown but very hidden away from the rift raff in downtown. So trully it was a excellent hideaway. Also the view from the living room because able to see the water was amazing. I definitely would make this my first choice whem i come back to Anchorage.
Very well decorated, all the comforts of home and alot of personal touches such as drinks and snacks in the fridge and freezer and just a warmth to the place that made you feel right at home. Even the fireplace was really nice also."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just incredible! Even more beautiful in person. Location was great and we definitely felt secluded and safe. Walking distance to lots of food options. The home is beyond comfortable with impeccable décor. We got hit with a little snow and it was just so beautiful watching the snowfall from the living room. Kitchen was stocked with lots of items we were able to make a little home cooked meal. You will not be disappointed with this place. A true gem. Thank you Bridget and Eric!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Portside Hideaway is a top tier airbnb stay. The location was perfectly suited to accommodate our wants for convenience while remaining private and quiet. Gorgeous views of the inlet and Mount Susitna included. Bridget and Eric’s thoughtful curation of decor is bright, clean, and inviting, meanwhile creating a cozy and comfortable environment. These are A+ hosts. They seem to have anticipated any need a guest may have and stocked the house thoroughly. From bicycles with helmets to barbasol and beyond."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is in an exceptional location. All of downtown is within very close walking distance, the coastal trail is just outside the door, and the train station is also very close. For those looking to do anchorage without a car (like we were), we were able to use Bridget’s place for our whole stay in Anchorage, getting around by foot, bike, train, and bus. Aside from the location, the actual house is perfect. Clean, beautifully decorated, quiet, and fully stocked with everything you need for lounging, cooking, etc. This was one of the best bnbs I’ve stayed at."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in a few Air bnbs in Anchorage and this was by far the best. Excellent location - easy walk to restaurants. Tucked away off the beaten path but yet close to everything. Super fun view- Alaska Railroad, Cook Inlet boat traffic, and we even had a clear view of Denali way off in the distance! Bridget’s place had everything you would need. Best stocked bnb I have ever experienced. And the bed was super comfortable too. This will definitely be my first choice for future stays in Anchorage!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget’s place was lovely! Well appointed, spotless with a very nice selection of snacks left. While I was visiting an issue requiring Bridget’s attention arose. Within 15 minutes of my call Bridget was on-site and resolved the problem. I’m very impressed with Bridget and her BnB. I will return when business requires stays in Anchorage."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget was an excellent host and her property was a lovely, peaceful, cozy place to stay for a couple of days in Anchorage in February. It was warm and dry, with plenty of extra blankets. The king sized mattress was comfortable and the couch was soft and cozy. Bridget also generously left the place stocked with some snacks, frozen food items in the freezer, drinks in the fridge, coffee, and tea. The view from the living room looks out over the Knik Arm of the Inlet and the distant mountains to the north. Meanwhile downtown Anchorage is just a short walk away, as is the Alaska Rail train station. I would not hesitate to stay here again on future visits."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget was the hostest with the mostest. The supplies she provided made it so easy for us, as so many things we didn't need to buy. It was like being at home - but better as you didn't have to do the shopping! The location was great as quite but close to town which for people without a car was great."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget was a terrific host. The house was private but close to downtown, and I could walk everywhere, even in the snow. The house was absolutely beautiful, well-maintained, and charming. I will stay there if possible when next I am in Anchorage."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay! Right on the edge of downtown with accessible walking to many cafes and restaurants, and a block away from the start of the coastal trail, which is great for running, walking, biking, or XC skiing. Very clean and tidy and Bridget was very responsive to any needs!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little place tucked away from the hustle and bustle of down town Anchorage. Everything down town was in walking distance, but we felt far more secluded and cozy when we wanted to be!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while in town for a conference and loved it! Conveniently located downtown, but it’s tucked away and feels more private. Great view and I enjoyed watching the trains. The cottage is very nice and just as described with everything you need. Check-in was easy, and Bridget was very helpful. She even brushed the snow off my car after a snowstorm. Highly recommended, and I look forward to staying here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Very clean and super comfortable with everything you need and more. We will definitely stay here again if we get the chance. Lots of food and snacks to get you started. She has thought of everything.
10 big stars!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. We will be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just phenomenal. Of you’re going to base in anchorage we can’t imagine a better spot. Walking distance to virtually everything downtown, coastal trail, etc - but also super private and quiet you’d never know this was there. Exceptional hosts!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage had everything we needed and everything we expected based on the listing. We really enjoyed the bikes! Bridget was also very friendly and accommodating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! It is right downtown and has a very peaceful vibe with a view of the water and a wonderful yard. An 11 mile paved bike trail is right behind the house. We loved that Bridget provided bikes and helmets and saw 4 moose on our ride -- a highlight of our trip. The house is also within walking distance of the train station. Even though the tracks run behind the house, we couldn't hear the train inside and it never disrupted our sleep.
Bridget was a wonderful host. She provided lots of goodies for breakfast and other cooking supplies. She also leant us one of her cans of bear spray to take with us up to Denali. Fortunately, we didn't need to use it and brought it back for others. Hope to return someday!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget's place made our trip to Anchorage....the cottage was so cute and cozy with fantastic views...we enjoyed the outdoor firepit, used the bikes for the coastal trail...walked to Fire Island for coffee and scones. But best of all was that there was everything and more provided right in the cottage: guide books and tourist info, grab and go snacks and even ear plugs/eye shades in case you had to hit the hay before the sunset at 1030PM or you did not enjoy hearing the trains. We hope Bridget's place is available for our next trip to Anchorage. It is really a special cottage to come home to...we were sad leave."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super friendly host with flexible check in opportunities. I really appreciated all of the amenities that the host provided, including things even like shaving cream and breakfast items in the kitchen which other hosts never provide. It was a great property with a great view outside. The host was so communicative all the time. I loved it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting and view of the port and Alaska Railroad. Great amenities and on the coastal trail. Just as listed.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice welcome and great instructions. Snacks greeted us upon our arrival. Nothing but great things to stay. Very walkable to downtown Anchorage.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location downtown. Quiet, peaceful location close to all amenities and restaurants"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place is too notch ! It’s gorgeous, cute and quaint, the pictures don’t do it justice. Comfy large king bed, and very spacious.
It has everything you can think of, snacks (free of charge ), condiments , bug spray, toiletries , etc pretty much anything you might have forgotten, I have never such a stocked air bnb !
Location is perfect, it’s right on the water with cute backyard , but also at same time only two blocks from the Main Street and restaurants , we walked everywhere.
And finally, the owner is super helpful and proactive, check in and out was so smooth, it was really wonderful stay.
This is by far the best air b nb I have stayed at, don’t hesitate to book!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is located within waking distance to downtown and the RR depot. The view is very nice. The house is very well stocked. We enjoyed our time there and would stay again if back in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We got in very late and to our surprise, Bridget had a nice bottle of wine with a personal note waiting for us on the dinette table. The fridge was well stocked and everything was as we expected. A great location for walking around Anchorage. Many great restaurants within a 20 minute walk. We were there a week and didn't rent a car. Walked or used Uber. Will definitely stay there again when visiting Anchorage, highly recommend to anyone visiting Anchorage. The Alaskan Railroad Depot is only a 10 minute walk with connections to Whittier, Seward, Denali and other locations in Alaska. There were also 2 nice bikes available to use. Would give 7 stars if I could."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best air b&b places we’ve stayed in. The location is fantastic—views of the inlet, train, coastal trail AND a short walk to downtown. We got in late and there were so many snacks provided (and a nicely stocked fridge/freezer), it was much appreciated. Bridget was only a message away and replied quickly. We’d definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in 4 different places while in Alaska and this was our favorite spot hands down. Beautifully eclectic, amazing views, comfortable furniture, extremely well stocked kitchen, washer and dryer - and so very walkable to just about anything in Anchorage. It overlooks the rail yard and the first night we heard trains but after that, we didn't hear than anymore. She was kind enough to put out earplugs though, which we didn't have to use! The water views are wonderful and you can even see the Denali Summit on a clear day, which we had each day! I would definitely stay at this location again when I am fortunate enough to return to Anchorage!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is a perfect place to stay for your trip to Anchorage. The location is in downtown but it feels so tucked away and private. We could easily walk to so many restaurants. Bridget’s cottage was so well stocked I felt like I was staying at a friends house. She has thought of everything! One day during our stay the weather was so clear we could see Denali from the living room. ! I absolutely recommend staying here for anyone’s trip! Beautiful, clean and felt right at home"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location with the beautiful coastal trail and amenities within walking distance. Extremely clean and well-equipped unit. The extra snacks and beverages were much appreciated. Bridget was very responsive, caring, and kind in our communications. Highly recommend for an Anchorage stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was a wonderful space to spend several days. It was easily accessible to downtown and yet was very private. The cottage itself was beautifully decorated and was immaculate. They were plenty of additional goodies and supplies to use when we needed to including two bicycles, which, unfortunately, we did not get to use because of the weather. I would highly recommend Bridget and Eric‘s place to any family and friends that will be visiting Anchorage!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the most incredible AirBnB we’ve ever stayed in ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️! The easy walk to all things downtown and restaurants was incredible, we loved using the bikes for the Tony Knowles coastal trail, the bed was super comfortable- we slept like bears😆. The cottage had every amenity we could possibly need or ask for and all very well decorated. Bridget was very friendly, generous and responsive in our communication from booking through departure.
There is no other place to stay for a couple in Anchorage other than this cottage!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just can't think of anything more Bridget and Eric could do to make this a better spot! Comfortable, clean, everything you could need. steps from the coastal trail. Excellent accommodations!, great communication, better than advertised!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very happy to have booked Bridget’s place pleasant house with big lawn and harbor view. Location is excellent and walkable to downtown. Friends who had booked a hotel were very envious. We didn’t have a car and larger grocery store is .6 mi walk. House is right next to the coastal trail which is superb.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. Little tricky to find depending on GPS used, but she was super helpful and quick to reply when I messaged her. Conveniently located to many different locales, I can't stress how great of a value it was. A great supply of snacks, drinks, super comfy bed, everything was perfect."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Downtown Portside Hideaway is an awesome Airbnb with many amenities, and it's an easy walk to downtown shops, restaurants, and breweries. The home was spotless, warm, and inviting, and Bridget's attention to detail exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed a quiet evening sitting in the backyard and taking in the water and mountain views. When we make it back to Anchorage we will definitely want to stay at the Downtown Portside Hideaway again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cottage that is just steps away from downtown Anchorage and the Coastal Trail but which is very quiet and completely private. The cottage is very homey and comfortable with tons of amenities and extra touches that you generally don’t find in Airbnbs. Washer and dryer are very fast, you can wash and dry a load of clothes in just an hour. Also Bridget was amazingly responsive, offering lots of tips tips for restaurants and things to do. Just a wonderful place to spend a few days while in Anchorage."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This location is extremely ideal. Walking distance to so many restaurants and the Coastal Trail. The cottage has everything you need. Even though it is so close to downtown it still feels private. It also has a really great view of the water. I highly recommend this place it is perfect.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Anchorage. Felt secluded but close enough to walk to downtown. Beautiful walkable trail nearby. House was cozy, laundry was nice to have. Host was responsive and friendly. Definitely recommend for anyone staying in Anchorage!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely place, close to downtown Anchorage. It was well-kept. I would definitely return there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bridget did a great job making this a wonderfully comfortable place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly peaceful stay at an amazingly convenient location, and an incredible host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. It’s downtown but is somewhat secluded from city. Right by bike path. Fantastic walkable location— close to restaurants and museums. We enjoyed our stay. Bridget is a great host. She provided some snacks and beverages that made our stay more enjoyable. The house was very comfortable and clean. We highly recommend her place—especially if you want to have easy access to downtown Anchorage.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful gem of a place to find in downtown Anchorage! Perfect location for walking to the best restaurants and so much more. Quietly located on the waterfront. Beautifully designed place! Lots of amenities provided! Very helpful, kind, and responsive host! Hope it’s available for my next visit! Thank you, Bridget!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What can I say other than this place is really a GEM 💎
It has to be one of my top 3 favorite Airbnbs. The train in the distance doing the slow Cha Cha of going back and forth to change tracks is a treat for us train lovers. The place was so perfect, I didn’t want to leave! There were snacks throughout the house and the fireplace was heavenly for relaxing after a long day.
I highly recommend staying here and will definitely have my friends and family stay here when they visit in June."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Somehow this place is in the middle of nowhere and also directly downtown! Very peaceful but also convenient to everything you want to do. The interior design is the best I have seen in an AirBnB and is stocked with everything you would need. Great responsive host. Would live to return!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Anchorage and this place was perfectly situated right in downtown while still feeling very private. I have NEVER stayed in an Airbnb with SO many amenities — Bridget really thought of everything. From a stocked fridge with snacks and drinks, hairspray to bug spray, and even slippers for my husband and I. We would easily stay here again if we visited next time. Beautiful place, easy to get to, responsive host. Thank you!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect, magical hideaway … all the 5 star reviews are on point … Maybe the best bnb ever (for me) …close, just blocks from downtown but you feel as if you are on a tropical island … hard to put into words how special this home is … I didn’t want to go anywhere just wanted to soak up the extraordinary views. I give the portside hideaway my strongest and highest recommendation. You won’t need to go to the grocery store the place is stocked with goodies and extras. A truly spiritual experience. Enjoy!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in Anchorage. Even being downtown you still feel you are away from town. Easy walk to great restaurants and shopping.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was one of the best AirBnbs we have ever stayed at! We came in the winter time for the Iditarod, and it was so cozy and comfortable. The decor is cute and welcoming. The king sized bed was very comfortable. It was super easy to walk to the downtown events and restaurants! It was definitely the most well-stocked place we have stayed. We were greeted with a bottle of wine, beer and other drinks in the fridge, fresh coffee beans and a grinder, and lots of yummy snacks and breakfast items. Bridget was very responsive when we had a question. And, as far as value, added over the week we stayed, this BnB saved us a huge chunk of money over the hotels we considered. We definitely want to come back in the summer time and stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is absolutely amazing inside and out. The little personal touches, to the twinkle lights, to the maintenance team checking to see the deck wasn’t slick, to the huge amount of snacks and drinks they had available, we felt this was nothing short of a welcoming stay. You could get anywhere in town in a 15 minute walk, even with all the snow slowing us down. It was quiet and the view of the bay was gorgeous. It is 100% worth the price and I can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful time and felt right at home and this cozy cottage. Everything was provided for us so we didn’t have to worry about needing items to cook with. There were still many items left over from previous days so we didn’t have to order extra things like cooking oil, spices, coffee, tea, water, etc. it was all provided. Would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay all around! We will be booking this place again. Bridgette was very kind and made our stay a pleasant experience.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Arguably the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Super easy to get to from the airport. I didn’t have a car while I was there but I was so close to town that I didn’t need one while I was there. Even though you’re downtown you still feel like you’re miles into the wilderness which is a big plus. Bridget was always responsive and happy to give local recommendations and I cannot wait to come back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I can't say enough good things about this cottage and the host! I had a two week work trip to Anchorage in December and wanted a quiet place where I could work, prepare my own meals, and rest. For all those things, this place was perfect. Additionally, it has great access to downtown restaurants and venues. But when you're ready to wind down, it still feels private.
While I was there, Anchorage had three major snowstorms and overall about 5 feet of snow fell. The hosts were great to reach out and check to see that snow removal had occurred (it had) and that I was alright.
Additionally, during my stay the local internet provider had some equipment malfunction. Since the hosts knew that I was there for work, they went out of their way to make sure the problem got resolved in a timely manner. Super helpful and responsive!
This cottage will be my first choice for my next trip to Anchorage!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely awesome guest house! We are locals and have stayed in many listings around anchorage. This one is really an awesome find! The location is fantastic for exploring downtown on foot or bike. The bed is extremely comfortable and the view is hard to beat. Everything you need is already in the house. We would stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks for providing this to guests!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect quiet home with backyard fire pit that is the best place to watch trains and ships go by.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget and Eric's place is an 11 out of 10. Everything about their place is perfect, from the location that's downtown but still quiet and private, to the small touches inside the home and out, this is one of the best AirBnB experiences I've ever had! It's a perfect place for a couples getaway and it just has it all! What a great experience and even better hosts!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location next to the rail trail and downtown restaurants and breweries. Fantastic view of the bay and port. I have never been to a better equipped house with bicycles and helmets to packs and bear spray if you are going for a hike. There were snacks and drinks in the fridge. Everything you would need to cook also. Super comfortable bed and great bathroom with soaps shampoo and lotion. It also had a nice back yard with deck and fire pit.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this little house so much! Spacious for two, the best-stocked airbnb we've been in, with everything from bear spray to hair spray, with knives that are actually sharp and nonstick pans that actually don't stick! The kitchen is actually wonderfully useable, having bikes and laundry is so great, and the outdoor spaces are great. Bridget was so helpful with recommendations and extra things. Bed is so cozy, loved watching the trains and boats come and go. Quiet and peaceful. Right above the start of the coastal trail and an easy walk to everything downtown. This house is that rare combination of a well put-together rental that feels livable. We hope to be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful spot !!! Had everything you could want
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The location is awesome, very clean and the host were very prompt with communications! Appreciated all the hospitable touches, I feel like the host went above and beyond! We will be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful rental in a fantastic location. Despite being just 1 block from the main downtown, it feels like you are staying in a cabin away from everything. Do yourself a favor and use the included bikes, access to the amazing coastal trail is just 1 block away. Probably saw ~ 25 moose on our 20 mi bike ride. Possibly the most comfortable bed I've experienced at a rental or hotel. Bridget was easy to communicate with and provided some nice recommendations. The included snacks and bottle of wine were a nice surprise. If you plan to spend any portion of your trip in Anchorage, you wont be disappointed staying here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Bridget’s place. It’s super clean and you will find everything that you need there. It’s also within the walking distance to many restaurants. We had a great time and we will stay here again if we come back to Anchorage.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best Air BnB that I’ve ever stayed at. Just incredible in every way. Perfectly located along the coastal trail, which we greatly enjoyed with the bikes at the cottage. Just a short walk away from many restaurants. I didn’t want to leave the cottage to explore Anchorage because the cottage is such a delightful place in itself, beautifully decorated and containing all creature comforts one could imagine. Bridget and Eric were incredibly thoughtful and kind hosts who seem to truly enjoy hosting and creating a positive experience for their guests."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gem of a place and the hosts are just as rare. Eric and Bridget have offered up one of the most thoughtful stays tucked away in downtown Anchorage. We rode the bikes and sipped wine by the fire pit - great way to spend a summer evening. Definitely recommended.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is the house I’ll recommend to friends when staying in Anchorage.
It has everything: a fantastic location, chill relaxing view, right on a good running path, cute interior, comfortable furnishings, bikes, and a good selection of pantry essentials.
The internet was reliable and fast too."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, of the many Airbnbs we’ve stayed at around the world, this one may be our favorite. It is cozy and very private, yet impeccably well located. It’s a two minute walk to the start of the Coastal Trail. It’s a five minute (or less) walk to great eateries including 49th State Brewing and Glacier Brewhouse, both of which had some of the best food we ate all weekend.
The hosts are fantastic. They provided extra pillows to ensure we’d be comfortable and accommodated a late checkout for no extra charge. Plus, the cottage itself is very well equipped with snacks, chilled drinks, a fully usable kitchen, laundry, bikes—really everything you could possibly want while staying in a home away from home. I am super impressed with this host and cottage and would gladly stay again and recommend the place to friends. We had a great stay and were very comfortable here."

Every convenience item you can possibly think of. Very helpful host. It just seems to be my luck that the greatest Airbnbs we find are the ones we have the least amount of time in, but it was definitely a great find and a place I'd love to come back to for a longer stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy cottage. Walking distance to restaurants and shops. Bridget was a great communicator also which was so helpful. We had everything we needed

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a few days at the end of our 2 week AK vacation in Anchorage at this lovely Airbnb! This place has an incredible location, truly hidden away from the city but also right in the center of it (hard to believe until you see it!) It was so comfortable (especially comfortable bed!) and had so many amenities! We loved having the bikes to go on the Coastal Trail (saw a moose and her baby!) and all the snacks that we grabbed on our way out to hike in nearby Girdwood and Whittier. We loved going to nearby 49th State brewery and Snow City Cafe. Both very short walks. Book this Airbnb, you won't be disappointed!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget's place is the ONLY place to stay when you are visiting Anchorage. It is CLEAN, comfortable and adorable!! Check in was a breeze and the bed was so comfy.

Lovely setting and right near restaurants and bars (Ginger was great, 49th St Brewery was very good and a fun hangout). Having bikes was great, as the house is right at the entrance of the the Tony Knowles Coastal trail. Bridget is quick to respond to any inquiries and the House is fully equipped and was super comfortable. We enjoyed exploring Anchorage from this home base."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a such a great time on our first trip to Alaska, and staying here was great! From the location (walking distance to most things) to the little extra touches (snacks, breakfast, even some local beers), we felt relaxed and at home. We stayed here for two days before our Denali excursion, and the snacks gave us the extra energy to keep on hiking! We also stayed here on our last two days before heading home. Having a washer/dryer available really helped us be able to pack lighter for our 10 day stay. We’d definitely stay here again!"

The location is secluded yet still centrally located to everything downtown. The views are EPIC. Most nights we just sat on the deck and watched planes go by. The house itself was perfect. Very comfy bed. All the amenities you could ask for, plus a few Alaskan necessities like bear spray and bug spray. And Bridget provides so many lovely touches and surprises. So communicative too! It’s the rare property that is actually better than listed. We will 100% stay here next time we are in town."

She was extremely friendly we really enjoyed her! Definitely stay here if you come to anchorage!"

I hope to be able to come back when the yard isn’t under 3 feet of snow so I can sit out in the yard and enjoy the amazing view! I loved the trains and they weren’t loud enough to be disruptive. The planes and jets nearby made for really fun viewing. The proximity to the Coastal Trail couldn’t be easier. My tip, rent electric fat tire bike with studded tires from Downtown Bicycle Rentals and take the trail, such a great experience!
The place was very clean, included everything I needed, wifi was fast, tv was easy to use with apps, owners were ideal, etc. Highly recommend!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget’s place is truly amazing, from downtown location to water front view to cleanliness to charming decoration to all the extra goodies provided for guests. She had thought of everything and is the most attentive and gracious host. We will not hesitate to recommend her place to all our friends."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage. Close to everything!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m tempted to say derogatory words about my stay here in hopes that it would dissuade future guest that are on the cusp of pressing reserve so that it is open for my next trip, but alas it would be a disservice. We thought it awesome and only hope it is open the next time we are in Anchortown."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best downtown Anchorage location bar none! The inside of the house is modern, beautifully decorated and fully stocked. The location is peaceful and tranquil, yet, a short walk to downtown favorites (49th State Brewery, Snow City Cafe, Glacier Brewhouse, and more), and the Coastal Trail is literally right outside your door. I’m a local Alaskan and this place is my favorite downtown Anchorage BnB. Bridget is incredible too. Very quick to respond and very accommodating. We loved everything about our stay here!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage, excellent location! Right next to downtown for easy access to great restaurants while still feeling private. Perfect place for a getaway, lots of thoughtful touches around the house. Bridget was very communicative and kind. Can’t recommend this place enough."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I am left speechless by the beauty of this place. It is simultaneously downtown and close to tons of restaurants and pubs and also secluded and out of the way of traffic. It could not have been any more cozy with every amenity I could have ever needed and everything arranged perfectly. This place is better than any 5 star hotel I have stayed in and I am really looking forward to my next stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stellar communication and incomparable world class customer service! OMG!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re lookin for a “home-away-from-home” feel with hosts that have thought of every amenity to make your stay perfect, then you need to stay in the super clean and adorable home with a great decor and amazing views! It makes for a wonderful weekend getaway or long term stay, hidden in a quiet area minutes from downtown Anchorage!
The hosts are easy to communicate with and are quick to response because they really do care that you’re enjoying your stay!
You will love your stay in this hidden gem!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bridget and Eric's home was one of the best decisions we made during our stay in Anchorage! Even though we were only there for 3 nights... in December... the stay couldn't have been better. The home is walking distance to many food and drink options downtown Anchorage, but still tucked enough away to enjoy some privacy. The home itself was ideal. Incredibly cozy, stocked with many food, snack, drink items. Bridget and Eric were very helpful in providing recommendations for our trip. We had such a wonderful time. Highly recommend staying here! You won't regret it."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely terrific place to stay. Great communications and lovely furnished place.
Really enjoyed the stay and would definitely come back and stay again.
Thank you."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you want to stay at a fabulous house this is the place too be. Thank you so much Bridget I can’t Thank you enough!!!!😀😀

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect getaway for our staycation. Close to downtown and the coastal trail. We were able to walk and explore without too much difficulty. The bed was large and comfortable. The view was beautiful. There was a lovely surprise in the fridge from the hosts.
We accidentally left something behind and the hosts contacted us quickly. They met with us the next day to return the item. Very fast communication. We will definitely keep this place on our list to stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Communication was way above average. The place was super clean and cozy. We would happily return.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lots of activities around and food places
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so pleased with our stay. The home is comfortable and has everything you need. It was clean and well maintained. Bridget had so many snacks to eat on which was especially wonderful getting in late or coming in from a long bike ride. We enjoyed sitting out on her gazebo visiting, using the grill on the front porch-we took advantage of all her little touches. We definitely would stay here again. BTW, close walking distance to everything Anchorage including the train station that heads to Denali / Fairbanks …. Thanks again Bridget and Eric."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Bridget!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place with every detail one might need including snacks and breakfast food. Great yard and view. Quiet but easy walk to downtown and great places to eat.
Bridget was very accommodating to our requests."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed with this lovely cottage! It’s in a great location next to all the best restaurants in downtown Anchorage. Bridget is amazing, friendly, thoughtful, and responsive. This cottage has all of the little things travelers and tourist of Anchorage would need for their stay. Can’t get any better than having bikes and snacks sitting there waiting to be used and consumed. We will absolutely book this cottage again the next time we visit Alaska!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for couples! A quick drive or train ride to Seward for a visit to kenai fjords. Walkable to everything fun in anchorage! King size comfy bed
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the house is conveniently located AND tucked away - so nice! the decor is lovely, the bed is super comfy, and the fridge was stocked for us! be sure to enjoy the outdoor seating area, too! HIGHLY recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect place to spend a night during our time in Anchorage. The location is downtown, right along the coastal trail, but hidden enough away where it is a quiet getaway. Bridget was a very responsive host and left detailed instructions for check-in & check-out, lots of refreshments, and a pamphlet with nearby restaurant recommendations. We ate some delicious seafood at the Glacier Brewhouse, which was about a 7 minute walk from the airbnb. Will definitely stay here again if we make our way back to Anchorage in the future! :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It was super clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Great location for getting around Anchorage too. We would stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s got a fantastic view the location is superb you can walk to the bridge where people fish for salmon. I really liked it the neighborhood was a little noisy
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stay here!!! First of all, the location is fantastic. It's a hop away from downtown, bit it doesn't feel like it's in the middle of a city. And the view of the bay this hideaway lends itself to is exceptional.
Secondly, the house is clean, and Bridget and Eric have thought of everything. There are bikes, a small cooler, a washer and dryer, etc.
Finally, and most importantly, the host was AMAZING. Bridget picked me up from my bus stop, she drove me around downtown to get me oriented, and she let me store my bags the day after I left in one of her other properties.
In short, this is an exceptional Airbnb."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I had to come up with one word to describe this place it would be generous. King sized bed, food for breakfast when we didn't have time to shop because we got in late, bikes (!) that can be used to ride the beautiful coastal trail that's right next door, wine and beer in the fridge, magazines and books to read, enough lamps. Just so many generous touches that really made our stay pleasant. The location is great, it's like being at a lakeside cottage but you can walk to restaurants. Make this the place you stay in Anchorage, you won't be sorry."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bridget and Eric are the best hosts! What a magical stay! We wish that there were more stars to give them. They made our first Airbnb stay the absolute best. We are forever spoiled! Their place is exactly as described, yet so much more! From the extras in the fridge to the little touches in the bathroom, they thought of everything. Bridget even picked us up from the airport when we couldn't get a rental car and even gave us a tour of the town. The best! Keep doing what you do you two!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hospitable and welcoming ! Would stay again in a heartbeat!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A great place to stay and enjoy what Alaska offers. Place was very comfortable. Host was great and communicated very well. Checked in and asked if we needed anything!
Great location for your adventures.
Would definitely go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay in Anchorage! Eric thought of everything. Stocked fridge with drinks, snacks, and breakfast items made our early mornings so much less stressful. Incredible views, lovely outdoor space, thoughtful touches with slippers and ear plugs. Super easy and secure check in. Yes you are near the harbor and train but we used ear plugs and eye masks and had a terrific night’s sleep! Would highly recommend staying at Eric’s place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is perfect. The location is close to downtown but quiet. Everything in downtown is a short walk. The hosts Bridget and Eric are generous and responsive.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An incredibly charming and private spot just outside (a couple of blocks) from downtown. Stunning sunsets, inviting place, and amazing location. You couldn't ask for more thoughtful hosts or a better view. What a peaceful experience!"

The art on the wall was beautiful and made the space so much more welcoming.
The unit is spacious for a 2 bedroom and the furnishings were so comfortable and welcoming.
The unit is near so many amazing trails and great restaurants. The neighborhood is very walkable and close to almost all bus routes.
The apliances were new and well maintained and the kitchen was stocked with all the tools and equipment i needed to cook for my family.
I had a great time staying here and if im ever in need of short term housing again i would consider this space first.
This is a wonderful place to relax after a long day and the shower had amazing water pressure."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet neighborhood, close to the hospital, nice place, clean, had everything we needed!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a good stay here - I was just 3 blocks from UAA where I was visiting my daughter /going to the Alaska Airlines Center. The bed was comfortable, easy to operate the TV, appreciated the coffee and washer/dryer. The front door lock had battery issues when I first arrived and this was resolved immediately. Quick and easy communication."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here for a couple nights was pleasant. Good parking for the full size pickup I rented. Easy access to the house. Clear instructions, and easy pin pad keyless entry.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy to find and perfectly situated for our trip.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Mario’s place was perfect for our temporary housing situation! We stayed there for 3 weeks and it was easy to feel welcomed in such a clean space. Mario let us bring our cat to also help us feel right at home.
I would highly recommend Mario’s place as somewhere to stay while you’re visiting the Anchorage area. Mario is also super responsive and kind when messaging, which makes the world of difference if you need to contact a host for any reason!
Thanks again, Mario!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We picked up all your cigarette butts outside the property. Though we saw a booklet and said we where going to be charged. I believe we left the air bnb in good condition as we checked in. We washed the beddings, towels and wiped down the apt."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is small and cute perfect for couples to rest while visiting family. The pricing was great for the place. It’s located on a pretty busy street surrounded by apartments and single family home combined, so it’s a little bit noisy throughout the day or night. You can hear the cars and big trucks and people walking by. But overall, the home itself feels nice and clean, and outside the windows you can see the beautiful mountains so near. They even have a washer and dryer too that I like because I was able to do my laundry at the end before I check out. If you are looking for a place to stay for a short while this place is really good, plus it has a lot of parking in the driveway that fits 5 cars. Thank you to Mario for being such a great host by being responsive to my messages."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The AirBNB itself was quiet, it being a corner lot, the traffic outside was loud. But that's a nice little place, clean, well furnished, I would recommend it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great places to stay, love how close it was to the hospital."

Will certainly be back!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the house is incredible, every detail is spectacular and we were able to spend a super romantic and pleasant birthday. the area to get to the accommodation is really not very pleasant but the stay as such was very comfortable and safe. We managed to see the Northern Lights a few blocks from the house. we loved it :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Absolutely peaceful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place made our entire Alaskan trip an unforgettable experience. The impressive mountains on one side and the beautiful sunset on the other was surreal.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, great amenities, flexible check in. Would stay here again"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We spent a week here and I don’t think we could get enough days here. It’s so peaceful being on the deck with nature and the sunsets don’t hurt either. Just a 10 min drive to Palmer makes everything nearby but just far enough away to feel like an escape.
Friendly host, lots of amenities to feel like home, nature right outside to connect with..the list goes on! We eloped on this trip so our marriage started in this a-frame, but even without that this beautiful space would have a soft spots in our hearts! Can’t wait to be back and then have to drag ourselves away again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely wonderful! The owners keep it so clean and welcoming. They are very responsive and super friendly. Super cute decor and the hot tub is a major bonus! The back deck has great views. It was so peaceful and relaxing sitting in the hot tub looking at the stars. Amanda was flexible with check ins for some photography work she allowed me to use the space for which was so convenient for me! We absolutely loved it and will definitely be returning.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stunning, peaceful space with a great host!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda's place is absolutely stunning! Super clean, minimalist with all of the necessities. The beds were incredibly comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. We enjoyed the hot tub in negative temps in the peaceful surroundings. We live in the borough but wanted to get away for a girls weekend. This was perfect because it was out of the way but close to restaurants and town. We went to Feather and Flour per the hosts recommendations and it did not disappoint. Best of all was how responsive and thoughtful Amanda was. She sent us a message to let us know the place was ready and we could check in early... so we did! She let us know that she saw it was extra cold out so she increased the heat for us and gave permission to bump up the thermostat but we ended up not having too. And when my friend locked her keys in the car at check out she offered to let us hang out in the house if we needed too. It was just really cute and cozy and we really enjoyed our 2 night stay! 5 stars!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, remote and just the cozy weekend I was looking for. The house is new and so tastful and clean. It was a tad child inside and took a while to warm up but the temperature outside was pretty cold. Would love to stay again sometime."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A unique, clean, and convenient place to stay. From the spiral spiral staircase to the huge windows overlooking the river, it was great."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this beautiful place. The location is somewhat remote which makes this extremely peaceful and relaxing. No noisy neighbors to deal with. The house in amazing. It looks exactly like the pictures. The very private views of the river were incredible and we loved our time spent in the hot tub looking for moose to stop by. Communication was great and check in was easy. I would most definitely come back here!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amanda was awesome! So responsive and was so flexible and willing to work with our schedule! Such a nice host, even wrote us a personalized letter for our babymoon :) we will be back this summer as a family of three!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A true slice of heaven! After reading the reviews, I thought no way it could be that great. It certainly was!! The view, privacy, hot tub, decor - everything was just perfect. Thank you Amanda and we hope to be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100 out of 10 stars!
Amanda's place was elegant, sophisticated, with added personal touches. This was the perfect place to celebrate graduating nursing school as it is private and overlooks a river. All you need to bring is your clothes and a bathing suit, as all the linens, soaps, and paper products are provided. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook, including the staple spices and fresh ice.
If you are considering this place, yes, you need to stay here. The photos do not do it justice! The night sky is perfectly visible from the hot tub and we saw plenty of shooting stars and even a glimpse of the northern lights. I could have easily stayed two additional weeks, and still felt like I needed more time!
We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous cabin! Our family enjoyed our stay & will definitely book again

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here over the Christmas holiday and it was the perfect backdrop for a magical holiday. It was easy to get to, yet felt secluded. The house is beautiful with large windows and a gorgeous view. While we enjoyed the hot tub, we were visited by 3 moose and a bald eagle. It really felt like we were in an Alaskan postcard. It was a little piece of heaven. 12/10 would recommend."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"You come to Alaska for adventure and excitement….but eventually you’ll want to relax at a place that feels like home… our stay at Amanda’s was just that. From an easy entry to the little touches that just made it feel comfortable. And that’s not even mentioning the hot tub….sitting in a 104 degree hot tub while it’s snowing, overlooking the mountains and the river. Epic. We will definitely be back….
Also the Butte, Jim’s creek, lazy mountain, and mat su peak (great hikes) are all just 10 minutes away. Bleeding heart brewery and a bunch of Palmer favorites are within a 5 minute drive too.
All that to say….we had an amazing experience. Thank you Amanda!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda’s Riverside Retreat was phenomenal! On the river in an established neighborhood, but incredibly private. Roads were maintained and access was great. Furnishings were thoughtful and beautiful. Coffee bar was a 10. Bed very comfortable. Hottub amazing! Amanda was a truly great host. And the moose walking in front of the cabin one morning was a bonus. Can’t wait to return!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous place, extremely well kept and very thoughtful decor. Very spacious, all the furniture was comfy, and the bathroom and kitchen were spotless. This place had everything we needed, kitchen utensils, shampoo and conditioner etc. The views were breathtaking and the area was very quiet and peaceful. It was the perfect distance from town but far enough to be able to see the beautiful stars and Northern Lights during the night. We would HIGHLY recommend staying here and we plan to stay again for sure!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"10 / 10 recommend visiting. Really cool place to spend time with family or friends. I am excited to come back and visit in the summer. The deck over the wing is really cool.

Two bedroom was also a plus. Heck of an experience."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice place. Accurately described. One of the bedrooms is small, only able to fit the bed. But you can’t really get a lot of space on an airplane! I’m glad to have stayed there"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a unique and awesome place to stay!

A+ on all accounts."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented the plane for my sons 9th birthday party. While there wasn’t enough space for a full party, I let him have one friend spend the night. They played all night in the plane running up n down the hallway to the cockpit. We must have “taken off” and “landed” that thing 1,000x! Perfect for a couple of 9 year olds. Thank you for the cool experience! I saw this plane being hauled down the highway so it was fun to see where it ended up n how it has transformed.."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun adventure to stay in such a unique place. All furnishings were well thought out and everything tied into the airplane itself. From watching the sunrise and sunset in the cockpit to hanging out in the cargo area it was a great experience.

I am so thankful for the area we were in because for the majority of our trip our car was filled with stuff as we got ready to move my daughter into her dorm at UAA.
