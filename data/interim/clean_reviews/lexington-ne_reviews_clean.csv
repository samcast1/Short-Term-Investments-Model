2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time! Very comfortable and clean. Highly recommend.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great area, preaceful, and safe. the basement was available to us, and it was simple and relaxing. super easy check-in, and the basement was easily accessible from the front door. definitely worth it!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find & easy access from I-80. Very clean. Comfy bed. Big bathroom.
No lights were on downstairs which was unwelcoming and it was hard to find the switches in the dark (cell phone flashlight came in handy).
There were house rules that were not mentioned on AirBnB… a no shoe and no food policy downstairs where my room was. There were two rooms available but the one I did not reserve was open for me and the one I reserved was locked. I really didn’t want to sleep with all the animals (safari theme)
It was a nice stay for the price for sure. I suggested adding the house rules in the reservation description so someone would know ahead of arrival."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a spacious, lovely experience. Thank you much! I highly recommend it."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place for stopping over on our way to Colorado from Iowa. Clean and lovely bathroom.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun and beautiful to stay! I’ve never seen such a fun game room for guests! I also think it’s a perfect place to hang out after a long day’s drive…especially for a family with teens.
Michelle makes sure you have access to all the amenities that are available. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice basement finish, lovely bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. Place was nicely decorated, and even though we were only there overnight, we enjoyed the large private space. Air hockey was fun! Eddie & Michelle were friendly hosts. For your phone GPS directions, be sure to use the street address the hosts specifically posted in the listing and not the default one. I would stay there again if in the area!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! I was just passing through and I couldn’t have picked a better place to stay after a long drive. I had delicious pizza at the local watering hole then returned to the bnb and had a jacuzzi and slept in a very comfortable bed. The space was very clean and private. I would def stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle was over-the-top helpful as a host. Although there are no cooking facilities downstairs, she provided her entire well-appointed kitchen for our use and a refrigerator downstairs for us to store our food. There is an amazing hot tub available in the downstairs area you rent; you can choose one or two bedrooms, but will always have the place to yourself. She also allowed us to store and unhook from our RV at her RV park, which was essential. We were there to visit the sandhill cranes, and there were close to 275,000 near Kearney. This was a tremendous experience for us all around."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was easy to find and offered us a quiet respite from our busy schedule and a great place to headquarter for visiting family and touring Pioneer Village Museum, Fort Kearney and The Archway. Spacious place to stay and parking was easy."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay very much. The water cooler was nice. We sat on the couch that had recliners with a blanket on our laps watching TV . Relaxing. Bed was comfortable. The bathroom was big. It's one of my husband 's favorite places we have been.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the 2nd nicest Airbnb I’ve stayed in over 5 years! Bathroom is nearly palatial with a hug jacuzzi tub and enough hot water to fill it. Rec room for a family. Spotlessly clean!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second time here. It is as good as it gets with AirBnB. You will love it here.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So accommodating and friendly. Clean!! The giant hot tub in the bathroom was a wonderful surprise! This was the best Airbnb deal I've experienced! I will stay there again if I have the opportunity!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great value. The hosts were quick to respond. The reclining couches and the big screen TV were a nice treat after a long road trip. The large bathroom and huge walk in shower was great for getting ready. The queen size bed and bedding (especially the sheets) in safari room were so comfy. But as I was laying there thinking how comfy and rested I was, I thought about how there were no egresses windows in the basement bedroom I was in and then realized I didn’t see ANY windows in the basement or an exit/fire escape route posted. (I did not open any doors that were closed in their bsmt looking, as we were on our way out) This might be an issue for people. I never gave it much thought, until then."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for our quick overnight stay. Very comfortable, spotless! Would highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, quiet and well maintained. Easy to find, would definitely stay again.
A+++"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Michelle & Eddie’s place was great. It was clean and comfy. We needed a quick night to stay, however I missed on the booking that we needed to check in before 11pm — definitely make sure you read everything and check your time zones. Their sleep before work is very important to them. We almost didn’t have a place to stay right before we arrived, after our 12 hour drive. No fault of theirs and I understood the frustration from my mistake. Thankfully they allowed us to keep our booking and sleep there while we remained respectful to their sleep. I would recommend regardless."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most beautiful AirBnB's that I have stayed in.
Plenty of parking, safe area, great hot water and a strong WiFi signal.
I would stay here again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for an overnight stay as I had a long drive through Nebraska. Michelle was very nice, greeting me upon arrival.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Excellent value and easy to find. I got to stay in the “jungle room”. It made me smile when I turned on the light and saw the toy stuffed lions and tigers on the dresser! I will definitely stay there when I come through the area!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean and comfortable. Nice soft carpet. we were very tired and had a relaxing evening. We slept well and were on the road again before dawn, making today's travel much easier."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful place to stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable bed and well equipped super large bathroom were the highlights. Being able to use the spacious basement family room with big screen tv was an added perk. Michelle was very accommodating and the household was quiet. Ideal place for my stopover.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you Michelle for making your home a comfortable place to land for the night. Place was very clean and very nice.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom is huge! The host was very nice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We ended up not staying at Michelle-Eddie’s place because we decided to keep on driving (we were in route home from our vacation). My interactions with Michelle were positive but I cannot comment on the space itself. She was very responsive and had great communication.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It would be nice to at least have a pod type coffee maker.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place. LOVED the shower !
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great comfortable place to stay right off the highway. The space was described accurately and was nice and clean. The only thing that was a little confusing is that the doors for the bedrooms are not marked and it is unclear which room to go in when all the doors are closed. Other than that it is a great quiet place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Beautiful location and home. The basement could be used for a whole lot of fun. Great bedroom and amazing bathroom. I would stay again if ever passing through.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great option while traveling. everything matched the descriptions. highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,thank you.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a quiet sleep. I had no problem getting to bed early even though the room was in the basement and under the rest of the house on a Friday evening. Very peaceful. Next time I will use the big tub!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cool, dehumidified, quiet basement with a great bathroom and internet. Would stop again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, and spacious. Not a bad place to stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were just passing through and enjoyed having a homier feel than a hotel! The bathroom is incredible and the place was clean. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 2nd time I have used Airbnb. This home is lovely and comfortable. I appreciated having the basement to myself. I stayed in the safari room. I was amazed at the thoughtful details that went into decorating this room. The ""animal eyes"" paintings is fascinating.
I have already booked for next year with an extra night. And I am hoping to come back, depending on availability in September for fishing and in March for the crane migration. (Thank you, Michelle for that information and invitation!)"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,nice 👍🙂
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful location in a beautiful country setting. The room was quiet and comfortable and had everything I needed for my stay. Michelle was quick to respond to any questions I had.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed on return trip. See previous review.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying this garden unit. The bathroom was big. The bedrooms were beautiful. The only thing we didn't feel comfortable was we had to share the entrance with the owner.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Close to interstate and easy to find for the most part. Loved the spacious bathroom and soaker tub. Appreciated being able to use fridge and freezer for our traveling cooler stuff.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You get a very large basement to yourself.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Michelle/Eddie's place was such a nice stay. The basement was spacious and private. The house and lawn was immaculate. It was easy to find and looked exactly like the pictures listed. I would definitely stay again. Thank you Michelle/Eddie.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean & private. Beautiful farm
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great, comfortable stay! The hosts were very friendly, even though I got there a bit earlier than I thought I would be. The bed was comfy and the bathroom amazing! Loved the big tub and spacious area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places we have stayed. Would recommend their place highly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Michelle & Eddie’s place. The bathroom was so nice and the bed very comfortable. We wish we had been able to stay long enough to enjoy the tv and fireplace room!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot just outside of Kearney. The bed was super comfortable and the whirlpool bath was a dream.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"My stay with Michelle was a mixed bag. I loved how at the end of my stay. She allowed me to use their campgrounds ice machine because I needed the ice for my coolers and the fridge. I didn’t like how there wasn’t self check in and it was a very awkward greeting. I was also late due to not accounting for the time difference between states. So I think that’s why it was such an awkward greeting. Coming from California, I did not realize that the basement didn’t have any windows, and therefore made me feel unsafe. This is all personal preference, however, and does not relate to Michelle. The listing was unclear. I thought I would choose my room upon arrival but I was informed upon arrival that I was not to open any of closed doors, and I had access to one room and the bathroom. As a solo, female traveler I felt the need to check all of the rooms for my safety, but I respected the hosts wishes and stayed in the space provided. Human hairs on sheets, stale smelling towels, hair in shower."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off I want to say our host was very friendly & their house was amazing, I especially enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. that being said, this stay was not your typical stay from Air B&B. when you arrive you have to come through the front door of the host's residence, & upon arrival the host was seated in the living room to greet us (not typical) we are then expected to remove our shoes and leave them at the front door (weird but understandable) then you proceed down to the basement through a non private entrance with only a ln indoor door lock on the door (not very secure). when we git downstairs to our room we were greeted by a stuffed animal sanctuary, not our taste in decor but someone may enjoy it. This was not an Air B&B only location, it doubled as a like family room. Next was the game room. It was listed as one of the amenities of the location but we got the since that we were not allowed to use anything. We could not access the pool cues do to air hockey placement."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful bathroom and Jacuzzi tub and spacious downstairs area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved Eddie and Michelle's ABB. Very quiet and cool in the huge basement space. Loved the decor in the Africa room. There is one restaurant and one grocery in town - both excellent. Used the school track for walking.
Sat in the front of house under the portico to read. Eddie and Michelle are very friendly and I had many visits with each and both of them.
Amenities are five plus!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I highly recommend the stay. Thank you for the good night’s rest before we continued on our way.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If all Airbnb places were this great, we would stay all the time. Highly recommend if in the Kearney area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay. Had everything we needed and was accurate to the listing.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Got really good rest and is conveniently located.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay! Close to Kearney. Kitchen was just remodeled and looks fantastic! We did not use the kitchen, except we put a pie in the fridge. We did not use the laundry facilities. We did sit on the deck and enjoyed the location. We did not use the whirlpool but the shower was great. The place was just as described. The host was very friendly and communicated well. Beds were comfortable with nice pillows. We would definitely stay again! I would not take anyone that can’t manage stairs as you stay in a nice finished basement so there are several steps. There is a hand rail to use going up/down. The house is beautifully decorated inside and out."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was a last minute reservation around 7:00 pm and arrived 30 min after booking. Instructions were super clear and getting in was quick and easy. Now for the best part..... THR JACUZZI TUB. This was the nicest bath tub I have been in in my life, with jets and a waterfall spout. I felt like I bathed in the fountain of youth and my muscles forgot about the 20 hours of driving I had been through. For the price of a shabby motel I experienced peak luxury. The other thing that stood out was the toilet paper.... must have been woven by the seamstress of the gods. I forgot to ask what brand but my bum has experienced the royal treatment and I fear I can never go back. No window light meant I slept peacefully throughout the night and my sleep watch showed a perfect 8 hours before I opened my eyes feeling reborn. There may not be attractions in town but the basement of this air BNB should be one of them. The kitchenware was also brand new and high quality. 11/10 experience"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good spacious place to rest with all the necessary amenities as well as accomodating hosts.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stop for road trips. Big space, comfy, just as pictured."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just spent a quick night on a road trip back home and it was the perfect place to stay. They were super responsive and sweet and the room was so comfortable, I definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Airbnb itself was awesome - some highlights were the massive bathroom, pool table, and beautiful countryside location. I didn't interact much with the hosts but they seemed friendly and straightforward."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best night's sleep I've had in a while!! The beds were super comfortable with beautiful all cotton sheets. It was a very comfortable stay overall - plush carpet, easy to operate TV & comfy beds. In addition, we were traveling through to Kansas & Nebraska and accidentally left an item behind that was needed for graduation gift giving in Nebraska. Michelle called us right away and shipped it out to us same day at our final destination in Nebraska. We super appreciate the extra effort she went to to help us out with this. I would definitely book again on my next trip through the area! Thank you!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was nice and clean. It was conveniently to I80. The jacuzzi was amazing!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Michelle was very cordial and gave advice on location for dinner.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We last minute booked Michelle-Eddie's place, and it was extremely easy to find and get in as well as accurate to the description. We were able to use their kitchen and had the whole basement to ourselves to spend the night. They were incredibly kind and accommodating - on top of the place being very reasonably priced! Strongly recommend to anyone traveling through the Kearney neighborhood."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room was exactly as described. It was very quiet--just what we needed after a day on the road. Everything was comfortably laid out.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was very simple, great hosts. The space was extremely clean, large, we were very satisfied. The bed was so comfortable, we slept sooo good, the best sleep so far on our one-month trip to America. Sincere recommendations, from the heart! We would definitely come back again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Appreciate the spacious layout, very comfortable bed. Easy to rest, good privacy. Would come back any time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Michelle and Eddie were very hospitable and friendly. Would definitely like to stay there again if I am out that way.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as described - great communication - met us at the door at 10pm. Spacious area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great find! Close to the Sandhill cranes, comfy bed, spacious bath!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had the entire basement to myself with a very large bathroom, walk in shower and huge tub. They were in the middle of remodeling the main level kitchen (shared) with a dishwater sitting out in the hallway, which didn’t make a good impression. Very friendly hosts. Exceptional value. Ideal for me for my trip to see the Sandhill Crane migration at the nearby Rowe Sanctuary."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and comfortable!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice space to rest and relax at the end of the day. Great shower!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was so clean and comfortable. Wish we would have spent more time there. Host was very responsive. Would recommend if driving through Nebraska or Crane viewing.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A seriously beautiful home very close to the highway and convenient for travelers. The hosts were super friendly and had some recommendations for local food and activities, although be aware that they are located in a small town and many traditionally touristy things are going to be 15-20 minutes away."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful! wonderfully comfortable. very private. beautiful area. stars! Michelle is sweet and attentive, the bathroom is luxury, the space is accomodative. great spot!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There is a beautiful halloween decoration outside and inside the house.

of amenities in the house including a game room with table hockey and billiards."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is as good as it gets. The accommodations are spacious, tastefully decorated and welcoming. The bed is comfortable and the bath is five star hotel quality. WOW. You will love staying here."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic time! The evening was relaxing and we both slept well. Michelle was very communicative and we appreciated her conversation while we settled.
2022-10-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The space was clean, private, and comfortable as other reviewers have said. However, I’m not sure I can recommend due to a bizarre experience I had.
Before arriving, I messaged the host to ask if there was a possibility I could do laundry. She responded “the laundry is near the bedroom”, which I took to mean she was letting me know where it was. In the morning, around 9:30, I decided to do laundry before I left. The host came out of her room yelling at me that I disturbed her sleep and that she meant since the laundry was near her bedroom she didn’t want me doing it. When I apologized and said I misunderstood the message, she continued to yell repeating that she didn’t sleep until 2am, that her husband kept her up until 2am.
If you do choose to stay her, just be careful, because at least one of the hosts has both poor communication and a temper."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"House was very nice, clean and big. Finding the place wasn’t the greatest as we came in at night and couldn’t see so it took a bit of driving around since the gps isn’t accurate. Read someone’s review and got help from that before contacting since it was late."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place for a quick stop while passing through. The space is very large and comfortable. The bed was comfy and I slept great. I highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything we needed for a quick pit stop during our road trip!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a delay in our trip and unfortunately missed our first of two bookings with Michelle-Eddie. The host was extremely empathetic and we will be staying with them on the way back to our home as well. If the Airbnb is anything like the hosts themselves, it will surely be Amazing and we are excited to stay with them in a couple days."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great people, great communication!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic find. Very clean and spacious with unique decorative touches and lots of nice features. Specifically the games and spa tub!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean , comfy, quiet
A good value"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and bed was very comfortable. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for an overnight stop. The place is immaculate and the jacuzzi tub - which was huge - was great after a day of driving and getting caught in a downpour!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,House is really hard to find.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was very conveniently located to I-80 without being too close. The place was very clean. The bathrooms were huge, clean and with a nice jacuzzi tub."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures do not do this place justice. There is so much more room then the 2 of us needed and yet at a great price. I took a soak in the tub almost immediately. The bed was so comfortable we overslept. Our hosts were super friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to stay there again. Try them, you won’t be disappointed!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Michelle and Eddie had a very big spacious basement. The beds were extremely comfortable!! And having a private bathroom with two sinks was nice for the 3 of us that stayed. We weren't allowed to eat in the basement so we felt a little odd eating in their private dining room upstairs and having to use their dishes. But she didn't seem to mind and got the things out for us. Their house is just a minute or two off the interstate which was great for us!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immense space with great amenities. Beds were very comfortable, and the shower/bathroom were just perfect. Such a lovely place. Thank you for making your space available to weary travelers."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location is very convenient if you’re traveling on the highway. Everything is very clean, the bathroom is huge, the decorations are so fun, and the bed is very soft and comfy! It was a great place to spend the night."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean. The enormous jet tub was a welcome surprise after 30 hours on the road. The jungle room was unique and provided a little something interesting for my stay.
Do note that not all GPS takes you to the house. It was dark when I arrived, and given the rural location it was hard to spot. In case you have that same problem, know that It’s the last driveway on the right, just before the stop sign, that detail would’ve saved me a lot of hassle and confusion ;)
I was only there about 11 hours but I was very glad for the stop! The bed is super comfortable and it felt much nicer than a roadside hotel."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place!! It was charmingly decorated and very comfortable. One of, if not the, nicest AirBnb we have stayed. Perfect location, just west of Kearney. We hope to stay here again. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and spacious accommodation, a shame Michelle's welcome was not very warm, giving us the feeling of disturbing them."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Basement suite was big, quiet, clean and had a large refrigerator that met our needs. Loved the new, lush carpeting and fabulous large bathroom. They allowed us to use their kitchen table to eat on but would probably be easier if you eat before you come as there is no eating downstairs in the basement. All and all a wonderful stay and would love to stay there again. Thank you Michelle for a wonderful overnight :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place in the beautiful countryside - I was only driving through the area to stay one night but it was so nice I would have stayed longer if I could. Definitely a must-see if you're in the area in Nebraska!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time at Michelle’s place. It’s comfy, clean and perfect for our quick overnight stay. We will stay again!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a super fun time at the safari room. The bed was super comfortable and everything was really clean. The bathroom was huge and super nice! The house is also super close to the highway which is why this was a perfect overnight night on our road trip.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and quiet, yet just a couple minute drive to hop back on I-80. The space is absolutely huge, could easily host four people. Bathroom had most of the essentials; shampoo, body wash, etc. I stayed in the safari room and dreamed of lions and giraffes. Go figure. 😂"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very lovely place to stay. Such comfortable beds and a spacious bathroom. Wish our stay would have been longer.
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I stopped here on a cross country road trip. The house is in a very rural part of Nebraska (which I assume most people looking to stay here already realize). It is spacious, but it is a basement so there are no windows. The living area is clean but I found that the bathroom, specifically the toilet, had not been cleaned prior to my arrival. I personally preferred to stay at a hotel but for a group this could be a good option."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is very nice, clean, and spacious."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great staying here! And the Coon’s Saloon is the place to go for late night pizza and good company.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is an amazing value. Such a lovey ambiance within. Everything was super.
If you enjoy a good nights sleep, this mattress is sure to leave you longing to buy one for yourself. The walk-in shower was incredible. There is also a jetted tub that was aesthetically pleasing.
Normal household rules, like staying with mum.
Such a restful stop and convenient to I-80 travel.
Plan to arrive early enough to enjoy their hospitality- you won’t be disappointed."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed overnight on a trip and it was a lovely place to stay.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quick & easy stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home with wonderful people inside. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom was huge and amazing!! My daughter and I loved the games available (we played connect four). Michelle generously allowed us the use of the washer and dryer for a load. After asking, we visited the cows. They were a sweet bonus. There is a panaromic view from the front porch too. Michelle was super fast communicating. Everything was super clean. My daughter suggested that it would be neat if the bathroom air freshner was matched to the sea-beach theme:) I hope we have a chance to stay here again in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't recommend this cottage enough. Great location, well-kept and great hosts!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Both for our favorite restaurant and Wild Horse Golf. We actually met a couple of the neighbors. The front porch was a great place to relax with morning coffee and a cold drink after a round of golf.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for my stay in Gothenburg. Great location, the grocery store and downtown area are super close. The house itself was taken care of and decorated with a lot of love, and was a joy to stay in! The big bed downstairs was really comfortable. The kitchen had exactly everything I needed. The front and back porches were great. And the wifi was strong! This place is special, I definitely recommend it. Thanks TJ and Michelle!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son, mother, and I were in town for Rail Days, and picked this home because it was away from the traffic and other tourists in North Platte (but still easy to get to North Platte via I-80). The neighborhood felt super safe. When we sat on the front porch (taking great advantage of the wonderful weather, along with the rocking chairs and porch swing), neighborhood residents never failed to wave or say ""hello"" as they passed by. The house itself was very comfy and inviting, and felt like home as soon as we arrived. In you're a history or museum nerd (like me), make sure to stop by the Pony Express museum, which is just a few blocks away. There is a very nice super market (Fresh Foods) not far from the house. The house (and Gothenburg) was perfect for our weekend trip, but would also be great for an extended stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home base for our golf trip to Western Nebraska. The home was clean and comfortable, the hosts were great."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was a gem! Surrounded by nature, peaceful, could see the stars at night and breath the fresh air. This was the perfect get-away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great private getaway from all the crowds while on a crane watching trip. The river was just down from the cabin as described and the property was great for a little hiking and exploring. We brought all of our food for cooking at the cabin and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed for food prep.
Towels and linens were clean and sufficient. There was a nice supply of board games for a rainy day, 3 SmartTV's, and a pair of binoculars for checking out any wildlife you may see at a distance. We definitely heard the wild animals in the middle of the night, but it justed added to the ambiance.
Check-in/out instructions were easy to follow.
Dishwasher, washer and dryer, coffee pot [cone filters], toaster were available and functioning
TIP: Arrive with your food, as the property is as described, off the beaten path. I imagine you will have a bit of a drive to the nearest grocery store if you didn't plan ahead. We were prepared for, and loved the seclusion."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was beautiful and perfect for a girls weekend getaway. The kitchen was great with all of the necessary cooking items to prepare our meals. The main room was so spacious and the furniture was comfortable. We're already discussing when to book our next weekend getaway.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home on a beautiful piece of property.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem. My girlfriend and I attended a nearby bull sale and it really couldn’t get any closer. This place is quiet, private, and very spacious. The floor plan is super open and there is a ton of room to spread out. It more than accommodated just the 2 of us and could very easily host a multi-family stay. John was easy to work with and the self check-in with the keypad is a breeze. Do plan to bring your own food as there is not much other than condiments and town is a good distance away. You can definitely cook anything you’d want. There are pots, pans, cookie sheets, a crockpot, etc. The included washer dryer is also nice, we were able to run a load with little issue.
Do be wary of wildlife however. We arrived after dark and there were definitely critters hanging out on the front step when we tried to get in. Not a problem, just an observation. You should expect such things when staying in the Sandhills! 10/10, really can’t go wrong here."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly hosts, clean and enjoyable"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. The house was great and the property was beautiful. John was a great host.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is gorgeous, watching the sunset through the windows and from the porch made the trip worth it. It was cold and I had issues with getting inside because the lock was frozen but John talked me through it and was immediate in responses to any requests I had. It’s an amazing place and well worth the booking."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John has a great place to stay! My family and I will definitely be back, everyone loved the home. The scenery is beautiful, it was a home away from home. John is an outstanding host and we’re happy we got to meet him!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were on a big road trip from Salt Lake City to New Jersey and John’s place was our first stop. It was perfect for our quick stop and our big family. My kids loved the bunk beds!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only wish we could stay longer at John’s house. It was absolutely beautiful, outside and inside. Very clean, new. The host was very responsive and helpful. We will definitely be back for longer stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really well done, very clean and cozy. Perfect for a large group or just the two of us. Well stocked kitchen for cooking or good restaurants not to far away. We enjoyed a nice evening fire in the fire pit with tons of stars including plenty of shooting stars. The sunsets both nights were spectacular. This is a special place and John was the best."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at John's place. Love the secluded and peaceful cabin. Looking forward to planning our next trip!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This riverside home was everything we hoped for...and more! It is pretty secluded (which suited us great!), in a beautiful part of Nebraska, surrounded by hills, trees, fields, and wildflowers. We brought our two little guys (3yrs and 1.5yrs) and they had great fun romping in the yard and playing on the front porch. The river is accessible but not so close to the house as to make it worrisome for little people who can't swim. A nice little clearing by the river, surrounded by towering cottonwoods, holds a zipline, swing, and slack line that make for great fun. The house itself is clean and beautiful (""magical"" and ""refreshing"" were two words that kept popping up in our vocabulary while we were there), with a well-thought-out layout and a crisp decorating style that is chic while being very kid-friendly at the same time. We are already talking about coming back! We highly recommend this place and its hosts. Thanks for a great stay, John and Mandy!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cabin was lovely in every way. It was so quiet and relaxing. I couldn’t recommend it more and we will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little vacation, we went to the winery's (passport Nebraska) - they were a little drive to get to but not bad. Their house was a great way to end the evening great views. And their beef and farm fresh eggs were great :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property was beautiful! We hope to make it a yearly stay. I wish we could have stayed longer. Very family friendly. Our kids had a blast!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location, view, river, and cabin were beautiful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"From the beginning to end the whole trip was fantastic. John was very responsive and helpful and had an amazing place to stay. The ribeyes that were purchased from him were some of the best steaks we tried and the provided grill was excellent. We had no complaints. We did not venture to the river, but the environment was great and exploring the fields was beautiful. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The River cabin was absolutely amazing! Our hosts were the best, very accommodating and great with communication! The property was beautiful. The perfect place to explore and swim! We will definitely be back."

The porch was peaceful, views were amazing and the night sky was incredible. The beds were comfortable and the house stayed nice and cool in the 95degree heat!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped after a long day of driving with 4 older kids (ages 11-16) and were immediately able to relax and stretch out. John gave clear instructions and the property was beautiful. Kids ran right to the river and zip line. The big round hay bale to climb up and swing from was a hit all around. Absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The accommodations were in perfect shape, clean and spacious. We were very comfortable. Would stop again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was lovely and just as described. The river was a short walk from the house, and there was a swing and zipline for the kids to enjoy. It was absolutely gorgeous and so peaceful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was clean and beautiful. The host are friendly and very helpful. Peaceful area and a great place to be with family. Our family cemeterywas down the road and the kids lived fishing by the river. Great place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Mandy were amazing hosts! The whole process and everything was very smooth, pleasant, exactly what was listed! The area was so beautiful and breath taking…. The view were amazing! The location was a very good location…. John helped us keep updated on the weather and storms, he helped guide us on the best possible route and roads to take….. John was very responsive thru the whole process and also the whole weekend…. He and Mandy made sure to message us and tell us to have a good visit, to relax and enjoy our time and visit, and also to check and see if we needed anything and that they would help us gather stuff for fire pit and help bring us stuff to start a fire…..I would definitely recommend and highly recommend to friends, family who want to enjoy a quiet, peaceful and secluded getaway or vacation….I hands down would have to say that we were and are blessed with the best hosts ever! It will be definitely hard to find better people then these two…. There’s a whole lot to say!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the River Cabin! It's a beautiful home, with all of the amenities one could want. The surrounding countryside is very peaceful and picturesque. The South Loup River is just a few steps away and was great to kayak. The location is fairly remote, requiring some gravel road travel, but that's part of the charm. We expect a return visit!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay very beautiful views and very spacious! John the host was very responsive with communication and gave great instructions on how to get into the house! Would definitely recommend for a quiet clean place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful location and home. Very newly constructed, adorable decor, and super clean. It’s a bit off the beaten path as we were just passing through, but the space was perfect for a big group. Comfortable beds, thoughtful lighting by the beds and easy access to outlets. Great kitchen supplies.
As a superhost myself, I thought John and Mandy were stellar hosts that were always quick to respond. They were helpful and you could tell they took pride in their role as hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John’s home was perfect for our multigenerational family! It was clean, comfortable, spacious, and had everything you could need. John was a wonderful host - super responsive, and very accommodating. And the setting was absolutely gorgeous. I would highly recommend staying here and hope I can return soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice short stay while passing through NE. The house was clean and organized. Make sure you bring the groceries and coffee you'll need for your stay because its a good drive to the closest town for supplies.
Thanks John!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John's place was a little farther away from Kearney than what I usually stay when working there but I absolutely loved the property! Deer greeted me every morning when I pulled into the drive and the surrounding countryside was some of the most picturesque I've ever encountered. Loved it. 👍
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place if you want to get away from everyone and everything! Views are spectacular and John and Mandy were great!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and his wife were amazing hosts. I am a Airbnb super host myself, and I have much to learn from John. He communicated very clearly and efficiently. The place was extremely clean. The beds were comfortable. The environment was peaceful, and I just couldn’t say anything better about the accommodations. As a matter of fact, he even gives you the ability to buy his farm, fresh steaks and eggs, which are probably the best you’ll ever have. Thank you guys for your tremendous hospitality. I wish I could give you 10 stars out of five."

The dock, ir you could pull up with too, just bring some bumpers and tie downs, a cooler so it’s nearby and try your luck fishing at night
Caught three 5 pound catfish and a 17 and a 20 inch walleye
Both back in the lake awaiting another angler.
Nice place for the money especially with a large group."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed to meet family, it was our first time to Nebraska. Julie was a great host, very friendly, flexible allowed us to check in early due to our circumstances. Julie is also very responsive, easy check-in.Place looked exactly like the pictures, extra blankets and plenty of beds, very clean, and right on the lake. Place is safe, and felt very private. Plenty of parking and close to the Walmart and highway if you need to pick up anything. Sliding door views are amazing. Very minor suggestion is have a nonstick pan for eggs for each morning, otherwise pans stick. However kitchen is FULLY stocked, everything you need is there, we had BBQ outdoors. Plenty of space to sit with two living rooms, plenty of bathrooms to get ready, spacious and just a great house all around! Super good location on the lake. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place, don't think twice I've done the research and this is the BEST place on the lake for your value. Would definitely stay again, keeping it as a favorite!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julie's place is a great location and has excellent views of the lake and marina. There is a very large patio area to gather at and the access to the water is excellent. We had a group of 9 people staying for a wedding and we appreciated the open floor plan of the kitchen, dining area, and living room area; it allowed us to all be in one room and not feel crowded. If you have a number of people in your party, you will appreciate the home having three nice bathrooms. The location of the home also provides easy access to a number of restaurants around the lake and it is not too far if you need to travel to a store."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time. We really enjoyed the outdoors space as well as the open concept of the kitchen, dining, and living room area!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was clean and uncluttered. No surprises, it was as described. We loved the back porch with the bar seating and umbrellas. Was a perfect place for a family get together. The business across the lake did have live music as mentioned in one of the photos. Nice at first but lasted a bit too long for our liking - made it difficult to have a conversation outside."

Julie has always been an excellent host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Julie's house on Johnson Lake was great for our family's summer vacation. Very spacious common kitchen, dining, living area with four well setup bedrooms and three nice bathrooms. We were blessed with great summer lake weather and could really enjoy all the outdoor activities the lake area has to offer. The house has several, very ample sized, outdoor areas where you can choose be close to the water or up on the covered patio overlooking the lake. Very nice way for our family to enjoy our vacation together."

Thank you. Jamie B"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was perfect for our family to spend a quick weekend together. The cabin was nice and clean. The kids loved the dock and spent lots of time fishing.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a local wedding planner and although I didn't stay at the AirBnb myself, I stopped by it several times throughout the rented wedding weekend and it was BEAUTIFUL! Very pristine cleanliness and spacious. Very comfortable and up-to-date, modern kitchen, furniture and bathrooms.
Day 2 the toilets wouldn't properly flushed. I messaged Julie and she was on it instantly. That evening while everyone was at the wedding, the toilets were fixed and the AirBnb was back in order for the bride and groom!
I'd highly recommend staying here--I may even do it myself ;)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was just what the doctor ordered. Peaceful clean very inviting. Plenty of everything. Julie was very helpful and easy to contact. We had an amazing time there.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is great! The check in process is so easy and user friendly using the smart lock on the front door. The home itself is super roomy and accommodating for medium-large groups. Our group had 8 people and everyone of us agreed that it easily would fit many more. The living room area is so roomy and works great for playing cards, group dinners, or just relaxing. The outside patio and water view is stunning and really makes you want to just sit outside and enjoy the view. This home is a 10/10 and Julie is a great host!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for a lake view getaway!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Lakeview Leisure is AMAZING…the house was great for our family to come together for a birthday celebration. Great view of the lake from a spacious back patio! Julie is a great host who was very quick to respond if needed.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have stayed at this home with my adult family twice now. Check in was easy, home was clean and well supplied, all appliances were in good shape, wi-fi reliable and kitchen is nicely stocked. The dock is great for swimming and relaxing. Patio is comfortable and lots of chairs and umbrellas. We could find shade all day long and plenty of sun if that's what you want. We didn't watch much TV, but I do know reception is good. I think the fact that we didn't watch much TV speaks highly of the experience. Restaurants on Johnson lake are a lovely example of good local dining. Markets are close enough to keep cooking and last minute needs pretty easy. Julie manages the property very efficiently and process of booking and billing went well. I will definitely return when they have another opening on a weekend!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent stay.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We would stay here again. Everything was wonderful. We watched an eagle both days from the deck. The common area was fantastic. It allowed for everyone to be part of the fun even the cooks. A firepit would make it top notch!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Spacious and perfect for an extended family gathering or group of friends. Everything is on one floor and easy to access so even older adults can use the entire space. Having such a large kitchen/dining area and having 3 full bathrooms is a bonus if you had a larger group. There is a very large overhang on deck and large great room so it would be a good place to stay even if the weather was not cooperating.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent lakeside property. Private dock, deck, and bountiful space await as you enjoy a fun filled vacation at Lake Johnson. I highly recommend this Airbnb if you have a large group and want to relax and enjoy all nature has to offer!"

Awesome weekend!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our big family!! First of all it was CLEAN and big! Everything we needed was right there water, fishing, kayaking, peddle boating and riding bikes. There was plenty beds and bathrooms for us and the best part was the shade we had to get out of the sun and relax!! Great experience we will be going back again. Thank you again Julie❤️"
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Prime location on the lake and the kitchen is large which is always a plus. However there is not a fire pit and barely any space on the dock or the grass area. Also the dock is not plastic so having our boat docked there ended up scratching and scraping on the side of the boat. We had a great time but with the extra cost per person over 8 guests we will not return.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious and updated accommodations. We had a group with 9 adults, 2 children and 1 infant. There was plenty of room. The property is in a great location on the lake. The house was furnished with everything you need."

The place was very clean and nicely decorated, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the kitchen/living/dining area has great lake views and is perfect for entertaining. We'd definitely stay here again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A spacious home on the lake with excellent amenities. We enjoyed sitting on the deck looking out at the lake. Quiet time of year with plenty of birdwatching. Julie did a great job of communicating
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great location! Watching the eagles and pelicans was fun for all of us. The water was beautiful even though the weather was cold and overcast much of our stay, it even snowed! The only thing I would change: Other people’s condiments in refrigerator and cabinets full of spices. We had nowhere to put our food. Every cabinet was full. We had to leave our food out on the counter. Also, we lugged lots of blankets in a crowded car only to find that there are actually blankets there to use.
The house was comfortable and we had a blast! We were in town to watch the sandhill crane migration and it did not disappoint:)"

The large open dining/kitchen and family area just makes way for conversation, meals, and entertainment. The lake beckons you early each morning to take in the sunrise and be refreshed and awed by the glimmering water. We love having our boat so accessible at the dock right down from the umbrella covered patio. Meals are easy with the grill and the restaurant across the lake is absolutely delicious, welcoming and delightful! We enjoyed viewing all the birds and were happy to see they are well fed! The Lake House is a perfect get away! The kitchen is stocked with all your needs! Looking forward to making more memories next season! Thanks Julie!"

Layout of the house with all the bedrooms and bathrooms down the hallway worked well for our group. All we needed to do was bring our clothes. The house had everything we needed. A bonus was that Julie left us coffee for our mornings. Given the time of year we were not able to take advantage of the lake that was steps away but the view from the house was beautiful.

Tom & Cindy (let’s be honest, Cindy) have thought of everything to make you feel like you’re at home. They have clear instructions on everything in the home to make sure there isn’t any questions or confusion. The house is adorable and perfectly decorated. It’s located on a quaint, quiet street within walking distance of a few restaurants and shops. I think the filtered water in the fridge made my husband love Tom & Cindy more than we already did. Clean water is my husband’s love language lol. Plus, we had delicious homemade cinnamon rolls waiting on the counter when we arrived. Again, I could go on for DAYS about this wonderful home and experience. I only wish we had more than 1 night booked with them. Thank you Tom & Cindy for sharing your place with us!"

It's like walking into someone's dream cottage and finding out it's yours for a while. It all seems very new and spiffy. Comfy bed, good shower, great kitchen, open plan living/dining room / kitchen, flat-screen TV on the wall. There is a cute sun porch with a sofa and pull-down desk that was just the right size for my yoga mat. A handy entry area with coat hooks and a bench. The kitchen is well-equipped. The living room couches, the dining room table, and the kitchen counter make it a great spot for families to hang out together. The towels were thick, abundant, and looked new. There's a shower and a bathtub. And, there was even a little Christmas tree! I loved staying here. The cottage is near the library, the Pony Express Museum, a leafy park, and an easy walk to the downtown area of this charming small town."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed 25 times for a total of 121 nights at The Cottage in the last year. Typically I stay 4 nights at a time. This has been a Godsend for me. Being away from home is hard, but this property makes it so much better. I am glad to be done with traveling but I am sad my time in the Cottage is over. Tom and Cindy are the best hosts ever. There were a few mishaps on my part and they were so understanding. The popcorn is magical. The cinnamon rolls are so wonderful. I have a thing for candy and they always have an ample supply for me. The puzzlers are a fun diversion. I solved all of them . . . .by looking them up on the internet. The property is pristine and seems to stay like new. If you treat this place like your home, it will feel more like home. You won’t find a better property on the AirBnB circuit. Cheers."

The name “cottage” kind of implies that it is small - we were worried about tiny rooms. We were wrong - it was very spacious inside, all looking recently remodeled, with very open and comfortable bathroom and kitchen spaces, super comfortable beds, etc. We would easily return again in the future."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the cottage and felt so at home at Tom and Cindy’s place! We wish we could have stayed longer. Safe, quiet neighborhood, great communication by hosts, and a well designed space. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was very comfortable & great location. We definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Central Nebraska.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is a delightful option for staying in Gothenburg. Tom and CIndy have thought of everything when it comes to furnishings and the well-stocked kitchen means you can actually cook a meal without lacking the necessary equipment/utensils. Everything is spotless and so welcoming. The location is quiet and peaceful and the town is charming. This is my second stay at the cottage and I will definitely return again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Book early and often. This is the hottest spot on I-80. Well worth the stay. Much better than a hotel and a great value.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place and a great value. Just off of I-80 for a night or a week or in my case even more. A quiet and caring community makes this a pleasant stay. Less than a mile away there is a state of the art YMCA with an indoor pool, gym, and modern exercise equipment. Anyone can use the facilities and a day pass is a nominal fee."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable cottage, very comfortable and with two bedrooms and two baths it was the perfect place for two couples to stay. We enjoyed the complimentary cinnamon rolls as well!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay last week. Looking forward to the upcoming week.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful as always. My home away from home. You've got to try the cinnamon rolls.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's hard to know where to begin with this place. Traveling long distances with tiny children is very difficult. There are very few opportunities for the adults to relax. This home, however, helps you feel relaxed right away.
Some toys were laid out, at eye level, for my children. As soon as we entered, they smiled and squealed and rushed right over to play. There were toys and a towel and a stool in the bathroom. My children were clamoring to get into the bath.
The house was so warm and welcoming. There were even homemade cinnamon rolls for us in the freezer and coloring books (with crayons) for my older daughter.
I can't say enough good things. We stopped here during a cross-country trip and might make a special trip to Nebraska again some day, just so we can come back to this home."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Loved it so much I decided to extend it a week.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem we found in this Storybook Cottage! Cindy and Tom have thought of everything. It’s clean, comfortable, beautiful and well stocked. We are so happy we booked it!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Storybook Cottage is by far the most welcoming home we have experienced. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible and makes for a comfortable, relaxing, enjoyable stay. Tom and Cindy have thought of everything to make their guests feel at home! It was a wonderful place for our family to gather during our time in Gothenburg."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down one of my favorite places!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom and Cindy are the best hosts. I stay here often.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I always enjoy my stays at The Cottage. I'll be back next week.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Truly a cottage right out of a fairytale storybook! The house is beautiful and very well done. Cindy and Tom knew we were coming with young children and left out books and some toys for them which were much appreciated. Convenient location. We hope to visit again and stay longer!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay! The town is very cool, lots of history and a park just around the corner from the house. Tom and Cindy are outstanding hosts. Over the last month, our family has stayed at about 20 homes across the United States through Airbnb. Tom and Cindy really have a handle on hospitality, providing an excellent and comfortable stay. Everything in this home is high quality, from the furniture to the finish work to the bedding. Absolutely recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is one of the best places we have stayed with Airbnb. Tom and Cindy have checked all the boxes to leave their guests worry free. Take them up on their cinnamon roll offer! Wonderful! Everything was superb. A special thanks to our hosts.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great property. I've been staying regularly. In a quiet neighborhood. Tom and Cindy keep a nice place. It is just wonderful.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This a beautiful remodeled cottage that was perfect for 2 couples who are old friends wanting a 2 day visit. You will not be disappointed with your stay at the Stoneybrook Cottage.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was fantastic for my daughter and her bridesmaids!!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We highly recommend Tom and Cindy’s cottage. We have stayed here twice and had a fantastic stay both times. They were easy to communicate with and their home had everything you need for a great stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage has a very comfortable and inviting feel. It was extremely clean. Tom and Cindy have added little touches that made our stay very homey. We would absolutely stay there again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice property. Everything was clean and beds were comfortable. Quiet area of town and had no problem getting a good night's sleep. Tom and Cindy were very quick to respond when we had questions.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed again on our trip back from Colorado - was perfect the first time around and even better the second!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is pristine. I am so thankful to have it in Gothenburg. Tom and Cindy are great hosts, very accomodating. In a great small community this is extremely quiet and peaceful. It feels like home."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tom and Cindy's place is absolutely charming! It has everything you need and so many cute decorations and details. The hosts were great about communicating information and were just generally super helpful and accommodating. I would 10/10 recommend staying here! (Also, the cinnamon rolls were so good!)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I don't know exactly how many airbnbs I've stayed in, but it's at least 50, and maybe 70 or 80. And seriously: I don't think I've ever seen a place as flawless as this one. I can't believe the amount of effort Tom and Cindy put into every little detail. It's indescribable.
Honestly, I've never seen anything quite like it. Sure, it's ""just"" a nice, renovated two-bedroom home in a small Nebraska town, but the level of care is mind-blowing. They've thought about HUNDREDS of little details. It's incredible.
I was tempted to put $100 in the snack/drink ""honesty jar"", just because. We were just passing through for a night, but we spent a bunch of time brainstorming excuses to spend a week in Gothenburg, just to stay here again.
I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll stop now. A huge tip of the cap to Tom and Cindy -- I'm an obsessive traveler whose life has been blessed by dozens of incredible hosts, but these two are at the top of the list."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the BEST place we have stayed. It was so clean and Tom/Cindy are very welcoming. Super cute house - and did I mention how clean it was?! Can’t wait to stay again. Very kid friendly!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tom and Cindy’s place is amazing. It is one of the nicest AirBNBs that we have ever stayed at! It is so nicely decorated and everything we needed was right there. It was all set up for our young son and it is great for families with toddlers. We would stay again in a heartbeat and very much recommend it to everyone who is looking.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tom and Cindy's home was lovely and comfortable. The rooms were spacious, and for a fee, they've included just about everything you could possibly have forgotten or need if you get in late and stores are closed. It's great to learn about their town from the books and maps they provide, too! They are very responsive and delightful to work with."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a pleasure to find myself in the midst of a charming small town neighborhood in a delightfully remodeled home. The house is better than the pictures, very clean and well lit. It's roomy and thoughtfully appointed, everything is like new. Having a private backyard and space to relax made my stay in Gothenburg so enjoyable. It was easy to walk to the main street in town, or stroll through the neighborhood, enjoy the local park, the lake, and take in the farmer's market. Tom and Cindy were spectacular hosts and I would highly recommend staying at their property!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at the cottage couldn’t have been more perfect as we visited the area to enjoy a round of golf. Everything was clean and comfortable upon our arrival and we had everything we needed in this cute little place. Definitely would stay here again when heading back that way. Thanks a bunch!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to stay the night. Very clean and just as described. Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The property is beautifully decorated and clean. A number of essential items and snacks are available for $1 each.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely adorable cottage! Beautifully remodeled. The hosts had thought of everything and were so helpful and responsive. Highly recommend!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time a Tom & Cindy’s home. The house is perfect for a one night stay or long vacation. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Very cute and accommodating! Lots of games which was perfect for the kids.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at the cottage and it was just as good as the first time. Gothenburg has great food just a couple blocks south of the cottage, and the cottage itself is so peaceful and relaxing."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space. I appreciated the good communication. The tiny screwdriver was a extra plus for my grandchild's bubble gun battery replacement. Thanks again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"best place to stay in Nebraska, hands down"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed! There were so many thoughtful touches that made our stay feel special. It was a clean, cozy, joyful place to stay. We are already planning to visit Gothenburg again just so we can stay here. :) Absolutely perfect place to stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, super comfy home. Great place to stay with a young child thanks to the care Cindy and Tom take to make the place kid friendly!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cozy feel. The home made you feel relaxed with its farmhouse vibe. Very clean. The little patio area was a nice place to read a book. Kids loved the board games. Also the town is very nice and we enjoyed the parks, which are in walking distance. Coffee bar was a bonus as well! The owners have put a lot of work into the details of this home which makes you feel right at home. We stayed with 5 people. My husband and I stayed in the master, our 15 year old was in the 2nd bedroom, our 9 year old slept on the pull out and our 7 year old slept on the couch. Plenty of room for us all. A great stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this charming cottage decorated with love and care! Very convenient stop off on I-80 on our road trip! Very nice community and friendly people! Hosts were good communicators and left detailed instructions. Cozy sunroom to read, many games to play and just around the corner to the Pony Express museum. Highly recommend!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication from owners. Very timely with information, key codes, etc.. Complementary cinnamon rolls are great! Very clean, good value. Restaurants nearby are walkable. Grill is available, and full kitchen. We will stay here again if back in Gothenburg."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gorgeous home! So clean and welcoming. Comfortable beds. Lots of space. We had cookies and cinnamon rolls waiting for our arrival. Super yummy! This is a wonderful place to stay along I-80.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean! Adorable house with more space than the pictures can do it justice! Would definitely recommend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,WOW! What a beautiful home! It is expertly decorated from top to bottom and very comfortable. The owners have thought of everything even snacks and fresh cinnamon rolls! We enjoyed our stay and wish we could have stayed longer.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We decided to stay here on our way to Colorado. The house exceeded our expectations - beautifully updated, spacious, and tastefully decorated. We had everything we needed to cook our own food and relax. It felt quiet and safe here. We rode our bikes around the little town and were just blocks away from a nice park and the grocery store. The hosts have made this place very special and I would recommend it to anyone!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had a really wonderful stay at the Storybook Cottage. The house was sparkling clean and the hosts were so generous and thoughtful. We would for sure stay here again when traveling through this area.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tom and Cindy have a beautiful home in a beautiful Midwest small town. Plenty of space and amenities for sure. If you’re needing a place to stay in westish central Nebraska skip Kearney and make this your stop!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tom and Cindy were the best hosts I’ve ever had! they went above what you would expect from a good host. The place also exceeded my expectations and I really enjoyed my stay with Fresh complementary cinnamon Rolls and cookies

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cozy place to stay and very family friendly!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding accommodation!

Clean Comfortable Convenient
Just terrific!
Thanks so much for letting us stay there.
Ken"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I am not sure any review is sufficient enough for this utterly charming cottage. It is truly one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed at. It has amenities and thoughtful touches that properties 3x this price don’t have. There is simply not a single thing they can do to improve this property. We had 3 adults and more than enough room and the bathrooms were just the cutest and well thought out. Thank you for everything!!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is very homey and Tom and Cindy were great hosts. We'd been in the car all day with little ones and were delighted to find they'd set up a crib, high chair, and plenty of kids toys!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cottage was just the cutest, coziest, cleanest Airbnb. Everything was perfect and communication was A+. Loved it so much we’re staying there again on our way back home next week. There always seems to be something a host could do to improve the experience but honestly I can’t think of a single thing they could do differently. Perfect size for three adults!!
Thank you!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fairytale setting and rockstar treatment ! Over the top amenities and the best night sleep I have ever had. Magical improvement from road trip aches and pains. Thank you Cindy and Tom for creating a ‘real’ storybook experience !
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You guys are the best, I truly appreciate you."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stylish space with lots of nice touches.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cottage is beautiful! Nice and clean and nicely decorated. We had a great stay and would love to come here again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at the Storybook Cottage and again, it was exceptional!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful place to stay in a charming small town. The rooms are more spacious than they appear in the photos and the house is perfectly outfitted with everything you will need. It's in a quiet location and the neighbors are extremely friendly. We came to watch the sandhill cranes and while we had to drive a bit to the viewing locations, Gothenburg is perfectly situated for easy access to North Platte and Kearney. In fact, it was better staying in a quiet town with downhome appeal than going to a more generic larger town. Tom and Cindy did an excellent job of welcoming us and communicating clearly about the rules, amenities, etc. I also believe it would be a nice place to bring kids as the streets are very quiet and there a couple of nearby parks. I recommend the Storybook Cottage without reservation!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t recommend this home enough! For families with kids, the hosts have thought of everything (night lights in the bathrooms, toys and games for little ones, chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls, kid-friendly utensils and plates, I could go on and on...). The hosts are super considerate and you can tell they put a ton of thought into making sure guests have everything they might need or want (there were 6+ flavors of coffee creamer!). It’s really above and beyond. To top it off, the home is beautiful, recently renovated, cozy, and immaculately clean!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’ve probably stayed at 20-25 Airbnbs and this is in the top 2-3. Completely new remodeled space, lots of room, well equipped kitchen, Smart TV, good beds, charming area of Gothenburg with many historic homes that have clearly been updated (not every one but many or most). Communications was perfect, easy check-in, lots of signage & local information, back-up options for food, bath supplies etc. You can stop looking - just book it!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to stay. Super clean, cozy and safe. A home away from home!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at Tom and Cindy’s! A winter storm delayed us on our road trip across the country and we ended up needing to stay in Gothenburg longer than planned — Tom and Cindy were extremely helpful and accommodating, and their home was a beautiful and cozy respite for the weekend. Immaculately clean with so many lovely personal touches like the cinnamon rolls and Tom’s handmade wood bowls. Thanks for making us feel so welcome during what could have been a very stressful situation!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a nice place! On a cross country trip, it was time to stop driving for the day and we found Tom's place. We were overwhelmed with how nice it is: everything is brand new, stylish, comfortable, and they thought of everything. One of the nicest Airbnb's we've ever stayed at! The town was absolutely adorable and extremely convenient to the interstate. Thanks for sharing your house with us!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"It’s pet friendly which is great. Only stayed one night, not sure I could have stayed longer. The queen bed is extremely firm. I like a firm bed but I felt like I was sleeping on the floor. Also it is an older house with a basement, so it has an old house smell."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great comfortable stay at this home. It was a very quiet neighborhood at night. Easy access to the main highway. Had a nice little back yard. The host was super responsive and very friendly! I would recommend a stay here.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. The four us had a great time.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Although I only stayed one night, as this was part of a week long road trip with my dog, we both appreciated the space. As soon as I walked in I felt at ease. I loved the open living/dining area, my dog enjoyed the fenced in yard which was larger than I expected. The hosts even had poop bags by the back door. Having access to a washer and dryer in the middle of my trip came in handy, and the kitchen was perfect for a home cooked meal on the road. It was located close to a grocery store and several parks, we took advantage of the Lake Helen Recreation Area, once on arrival just as the sun was setting, and then again in the morning before we got on the road. Check in and check out were easy and the hosts were easy to communicate with."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect stop for our large family and pets, we would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Very firm bed and I loved how minimal the clean-up instructions were. Will stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here! Great location, comfy and clean house. The back yard was so nice for our dogs. The hosts were so thoughtful and kind, would definitely stay here again if in the area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Quiet, clean, comfortable and felt right at home as always!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is very nice, clean and pleasant. Would stay there again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great place
would stay again"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house was so cute and had all the amenities we needed! Great place to crash for the night.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another enjoyable stay here! Comfortable, quiet, clean and you feel right at home. Hayley is a wonderful host! Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed - thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute old house, and you can tell they've put time and energy on it. Slept great on a quality bed. Dog friendly too!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older home near a railroad track. Perfect space for family and friends to sit and visit. You can set up a snack buffet on the cute pull up sideboard/buffet in the dining area. There are games galore to play in that sideboard/buffet also. I really wanted to play Hedbanz, yet we were there for a funeral so really did not have time for that and no children under forty were with us. All you need to prepare and serve a meal. Being older and a little challenged in the 'Airbnb App' check-in process (the fewer Apps the better for me) we did need a little help from Hosts to get inside. Easy enough since their phone numbers are on the site where I found the airbnb. I would book this again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and warm with comfortable furnishings and lots of space. Very clean and great amenities.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful hosts, felt right at home, we would definitely stay again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was perfect for a quick night's sleep on a road trip. It's right off the 80 and even had a fenced in back yard for our fur babies!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Day 2 of a road trip from LA to Chicago and this was a perfect stop. It was a great house in a quiet neighborhood. It was nice to have access to a backyard for my dog to wander a bit after spending a day in the car. Felt at home and it was a great reset before hitting the road again. Would come back again next time I make the drive home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great stop for us in our travels! The bungalow was so clean and comfortable for us. Our dog loved the back yard too! Thank you so much and will highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute and adorable place! Felt right at home! Absolutely enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone who is looking or considering to stay here!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It's only a mile off 80
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, friendly and responsive hosts, and a quiet neighborhood. We will definitely be coming back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tony and Hayley’s place was perfect for what we needed - a quick stop on our way across I-80 for us and our two fur babies. The hosts were very communicative and provided all the necessary information. The fenced in backyard was perfect for our pup to let some energy out after a long drive, and all pet necessities were provided, including poop bags and even treats for both our dog and kitty cat! The keurig was amazing to have in the morning since we left around 6am and no coffee places were open yet. Oh and it was so nice to not have any check out chores!!! Hosts made our stay so easy and relaxing :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice house with very responsive and friendly hosts. Made the stay very easy.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy little home is private, affordable, and available for 1 night stays. It is uncluttered, but well stocked, and has no housekeeping duties. We did not mind the rumble and whistle of distant trains. We definitely hope to stay again, and it's nice to know that a furry family member would be welcome!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here on our way to and back from Colorado. Great midpoint for us. Loved the fact the dog could stay. Cheaper than a hotel and more private. No extra chores to do. Great spot.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean place to stay, with highway nearby, so worked well for an overnight as we were driving out to Colorado from Ohio. Nice to have a fenced in yard for our dog and the dog treats were a lovely touch! Owners very friendly in their communications. Beds were comfortable. Kitchen was well equipped so that we were able to cook our dinner once we arrived. Close to the small downtown area, so we were able to walk to the coffee shop in the morning before heading out."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dog friendly, huge perk! The fenced in backyard was such a nice break for our dog on our way to Colorado. Would absolutely stay here again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tony and Hayley's place is awesome, especially if traveling with dogs! They have a very nice fenced yard and pups got some zoomies in during travel. They have thought of several details including poop bags and treats on counter.
The house is very peaceful and relaxing. It is quite close to a large plant or something. When outside, there is a low hum/noise, but did not scare my dogs. Inside, you cannot hear it.
Furniture and bedding are all very clean and comfortable. We tend to use kitchen a bit and it was very clean with all we needed. A working full size fridge and freezer.
Super cute coffee shop near interstate, Lasso Coffee, that has alternative milks and decaf espresso! Often hard to find in middle America.
A really great stay, I just wish we had more time to enjoy the space and the town. Arrival was much later than expected and were on road by 10.
Overall a fantastic place to stay, especially with fur babies!!"

My pets usually bark some when at a new place and constantly fidgety, but this place made them comfortable and quiet.
I would recommend their place 💯 and would love to stay there again if needed.
You will not be disappointed!!!!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice pet friendly place to stay during our road trip with responsive hosts. The neighbors do have an off leash dog that charged at our dog so just a heads up for reactive dog owners! It was convenient having a fenced yard and the couch was very comfortable.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect stop for our road trip from Ohio to Wyoming. An easy stop off I-80. Plus it was dog friendly! Huge win for us having 2 Saint Bernards. They were right at home in the fenced in back yard.
The home was extremely clean, and not cluttered like some airbnbs. We were only really there to sleep, but would definitely have used the kitchen and living room if we had time. Everything was clean and comfortable.
The hosts were also fantastic! Super responsive and very kind, but what else could you expect from other dog lovers :)
Would highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house has potential - currently has no personality (plain) but would do well with some decor (show ur personality - visitors enjoy that!). The neighborhood isn't the best but it is safe (would be nice if you could get the neighbor to clean up the junk in their backyard since you can see if from your yard). Overall, it is fine for a short visit."

We would stay in any home Tony and Hayley manage. Their thoughtful attention to detail is obvious.
My 95 y/o mother could move easily through each room with her walker (minus the bathroom - but she had everything she needed within reach and didn’t need her walker there).
Every room is super clean and well stocked with nice dishes, pots and pans, bedding, and towels.
This well appointed older home is lovely with high ceilings and minimal decor. We also had plenty of space to bring in our coolers and luggage.
This home is just what we always hope for when scheduling a stay through Airbnb."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The bungalow is a nice spot for a stay-over - it was a perfect overnight place for us on our cross country trip. We really appreciated the firm and comfortable mattress and a lovely hot shower. Always nice to have a place to make our coffee in the morning! Close to I-80.

The house itself is truly a delight, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere that makes it the perfect place to relax and unwind. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is fully equipped, and the living area is spacious and comfortable. I especially loved the charming 1930's decor and rustic touches that really capture the essence of the Nebraska countryside.
The location of this rental is also second to none. Surrounded by stunning natural beauty and some of the most picturesque landscapes that the state offers, it's the perfect place to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and immerse yourself in the tranquility of the great outdoors.
They say Nebraska isn't for everyone, but I think it is now for me."

The house even went past out expectations! We look forward to making other trips to stay at Grandma Betty's Place! As a Chef, I LOVED the kitchen. If I had had more time, I could have cooked even more than I did in that kitchen.
Such a comfortable home and farm with a view that would inspire an artist to paint!"

Tricia's Airbnb was a perfect location for both fun activities! From the get-go Tricia responded to my email questions promptly. The Airbnb was clean, very comfortable, and was located about 7 miles outside downtown Kearney so it was wonderfully quiet. Tricia told me in advance that there were about 3 miles of unpaved road leading to her neighborhood so we were prepared for that. There were flyers in the living room re: the Sand Hill Crane migration, local things to see and do which were helpful. The major migration viewing spots and good restaurants were all within 10 miles of the Airbnb! Unfortunately, I got sick one of the nights we were there. Tricia handled the situation very kindly and fairly. SO grateful there was a stack washer/dryer in the bathroom! Treat yourself and stay at Tricia's place! You'll be glad you did!"

The beds were ok. Not terrible by any means but not the most comfortable either. Just needed a place to sleep for the night so it was perfect for that.
The keyless entry is not lit up and I struggled at first to punch in the code without hitting a number to light up the keypad. But once I figured out that was what I was doing, I was able to get right in."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I would recommend and stay again, anytime! The listing is safe, peaceful, and offers you everything you need. I booked this during a travel nurse assignment working night shift and had no problems getting the rest I needed! The washer and dryer were a huge plus! I did puzzles at the table in my spare time, watched hockey on the ESPN app, but the best part was seeing all the stars at night!! Tricia and her family were so nice, and always a text away. No complaints here."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place in Eustis is such a cute home with original hard wood flooring, and neat layout.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super chill place in small town Nebraska! 👌
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ok first of all it was pouring down rain! Dark and hard to see. Nobody's fault but made it hard to find.
Karen's place is comfortable. The space was welcoming, the shower nice, and the bed ok. KriKet, our fur-daughter, loved the pet friendly atmosphere!
The surroundings appeared discoverable... I guess? And another time we might enjoying spending more time. We were hauling antiques cross country so not a lot of time to dally. It seemed _way_ off I80 and take food because (and maybe it was because of the horrible storm, but) no food. Nothing at all to eat.
The stay was worth the money, though. If you're on a budget, it's perfect."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I'd book this place in a heart beat
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very helpful, responsive, friendly host. The house is old and a little rickety, doors may not latch and stay shut in bedrooms or bathroom, but still a fine stay in a nice small town with great restaurants nearby."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute house. Wonderful place to sleep and refresh on our trip.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay in Eustis! Karen had tons of thoughtful items (q-tips, make up remover, umbrellas, etc) available for use, the space had a great cozy vibe and the beds were great! Check in was easy but the check out was by far the easiest out of any Air Bnb I've stayed at! And for a price that couldn't be beat!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved all the thoughtful personal touches. The host was a good communicator. We went 20 min away for breakfast and dinner in Cozad; The town was super cute with a surprising amount of dining options. Overall great/easy stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, great host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The right place for the right price! I was on a cross country road trip and needed a place to stop over for the night. Karen’s place was cozy and just what I needed and the price is right! If you’re planning to arrive late (like I did) the best sure to get food off the highway. Places close early and are very limited. It’s an old house but clean and comfortable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stop on our way through Nebraska, Karen had a lot of thoughtful amenities. It’s always nice to have a spot that allows pets too!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little place to stay. It is on the older side but still a nice little host. Perfect for our family who was traveling on a long road trip.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adequate for a quick stop on a road trip, be careful with the weather, snow made it very difficult to get out of the driveway even with a 4 wheel drive car, especially with no snow shovel available."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was wonderful. Very responsive and gave local grocery recommendations for me. The house was spacious and clean, had all we needed and then some for the night. The bed was very comfortable and the linens smelled lovely. The extra little amenities were a really nice touch. Thoughtful.
I love that she is a 5th gen farmer/rancher! And branching out with new opportunities. Yessss Karen! ❤️
We arrived late and my gps didn’t take us to the house, Karen returned my call immediately and talked me through it.
As for the “bugs” a guest commented on….goodness gracious. Different seasons and different states bring different critters. I saw one on my stay. And, it’s a bug. I hope this doesn’t keep you from a good little spot with an amazing host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great little place and the beds were so comfortable
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karen’s place was absolutely amazing ! The pictures don’t even begin to show how beautiful this place is and how much work has gone into this home ! Will absolutely be back and recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was so great about making our check-in as easy as possible! She reached out ahead of time to find out our travel plans, gave clear instructions and was very friendly! The place was perfect for us and our two pups traveling cross country. A comfy, private and spacious spot!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect stay for us! Karen was amazing to work with and made the most of all the space she has. Would totally recommend to anyone!
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was really taken aback by the number of bugs -both dead and alive- in every room. If this isn’t able to be managed or controlled better, it really should be stated in the listing. The fridge was also filthy inside, and when I went to grab a bowl to give my dog water, it was visibly dirty. I’m a side sleeper and didn’t find the bed comfortable at all; I was up more than once with pain in my hips. Had I been staying more than one night, I would have asked for cleaning, but I arrived after midnight and it wasn’t worth it.
I did appreciate that Karen allows dogs and quickly agreed to checking out an hour late. While Karen was kind and checked in, each time she did so she mentioned a five-star rating which made me feel that she valued that over important my actual comfort.
It’s a just-ok place to crash for a night but wouldn’t recommend it for longer than that."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Karen’s place was perfect for our stay in Eustis. Lots of history to be found in Eustis and it was fun to walk into town. We only stayed in bedroom closest to back door and the bed was very comfy. Kitchen had everything we needed to be right at home. Karen’s extra details could be found thru out the house. She was very prompt at communicating when needed. I’d recommend staying here if you’re passing through the area.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great price for a place to crash for the night.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great Airbnb. I'll be back!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen provided so many amenities that it was the best stay I’ve had on Airbnb.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! Plenty of room and privacy. We didn’t bring our pets but we have the option to which is nice and we will keep that in mind for next time. Host was quick to respond.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Was in town for work at the school. Great place for us to stay. Everything was as mentioned. Great food downtown. Overall great stay. Thanks
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoy staying here for work when in Eustis, it’s conveniently located to downtown which makes it very convenient the place is clean the hostess is friendly plenty of parking highly recommended"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen, I HAVE to leave you a review... You are an amazing human being! Long story short, i was traveling home pulling a horse trailer. Absolutely exhausted. Made a last minute reservation, so excited for a bed and a chance to rest. Karen made arrangements for my horse and where i could park my rig. Everything was set. An hour from Eustis, my wheel bearing took it's last breath/turn. I'm dead in the water. Karen went completely out of her way in reimbursing my last minute stay, contacted a friend who recommended a mechanic. She was so willing to help where she could and make sure my animals and I were good.
So, thank you, from the bottom of my heart! I pray God blesses you in return for you blessing me, even tho i didn't get to stay in your lovely home there. ❤️😉"
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was a great host and very quick to respond. It was dark when we arrived so difficult to see the place but Karen responded right away with instructions. There were no curtains in the kitchen area, that looked into where the bathroom was. One of the windows didn’t lock, and the closet door and bedroom door didn’t fully shut. Overall we were just looking for a place to sleep to breakup our long road trip, so for that it was fine."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and cozy.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karen’s place was great, price, cleanliness, and nice amenities. Great communication. Appreciate it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to stay for the night. We are driving across country with our dog and so many hotels wanted to charge us a bunch extra for our dog so we opted for an air bnb. We were a little hesitant at first because this place is newer and did not have as many reviews, but we were throughly impressed. Karen was very quick to answer questions and confirm our booking. The house was very clean and she had many helpful things in the house such as some snacks and toiletries. We were very impressed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t thank Karen enough for providing such a great, comfortable stay for my dog and me on short notice over the Thanksgiving holiday. She was super responsive, friendly and committed to making sure we enjoyed a top-notch experience. Everything from the comfy bed and fully stocked kitchen to the washer/dryer and numerous special touches made the place feel like a home away from home. Karen has truly thought of everything to make her guests feel welcome. I enjoyed the peace and quiet of the small town, but also liked knowing that groceries and gas were just a few blocks away if I needed supplies. It was a blast staying at Karen’s place, and I hope to book again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only spent a night here, but wish we could have stayed longer! Super hospitable host and had everything that we needed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I were passing through and needed a clean safe place for the night. We were coming in late and Karen was extremely responsive and told us exactly how to get in.
The house was adorable and clean, linens were fresh, and the beds were super comfortable. She left a frozen pizza in the freezer and a sweet note saying that since we were coming in late she wanted to make sure we had food in case we hadn't eaten.
We were the first people to stay here, so the house is still being worked on, but even with that it's stay ready.
Definitely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend to friends and family. Country hospitality at its finest."
,,,"Booked (2/26) same-day, traveling thru NE. Location worked & ratings seemed good. Arrived 9pm-ish. A bit later, found live bugs near & then dead bugs behind couch. I messaged Karen checkout day (2/27) & mentioned the bugs in a friendly, respectful way & gave her the benefit of the doubt as a newer listing/host. The app showed she read my message- but no reply.
9 days later, still no reply, so I msgd her again, w/pics. (Upon closer look, reviews show other incidents.) Karen finally replied (3/8) & apologized for the bugs. But also wrote paragraphs of negative comments—deflecting the real issue -with false & insulting claims about us as guests. And, boasted about herself & listing. Made 0 attempt to resolve.
What could’ve been solved easily w/ a prompt reply, apology & small effort, turned into a big headache for me. Thankfully Abnb Support resolved the issue. Due to Karen’s choice to ignore the issue & then 10+ days later, respond negatively & defensively, I would not recommend."
