My niece graduated w/ her masters as well as finishing up her softball career at MSU and having a home that we were able to gather & fellowship was AWESOME.
House has a great open concept. Rooms are huge beds comfy each room has a bathroom either as an en suite or right next to it. Patio is a great place to hang - watch TV - and with the outdoor sink & grill can enjoy bbq'ing-plenty of parking - well thought out floor plan.

Marisol is a FABULOUS host. She's well stocked on ALL essentials- she even has snacks/coffee pods/condiments/etc
We accidentally locked ourselves out and it was late at night, she sent help over to rescue us - 5 minutes tops!
If I can give this place a 10 STAR rating I would - stay here - YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!

We were challenged with the loss of a loved one during this time and Marisol's attention to detail and the beauty and comfort of her home as well as her expressions of compassion added consolation for us. We truly felt at home. She went above and beyond as a host and we are truly grateful.
The neighborhood was also a quiet street, very convenient to any additional items we needed. Can't thank her enough. Hope the house is open when we return to visit family or an MSU game."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tyler's place is very accessible and surprisingly quiet, given the central location. Parking is very specific, but not bad once you understand the instructions (Tyler clearly spells these out). The pool is shallow- only 3.5' at it's deepest point - but perfect for little ones to play in and the gym key is provided in the condo. The beds are comfortable and it doesn't feel like Tyler used cheap furnishings as some AirBNB hosts do - this feels like Tyler takes pride in his place and cares about his guest's comfort."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! While small, the space was exactly what we needed with a comfortable seating area, internet connected TV and well-equipped kitchen. The hosts were very responsive and clearly communicated the location, how to get in the place for check-in, etc.
We also loved the convenience of the location and walked several places. It should be no surprise that late night weekend music from the District can be loud enough to hear clearly, and not everyone walking home at the wee hours are at their quietest. But that didn‚Äôt detract from our overall appreciation of the experience and we would definitely return and recommend it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first visit to Starkville and I was very impressed with Amanda & Brian‚Äôs hospitality and their fantastic cottage. I immediately felt at home and relaxed, especially with all of the clean spaces and cozy furnishings.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was in a great location but a little hard to find. Everything was within walking distance. The street was quiet but the people staying next door woke us up at 1 am being loud which has nothing to do with the host because they have clear rules for quiet time.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Frances was great. I had to book last minute due to an emergency situation and I had booking info within 10-15 minutes and was able to be at the BNB right as I got the info. Due to the situation (had a pet getting an emergency surgery at the Vet school), she accommodated great due to my needs. I requested a late checkout and she replied instantly and accommodated. I booked during a very high stress moment and she made it so easy. I am not sure I have ever had this smooth of an experience. Also, since I wasn‚Äôt planning on staying overnight in Starkville I did not have all my necessities but the studio had everything! (Detergent pods, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and all personal hygiene necessities). Also, after a very stressful day, we went to map the nearest restaurant & found out we were within walking distance of all the top rated restaurants! Will definitely be booking again when in Starkville. Made it such a stress free experience during such a stressful time."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute studio apartment in a fun neighborhood! Walkable to the Cotton District and downtown (about 15 mins). Clean, private, quiet, comfortable! Would definitely stay again!
(FYI: If you have a full-size truck or similar-size vehicle, you'll have to park around the corner with street parking because there's not much room in the provided parking lot on site, but it was a quick/safe walk.)"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this cozy studio apartment in the heart of Starkville, and it was fantastic! The location is perfect, right in the lively college town atmosphere. The studio is well-designed and makes excellent use of space. It's equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay, from a fully stocked kitchenette to a comfortable bed. The decor is modern and inviting, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Frances made sure the apartment was warm upon our arrival. One of the highlights is the proximity to the college campus and local attractions. Whether you're a student, visiting for a game day, or just exploring Starkville, this place is ideal. The host was incredibly responsive and accommodating, making the check-in/check-out process seamless. I would recommend backing in the parking spot vs pulling in, just makes things easier if the parking lot is full. Overall, I highly recommend this studio for anyone visiting Starkville."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"When arriving in the dark, it can a little tricky to find the entrance to the apt door. I don't think there is much more detail that could be added in their description, just have to work through and would suggest having a flashlight handy once you go through the iron gate into the covered breezeway. If the light in that area is off, it's very dark to find the steps. Slight hiccups in alloted parking spot being available but host was responsive in alternatives. It's a shared apt building so neighboring units could be heard relatively easily. Might be something to be considered if light sleeper. All in all, very good value and responsive hosts were much appreciated."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great studio for me while I was in town working.

Perfect location right near the cotton district and the neighbors are really cool. The privacy of the space is very nice under a covered walkway and plenty of parking nearby.

Thank you so much for a comfortable stay!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It waa a nice place to stay. Clean and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our trip and family of 4. The home is tucked away in a little loop of houses and is very private. No noisy neighborhood!!!! The home is actually much larger than the pictures show. We loved the open floor plan and I especially loved the decor. It was very nice and also very homey and old timey (some decor) at the same time. My 19 year old said his bed was the best one he has ever slept in, and that the wifi was excellent. He would watch YouTube on his phone all night and we all know how important that is. Haha.
The master shower was AMAZING!! We are so jealous that we didn‚Äôt do that same shower head style on our home!
The location was ideal. We went for MSU orientation and we were only 1.5 miles from the student union. We went out to eat each night and only drove 1.5 miles out for either place!! Umi (?) habachi and then Georgia Blue. Both were very easy to get to, get into, and the food was great!
We would definitely book here again!"

The only problem we had with our stay was that the previous guests had smoked and we were not made aware of the strong smell, nor was there a successful attempt to get rid of the smell. Additionally, the owner did not offer any discount; only telling me where the Fabreeze was to try to mask the smell, which was not successful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really flexible timing on a short note. Cozy and clean.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My son and I stayed here while visiting Mississippi State for spring preview day. Everything was clean and modern. The beds were comfortable including the pillows. To get to the condo, you will need to turn in-between two brick buildings/condos. It is not on the main road like the nav system will try to navigate you to it. There are also two condos in front of it that has a walkway to this one. It was quiet, and also walking distance to different restaurants. We were happy with the accommodations. Jarrod was helpful and responsive to questions and had some great recommendations to places to eat."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a two night stay while my daughter interviewed for the Vet School program. Stressful in itself this little place was perfect. It gave us ample space with individual bedrooms (best beds ever) and a place for her to study while I sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine.
They provide everything that you need from soaps and shampoos to coffee pods in the kitchen. There is a list of great spots to visit and restaurants. We tried two of the recommendations and they were really good.
If we're lucky enough to get into MSU - this will be our regular place to stay."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot for walking to restaurants and campus! It was far enough back from the main road to be quiet and private. Such a cute and comfortable space. The bed was very comfy! Lots of coffee! Jarrod was friendly and easy to communicate with. I will definitely stay here again if I‚Äôm in the area. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a game weekend‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt beat the location !
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed here. You can NOT beat the location - and having two parking spots! Convenient walking distance to shopping, restaurants and campus. Be aware that there is night time music noise that can be heard from the ‚Äúdistrict‚Äù venues but it does not last all night."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great, but the bells from the church next door woke us up at 7am sharp each morning, which was a bummer since this was a trip for pleasure. I think they stopped ringing at 9pm and started right back up at 7am. Bells ring on the hour, every hour, with many rings in between. The church is literally next door, so it‚Äôs loud.
I know the bells are out of Jarrod‚Äôs control, but it would make me not stay here again. It‚Äôs disappointing because my son is a freshman, so I see us making many trips to Starkville over the next few years, and I‚Äôd love to stay here again.
Otherwise, the house was great! It‚Äôs walkable to anything in the Cotton District, has great amenities that make it feel like home, and the outdoor space was enjoyed due to nice weather while we were there."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. It was quite convenient to campus and restaurants. It was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.
#Hailstate!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great 100%
Location is awesome!! Tucked away out of sight."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay for the night as we dropped our daughter off at college. It‚Äôs very close to campus with restaurants within walking distance. Beautiful kitchen! We look forward to returning.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall our stay was great!
Pros: Jarrod was very responsive and provided good information about check-in/check-out and the area, including recommendations for restaurants, etc. The bedrooms were very comfortable, and there was lots of space. Being tucked away from the street, it's very quiet while still being super close to the Cotton District restaurants. There are some really nice updates in the home (counters, linens, furniture, etc.).
Cons: It was very humid when we were in town (not surprising for MS), and the air conditioning seemed to have trouble keeping the humidity inside the house at bay. The half bath is tucked under the stairs and may not be comfortable for taller guests (my kids loved it). Some minor repairs/updates would make this 5 stars!
Overall, it was a very good value for the cost!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay. Great location!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were very responsive and I loved that they gave recommendations for the area, we plan to stay here again when we return to see family!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place - clean, beds were super comfy, excellence coffee selection. Kitchen had everything we needed. Great location for going back and forth to MSU campus. There were ants in the kitchen, but I lived in Starkville for years and couldn't keep ants out. The house felt a little damp and the AC was loud, but I'm nitpicking. Great experience and I'll recommend the house to others."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location within walking distance of some neat restaurants and easy to get to MSU‚Äôs campus by car. Was here for work and would stay again.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time! Wonderful location! We parked our truck and walked everywhere.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, comfortable and very clean. It is tucked away, so it is quiet and feels private but it is walkable to the Cotton District restaurants/ bars. We would stay here again."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very convenient, you cannot beat the location. The place could use a little TLC, bathroom floor tiles loose, bathroom door handle fell off, WIFI was out, also bed sheets dirty with hair. We arrived in daylight so no issues, however outside lamppost doesn‚Äôt work and the house number not marked, thus could be hard to find in the dark."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"For being in a poplar running & evening entertainment area, it was surprisingly quiet.
Outdoor lighting at night needs work, would make one feel more secure & easier to fine the unit.
You may consider turning down the temp in hit water heater to 125¬∞ to conserve energy while still providing ample hot water for showers.
Minor ant issue that should be addressed by monthly pest control.
Minor HVAC maintenance would resolve odor issue.
All in all nice place & we enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for MSU orientation. My wife said several times how much she likes this condo. We‚Äôve looked at a bunch to buy and like this layout and location.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a Mississippi State alumni, Jarrod's place was absolutely perfect in everyway. It's located right in the Cotton District, close to The Bin, Two Brothers, campus, etc. but also a short walk to downtown where Restaurant Tyler and other fun Starkville spots are located. The place itself was incredible - the kitchen was of my dreams, and the details throughout the whole place were spectacular. There is a super cute patio off the kitchen that offers complete privacy for outdoor hangs. This will definitely be my go-to spot for any Starkville trip moving forward. Can't say enough about how great it was!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jarrod's place was nice. Great location. Easy walk to just about anywhere along University or toward downtown.
The unit itself was an older unit that's had some refurbishing done.
If you're looking for a quiet stay, this is not the place for you. Lots of noise on the street until late at night because you're surrounded by college kids. If you can live with that, it's a good place in a great location.
Only complaint that I have really is that there were two parking places assigned to this unit, but nobody respects reserved parking spaces apparently, because both of my spots were parked in by kids hanging out in local apartments."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed this cozy spot to stay at while on a work trip! It was nice to be able to walk to dinner. Only negative was the parking was a little tight in my Mercedes sprinter. (Oversized vehicle) Definitely recommend!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good spot. Location was great. Clear instructions for everything!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was very cute and perfect for what we needed. You can tell they put a lot of money and time into updating it and making it cute. I really appreciate that they kept the place stocked with plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, laundry stuff, etc. My only complaint is that the cleaning crew did not do a good job at all. But all in all it was a very enjoyable stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just like the photos. Clean and cozy with very modern appliances. Throughly enjoyed our stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space is charming and has a lot of character! The kitchen has to be my favorite place in the home. I am frequently in the Starkville area , I look forward to potentially booking again in the near future"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place for a small group of people. Location is great for activities at Mississippi State University. The unit is well furnished for everything you will need for your stay. Plenty of restaurants and bars close by and within walking distance to the unit.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Starkville is usually a very busy college town! Our stay was holiday-weekend centric and the town was quiet and peaceful. Our stay was short, but it was apparent that this location is a convenient hot spot when the town is busy!"
