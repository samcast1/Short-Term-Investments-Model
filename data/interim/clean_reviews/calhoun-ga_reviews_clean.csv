2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing stay thank you for the amazing opportunity.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing place to get away and spend quality time with friends or family. Beautiful surroundings, peaceful environment, everything was very cleanly, and the hosts were super friendly and helpful! Would definitely come here again!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Small but cozy
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A nice, quiet little retreat. Enjoyed staying here on my way through the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,See you again. The peace in our land is beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic stay and hosts! Had the best family get away, can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful stay! The location is private/quiet and it was exactly what I needed to decompress and disconnect for a few days. The greenhouse was light & airy, well equipped and very comfortable. I enjoyed the covered porch on a rainy morning and the stroll around the pond. I would definitely stay here again! The host was super friendly and accommodating."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at The Greenhouse! We got in late and found everything as described – parking, courtesy lanterns to find our spot, peaceful chirping of crickets and croaking of a bullfrog, and the coziest little dwelling nestled into the woods.
The site was charming and cozy. The windows were left open, the fresh air was wonderful, and the temperature was perfect! We (and our pup) tucked in for the night and awoke to the sunrise and peaceful pond out our front window. We made coffee by the camp stove and enjoyed it by the fire pit. (We didn't take advantage of the provided firewood, but appreciated the fact that it was there if we wanted it!)
We sat enjoying ourselves thoroughly, discussed how fun it would be to come back with friends and rent out all three dwellings on the property, and dreamt of how dreamy hosting a fireside Thanksgiving feast would be here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay in the greenhouse so much! We fished, cooked dinner over the fire, and the best part was hanging out and making s’mores with the kids outside without tvs and tablets. We woke up the next morning and it was pouring. Lewis was so kind to give us a later check out for the rain to slack up so we could load our truck up. Staying here was the neatest experience and definitely recommend to anyone looking to get a small break from this crazy world. Thank y’all again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house is very cute and easy to find, and it’s not far from some beautiful places. The host is helpful and responsive. (And they allow pets - yay! :) Also the foot pump water dispenser is a plus. I did not have time to use the telescope, but I think that is a thoughtful addition. That said, some things to note. 1. The heat was just a portable buddy heater, rated safe for indoor use, but not really made for living quarters. Beware, it may shut off in the night and refuse to re-light. Turn it off before you sleep. 2. The kitchenette is actually a Coleman camping stove. Personally I think using one indoors is sketchy, though I guess it would be OK if you open the window/door. 3. If you are bringing food, know that the luggage cart provided will not accommodate any but the tiniest of coolers."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing trip, beautiful location, and great hosts. If you’re looking for a quiet little getaway away with access to fishing on the property it’s definitely the place for you. The little cabin was cozy and had everything we needed to be comfortable for a few days. The pond on site was loaded with some of the biggest bluegill and panfish I have ever caught and plenty of bass as well. We had a blast catching and releasing more fish than we could count over the course of our visit. Unfortunately due to bad weather we had to cut our stay short but we can’t wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Greenhouse was perfect for a weekend getaway. The tiny house was as listed, the instructions were clear and check-in was simple.
The area was private/peaceful and the pond was stocked with fish (catch and release).
The hosts went above and beyond for us during our stay, and I highly recommend working with Lewis & family. We will definitely be back! 🙂"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was amazing and the greenhouse was super cute and well stocked. My fiancé and I had a great time. It was very peaceful and there were so many bird songs. The fact that s’mores kits are provided was such a nice and tasty touch. The only thing to note is that the greenhouse is not quite as surrounded by trees as in the the photos suggest.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful area, very peaceful and great for weekend getaways. Host was super friendly and quick to answer questions."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place felt like a fairytale… They had everything you could possibly need for your stay, and the instructions were clear and in a wonderful notebook they provided. I highly recommend this place."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful spaces. Very peaceful and just what we needed to get away from the city for a night and enjoy being outside. The hosts thought of everything and you can tell the attention to detail was there. Made some good food on the fire, caught some fish, and looked at the moon through the telescope they had. Cool spot, will definitely return soon."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Magical location and stay. Feels quite secluded and cozy. Very nice touches to have a s’mores station and the space heater. Unfortunately the gas did run out in the morning for me, but I was able to switch out the propane tank without too much cold getting in."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy! Had everything we needed. Would love to stay here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful home. Would definitely be back. The photos don’t do it justice.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and cozy stay. The hosts were as nice as can be.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really peaceful, beautiful location, easy to find and good parking. Very nice to have a dry camping place while also providing a shared bathroom with hot water. Nice touches included firewood, heater, coffee, creamer, s’mores, telescope. Description and pictures are true to the Airbnb.
Stars were impeccable compared to when in the city. BBQ down the way was great. Mexican restaurant was good. Close by to larger town with fast food.
Close to Chattanooga as well"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great experience, we'll definitely return."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and cozy little place. I really appreciated all the small touches the host added to make it more homely.
I would absolutely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lewis checked in with me before booking to let me know of some changes and met me to make sure I had everything I needed—especially heat and lights since it was a cold night. Beautiful property, would stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lewis was extremely kind, welcoming and helpful. Guaranteed peace and quiet. Had everything we need. We were comfortably warm with the temperature in the low 30s. Really enjoyed a night of glamping."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay felt like a home away from home for the weekend. The hosts thought of absolutely everything to make this trip relaxing. We will definitely be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience! Exactly as pictured/advertised. Comfortable bed + I was warm and cozy even in 20 degree weather. Wonderful, friendly hosts who have clearly thought through every detail to curate excellent stays for their guests. These are rare, friendly folks with a lovely property! Well done! Thanks for hosting - I’ll definitely be back :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay in the green house! It was very peaceful. We had a little trouble with the heater, but the host was very responsive and helpful. Overall, we had a great time."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Very quiet and peaceful.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed for one night as a stopover on a long drive, but it was lovely and was a great alternative to a traditional hotel. Convenient location not far off the interstate, but still felt secluded. Very pretty. We stayed in winter and it is glamping. So we came prepared with some extra bedding and flashlights. We were warm and comfortable."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Totally wish we could have stayed longer! What a great getaway! It was exactly as described and was so peaceful and beautiful. Super cute tiny homes! We would love to go back with a few friends and enjoy all of their tiny cabins and stay longer!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute and comfy spot!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This peaceful little Georgia greenhouse gave us the perfect excuse to have a quiet getaway. Just as adorable as the pictures, this tiny home offers a comfy bed and roof over your head instead of a tent. It did get hot during the day, so utilize the fan provided!
I will say there were a lot of bugs (to be expected, as it's right at the edge of the woods) so bring that bug spray! Quite a few big spiders were seen.
We loved that this place was Dog Friendly so we going bring our Lab with us on this Georgia adventure.
My husband caught a couple fish in the pond (catch and release of course!) and we enjoyed the peaceful sounds of nature surrounding us.
This place is perfect for a 2 night stay in North Georgia. There isn't much around, so buy your supplies before you get there. There are no outlets in the greenhouse so bring a powerbank with you to charge any electronics.
Overall, we enjoyed our peaceful stay at Rolling Ridge!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed at Rolling Ridge only once before, but we’ve already agreed to make it a staple date night location. It’s quaint, comfy, and just far enough from the city to be able to disconnect for the night, then get to work on time the next day."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view and peaceful environment! Hosts were very friendly and accommodating. We were happy to have positive interactions/small talk but the hosts were not pushy or demanding of our time. The green house was exactly as photographed but also had comfortable beds to sleep in! Hosts thought to put out extra blankets, propane for the heater, firewood and offered s’mores, coffee and tea. Overall, a very good time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was magical. It was so beautiful and lots of fun. The hosts are also extremely nice and very and very quick to answer. We will be staying again for sure !

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Would go back a second time for sure! Beautiful surroundings and the money is worth the stay. The host will always be responsive and attentive at all times.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cutest little green house! (Very little!) peaceful and quiet. Our dogs had a great time and enjoyed checking out the property. 🐾 Our brown widow spider neighbor was also fun to watch. (please don’t kill her!) 🕸️
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pure perfection! Already planning my next stay!!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It was the one if the greatest finding of our last minute weekend staycation. Very quiet and “faraway from screen time” -cation for my kids.
The only thing was that we didn’t pack enough water so needed to ran just before dusk. Also, be ready to run out the phone battery. Recommending to check all the QR code instructions before losing all the phone batteries.
Fishing and fire pit was fun!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was so beautiful here! Hosts are wonderful and super friendly! Loved staying here for a night it was so beautiful and peaceful! The only thing is there is no AC (as expected, it is a tiny tiny greenhouse) so we were out during much of the daytime as it got very hot. Evenings and mornings were gorgeous and beautifully temperatured! Would stay here again, loved the place! Wonderful little getaway from home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! The tiny house is adorable and waking up to the sunrise with the windows was *chefs kiss*
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I will highly recommend this tiny house . For us was a romantic and peaceful gateway. We found everything that we need it . Love it . I will come back for sure
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lewis was very responsive and proactive about helping to make our stay comfortable and relaxing. The space was beautiful and there’s a lake right in front for fishing. Thank you Rolling Ridge for a great experience, I will be coming back to enjoy more of the space in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time! The property and her tiny house were beautiful. A family of three and a little dachshund slept comfortably. A set of s’mores was a really nice touch and we truly enjoyed it! Love the decor in the tiny house, it had everything we needed for a night away from home. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a really great stay. The hosts were very helpful and responsive. We can’t wait to come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful spot for a quiet getaway! Comfortable and clean, with a beautiful view of the property and close to several great hikes. The host was responsive and helpful as well. I really enjoyed my stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was amazing. The hosts were so nice and had a ton of great places to recommend during our stay. Love it and the air B and B was amazing too!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is just as magical as the photos! The hosts where very accommodating, allowing us to check in early which was very helpful to us. The inside was spotless. No bugs or spiders. We enjoyed having a fire and walking the pond and listening to the nature! We saw a group of turkeys that came by our site a few different times which was super cool. The stars are absolutely breathtaking at night. And we had a small lighting storm that was jaw dropping to see from inside!
Would recommend to anyone and definitely plan to come back but in the winter when it’s not so hot!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a cute little place! Great for a weekend getaway. Beautiful location, very clean and had all the amenities we needed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this peaceful getaway! You can hear frogs chirping and see lighting bugs at dusk. A warning for summer visitors, the cabin can get a bit hot during the day but opening the windows in the evening helps. Also if rainstorms pass through it can get a bit loud on the roof. But the view of the lighting through the windows was beautiful! The amenities were really thoughtful and it was a perfect place to disconnect and relax."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was incredible, the hosts were very accommodating. We asked if we could set off fireworks and they had a designated area for them. The environment was incredible"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I loved this place!! It’s very relaxing and able to escape from the city (but also in driving distance from Dalton / Calhoun, if needed). The owners responded very efficiently and were so nice to bring us fans and umbrellas when needed. We’ll most definitely be coming back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a great peaceful getaway. It really had everything you would need for a few nice “off grid” comfortable nights, but still close enough to stores.
The hosts were very responsive, and provided things such as a fan, lights and even a little camping set.
Would recommend this place without hesitation."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved it! So peaceful and relaxing. Well kept, clean and matched description to a t"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I spent our Birthday weekend at the Little Greenhouse. It was perfect very peaceful and relaxing. Decorated perfectly every thing was perfect. Hope to visit again soon.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good host
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very peaceful and quiet. 10/10 recommend. Clean, friendly host.
Cute little get away. Local recommendations were a great bonus, especially if not from the area.
Turkeys were interesting to encounter lol"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,She was a great host. Nice family to be around. Would like to go back with kids/grandkids
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great camping spot! Very private with a nice view. Loved staying here will definitely be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was exactly what I was expecting from when I booked. This place is absolutely adorable, I fell in love. I wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday fishing with my family, and that's exactly what I was able to do. They even recognized my birthday, which was so thoughtful! It was extremely clean and peaceful. Thank you for the amazing stay. I will definitely return. Also, I read a newspaper article about the family and the property and the plans you guys have, and I wish nothing but the best for you guys!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It's such a cute and quiet place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything as it is described! Loved being able to bring the pup, he had a blast! Appreciate the hose outside the bath house and the dog towel for his after romp bath! Bed was so comfy and cozy. Thanks for everything for a great weekend away!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little cabin, the perfect glamping experience. Would definitely come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely host and even better area! So peaceful.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Rolling ridge provided a relaxing environment in a quaint tiny-home
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place is extremely clean, very cute house."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We definitely enjoyed our stay at this property. My two sons (1 and 2 years old) and furbaby loved all the outdoor spaces. The host is very responsive and made us feel very welcome. We can’t wait to go back here :)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice get away from the city. Will definitely come back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was great! Exactly as pictured! We had fresh farm eggs and herbs waiting for us! Shannon was gracious and responded quickly! My family wanted to stay longer! Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an absolutely fabulous experience. Steers Place has everything going for it and the host (Shannon) could not be more gracious, very pleasant and extremely accommodating.
Steers was immaculately clean and neat, lacking for nothing.
I have stayed in many many 5 star hotels and or resorts. There is not a single one as great as Steers.
Additionally I was especially delighted with the bed and its linens. Extraordinary!!!!’
I will return again and again!!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this place and Shannon!!!! It was very peaceful and just an amazing environment!! We will definitely come back and stay! Even through the hard times of family passing away, I woke up with a smile on my face and being able to go outside and love on some animals made it even better❤️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved the cottage. What a wonderful place- very peaceful and easy to get in and out of. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My friends and I loved this cute little space. Definitely will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was fantastic! I was driving in after a long 10-hour drive and got in very late. The place can be difficult to find at night as the address provided sent me to an empty lot. No matter, though, because Shannon had sent me directions and pictures of the area at night so I could easily find my way! She was very communicative even late at night. The place was very comfortable and my dog enjoyed his morning walk saying hi to the cows and other animals on property. Luke, their ranch-hand, was also very welcoming and helpful. Very safe area in North Georgia."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was absolutely stunning in every way. Shannon did an amazing job and you can tell the heart and soul that was put into designing it and putting it together. The cottage has everything you need for cooking meals on the farm. You can also look outside the window and see bulls, donkeys and cows. I mean how often does one get to do that? I am very appreciative of Shannon letting me and Wednesday stay here. Shannon was very friendly, responsive and let me feed a calf! I only booked one night originally but Shannon was very flexible with adding another night. Thanks for such a wonderful experience, Shannon!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very pleased with everything about this place, it was perfect! Shannon had fresh farm eggs on the counter and a little note to welcome us. She was a great hostess, I would recommend this to everyone! She made us feel welcome, we truly felt like we were at home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing cabin and Shannon was an amazing host, Will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ready to get away from it all? GO HERE! This is the perfect place to unwind, enjoy nature, and soak up peace and tranquility. Also, you can bottle feed baby cows - how amazing is that?! We were also able to bring our dog with us and she loved the outdoors as much as we did. Finally, Shannon was absolutely the best! She was incredibly flexible with the check in time, responsive to our messages, and she even provided us with delicious farm fresh eggs (which we enjoyed on the porch in the morning). I can't recommend this place enough and I can't thank Shannon enough for her wonderful hospitality!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing little place, all the animals are so sweet and Shannon is a really great person and easy to get in touch with and really helpful. I would definitely come back"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful time. Thank you Shannon.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t say enough wonderful things about this listing!! Shannon is an amazing hostess and so easy to get in contact with. She opened up not only this adorable home to us but also her farm. We were able to meet the animals, and our son had the BEST time getting to feed the calves and look for eggs, which we got to take back with us! Farm fresh eggs are so good. Such a wholesome environment! The property was easy to find and access. There is a Dollar General just down the road so even though you are enjoying the country, you have quick access to essentials. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my very favorite airbnbs! Shannon was very welcoming and there were so many personal and thoughtful touches, like farm fresh eggs and she provided a dog bed for our pup. The kitchen was fully furnished and had everything we needed. It was such a peaceful and serene area. We went on several gorgeous hikes on trails nearby. I would happily stay again next time I’m in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start by saying that this was THE CLEANEST AirBNB that I have ever stayed in. Shannon has an eye for detail and everything was there that I needed. Farm fresh eggs greeted me along with cows, donkeys and geese! The surroundings were amazing…less than 2 miles from multiple waterfalls and crystal clear creeks. The sun setting over the mountain was beautiful and the 5 minute drive to the top of the mountain looking out over “The Pocket” was breathtaking. I never locked my doors. I just felt very safe here. I had no fear that my work equipment would get stolen. I can’t wait to bring my wife and kids back here. This is going to become a routine stay when I need to “get away”."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Second stay and again felt very welcomed
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a pleasure getting to know Gabriella and her family. she was a wonderful host with a beautiful home. I was hesitant at first due to her living in a subdivision and me working nightshift, buti slept comfortably with no issues. I definitely plan on staying with her again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were treated like family
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked a same day reservation and the host was quick to respond. The host’s communication was great. The stay was quiet and clean. I also had plenty of driveway space for secure parking. I would recommend this location.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for the beautiful accommodations! This place has been my favorite thus far! It was like getting a perfect salad from your favorite restaurant. The neighborhood is beautiful.
-Saundretta"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean and friendly place to stay. the price was half that of the hotels nearby and they even made me a delicious breakfast with dinner very tasty tea. best Air BNB experience I've had so far
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here! Everything was great! Her husband was there to greet us, even asked if we wanted something to eat when we got there! (Midnight!) So thoughtful!! If we are ever back in the area I would book for a 3rd time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you, Gabriela and Majid! You treated me like family during my whole stay. I would have loved to stay for more than one night. There is a great chance that I'll be through the area again soon and so I'll look forward to coming back again. To anyone reading this, I cannot recommend them enough, they are wonderful, wonderful hosts.
God bless you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I must say that gabriela and majid are the type of people you would love to stay with anyday! They were very welcoming, catering and made sure that I enjoyed the space and my time in Adairsville. On top of that there home is comftorable, private and spacious. Totally a 5 star rating! 😃"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gabriela’s house was very much to description! It was in a very nice housing plan. Felt right at home. She was very accommodating to my late arrival into their home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As a traveling nurse I always want to feel at home wherever I stay at and this was perfect.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. The hosts were always responsive and when we arrived they offered us a home cooked meal. Was delicious. Everything matched the descriptions and pictures. We just had a one night stay on our way through town and it was great. Hosts responded quickly to all messages. Would stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying here for the weekend was perfect for my boyfriend and I. We had our own space for us to relax in with it's own locked door which was nice. The hosts were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. I would stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Peaceful with nice outdoor options.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A unique and beautiful space. It is great for a quiet getaway
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Me and my fiancé loved the weekend get away. Super easy to find, great architecture and very unique. The hot tub was a great touch and the host was very responsive! Will definitely stay again 10/10!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time at the Tree house! The little details really stood out here. Thank you Jody!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"peaceful, will return"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful quiet tree house. Wonderful experience!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse stay is truly magical! It probably my top stay of all the Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Highly recommend this Airbnb! So peaceful and beautiful! They have everything you need to fill right at home! Super Great Host that makes everything easy for check in and check out!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are not enough words to describe how amazing this place is, absolutely incredible and breathtaking. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway or breaking up a long road trip like we did!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful location to relax! Jody‘s house is absolutely beautiful. The details and craftsmanship are something I’ve never seen before.! You can tell how much time and heart they put into the work of this house. The back porch is very relaxing! The swings are a great touch!
Thank you for a wonderful stay! We will certainly recommend your home to others!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spontaneous last minute stay for my partner and I. Nestled in the woods , we couldn’t get enough of the hammocks on the back porch and not to mention the hot tub. I’m sure this cabin is beautiful during the winter considering the fireplace available inside. The kitchen was well equipped and the grocery store was only 10 minutes up the road. We took a day trip to Chattanooga and rode the incline trolley up the mountain side. The aesthetic and architecture was very pleasing, we would return in a heartbeat and have already shared this listing with multiple family members and friends. Jody was very welcoming and answered any questions we had in a timely manner."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this place for our two year anniversary and it was perfect. About an hour and 15 minute drive to the Atlanta aquarium and plenty of good food options in the area even though the actual Airbnb is very secluded.
You can tell Jody, the host, really knows what she’s doing. We never had an issue with anything and we never had to reach out because she communicated the details about the trip so well. The treehouse was extremely clean (which was impressive being in the woods) and it was filled with a bunch of cool little activities and things to discover. My wife and I are in our mid 20s and we thought it was super fun, so I can’t imagine how much more fun kids would have exploring the cabin.
The back deck and hot tub were great. We saw a bunch of squirrels, a cardinal trying to make its nest on the porch, and a few deer run by while we were in the hot tub.
100% would recommend, we will be coming back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a magical place. We loved the treehouse and will definitely visit again, and tell all our friends."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Jody’s, and wish we could have enjoyed the space for longer."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice theme-built detailed home which is comfortable and fun to stay in
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a really well maintained place with amenities and supplies that are above others.
They put a lot of thought into curating and decorating the place. It’s cozy and different in a nice way.
I love the snack basket. My kids devoured that in now time! Also they have both regular and decaf coffee, and individually packed creamers are truly appreciated.
We use the maps provided and ventured around the areas.
Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Forester Treehouse was the absolute breath of fresh air my wife and I needed to unplug from the world for a couple of days. The treehouse was beautiful, thoughtfully decorated and serene. There was a wonderful rain storm one night and we fell asleep in the loft bed to the sound of the rain on the metal roof. Spent time in the swing chairs on the back porch and enjoyed the hot tub. Jody was so thoughtful. We arrived a few minutes early while Jody was still at the treehouse. She spent a few minutes with us and walked us through the space, sharing how the treehouse came to be and some of the materials that were used. We met our co-host, Edna, the next morning and was delighted to find out her name was originally Ed until she had puppies... now Ed is Edna, lol. The only issue we had was that we had not planned a long enough stay. We will be visiting again and will definitely stay longer than 2 nights. We felt comfortable and right at home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booked for my Son and his new bride and they said the place was perfect for their Honeymoon!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the FoResTree house. The cabin is beautiful and well decorated and outfitted. The hot tub was clean and easy to use. We enjoyed the indoor fireplace as well as the outdoor fire pit. The bed was comfortable and it was so cozy inside with the fireplace on! The patio was fantastic and we loved the swings for our morning coffee and breakfast. The location of the treehouse was not as private as I thought it would be, there are two other airbnbs close by on the property, but that did not matter to us! Thanks Jody for hosting us!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place love how I felt like I was at home and the host is great
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place! So much care has clearly been put into building and maintaining this treehouse. So clean, comfortable, and beautiful. A wonderful way to enjoy the woods."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful cabin with amazing decorations. peaceful and relaxing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The FoResTree House is a beautiful place to stay neat the city. The cabin is well preserved and close enough to restaurants and grocery stores. We loved the hot tub and the late night snacks basket they left for the guests. I'd love to come back to stay longer!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Treehouse was comfortable, very livable and quiet. I thoroughly enjoyed it"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Forest Tree house and would definitely stay here again. Peaceful but very close to the places we wanted to visit. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed staying here! Loved the amenities and little special touches that the home had. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet getaway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The FoResTree House is magical. I wish we could have stayed a week, but we were there just one night during a long road trip. I would absolutely go back if I was in the area. It's perfect for some quiet time away!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I read other reviews & pretty much everyone is spot on! Very clean, cozy w a real treehouse feel! Tree details r everywhere we looked! Welcome basket of snacks was a hit & so appreciated! The little touches don’t go unnoticed.
Being 100% wood floors & we had their sweet dog, Edna visit outside on the property it’s a bummer we weren’t able to bring our little guy but also understand the liability w allowing dogs in your home. Obviously that wasn’t a deal breaker by any means.
The host does live on the property as well as a shared drive w 2 other property’s
they rent out. In the summer there would be more privacy except for the one unit facing ours but not a a huge deal Just know your not deep in woods feel But still felt secluded enough. Jody and her husband were very quick to respond to any questions that we had before and during our stay. They do come to the house to personally welcome you which is nice but I never had that before so took me by surprise.
recommend 10/10 ⭐️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and beautiful surroundings!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a serene get away that is quiet and surrounded by nature, this is the place for you. I was not disappointed in this stay. Was very relaxed, easy to get to and most of all provided a quiet setting to get away from the world. The bed was super comfy. Host was very responsive. The ambiance felt just like the pictures."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really awesome place, very easy to check in and out. Jody was very responsive. My family and I enjoyed it so much! ❤️💯"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was one of the nicest Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in. It was perfect for a quick getaway from the city and was even more beautiful in person. Would definitely recommend this cozy cabin!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our first Treehouse stay, and it was AMAZING! The host goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to include ANYTHING you might need. As far as the space itself, the decorations are incredible, and if you don’t pay attention you may miss all this place has to offer. For example, the big tree in the living room lights up, which makes for an even better stay. The hot tub was perfect for the cold weather, and the book of restaurants and “things to do” were helpful. Will definitely be returning in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is magical. From the build to the decor it’s all effectively thought out. If recommend this place for a serene getaway in the woods. The cabin itself is welcoming and cozy but has a rustic whimsical charm and feel to it instead of a mountain feel. Truly beautiful and I can’t wait to retreat back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jodis ForesTree house is magical! everything you could possibly need is provided, everything is comfy, the surroundings are beautiful! 10 out of 10 would definitely stay again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a very relaxing time alone. Perfect little tree house. Thank you for opening your home. The sound of the pouring rain on the roof was amazing. I will stay again someday.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This host goes above and beyond anticipating her guests wants and needs. The place was like living out a childhood dream. It was artfully decorated and very comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem - probably one of the coolest Airbnbs I've ever stayed in! Everything is very detailed and organized. I love the booket, super helpful of things to do and restaurants to try!
It's so peaceful soaking in the hot tub and watching deers roam the woods in front of you!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here! Was such a beautiful spot for our weekend getaway and had everything we needed.

It was soooo beautiful
Great touches everywhere.
Treehouse with a hot tub and swings.
I was in love with the chair swings. I spent every chance I could get in them.
Jody & and her husband were very responsive and made sure I had everything I needed!
10/10 stay.
If you need some alone time to getaway and recharge definitely book Jody’s place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My childhood best friend and I booked. 1-night stay at the ForResTree House so we can have a catch-up girls night, and it was a dream! The space is beautiful and extremely well-done with fun quirky decor accents. The space was absolutely peaceful and just what these girlfriends needed. Thank you Jody for your hospitality, and I look forward to returning in the future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a fun relaxing stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Jody and Britt have created a truly exquisite escape where every detail is carefully thought out. The wood art and architecture is stunning and you feel as though you have been transported to a wooden tree house fantasy. We will be back!

Jody was an excellent hostess and was very responsive during our stay. We are so excited to stay here again and to have found such a gem not too far from home!"

We super recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at the treehouse. It was great to get away for a few days and enjoy the hot tub and the view of the leaves changing. She had lots of interesting games which we utilized as well. Beds were great and decorations were neat

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Our third stay at Jody’s place- we love it and will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"When booking the accommodation we contacted Jody, she gave us recommendations of nearby places to eat. She was spot on and very helpful and friendly. The place was magical and unique. We had a fire by the treehouse and were welcomed by her sweet pup. Absolutely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something out of the beaten path. Will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great places to go for a little get away!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My two children and I stayed at the treehouse for two nights. It was absolutely beautiful! I loved all the decor and details, especially the lighting. The kitchen had everything we needed. We made s’mores by the fire pit. (Jody was super responsive when I couldn’t find a lighter.) We swung our hearts out on the deck. And we slept great on the comfy beds. Although I stayed mostly unplugged, I had no problems with cell service the entire stay either. Highly recommend and we can’t wait to go back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay at! Wish i could make it my home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I came here for our 5 yr anniversary, and our expectations were exceeded. The pictures do not do it justice, there is SO much beautiful craftsmanship here… you just have to see it for yourself. Cute decor, amazing comfy beds, relaxing porch & hot tub. As long as Jody is renting this place, we hope to make it a tradition to be back every year. It was the perfect little get away.
The only complaint we had (which isn’t even really a complaint, bc we didn’t mind) but figured I’d say to let others know. If you’re a light sleeper, booking in the fall with rain/wind may not be the best, as acorns and stuff constantly fall on the tin roof. However, the beds are so comfy that it’s easy to ignore and get right to sleep.
10/10 recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a weekend getaway! 10/10 would recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The most beautiful tree house in the middle of the woods!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This tree house is so amazing! All the decor and details Jody put into this house makes to a dream come true!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody’s treehouse was the nicest airbnb stay I have ever had!! She was quick to respond and gave clear directions on how to find and enter the bnb. This place lacked nothing at all and was full of everything we needed for a nice and relaxing stay. It gave just the right amount of privacy that we wanted. Wifi wasn’t terrible and we were still able to watch our favorite show at the end of the day. The sleep I got inside this cabin and on that bed was honestly the best sleep of my life. I will remember that sleep for a long time. I honestly can’t say enough good things about this place. Thank you so much Jody, I hope I could book this place again sometime!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody was very responsive leading up to, during and after our stay! Very cozy, quiet, private place with lots to do. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody gave excellent instructions on finding the place & check in was a breeze. Beds were comfortable and shower was hot & spacious. We did however have deadlines for work and although the listing & our devices showed a connection, we were never able to get anything to load. That being said, this is the perfect place to disconnect & recharge. This would not have altered our decision to stay here, would have just stopped to work somewhere along the way if we had known!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property. So much thought and care went into this property. Truly an amazing experience! It was also a great value!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you really want a cozy treehouse weekend, with a hot tub, this is your place.
Feels like you’re way out of the city. The beds are comfy and linens and towels very clean and cozy. The host was very responsive. Lots of games and outdoor spaces, kept kids entertained.
Helpful tips for others to know:
Wi-Fi is not the best, so I wouldn’t plan of streaming or working/homework (it was better at times than others) no signal for t-mobile but the Wi-Fi worked for internet based texting.
Recommend bringing your own food and spices as kitchen is well stocked with appliances and few restaurants in the immediate area- plus, why would you want to leave?
We already want to go back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody thought of everything. A perfect escape for a few days! We hope to return some day.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and quiet. Perfect getaway for the weekend. Photos are exactly what it looks like in person
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the best little tree house - everything was well appointed and SO cozy. You can tell a lot of thought went into this AirBNB! Thanks for a great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a magical place. There is so much attention to detail, pillows and throw blankets are soft, not just pretty, same vibe elsewhere. Swinging fun pod hammocks to gaze at the forrest from. Interesting design and antiques everywhere! I can not overstate this. And thought-out. Hand towel just where you’d expect. Need a hook? It’s exactly where you think. It’s giving soft, tidy, interesting, memorable, fun."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was absolutely amazing for a romantic getaway! The craftsmanship will blow you away and the space is so comfortable. We loved it!
Highly recommend a visit to downtown Rome while there. It’s a 15 mile drive, but the great shops and restaurants make it well worth it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Forest Treehouse was a wonderful stay. It’s a beautiful and spacious place with very peaceful surroundings.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, unique stay. The newlyweds loved it. Absolutely perfect!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was absolutely gorgeous, loved the back porch swings, lighting and hot tub. Definitely the best place to grab a book and hang out on the porch in a swing. Bedding was spotless, bathroom was very clean, and the entire place was tidy overall."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This treehouse is so peaceful. I wish I could've stayed longer. The swings and hot tub were definitely our favorites.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful quick getaway thank you! Really unique place to unwind between baseball tournaments in Georgia.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite AirBnB that I have ever stayed in. Tucked away in the small, quiet town of Adairsville, this place is the perfect getaway for anyone needing a place to truly relax and unplug. There is a reason it’s called a forest tree house - you truly have tons of privacy surrounded by trees and nature! The back porch is stunning and I took a nice nap on one of the hammock swings. The hot tub was perfect for winding down at the end of the day. All of the decor inside was so magical and homey, and the different lighting is such an incredible added touch to the space. Everything was extremely clean and clearly well-maintained.
The only downside I would say is that you won’t have much cell service and the wifi isn’t great. This was far from a dealbreaker and I quite enjoyed being forced to be unplugged! There are going to be bugs since you are surrounded by so many trees and lush forestry - not inside, but definitely outside. Bring bug spray and remember to keep the doors closed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful Build.. Very artistic scene , from the Place and surroundings.. Amazing stay !"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Met and exceeded expectations.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Jody's place. It made for an excellent relaxing stop for our 10 year wedding anniversary road trip. Just sitting on the back porch watching squirrels and deer was a welcome change of pace from our day to day life. Would definitely recommend this spot for anyone needing a quiet place to unwind.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody’s tree house in the woods was like something out of Zelda. So much love, creativity, and design went into the build. Very private & spacious to get back in tune with nature. Highly recommend if you’re looking for some tranquility."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in the forest. We stopped over on a long drive from Ohio to Tampa. Only about 10 min from the I75 interstate. Beautiful place. Amazing woodwork. Very comfortable beds. Definitely coming back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay and very clean space!! Recommend to anyone!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The tree house is very well equipped.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The treehouse was amazing!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little retreat cabin in the woods, just as described! Would definitely recommend for a rejuvenating escape solo or together with someone. Hot tub on the deck with the market lights was perfect."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The only thing I can say about this property is that we wish we had more time to spend here. We just stayed one night on our travels from Florida to Kentucky. Just such a hidden gem! Everything about this property is top notch and the host was super!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Omg! The pictures don’t capture the full beauty of this location. Located in a wooded area with other tenants near by but the treehouse is discreetly tucked in its own spot. The jacuzzi on the balcony is private and year round. A little fire pit in the back yard. I would recommend to bring a small grill if you are not going to eat out. A decent amount of food options near by. 20-30 minute drive to nearby stores.
Will be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful getaway! The space was pristine and clean inside and out. Very unique and thoughtful decor. Very comfortable beds as well!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,the place was beautiful! super peaceful 🥰
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place had all the quirky but also essential things you could need. The hot tub worked great, as everything was very functional in the apartment. We only stayed one night, but In the morning, we made breakfast on the campfire outside, which was awesome. ps - some of the most eclectic and aesthetically pleasing lighting I have ever seen."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful unique getaway. Everything was as described and pictured. Very clean and host always responded quickly. Will be booking again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody’s place was fantastic! The bed and couch were very comfortable. The hot tub was amazing and private. There were so many small details that made it extra special. Jody was also so responsive and accommodated a late short-notice check in. We will definitely be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at roughly 15 Airbnbs, several private rentals, tons of hotels (fancy and not so fancy), and grew up in family cabins. Jody’s treehouse is in my top 3 locations . One of other locations was in Hawaii, and another in Spain. That should tell you how much we loved this place. Super clean, cozy, and attention to detail made this place fantastic. Once we arrived we altered our plans so we could just hang out there for entire stay. I’m a huge fan of cabins or similar places and Jody’s is top tier. Private, peaceful, and just the right space for a romantic retreat. The only drawback is food preparation. We made do the hot plates provided, but a grill would be a welcomed attention. Otherwise nearly perfect stay. If we ever pass through Georgia again, we’ll be sure to see if the Treehouse is available."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm a treehouse lover and had been looking for a treehouse that would work for my 93-year-old mother. Jody was very responsive to my questions about accessibility, even sending extra photos so I could see how far Mom would have to walk. If you have someone who wants to experience a treehouse but has limited mobility, this is an amazing find! There is an entrance that works with a walker and a bed on the main floor. If you like a treehouse challenge, the second bed is up a spiral staircase that is truly beautiful! A lot of care and craftsmanship went into this treehouse. My Mom (and I!) loved the twinkly lights on the tree trunk behind the cozy gas fireplace! I'll be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Omg we loved Jody and Britt’s place, it was so cute and had everything we needed for our quick and relaxing anniversary weekend trip, their space had so many thoughtful touches, we even got to meet them which we throughly enjoyed, this was our second stay at one of their properties and we will definitely be back!!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome experience with fantastic views!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was awesome and offered everything advertised!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is super cozy and comfortable. We loved the decor, the cleanliness, and the ease of everything. The hot tub in the back porch is amazing as is the lighting. Wi-Fi was great and much appreciated. For rest, relaxation, book reading, and lounging around it is perfect. The fire is perfect!
It was hard to find in the dark and is located behind a couple building with a shared driveway. The neighbor had a light on that in the winter, shined through the window directly into the bed area. The air unit was a little noisy at night and made a rattling sound every now and then and getting the temp right at night seemed tough. Lots of little remotes for things so it took a while to figure out what went with what. Lots of discovery work on that end.
Overall we really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is wonderful! It was absolutely perfect for a quiet night away.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First get away since having our new baby. The tree house was tucked away and had a beautiful wooded view. When we arrived the treehouse was clean and the heat was on and it was a nice touch considering how cold it was. The gas fireplace was nice and cozy and we enjoyed the hot tub.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This treehouse is super cute! We loved the decor and trees inside. The spiral stairs were very cool. I absolutely loved the big back porch with the swings and sitting area. The host was wonderful. We arrived when the power was out because of a bad storm and she made sure we were aware ahead of time. And this was not a problem at all because they had a generator hooked up and we could still use most of the accommodations. The hot tub was even still useable. And she let us know as soon as it came back on. She was very responsive and informative. The beds were very comfortable and everything was cozy and clean! We highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a very peaceful getaway spot. Jody was very thorough with all the instructions needed in every aspect of the stay. All the small and big details were adorable and you can tell she really put time into making it a comfortable cozy place to decompress.

I would definitely stay here again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jody was perfect host and great in communication. The cabin was perfect for the family’s relaxing staycation. Everything was what it’s shown in the pictures, and she’s got everything ready for us. The amount of towels (a lot!!) was the most helpful especially our main focus was hot tub. Jody gave us the detail directions and that helped us a lot but we should have arrived there before dark. It was a little challenging to find the place in the dark.
We had a most relaxing family time. Thank you!"

My whole family and I really enjoyed our stay but the kids, especially, didn’t want to leave. My pup and I’s favorite part was that beautiful huge tree and the peaceful backyard.

Jessica was a fantastic host; we will definitely be back in the future. Highly recommend! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was older but Jessica did a great job decorating and making it feel like home. Due to it being an older home, there was an ant problem but there was ant spray located in the home that we used. There were a few complications in the beginning of the stay but Jessica resolved the issue and was very genuine. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we enjoyed the guest basket left for us."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This cabin is an amazing space with an abundance of land surrounding it. It truly gives you a private space to enjoy time with your loved ones. There are tons of nature scenes to explore with the river being right down the hill from the cabin. You don't get the sense that there would be restaurants and grocery stores 15 minutes away from you but there was a little town right up the road that had everything we needed. Would love to come back sometime and explore more of the surrounding area!

You will not be disappointed! Exquisite! I’ll definitely give this place a 10 star rating hands-down! You feel right at home. No one was ready to come home. They wanted to stay longer. Extremely beautiful and peaceful. I cannot say enough about this place!!! Thanks for everything. My family and I are definitely looking into booking with you again.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,It was a beautiful air b n b in an amazing location. It was peaceful and remote yet close to grocery stores and other accommodations.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The house and the surroundings are beautiful. We stayed with 3 families and each one had their own room and bathroom. The teens enjoyed the downstairs area and we all enjoyed fishing in the pond and pavilion to BBQ and sit by the fire. We took walks and fished everyday and you can't beat enjoying your morning coffee sitting out on the porch to take in all the views. If I had one complaint it would be that there were more kitchen equipment to use for larger groups but we managed by taking advantage of the BBQ and the restaurants around the area. We would love to stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice owners!
Beautiful place"

This cabin was very clean the beds are very comfortable. The fire places made it very special . Moreover this cabin was very affordable, it allowed us to chose to stay in or go out if we choose because of their nearby stores and restaurants. There is also a lot of history in the area. We love it & will be back"

With easy access to I-75 this made a perfect, relaxing overnight stop on our trip from Florida to Michigan.

We will make this a regular stop on our bi-annual trek!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The accommodations were very relaxing and perfect for our visit to see our granddaughters. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and cook ware.

There were good quality restaurants located right off the exit (Olive Garden, Longhorn, etc.). This was an overnight on the way home from Florida and it was fantastic to have a peaceful, comfortable home setting to rest in instead of a hotel! This is getting added to my favorites for future trips! The host sent a great note ahead of time with instructions. I had no trouble getting in or out!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We spent a month in ""Ray of Sunshine"" while visiting family in the area. This was the perfect spot for us with everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The space was clean and beautifully decorated. We appreciated the comfortable furniture for relaxing in the evenings after busy days with our grandkids! The well-equipped kitchen allowed us to make many meals at home, but there were plenty of nearby restaurants when we chose to eat out. Christy & Matt are wonderful, responsive hosts and we highly recommend both of their listings."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,let me start by saying this place is so much larger than you think it is. you have ample space and a fully stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook as far as dishware goes.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very nice, exactly like the pictures, and had all the little extras without losing its kinda rustic feel. The space was plenty big for myself and my girlfriend to stay in, and it was far enough from the other units to not hear any disturbances that may have occurred. Jody is a fantastic host who communicated clearly and quickly, and was flexible on our check in as we had to drive a decent distance. 10/10 stay"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved that we were greeted by Jody’s sweet little dog, Edna. What a fun way to shift gears after a long day of travel. We made a small fire in the fire pit and enjoyed the peace & beauty of the forest setting. We enjoyed the provided coffee in the morning. Although we brought our own, we appreciated the snacks and breakfast options. So nice to have something on hand if needed. The area is beautiful and quiet. This is a great place to relax and reset."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice cabin style room and bathroom. Would definitely recommend over any hotel in Rome.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was Perfect
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"words canot express my gratitude, joy, peace and solitude staying at Jody's. Not only was she extremely communicative but accommodating to our late arrival and need for an extra hour the next morning. This literally felt like I slept a night away from home at home but I am a country girl who is daily surrounded by trees and wildlife and that is what you will find here. There are neighboring rentals bit with the surrounding trees it wasn't a problem. Saw deer as we traveled in.. so yes, right at home. I bet if you stay more than one night you would see even more. The linens, the kitchen, the snacks, coffee and tea were all very thoughtful touches. I loved the flameless candles, the local, vintage, and nature themed art, and the vintage furniture along with whiteboard walls. Again, I cannot say enough the describe our stay. We LOVED IT!! Off the beaten path which is perfect for us. We will definitely stay here again if ever back in the area again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! I was in town for some training for my job in Adairsville and found this place. Great for the price! The place was clean, cozy and was set up well with everything I needed while there. GPS gets you almost all the way there, if you read the mailbox #s there’s no issue. The bed was too firm for what I am used to but personal preference I’d say. I was only there for two nights on business but I really appreciated that she has a binder of things to do in the surrounding areas plus the snack/coffee stock she keeps for guests. I would definitely stay again or look at one of the other cool cabin-y stays she offers as well in there area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little place for a one night stay. Jody was beyond helpful with a last minute booking. Definitely five star worthy!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Comfortable as well. Amazing drive in. Beautiful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody’s place was perfect for our needs and had everything we needed and then some. She even brought me a table for the porch to put my portable gas bbq pit on.
We had a lengthy visit with her at her FoResTreehouse cabin which is also a must stay for sure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just love this place. Spending at least 3 months here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a very special and quiet place. Easy if find, private, and comfortable. Modern bathroom and kitchen with everything you might need. Jody was quick to respond and gave great descriptions on finding her place and getting in. Would recommend to anyone who is in the area. Thank you for opening up your home to a traveler like me."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody had every small detail covered. If there was anything you might need while away from home, she has it in supply for you. The modern farmhouse decor was beautiful and relaxing. The large windows around the perimeter of the cabin allow the morning sunlight to light the place as it filters through the surrounding trees. The bedding was so comfortable and really gave the place a lush feeling. The cabin was exceptionally clean & the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels and washcloths. For the purpose of our trip, the location was superbly located between Blankets Creek MTB trails and Jarrod’s Place (and as a bonus was only a beautiful, 20 minute country drive to downtown historic Rome, which has plentiful restaurants and eateries.) I can’t recommend this Air BNB enough & hope to return one day! ❤️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great little studio cabin in the woods! Affordable, very clean, and has all you need...including snacks.
Thanks for providing me with a perfect space for time away! I will be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed for the weekend. The cabin was cute and cozy. Everything was clean. They even had snacks for you to enjoy. I would definitely stay the next time we visit our son.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying here for a few days. It was quiet, peaceful and had everything you need. It was a short drive to multiple towns where there was lots to explore. It was clean and comfortable. The host communicated well and we had no issues."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing deal! Private but minutes away from anything you may need. Spotlessly clean, beautiful rustic motif-love the sink! I wish I hadn’t been so exhausted, would have been great to sit by the fire outside. A lot of Airbnb’s have sort of lost the vision and become overpriced. This is not one of them:great space, clean, private, and great value. I highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a place to stay NW GA."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was peaceful and relaxing, clean and private.. bed was comfy and bathroom was clean Jody even left snacks for us! It’s very quiet and we had no problems finding the place . It’s close to things about 10-30 minute drives . Flexible check in Jody offered us the place early although check out we asked for a later time for an hour or two and it was available except with a fee and 100% of the other air bnbs I’ve stayed at are flexible with it especially since we are from out of state would’ve been nice to have customer satisfactory without worrying about the extra money, .. esp with no other guests checking in . otherwise nice place would stay again . Edna the dog is very friendly and visits often ."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a private place to stay close to taking our son to college in Atlanta. We didn’t want to have to take everything out of the car at a hotel for fear of our car broken into. Location was out of way. Felt safe and private. We also decided on an Airbnb same evening we needed to stay and only one night. Jody was very responsive, kind and let us check in two after after reservation. Even pulled the sofa out and made it. Great stay. Would again for sure."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed some quiet and down-time, and Jody's place met every expectation! it was a great escape, and much needed respite. The room was nicely appointed, save a full stove/oven, but you really don't miss it with everything else you get.
I had much-needed R&R and will keep this place on my short list of great getaways to take when a change of sceneryis needed.
Jody was an awesome host, giving friendly, clear instructions to get to her place and into the stay.
I highly recommend!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My stay was great! The cabin is cozy and clean.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody's Airbnb is one we hope to come back to on purpose to stay at a week, not just an overnight on the way to somewhere else. My husband, who is generally more critical than I am about Airbnb stays, remarked, ""I wouldn't change ANYTHING about this one!"" The super-quiet setting was beautifully woodsy, with lovely trees and rolling hills. The roomy and yet cozy cabin, with its beautiful large windows and views and its deep, shady porch with rockers reminded me of my grandparents' house in my childhood. Thanks, Jody, for all the labor that went into this place!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and relaxing.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could leave more stars, I would. Jody is an amazing host!
As someone who used to live in a similar region, I have a great appreciation for the type of accommodations that were provided.
Jody's response time is exceptionally quick as her responses are genuine and thorough. Her availability to be on the scene as well as answer any and all questions and concerns is very appreciative. I would also like to thank her for being explicitly thorough with her directions in regards to finding the Airbnb location.
If you want a quiet, country, and remote little cabin for a quick romantic getaway or even for just a few nights on your own, this is the place you want to be. Its location is settled between two major highways; so - you have the option of not only going out and venturing amongst the locals, but thanks to Jody's guidebook, you can also venture out further and find amazing places to eat as well as various activities to do year-round.
The cabin is amazingly beautiful and secure. Those pictures are not lying; if anything, it does no justice as far as showing the true gem of what a beauty that place really is. you can tell that from the craftsmanship, to the layout, to the decorations; there was nothing but love poured into that place as that is the first thing you feel as soon as you come onto the premises. Also, due to the type of accommodations that are provided, I also felt a great sense of safety being there.
If you're lucky, you will be greeted by the most adorable little dog. She will wait for you at the door as she appreciates ear rubs and tummy rubs.
This is definitely a place I have plans on visiting again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Amazing space! Jody was quick to reply and kept open communication during my stay. The studio was beautiful, peaceful, and quiet. Everything I needed was either provided or was within reasonable distance. 10/10 would visit this place again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is beautiful well stocked and the perfect place to get away from the city.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody was the best! She was so helpful and ensured every aspect of the stay would be perfect! She was wonderful at communicating and made this experience so pleasant. Will definitely be staying with Jody next time we’re up that way!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of our favorite Airbnb stays. It was secluded, quiet, comfortable and clean. It exceeded our expectations. We especially enjoyed coffee on the front porch. We didn’t want to leave. Great spot for events at Barnsley Gardens. Kudos to Jody!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The Airbnb was unique! We absolutely loved the rustic cabin vibe. We were comfortable and slept well. It’s an awesome Airbnb.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place felt completely like home. I travel for work and I really loathe staying in a hotel. The little drive up the road is wooded and makes you feel like you are really slipping away to a little secluded cabin. I pulled up on my second night and was greeted by the sweetest little pup which made my entire day. Made missing my pups a little easier. The bed is super comfy. Jody has all kinds of little extras that made it so nice. I came in straight from home the first night after 10pm and there were snacks out which was great since I didn’t have time to stop and get food before I came. I’ve rebooked for the rest of my work time here in Rome. It stays booked up so if it’s open when you’re seeing this rush to the reserve button!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,I enjoyed the location. It was very nice.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody's cabin exceeded our expectations. It was the perfect little getaway for New Years. It had everything we needed and more. So cozy and well kept. I recommend 100% and we'll definitely be back.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly can not say enough good things about this rental. Lovely, cozy, organized, unique, and clean are just a few words that come to mind when you walk in this lovely cottage style rental.
This host has thought of her guests with every detail. All the way from the snack basket to the air purifer and the washer and dryer. She has made this charming space a sanctuary for travelers.
Set in the country just enough to feel like your in your own world but not too far out that you feel isolated.
Renting in the past has been somewhat disappointing at times. I thought maybe our standards were too high and what we were expecting was not really attainable. However, after renting from Jody we now know that it is very much attainable, and she has spoiled us for future travel.
If you are close yo this area and need a rental look no further than this little treasure.
Chad & Tonya M."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for just one night on our way from Illinois to Florida. We chose it because it was inexpensive and only about 10 miles off the interstate. The place was super cute and very clean. Our toddler loved that we were out in the woods and that he got to sleep in the same room as us (he slept on the half bed in the living room area). Shower, etc., all worked well, and there were extra sheets and blankets if needed. We are a little covid-crazy and asked Jody to open up all the windows after the last guest left so the place could air out, which she did:-) Would definitely stay here again while traveling through."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I want to live at this Airbnb.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect!!! Clean, comfortable, inviting. Amazing property. Close to local attractions. 4 adults had plenty of room. Will absolutely stay here again when in the area."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was such a cute place with everything we needed. We were coming in for a concert and Jody was very accommodating with checkin to coordinate arrival with my daughter. It was perfect for what we needed! We used it only to sleep after the concert before heading home early the next morning so we didn’t get the full experience but I would definitely recommend it.
Only thing to consider is that even though it holds 4 guests, there is an additional charge for each guest over two. I didn’t realize that when I booked, so the price ended up being a bit more than I originally thought. Not a game changer, but I have not encountered with an Airbnb rental before."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jody is GREAT to rent from! The place was ready on time and very clean! She had the place stocked with anything you could possibly need and was a phone call away if something went wrong! Also, great distance from coosa valley fairgrounds if you happen to be in town for a concert!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy to find. Found the place to be very clean and accommodating. We look forward to booking again in the future
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Jody was amazing! the place was nice and clean :-)
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great mountain escape in Adairsville. Not too far from Rome, GA.
The studio space is very homey and well-kept. Also, Jody is an excellent host & communicator.
There’s a helpful guide with some suggested sights/good-eats. If you need a great place to work, be sure to check out Lumina Coffee Co.
Can’t wait to return!"

Can definitely recommend Jody’s place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay while visiting area colleges. The place was very clean, super cute and comfortable, and we enjoyed the peace and quiet. Little extra touches like snacks and thoughtful/tasteful decor were really nice, and it's clear that the hosts take their role seriously. There isn't a stove, which wouldn't have surprised me if I had looked more carefully at pictures and amenities. This wasn't an issue at all--there's a two-burner hot plate, microwave, coffee pot, etc.--but it might be something for travelers to keep in mind if you plan to cook."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable and well-furnished living space, it was very easy to find and the host was very helpful and kind."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife & I visit Rome every year for a geocaching weekend. Each year we have stayed in a different Airbnb. This one by far has been our favorite stay….and we will certainly be returning. Everything about this beautiful place was perfect. We had a slight mishap at one point, and Jody bent over backwards to take care of us. I would highly recommend booking a stay with Jody to anyone."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely beautiful
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Ben’s house has an amazing view with beautiful nature. The furniture inside is New. Best place to come back in Georgia.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was better than we could have ever hoped for! Ben was great! Super nice and we really enjoyed getting to chat with him. He was super kind and helpful. The house was clean and had everything we could need. We would absolutely stay again and look forward to it. The surroundings were pristine, calm and beautiful. We needed the relaxing location. We were in town for festivities at Barnsley Resort but decided too last minute that we were going to be able to get a room, so I thought before we decided to not go at all I’d check into STVR. So thankful we found this! It was wonderful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ben’s retreat was so peaceful and cozy we didn’t want to leave. It feels like you’re a million miles away but, in reality you’re minutes from I-75. The beds were comfortable and the place stays nice and cool in the summertime. We saw deer, a ton of wild birds and our granddaughter loved all the lightening bugs!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ben was an accommodating host. His place is in a quiet, peaceful country setting. It was very clean and was larger than we expected, especially for a one-bedroom."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was absolutely wonderful. Exceptionally clean and a very quiet setting adjacent to a wooded area with noise to be heard. There was no need to rush to the nearest store to stock up as they already had many of the necessities available.
A great place to relax and watch the deer roam in the grass fields. My son fell in love Coco has she happily greeted us each time we returned.
This is definitely the place we will stay should we return."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private, very comfortable, would 100% stay there again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,The guest house is amazing!! Very spacious and immaculate!! The location was perfect for us. We enjoyed watching the deer on Ben and Susan’s 11 acre property. His yard is manicured and looks fantastic. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area and the cost is so reasonable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best place to stay. quiet safe and beautiful
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest cottage is very comfortable and stylish. The setting is very peaceful: we saw deer as we drove in, a rabbit, and we heard a Chuck Will’s Widow (a bird) calling from the woods. We will stay again when we return to the area to visit family! Ben is very easy to communicate with."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Pictures don't do it justice. Property is breathtaking and Ben couldn't be nicer. We can't wait to go back. Very close to everything. We were visiting my parents in Cartersville and were able to just hang and relax. Don't hesitate to book.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Had everything we needed and the location is beautiful. Definitely recommend this lovely airbnb!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben's place was LOVELY. And SO PEACEFUL. The rooms were spacious, everything looked brand new, and there was so much space to put our stuff.
We asked Ben for a donut shop recommendation and the place he sent us was GREAT (""Fresh Donuts""): good every day selection, with added surprises like jalapeno.
But the really memorable aspect of our visit - which was to attend our daughter's wedding over in Calhoun - was Ben's super friendliness and hospitality. We flew in late Thursday and managed to get off on the wrong foot that first night by driving our rental car right into a ditch before we had even arrived. We called Ben and he drove out to helps us, but he was beaten by some other Good Samaritan who pulled off the highway and used a winch on his jeep to extract us: Jason Miles, of Adairsville. If you know him, thank him AGAIN for us. First we were mortified and then we were GRATEFUL. Ben and everyone else were so nice about telling us that EVERYBODY drives into ditches all the time - like it was a Local Tradition. We have our doubts.
Anyway, all I can say us that I wish I had had more time to hang out, but Wedding Festivities consumed almost all of our weekend. Each night when we dragged in past midnight, it was such a JOY to come home to Ben's place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great experience last weekend! Our family loved the farm! everything was clean and very beautiful! The beds were comfortable and the room was dark, which was great for my baby's naps! The grassy area is large and lovely! We would definitely love to come back another time!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This little gem was exactly what we needed to keep family together while in town for a wedding! The house was clean and organized. It was quite chilly so only one of braved the chilly pool but the sound of the waterfall made for a relaxing morning coffee on the porch! Laura was great with communications! I definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host and beautiful property. They were super accommodating as our plans changed over an extended stay. If you want privacy then you can't beat the location.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place so so peaceful amd relaxing. We wanted to get away for the holiday and spend a weekend away with our kids amd get away from our busy lives! This was just the place to do it! It was worth every penny! Laura was there for every question we had and went above and beyond to make sure we was comfortable without stay and had what we needed! We will definitely remember this place for warmer weather so we can enjoy that pool!! If your looking for a place to get away and relax, this is just the place to do it! Thanks Laura for everything!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The inside of the house is spacious and clean. The exterior is great and well maintained. My family was able to enjoy the 11 acres outside as much as the the inside. A short ride from 75 as well as Elijah or Jasper.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny house has tons of character! It's not one of those modern trailers with a tiny house built on it. This is a tiny house built on a very old foundation that I'm sure could tell some stories.
Christy was great in all her communications and had local recommendations in a binder for us.
The neighborhood is calm and quiet. The lot is large and the grounds were well maintained.
The kitchen was stocked, 2 TVs in the place, games, a work desk.
You could live here and be just a couple of minutes from almost anything you might need.
You have a great opportunity if the dates you need are available, better book it now :-)"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Five-star accommodations. Need I say more? The cottage is a tranquil place that provides everything a traveler needs and more. The hosts (Christy and Matt) are very hospitable and flexible. They kindly accepted our impromptu booking and were flexible with our need for a 4 a.m. arrival time with same-day evening departure. They went the extra-mile in providing excellent hospitality, as they had the porch light and some house lights on for us when we arrived, as well as had bought some white bath towels for us given that we have allergies to the colored-dye bath towels they had for their guests. We slept like a baby in the extremely comfortable bed with wondeful linens, which was also due in part to the fact that they allow their guests to control the thermostat in the cottage! And, we also enjoyed being able to do our laundry on the premises while we looked at all of the literature they provided for the local area including eateries we had not heard of before as former Daltonians."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage makes me wish I needed an extended stay in Dalton. Very nicely laid out. Has everything you need. Christy was very responsive and had good suggestions for food. Nice and warm on a chilly night. Definitely would recommend.

The home was decorated for Christmas which lead me and my partner to buy gingerbread houses to decorate. I will say it got very very cold especially in the morning. I realized it’s because the AC had been turned off in the night and wasn’t set to start again until 6pm that day but that’s bad on my part. Other than that it was a nice stay. Would’ve definitely visit again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect and cozy for our overnight stay. We enjoyed watching a movie by the light of the cute Christmas tree. Everything was clean and in order!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's place is exactly as pictured. Nice and cozy, and it is a good space for a couple or three friends as the coach that I fell asleep on one night was just as comfortable as the bed. The street has private homes, so it is very quiet during the day and at night. You will also be very close to everything you need, supermarkets, and restaurants, and it is less than 10 minutes from the Dalton Convention center. And Christy was very quick with responding to questions. If you are in the Dalton area, you will definitely appreciate this home away from home."

Stayed at Christy’s place for 3 days, 2-nights for a wedding nearby. While it was a short stay, it was perfect. The place was clean and had all the essentials.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is more than I could ever expect and better than advertised. This Airbnb is convenient to all Dalton has to offer. Not only is the location safe and central to everything but the house itself is super cozy and has everything you will need for a stay away from home. We previously stayed at a hotel and this time decided to stay at this Airbnb and it was the best decision we could have made and changed my whole outlook on the city of Dalton. The bed was luxurious and so comfortable with the softest sheets, the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you might need, the added touches of a washer/dryer/detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash and the book about Dalton and things to do was just the topping on the cake. I highly recommend this sweet house and we will definitely stay again!!!"
