2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little room with attached bathroom that was great for a few nights stay. The house is very near to all the shops you need and easy to get on the highways and main streets. The bed is very soft so just something to be aware of if you prefer a firm bed, but I was able to get comfortable and slept well thanks to the noise machine!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The sheets on the bed were sooo comfortable! The neighborhood was nice and quiet. I felt comfortable.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little place was fine for a night or two in a decent family neighborhood. It will serve well as a place to sleep when visiting some family members who live in the immediate neighborhood and will soon need their guest room for a baby. The space was pretty much as described.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the privacy and separate entrance. Felt safe walking my dog around the neighborhood.

The space was small because we used the trundle bed, but we knew that, because it was in the description. It was very clean and had all that we needed. Kayleigh responded quickly to all our messages. It worked well for us, and we would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kayleigh’s place was just what we needed— just tucked away in a pleasant neighborhood and easy to get in-and-out of near a lot of places to visit.

There were more amenities than listed which was a surprise to us and greatly appreciated! Have a great time and recommend her to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly gracious hosts and a quaint space that makes the most of every inch without feeling cluttered. Lovely and bright and oh so comfortable. I had to leave early for a family emergency and they were very helpful.
FYI, the entrance is on the side (I didn't realize that), so you'll have to walk across graveled pathway with your bags. But it also makes for a private space. Also, as listed, the pups can get a bit vocal in the mornings, but quiet down after not too long.
Recommend and would happily stay again."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This small nut neatly furnished studio is a good option for a short stay. Its pet friendly and we only heard the dogs once as we were leaving, but nothing when we arrived late in the evening. Communication is great and there are lots of eating options a short walk or frove away in Nob Hill.
Little touches like toiletries were and a dog bowl with fresh water are just a few things to make guests feel welcome. We would recommend this space."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were driving cross country via I-40, the location couldn’t have been better. Expected it to be a bit bigger; however, bed was super comfortable and everything was beautifully decorated. Some previous reviews mentioned dogs being noisey but I didn’t notice them at all. Would highly recommend."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little place. So peaceful and cute. Clean and just as described. Casita is attached to the house but still felt private! Also, I accidentally booked my dates wrong and the hosts were SO accommodating and friendly about it."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kayleigh and Nathan’s guest suite was perfect for our few days in Albuquerque. The bed was so cozy, and the shower was hot with great water pressure. The mini fridge and microwave were perfect for not eating out too much and drowning in green chile, and the wifi was great. The mini split worked great for hot afternoons and the heater worked for the last snowy day. Wonderful place!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was awesome! We were initially worried at the dogs barking once we got into the airbnb. After a while, they calmed down and we didn’t hear them at all the rest of the trip. 10/10 would recommend to anyone going through!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice room and bathroom. Nice neighbors
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kayleigh’s space is beautiful, lots of thoughtful touches. It is also conveniently located to all the spots in ABQ. Amenities are also great. Only thing I would note is that it is a bit toasty. There is a ceiling fan, a floor fan and an AC vent from the main house but I guess the summer weather truly outdid them. Regardless, amazing stay overall!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kayleigh’s place was absolutely gorgeous! Cleanliness was a huge 5-stars! It’s a smaller space, but more than enough for a few nights stay.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a nice place to stay for a visit to Albuquerque. Kayleigh has added lots of local products and nice, personal touches to make this space very special. I very much enjoyed the local coffee that was in the space. The space also had local tea and there were chocolate chip cookies available for us when we arrived. The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet at night. The bathroom was stocked with high quality soaps. The house was easy to find and offered us a chance to experience a Albuquerque style home and neighborhood."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was cute! It was a little bare bones but I was only staying for one night so it was okay for me. Check in and check out was easy and the owner was flexible with check in time for me which I appreciated. You do hear some noises from the main house as the Airbnb is basically a separated back bedroom and bathroom of the main house, but the noises didn’t bother me and were not overly frequent or loud. Overall I would stay again for a short trip. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great little suite in a good neighborhood with the most thoughtful touches. The space is beautiful and comfortable and has yummy bath products! We planned to hit the town in Albuquerque but ended up staying in and resting up because the space was so lovely.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at this place. Very well designed, comfy and convenient."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and bright. Good central location and it's awesome that you can bring your pet.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication with Kayleigh who went outside as I was a bit confused if I was in the proper location. I appreciated the tea, lotion, and love lavender scented products. Space is small and compact, definitely more of a space to rest up on travels. I enjoyed the decor which is primarily why I chose this air bnb. The shower had piping hot water which I need and appreciated. The temperature drops and bed/pillows were comfy. The sunlight comes in so beautifully and lights up the room. I'm a sensitive sleeper and could hear feet shuffling, cabinets opening and closing, etc in the main part of the house. About a 10 minute drive to Hotel Albuquerque and Sawmill Market where there is an abundance of food options."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our overnight stop at Kayleigh's place! It was very sweet with great decor and a lot of cool touches. I loved the quality of the products that she offered and the local products available to purchase are a bonus too. We arrived after dark but had no trouble finding our way in. It was really a perfect spot to stay. I have a few Aibnbs and took away some great ideas as Kayleigh clearly cares about her guests and their experience and has set this small space really well!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Kayleigh’s place! The decor was beautiful, the bed was so comfy and her recommendations were awesome. Would definitely come back!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kayleigh’s place is superb! Such lovely thoughtful touches, from the fresh water in the fridge to the delightful incense and candles. The two of us with our small dog fit perfectly. We only stopped over for a night on an impromptu road trip whim, and, after we left, we wished we could’ve stayed longer. Thanks, Kayleigh!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wasn't able to stay because of travel and delay issues, but Kayleigh was very kind and accommodating and offered a partial refund, which was so amazing! When I am traveling through the Albuquerque area in the future, I will 100% book (and hopefully stay at) this property!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kayleigh’s place was incredible for our trip! Super comfortable bed, small details that made a difference and perfect location. Major plus to have the option to reheat leftovers and make coffee in the mornings. We will absolutely be back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is the CUTEST! Great for 1-2 guests. Little details on top of the great location and great hosts are what make this air bnb. We loved our stay here!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing and comfortable. We only were able to stay the night passing through but would have loved to stay longer. Very comfortable and close to so much. Great neighborhood and easy to find. Love the style and local focus. Recommend to all.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s clean, beautiful, feeling comfortable, totally worth it!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Manzano sweet was fantastic! Such an efficient layout with a great vibe. The bed was SO comfy also! I’d definitely return.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So impressed with this guest suite. Everything was clean and prepared for my group of 3, both the queen bed and floor mattress were very comfortable. We had everything we needed for our night and got a great night’s sleep after a long day of driving. Kayleigh communicated well and we could tell she spent time making the beautiful space for guests. The whole experience was what I hope for when booking Airbnb stays—safe, quiet, clean, and comfortable. Definitely book this as the price is a steal! :)"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There are so many thoughtful touches in this space--filtered water in the fridge, toiletries from local vendors, extra dog treats, etc. The hosts also provided clear and accurate details about their space. Our stay wasn't long, but it was very comfortable."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, quaint, clean & quiet - the perfect spot for a work-trip to lay my head to rest every night. As a solo traveler in town to work a festival & eat out every night, it had everything I needed, and I would happily stay here again. The hosts were also the ideal host - attentive to any needs I may have had, while being invisible otherwise.
Highly recommended!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy. Clean. Great place for our overnight stay. Thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Albuquerque Drivers Review: Be prepared. Holy moly! Let me start by saying New Mexico has some insane drivers. I’m sure there’s tons of fender benders daily being so fast and reckless. Driving in a packed car moving from Oregon to Texas was really scary with the sun setting where it’s right in your eyes and an already limited view due to packed car. I’ve lived in LA, Arizona, the PNW, and never seen anything like this. Reminded me of being in a taxi in New York.
Airbnb Review: Small space that’s maximized very well. Aesthetically pleasing as there were a series of home decor/design moments throughout the space which makes it appealing. Good for 1 person or a couple. It felt small just me and my two cats. Mattress nice and soft. Don’t drink bathroom sink water. I make chamomile tea at night and had to dump the water and use some I brought. The only note I would give is that the saw dust/mulch is easier to walk on than those rocks on the side path to the Airbnb unit for travelers who are likely lugging items. There were a couple times I was worried I’d roll my ankle. Also wheeled luggage would be easier to roll on the saw dust mulch than rocks plus it would also emphasize the path giving contrast to the main rocked area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This stay is so lovely and cozy!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, convenient spot."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little spot is like stepping into a magazine page! So aesthetic and the perfect details and amenities (fresh coffee + french press, fancy soap, cool books and a closet for storage!) Perfect for solo travel or for a couple!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Casita Manzano was a lovely place to stay. It was private and quiet and had everything we needed. My husband has a bad back and he loved the mattress. It was close to restaurants and shopping and we would recommend it.

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the location and ease of this small guest suite! Kayleigh was a wonderful Airbnb host as she was very communicative leading up to and during the stay. The guest suite was immaculately clean and I appreciated the small touches such as being able to purchase NM special chocolates, cactus soap, NM print masks, etc.
One thing to note as a heads up is that I was able to hear sounds and thumps from the main house (3am and early AM), but Kayleigh did mention that the night of my stay was the exception because their new puppy was adjusting to their home that night. Another heads up is that the thermostat is located in the main house, so in order to change the temp, you can reach out to Kayleigh. It was a very toasty 69 degrees but they had a ceiling fan."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a gorgeous space! Kayleigh is a thoughtful and wonderful host. I’d stay there again for sure!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of my favorite airbnbs I have stayed. The place was beautiful and relaxing for the night. Kayleigh was very easy to communicate with. While there isn’t a kitchen, a hot plate, microwave and hot water heater makes any cooking you would like to do easy. We visited nearby Marble Brewing (downtown) which had some of the best sours and food trucks."

You have your own private entrance and space to yourself, clean space and SUPER comfy bed, location is great, 10 minutes from Old Town Albuquerque (which you should definitely check out if you stop by) and Kayleigh was very pleasant and communicative.

The area is safe and not far from major roads. I’d definitely recommend staying there and would stay there again!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mary’s place was EXACTLY as described and pictured. Her place is located close to all that ABQ has to offer, particularly outdoor activities and food. Above all, Mary is an exceptional host going above and beyond what I expected. Friendly. Attentive. And always responsive. All this makes the rate highly valuable, and dare I say undersold. I will definitely be staying again! Highly recommend Mary and her place, as well as her adorable feline cheer crew."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best Airbnb we’ve been to!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s AirBnb is beautiful, and Mary is a wonderful hostess. Everything is spotless, and she has added many amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable. Although we had booked a room in her house, we had the run of the house, including use of her kitchen, living room, the washer and drier, a separate, very well appointed bathroom, and her very restful patio. In addition, she provided many different coffees, teas and cocoa, milk, creamers and juices, as well as delicious cookies and breakfast pastries. And she welcomed us with glasses of red wine! When in Albuquerque, we will definitely stay with Mary again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary is proof that the host makes the Airbnb. She is a joy and a truly caring person. Mary genuinely wants you to enjoy your stay. Many, many touches to confirm this. For example: check-in is so simple and the host is very responsive, cookies and fresh baked goods daily, drinks provided in the in room fridge, check-ins each day to make sure needs are met and things are going well. The bathroom has a jetted tub as well as a shower. The bed is comfortable. Mary knows the city and has many excellent recommendations. I really loved the vibes. I would absolutely recommend this Airbnb and would stay there again when in Albuquerque. I have paid more for places that offered much less."

We would have no reservations about recommending Mary’s place to a friend visiting Albuquerque!"

She is very kind, social and caring. She'll let you have your privacy when needed, and socialized when wanted.
I certainly will come back whenever in Albuquerque
Big hug, Mary!
Thank you so much!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and her cats were a joy to stay with! There were no other guests while I visited and Mary was away on a trip for several of the days, so I had a nice time to myself chilling out with the animals. The room was lovely and you are given free range of the house (including the kitchen and spacious backyard/patio), which is very nice. The only thing I'd gotten confused about from the photos was thinking there was a private patio entrance - both rooms can only be accessed through the main house. The location is very quiet and peaceful, but it's best if you have car access because the neighborhood is a bit of a distance to any amenities and getting a ride share on the west side of ABQ can be challenging. Mary was a lovely and responsive host and her pets were extremely friendly as well!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to work remotely while visiting our daughter. Great location and very welcoming host. Highly recommend.

I’ll never stay anywhere else but her Airbnb when I’m in Albuquerque?"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a great stay at Mary's place. Staying with her was like staying with a long-time friend. She greeted me in driveway on arrival and gave tour of the place while going over what I shall expect during my stay. Her amazing kitty cats also joined in for the tour. The room was equipped with comfy bed, tv, desk, chair, a couple fans for those hot summer days, though not needed as here home was perfect temperature and a mini fridge. The bathroom was superb as it included a jacuzzi tub as well. Her home was beautifully decorated throughout, including the backyard and patio. Mary is really a super host, whose hospitality goes above and beyond. The details of providing a mini coffee bar, setting aside a shelf in kitchen refrigerator for guests, and setting out little dishes of snacks and mini candies definitely did not go unnoticed. My favorite part of stay was the conversations Mary and I shared out on back patio. I highly recommend Mary's place if visiting New Mexico."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary is an exceptional host.

We felt like at home from the First moment. Everything was neat and clean and there was more than enough space to feel private.

Coming back to Albuquerque Mary will be the very first address to stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I extended my stay at Mary’s because I liked it so much :) Felt right at home. I’d absolutely book again with her. Beautiful spot!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary’s place is soooo peaceful. The views of the city and the Sandias Mountain Range from her neighborhood are beautiful. The back patio area is gorgeous. Mary was super thorough with the walkthrough of where everything is and was always very responsive. She made sure I was happy and comfortable. Highly recommend her spot!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary is such a kind and accommodating host. She has a friendly personality and yet so easily respects your space so you feel so comfortable to ‘let your hair down’ and relax. The outdoor space is so peaceful to sit and eat a snack or read. The bathroom has a great bathtub with jets!!! I would recommend this stay to friends and family! Any time I find myself back in town I would 100% stay here again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Mary's was beyond enjoyable. Mary is a absolutely lovely person that truly made me feel welcome and invited into her home. From the moment I entered her home, I felt as if I have lived there for years. Thoughtful details such as a complete coffee bar and snacks in several places throughout the home helped make her home stand out. Mary's home is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood that that is conveniently located close to the airport. When here, be sure to enjoy a cup of coffee under the gazebo while watching a sunrise and listening to the birds. The rate that is charged to stay is beyond reasonable and one would be truly missing an amazing deal if passing up on her home. Thank you again, Mary, for a wonderful first time in Albuquerque."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful home, convenient to all things ABQ. Great and friendly host with great recommendations"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very kind and welcoming. jacuzzi bath was a bonus I couldn't take part in, and my only regret. Peace and quiet and the cats weren't a bother at all. Definitely recommend Mo's gym down the street."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pros: The bed was comfy, the Wi-Fi was adequate to my zoom needs, and the kitchen was very well equipped. The host was friendly and responsive. The cats were cute. The space is beautiful.
Cons: One of the cats, the really friendly one, likes to gently gnaw on human toes. He doesn’t break the skin. It tickles more than anything else. So if you’re ticklish, you might want to be sure to wear closed-toed shoes when you hang out in the public part of the house."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience staying at Mary’s home!
It was everything I needed and she was super clear, kind and easy to communicate with! I loved the kitty cats and the bath tub. Thanks Mary!"

I felt “at home” immediately‼️ So close to great restaurants and shopping. You do need a car for this location. I will definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We looked for a place for us to get away for the long weekend and this beautiful home did not disappoint. The kids enjoyed themselves so much they had plenty to do, there was a game room, as well as a pool table, and more fun games for them and the adults to enjoy. The house was very spacious for four families we had more than enough room, we didn’t not feel like we were in each other’s space. The backyard looked just the pictures, we had so much space for plenty of activities. We really enjoyed the house and would rent again in we had the chance to."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved this house! It was perfect for our families while we were visiting. Great for families with children, as there is so much to keep them entertained.

We will definitely be staying there again the next time we are in Albuquerque!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice neighborhood. Cute casita. Place was not ready at 4, which is check in. Cleaners were still cleaning when we arrived."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect landing pad for a long weekend in Albuquerque. I especially loved the central location and the value—much more affordable than area hotels and it perfectly fit the bill. Lacy was super responsive and helpful, too, checking in throughout my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. Recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was excellent, I had no issues with anything there and was able to hangout and relax after getting off work while I stayed here."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Actually our stay was good and I would recommend this AirBnB. But we had to wait for our check-in as the AirBnB was not ready even though we could book it “immediately”. This can be improved. The host offered us to stay in one of her other two AirBnBs, but we did not want to change as these would have been not as quiet as this one according to their reviews. We would have expected the AirBnB to be ready if the option to immediately book it is activated. Also Netflix was not working and the host unfortunately did not respond to our request to fix the issue. All in all, the AirBnB is located in a really nice neighborhood and we liked to stay there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, comfortable, serene casita with a private outdoor patio. Great location in a lovely old Albuquerque neighborhood. Lacy is amazing with communication and support. Will definitely look to book here again."

Rebecca Torres"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This casita is totally cute and comfortable, with lots of charm, in a great location. I was able to walk to a grocery store and easily access UNM, Old Town, and the Bio Park. Lacy is a great host—checks in, is responsive. I'd happily stay here and/or have Lacy as a host again next time I'm in Albuquerque."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We like the cozy cottage and the southwestern decor. It was definitely, New Mexico style. Lacy's place is close to Old Town where there are a variety of shops and restaurants for folks to visit. Unfortunately, the host wasn't responsive to my questions and comments via Airbnb when we were there. Otherwise it was fine."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, peacful stay. Nice sitting area to relax for the evening."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Casita Serena was a nice little adobe house behind the owners home in a very quiet neighborhood about 10 blocks west of downtown Albuquerque and an equal distance from Old Town. It is convenient to both the I-40 and I-25 freeways but the neighborhood is a collection of post WWII homes ranging from small to quite large. It was a pleasant area to walk in day or night time. Its a very comfortable home for the two of us with a roomy bedroom and nice living room eating area. It was like staying at a friends home, not like some places which are completely furnished with Ikea stuff. Nice oriental rugs on floors, comfortable, nice older furniture. A small kitchen and bathroom but more than adequate for our needs."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable accommodation in a safe neighborhood. Thanks Lacy!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place

She went out of her way to check in with us to make sure our stay was comfortable. The neighborhood is so conveniently placed. Grocery and gas station just on the other side of the main road. We had 5-10 minute commutes to everything we had planned. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous. Lined with amazing historical homes with a cute park just around the corner. 10/10. definitely planning to come back."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A place so nice, I’ve stayed there twice! This is a very quiet and comfortable casita. It is very private and has plenty of space for 1 or 2 people. The bed is comfortable and there’s a nice amount of light in the living area. It feels like home away from home."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lacy does a great job. She is a fabulous host . The property suits us very well for location and amenities. It could use some refreshing so bear that in mind. If the location works for your activities in ABQ I would certainly recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space matched the pictures exactly and was actually larger then I expected. It was well appointed and we felt right at home. Lacy was very responsive and provided clear, easy to follow instructions. We will stay again when we're back in Albuquerque."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was fantastic: the Casita has a nice, Southwestern design, is quiet, and is very centrally located. The kitchen is well-equipped with a stove, range, and microwave so I made several meals there. I also was able to walk to Sawmill Market, Downtown, and several coffee shops like Slow Burn and Castle. Lacy was truly a super host: she checked in regularly to make sure I was okay. I highly recommend this Casita to anyone traveling to Albuquerque!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy's place is just precious- I love the feel of this little Casita. It's calming and has everything you need for a great stay. Lowe's, the market down the street is wonderful for picking up breakfast items! It was convenient to my event at the Convention center. I felt safe and comfortable. Located right between downtown and Old Town! Very convenient and nice, quiet street."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked last minute while we were on a road trip. We got in late, but everything was perfect for us. We left early to continue our trip. We were comfortable and happy. Thanks for everything! Would book again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean house, good location, i will be back."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this Airbnb was fantastic, close to the Old Town and downtown Albuquerque. The casita was in the back yard of the owner’s house; this owner seemed to be a different person than the host. There was a nice fountain in the courtyard but the patio seemed a bit disheveled and it was unclear what parts were ours to use. It would have been nice to have dish towels and luggage racks. Also, the sheets on the bed were not the right size for the bed which was really annoying; we like to make the bed each day and have our space neat and this bedding made it difficult. This could be very easily remedied.
Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful casita, comfortable, quiet with everything you need for your stay. I also love the garden and the trees. The location is great, conveniently located to old downtown. I would highly recommend to experience this casita. Thank you Lacy!"

Lacy was a very responsive host.
Come prepared to deal with mosquitos and you will have a fine time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sweet casita that is quiet and peaceful yet close to downtown and Old Town. Good size, attractively furnished. Comfortable bed!! Lacy/host was great. Highly recommend the location and the casita itself. Will definitely book when I’m back in ABQ."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy’s air b and b was wonderful! Honestly one of the nicest places I’ve stayed. The kitchen was adorable, the bed was COMFY, and the natural light was a plus. Thanks Lacy! Definitely coming back next time I’m in Albuquerque."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita is located in a sweet, quiet, walkable neighborhood close to much of what the city offers. The inside is much more spacious and comfortable than one might expect, so is ideal for longer stays. It was a treat going to sleep with the sound of the fountain outside! Good location, attentive host, great for our needs."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay! The place was spacious and clean, and I appreciated having a private entrance. Walking through the courtyard to get into and out of the casita was so cute and peaceful too. The host had coffee available, and the hot water in the shower got super hot super fast. Not much else I could ask for!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in a beautiful neighborhood. Very walkable with an incredible market only two blocks away. Would highly recommend this rental.

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a nice stay at Lacy’s. The place is charming, safe, and quiet. As indicated by Lacy in the description, there are quite a lot of bugs throughout the place. I’d suggest bringing a bug repellent."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super pretty and quiet neighborhood! A lot of beautiful hiking trails near the casita! Definitely will be coming back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house is beautiful and homey with a lovely fountain and other decorations out front. Check in and check out were both easy and flexible. The area feels safe and peaceful and I was very at ease throughout the stay. The kitchen is fully functional but a bit small so I wouldn’t recommend cooking for more than two people, but given the proximity of nearby restaurants you likely won’t need to! I highly recommend staying, especially for couples seeking a cute and cozy spot to relax."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Clean, and convenient to the downtown area, as well as freeway access. Parking off street was a plus. Nice neighborhood, with no concern for safety. Lacy was great with instructions and followed up the next am to make sure everything was going fine. Would definitely stay again on a future visit to ABQ."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love this little casita - it is quite ,safe and nurturing !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really loved and enjoyed my stay at the casita. I was meeting an old friend and had such a good time catching up there. Incredibly close to everything so I was able to go out and get some really cool photos of the city, the neighborhood feels very safe to walk around and was just a great location overall. I will be staying here my next time in abq!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious and comfortable place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Prime location right in the heart of the city. Great for both short and long term stay. The hosts are super kind and helpful with getting around the city. The wifi works well if you need to work.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita was perfect for our stay. We would stay there again if it’s just the two of us.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a gem. Beautiful and calming fountain as you walk in. Easy to access with clear instructions. Lacy was very responsive to all questions or concerns (of which there was only one). Area was very nice with a great local coffee shop that we visited twice during our stay (Java Joes). My mom kept raving about how beautiful it was and talked about a returning stay when they visit (we were apartment searching for me).
Thanks for everything Lacy!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb/Casita was perfect for what I needed. I was in town to visit family and it was a great location as I would consider this to be central Albuquerque. If you know much ab ABQ, it is prone to theft therefore I recommend a neighborhood like this one and appreciated the off street parking!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy’s place is nicely decorated and in a good location, close to many things you might want to do in downtown Albuquerque, Old Town, Zoo, etc.
Bed was comfy, though couch was quite saggy.
Welcome letter and info is on line rather than on premises, as are checkout instructions, so don’t keep looking for it at the place, as I did."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for the hospitality.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely Casita! The place is clean, roomy and comfortable. We were there for just 3 nights but it would be perfect to spend a retreat for a few weeks.
The yard is very serene and the neighborhood super safe. There was a nice grocery store a block away.
We used the home as a base to visit a bunch of sights around Albuquerque and come back to relax and catch a movie at the end of a long day.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay here! if you want to be near downtown Albuquerque, then this is the spot! I had a wonderful time, and the place was wonderfully kept and well designed. Easily would recommend it to anyone."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at Lacy's. The casita was even more peaceful than pictured. I spent much of my time sitting next to the fountain and watching the hummingbirds come by and take a drink. The grocery stores, museums, and the park are all within walking distance. I highly recommend Lacy's casita. This is a perfect spot to be if you do not want to rent a car but still want to be able to get to a lot of places. Thank you, Lacy, for a lovely stay."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a nice and peaceful place. Well located. Excellent hosts!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in a great location…we were first time visitors to the area doing all the touristy things, and I don’t think we were more then 10-15 minute drive from anything on our list. Easy off street parking with dedicated space in driveway."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy’s place is beautiful, feels like home and comfortable. Everything we could need was available including a quaint courtyard to enjoy. This was our second stay and I know we will stay again! Thanks for the hospitality!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant stay at this downtown casita. The place was incredibly spacious and well taken care of. We appreciated having a kitchen with a coffee maker. There were multiple quilts in the bedroom to keep us warm. The only issue was finding the address in the dark, as we had a late arrival time."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was clean and comfortable and I felt very safe as a female solo traveler. 😊
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Casita! The house is so cute and had everything we needed and more! Lacy was readily available and checked in on us to make sure everything was going well. Highly recommend!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy was a very responsive host, the casita was very nicely furnished and a perfect place to spend a few days in ABQ. It still felt private despite being behind a larger house. It’s in a nice, walkable part of downtown."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb I stayed in my life. The casita is so nice, we feel like home and the neighborhood is really quiet, safe, and so beautiful and green with a lot of trees. Lacy is a great host, really nice and flexible. We feel really lucky to stay here. We totally recommend to visit Albuquerque!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Lacy’s Airbnb! It was cozy and in close distance to everything we wanted to do. Definitely worth paying a little more than a hotel!
We had a delayed flight and had to check in really late, but we were still able to get in!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Casita was perfect for me! everything was very clean and the check in was super easy. The whole neighborhood is very beautiful with lots of flowers and trees, rare for a lot of ABQ. It's also very close to a ton of restaurant options."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy casita is in a beautiful, serene, established neighborhood. Walkability to neighborhood grocery and small bakery/independent restaurants was a bonus. Yet, highways, Old Town, and downtown were nearby. Working with Lacy was easy as were house procedures. We hope to stay here during future visits."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoy our stay!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive host and lots of helpful instructions and information about what to do and where to eat. Nice spacious rooms and good amenities. Nice peaceful area and neighborhoods. Felt very safe and homey.
The only complaint is we found some cockroaches, some are dead and some are not quite dead. We were warned on the instructions provided by the host but after we have already booked. We understand that it's a problem in ABQ but it was still not pleasant to encounter."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is cozy and comfortable! It's just a short walk to downtown Albuquerque or Old Town. I will be staying here the next time I visit! Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a nice stay at Lacy's. Comfortable bed (which is the most important thing), internet TV, keurig coffee maker.
I would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great spot. the location was perfect, centrally located and a quick jaunt to the airport.
tasteful decor, and all the amenities to leave hotels as an afterthought."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Lacy's. We had a rough time making our way to ABQ, and once we finally settled down in our place, we felt very comfortable in our own little casita. We are too young to rent a car, so the fact that this place is walkable made our stay very easy. We especially loved how the kitchen is fully equipped with plenty of cooking materials and appliances. The people who live in the main house are friendly, and so is Lupa the dog. Lacy's place has everything you need for a lovely getaway to Albuquerque. I would highly recommend it to anyone, and I will surely stay again if I ever return to Albuquerque."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location but not a super walkable neighbourhood. The casita was spacious and comfortable though neither of the coffeemakers were functional and the gas oven was very hard to start. Cooking our own meals was important to us and the kitchen might have been better equipped. Very nice dog was a bonus.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Between the garden and the safety of the space, I couldn’t be more happy. It’s homie and feels good with the light filled space."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place, great location and great host. This has been our best Airbnb experience to date. We rented a car for our stay with the plan of making this our ""base camp,"" but turned our rental car in early due to the number of attractions and restaurants in walking distance. For a couple, this was the perfect place. All the photos and reviews are accurate. Lacy is a most helpful host. If this is available to rent during your visit to Albuquerque, grab it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is great for a short stay. The house had everything we needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place. The neighborhood is really quite and very walkable. The puppy dog is very friendly and an added bonus. Very comfortable apartment. Highly recommend

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Skip the motel and stay here! We were just passing through for the night, but we really appreciate the comfort and chill this charming casita, if only for one night…"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely casita. Great hosts. Thumbs up!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay again
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice to park and see daffodils and bushes blooming with a very cared for landscape. Place is tucked back behind owner’s house in a gated area. Luna the dog is a welcome greeter! One thing to note is the bathroom is about 15-20’ from the bedroom so not en suite.
This is a great neighborhood! If you have time to take a walk, the architectural diversity of the houses is a total pleasure!"
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, centrally located casita. Liked the place a lot. However, we had to kill 3 wasps inside. Let the homeowners know, which is when we found out that Lacy doesn’t live on site. There were also many roaches in the process of dying which is stated in the welcome book, but it’s something to note. Minus the pests, we had an overall enjoyable stay. Super comfy bed and nice amenities. Lupa was also a highlight."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location of this wonderful casita is very central to downtown and is walking distance to a grocery store and a restaurant. The casita has a large living room and perfectly equipped kitchen. The check-in was seamless and Lacy communicated excellent throughout our entire stay. I would definitely come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful place to stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lacy's place was a great spot for me to unwind after working in the field all day. Thanks so much!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and comfortable house!! Very cozy! I immediately felt comfortable there, like at home, really. It's spacious, beautiful, well appointed, decorated, and quiet!! I packed my suitcases there during a professional stay in Albuquerque; a real joy to join this harbor of peace after a day's work. I cooked at ease, but I didn't miss anything. I slept there like a dormitory. Parking in front of the house; always space. All within walking distance of the city center; and to do the supplies and shopping: you can even walk there..."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pristine, quiet, charming casita. Very clean and spacious. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lacy’s home was adorable! It was great for my quick stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute and comfortable cottage. I arrived after dark, on a cold night, with the heater on and a light on. The key instructions were clear and easy. My host responded to all messsages quickly. The cottage was clean, sheets were crisp and fresh. I slept wonderfully. I loved the quiet neighborhood and the quaintness of the cottage."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a short one night stay at Lacy's place, however it was perfect for all my needs. Parking was convenient and check in instructions were very simple and it was easy to find. I appreciated the clean spacious rooms after a long drive to stretch and have a good nights sleep. Would recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in this Casita! Very close to old town ABQ and lots of good restaurants in the area. Also plenty of space for two people to work remotely.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy stay, good location, quiet, good communication. Will stay here again for sure."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"cozy, clean, spacious, and homey feeling! enjoyed coming here at the end of each day to decompress and relax. quiet peaceful neighborhood!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"All in all, we had a nice stay in the casita.. The location is excellent - it's in a lovely and coveted neighborhood in ABQ and was easily walkable to a variety of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. The space itself was bright and quiet with some nice decorations. Lacy was very proactive with communication and on more than one occasion checked in to see how things were going. There were a few things, though, that didn't quite live up to the expectations I had based on the photos, description, and especially price (I'm from ABQ and have stayed in several airbnbs around town while visiting family). The biggest one was the bed - we stayed for a week and had a terrible time sleeping. I realize mattresses are a very subjective thing, but both my partner and I found the bed to be extremely firm (hard, really) and we tossed and turned on it every night. The photos make the space seem nicer and more polished, wherein reality things felt a little shabby. Overall, though, a good spot."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful: cozy, clean, private, great location, easy parking. Will definitely stay again when in Albuquerque. Lacy was a great host - highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lacy's casita was a great place to stay for a couple of nights - far better than a hotel option. The memory foam bed and pillows were super comfortable and the communication was great. Unfortunately it was too cold to enjoy the lovely outdoor space.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property is exactly as listed. Easy to find, check in was a cinch, good parking, convenient for traveling around the area. Quiet, safe neighborhood. Grocery store just down the block. Very clean and comfortable, nice soap, etc. in bathroom. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Lacy is very quick to respond to any queries. Hope to return."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying at this cute spot. Super responsive host, easy check in."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay at Lacy's. She was very responsive when we had questions. The house was as posted. Our top requirements for an AirBnb are quiet, clean and a comfortable bed. All three were met. Nice to have a grocery so close to the house. Got to walk to coffee shops and breakfast cafe. Easy to get to other parts of the city for sightseeing.
Highly recommend and would stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita was the perfect place for my weekend in Albuquerque. Lacy was communicative throughout my stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my very best experiences in over 10 years of Airbnb. The ""casita"" (please feel free to say house) of Lacy and Dan offers total privacy, all the comforts and all the comforts in a safe, unusually beautiful (the trees!) street.
Walking distance to both the old town and the business center. Puike WiFi. Nice coffee. Desk to work. Wonderful garden. Great price.
In short: better than this it does not get fast."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy handled my accidental overstay with grace and calm. I can only imagine the skill required to do that, and can sure see why she has earned Superhost status. She was very responsive when I left items behind, and I was able to retrieve them only due to her communication and quick response time. Lacy is top-notch!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Cozy unique unit with full kitchen ( bring your own condiments), comfortable bed with quality linens, full closet, ample hangers, lacking towels/ washcloths restocked 4 days after arrival ( we bought extra washcloths) , sofa very soft cushions lacking support, great tv. Great location! Sweet puppy that walked right in to join us for take out! An overall comfortable ARBNB that we return to!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I stayed at the Casita for the Balloon Fiesta! It was a great location to explore Albuquerque. The neighborhood was walkable and it felt safe.

It was beautifully appointed and we were particularly impressed with the beautiful linens and comfortable bed. Location was great, just a short 15 minute to Old Town, and it was also close to several breweries and restaurants downtown. We loved it and should we return to Albuquerque we would definitely plan to stay at Casita Serena. Thanks so much for providing a wonderful place to stay."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very private and lovely casita! While being close to a lot of great things, this casita is set away behind a home and bubbling fountain on a quiet and safe street. It was a very nice place to land at the end of the day and Lacy is a great and communicative host. I'd recommend this sweet spot!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet peaceful spacious and comfortable. Great location. Will be back.
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"the foundation was cool. but if bugs, like roaches, get to you, I wouldn't stay here. at one point some roaches crawled onto me as I sat infront of the TV in the living room. this automatically made the value of the place overpriced."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy was a lovely and communicative host. The place was so cute with carefully selected decorations and furnishings. It’s a quiet neighbourhood while still centrally located downtown and also close to Old Town.
We were also great every morning by the sweetest dog. Next time we’re in the area, we’ll definitely stay at Lacy’s again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a wonderful little Casita in a cool part of town. the fountain was just lovely!!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay at Lacy’s casita. Located so close to so much—downtown, Old Town, the museum campus.
I found the casita quite spacious as a solo traveler, and it could easily and comfortably accommodate two travelers. The courtyard it shares with the main house was so serene, with a gentle fountain and attractive plants.
I’d stay again without hesitation!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great Albuquerque find! The neighborhood is beautiful, safe, and easy to walk/explore. The guest house was charming and comfortable with everything we needed for a relaxing stay. We felt like we really got to experience the best of Albuquerque!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Older guest house in a nice, quaint neighborhood near Old Town and downtown. Convenient location, quiet, easy check in, and communicative hosts. Had some very heavy rains the first night and there was a water leak in the ceiling that saturated part of the couch. You will find some small bugs in the house and the cleaning staff left a lot to be desired in the bathroom. Perhaps that was a one time issue; overall a good place to stay in Albuquerque"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my time at Lacy’s place. I had traveled to Albuquerque for a wedding and it was very easy to get to the venue from her downtown location. Also the proximity to old town is great and there is a good market at the corner where you can get things like water, cream and the like. The little casita is well equipped if you wish to make a few meals, the bed is super comfortable. I especially appreciated a greeting each day by the friendly dog Lupa, as well as, Lacy’s excellent communication skills. She went out of her way to make me feel welcomed.
I would certainly chose to stay there again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Casita Serena, near Old Town Albuquerque, in a tree shaded historic neighborhood, sits behind a lovely house and garden. Before entering the casita, There is a lovely patio with a running fountain, creating a beautiful place to sit outside in the shade.

We loved it and will return whenever we are in Albuquerque."

The casita was so clean and beautiful. We loved all the little touches of abq art in the house, and the neighborhood itself was PERFECT! The cutest, most unique homes and right next to old town. It was the perfect place to stay for us.
Ps. Cutest neighborhood cats that we ran into while strolling the neighborhood. I highly recommend exploring all that abq & this casita has to offer."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anything I said to Lacey can be published.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita was an absolutely wonderful location. The place had everything you would need for a short or long stay. Lacy was communicative and extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone staying in Albuquerque.
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lacy manages the Airbnb properties and she is friendly. The casita itself was cute and the location is good. However, the casita is in the backyard steps from the owners' house, so there is very little privacy. In addition, the female owner was unfriendly and unwelcoming. The owners had out of town guests parked in the spot reserved for the Airbnb casita guest. The check-in process was confusing, particularly in the dark. A nice thing to do would be to leave an outdoor light on when you know you have a single female arriving late at night. I won't be giving these owners any business in the future unfortunately."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Casita Serena is every bit as lovely and peaceful a spot as the pictures and descriptions in the listing. Everything was perfect and I would stay again in a heartbeat. Was especially nice to be greeted by sweet Lupa when I returned back to the casita in the evening, sweetest dog ever. What a special bonus 💞 Thank you Lacy"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Amazing stay and such great hosts
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed for a few days during the Balloon Fiesta. It was about 15 minutes from the fiesta field, about 10 minutes from Old town & other sites. Nearby chain restaurants & grocery stores. Great location as far as getting around the city!
The house was clean, tidy, & without clutter. Located in a small neighborhood, we didn't see hardly anyone out and about - a few barking dogs at night, but inside the bedrooms it was quiet enough for sleeping. Mattresses & pillows were a bit flat/squishy & the bed frames were squeaky - but everything was clean.
Appreciated that the house came with the essentials (soaps, paper products, etc) along with water bottles and candy to greet us! It was nice to have access to the two stall garage to be able to park the cars. Would appreciate another couch or some chairs for additional seating in the living room. Serge was easy and quick to respond. Was accommodating to let us check in a bit early! Overall Serge's place worked out well and we'd stay there again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was perfect for our group of 5. The location isn’t too far from most things you’d want to do and the house has definitely had a modern refresh so you feel right at home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and comfortable. My only complaint would be the cooling system is loud but works very well.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is fantastic! I would definitely recommend staying here!
Serge and Karyna are wonderful hosts. The place was clean and smelled lovely when we arrived. They thoughtfully included a few snacks, a helpful handbook, and every single essential we needed for our stay. I'm talking laundry needs, dishwashing needs, cleaning needs, plenty of TP, and paper towels, plenty of shampoo, soap, conditioner, plenty of towels, hangers, blankets and pillows. Just...everything! It immediately put us at ease, feeling cared for and carefree!
Communication with Serge and Karyna was smooth and easy. Any issues or questions I had were immediately addressed and answered by the hosts.
The place is spacious and airy. I had no idea how much I enjoyed a roof window/skylight until I stayed here (don't worry - they aren't in the bedroom in case you like to sleep in a bit like me!). It filled the space with sunlight during the day which was so cozy. Each room was pleasantly decorated and plenty big. There was just 2 of us staying in this house during our trip, but it could very reasonably hold a small group without feeling like you are on top of one another.
10/10 would recommend."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property was exactly as described, and self check in was very easy. The home was clean and well taken care of. The beds were comfortable and ample extra towels, etc. Communication with Serge was clear and timely!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Serge had an amazing place that was close to all the local hot spots as well as the hospital we were working at. He was helpful and kept up with any issues that we had. Would definitely stay at any of his rental locations again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I don’t usually write reviews, but this place was special. The location is great - close to many outdoor activities, walking distance to restaurants and a great frozen custard spot. The property is beautiful and very well-maintained. But what made this place truly exceptional was John -‘d his family’s hospitality and kindness. John made sure we had everything we could need and the family was so sweet to my 5 and 2 year olds. Very family-friendly and one of the very best places we’ve ever stayed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John was the most accommodating host, and the house was beautiful. Felt right at home but also like we had our own little private oasis. And lots of fun things for our 5 year old to do, from the sandbox to the Barbie house."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous home in a gorgeous location in a special part of ABQ. We loved being able to walk everywhere on very quiet roads and along the unique waterways of western ABQ. Great local restaurants with NM atmosphere. Host can answer any questions you might have since he is a second generation (or longer?) resident of the area. I can't imagine a better place to stay in ABQ!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I really cannot say enough nice things about John the host, he is friendly, welcoming, and helpful. His orchard casita is peaceful, beautiful, homey, and top notch appliances, bathrooms, and bedding/towels. Back porch with fountain, grass, trees, flowers, dogs...a great place! Highly recommend."

Everything just really makes you feel at home in a beautiful space.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just loved this place. It is spacious, beautiful, very comfortable and relaxing. The setting is lovely and quiet. Location is excellent, close to restaurants, pubs and wineries. Our favorite thing about the location was being able to ride our ebikes straight from the home to the dedicated bike path on the Rio Grande, all the way to Old Town and the zoo.
John is a great host who meets you and gives you a thorough intro to the property.
We would love to stay here again. Wish every Airbnb was like this one."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an excellent Airbnb experience! Mr. John went above and beyond for us.

John and his family are wonderful hosts!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I cannot say enough about the beauty of the property and the kindness of John, the best host ever. We had a glorious time, and will never forget our stay in Albuquerque. John was terrific. Full marks."

Location ideal. The back porch is a haven, replete with private chiminea and cozy seating. We particularly enjoyed strolling the property to visit the chickens and sheep. We experienced the utmost peace and comfort during our stay here. John is a magnificent and attentive host."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John’s casita is beautiful, spacious, and very peaceful. The furnishings are Southwest and comfortable and appliances are top end. The setting in an orchard is green and private, location is central to everything. He is an attentive and responsive host."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"John's Casita is a wonderful spot. He is friendly and hospitable and always goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome and cared for.

The property has beautiful grass, trees, and flowers and is an oasis in the high desert! It is one of my favorite places to stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is one nicest Airbnb that we have stayed. John went above and beyond lots of extras and little surprises which were very delightful. We look forward to staying again with John. CL
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so happy to have found this sweet casita with all the comforts of home, surrounded by apple and cherry trees. It was clear that host John cares a lot about the happiness of his guests. Each morning we found a newspaper on the doorstep, and sometimes a little something from the garden. We only used one of the bedrooms, but the bed was very comfortable. Also the kitchen was very well stocked with everything we needed to enjoy cooking at home during our 2wk stay. We would definitely stay here again whenever our family members can not accommodate us at their home. 5 stars!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Casita in the Orchard. John was a very friendly and helpful host. The casita itself was extremely comfortable for an extended stay. The kitchen was well equipped and we used it a lot. The location was perfect for seeing family nearby.
We would not hesitate to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and his kids made us feel like family. He has a beautiful orchard and garden. Fresh apples, cider and tomatoes were great. John made sure we had a pair of glasses to see the annular eclipse."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW. We are grateful we found this beautiful air bnb and could not have been happier! We will for sure be back! We had our three kids along with us for our travels and there was SO many things that they too loved; picking apples, seeing the chickens, friendly dogs, sand box and toys, and the list goes on! The host called to check in day of check in- we were checked in on when we arrived and made sure we got in okay! There were ZERO issues that arose while staying there and everything was clean, all we could think of needing was provided(dishes/pots/cleaning supplies/ shampoos/conditioners/extra pillows and so on), spacious, gorgeous house, serene landscape, and exactly how it was described!! We can not wait to come back hopefully same time next year! The host was friendly, approachable, responsive, and spoiled us!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay in John’s Casita and it was perfect again. The house is spotless and beautiful. We love being surrounded by the trees, and flowers here. John is such a gracious host with his attention to detail and anticipating all his guests might need. This is easily our favorite Airbnb."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John went out of his way for us. Fresh eggs, beautiful vegetables and apples from his garden were left outside the front door in the morning. He lent us bicycles since we didn’t have a car. The house was spacious, spotlessly clean and had the most well appointed kitchen we’d ever encountered at an Airbnb. Highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication from start to finish with very caring host. Lovely property with fruit trees and fresh berries. Our host was happy to show us around and offered us fresh apples off the trees and apple cider made on premises. We found the entire experience restorative; there are still good people in the world who care about their surroundings and are willing to share.
The home was immaculate and well stocked, easy to find and very comfortable for a family of 4. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Peaceful, beautiful, huge kitchen with everything you would have at home and more. Some AirBnB’s feel like an extended stay hotel; John’s casita feels like home. That is in part due to his kind gestures like leaving you the paper or having flowers in the house or leaving a citronella candle for outside. The setting is beautiful, quiet, and safe, a true oasis. Thank you John!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,John was an incredible host - the best we've ever had. He was very proactive and always responsive. He provided a ton of great recommendations for the surrounding area and was so friendly. His house was just what we needed (and more) for our stay in ABQ. It was peaceful and tranquil - very relaxing. Each morning he had fresh eggs and other veggies from his garden at our doorstep. We will definitely be back. We can't recommend his place enough!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John’s Casita is just beautiful. Everything was immaculate and comfortable. I could not stop staring at the beautiful trees and flowers around the patio. John was wonderful from the moment we arrived until we left. He is kind and a perfect host providing special touches for the stay. This stay felt like visiting a friend. This is the absolute best place to stay in Albuquerque and we will return!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place is incredible. Everything is beautiful, comfortable and thoughtfully designed. Even in a heat wave we just wanted to sit on the patio and enjoy the fountain, the gardens, chickens and friendly dogs. Every morning brought a fresh surprise from the orchard or henhouse, along with the daily paper. John was a super responsive host. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, with the occasional gathering of bunnies on the front lawn. I loved staying there."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I cannot say enough nice things about this beautiful peaceful place. Fruit trees, flowers everywhere, great back porch with fountain. John is a fantastic host friendly, thoughtful, and proactive. If you love to cook you will be able to make a great dinner in the well appointed kitchen. I felt right at home and will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best airbnb out there. Look no further if you’re looking to book a place in Albuquerque.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best, most unique, private, and enjoyable AirBnB we’ve ever visited. The property is on a fruit orchard (cherries and apples) and if you are fortunate enough to visit during harvest time, John will visit with you as he pulls samples off the nearest tree (we were there at cherry time) for you to enjoy.
This awesome place was actually his home (he lives next door) and is completely furnished and decorated as though he still lives there!
Oh and don’t be surprised if he delivers a half dozen eggs from his chickens along with some veggies from his garden each morning plus today’s ABQ newspaper!
Don’t overlook this great stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Casita and the rest of the property was incredible. Off the main roads, John’s property was relaxing and a breath of fresh air for myself and my family. John was a great host, and we felt at home. We look forward to coming back in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was fantastic, and we really enjoyed our stay. John greeted us to show us around the property, and was easily accessible throughout our stay. The kitchen was well stocked and perfect for cooking our meals. I just loved the farm-like setting and felt so at peace and away from the city, yet only 15 minutes away from the places that we came to visit. This is probably the first Air BnB where I have stayed (and we've stayed in many) where I choose to drive home and enjoy the property whenever I could. :-) I just loved drinking a cup of tea on the porch in the afternoon, with views of the cherry trees, chickens and farm land. There was so much peace and quiet, and we would certainly love to stay here again if we return to ABQ. Thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John is an incredibly warm & gracious host. He is an effective communicator, and he went above & beyond the call. I recommend his casita most highly!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I cannot say enough about how beautiful this property is, grass and flowers and fountain and peaceful serene atmosphere.

The back porch is also a great space to relax. I really felt at home and John was friendly and went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable there. It is the best AirBnB experience I have ever had and I will definitely be back. Thank you John for your kindness and hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John's orchard is absolutely gorgeous. He is a fantastic host and truly loves sharing his beautiful property with others. My mother and I woke up to the newspaper and fresh eggs! How wonderful. I highly recommend Johns place and will stay again! Thanks so much for the great memories!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs & this one is one of our favorites! Beautiful home & jaw dropping surroundings. Nicest & most accommodating host! Lots of extras like a bottle of bubbles for our anniversary & fresh eggs for our breakfast. Adorable dogs. We felt so relaxed and at home. We hope to return often. Thanks John!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and great host! Everything you need, and then some. If you're looking for a place a little more secluded, but easy to get to anywhere in Albuquerque, this is it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at John's casita! It is a beautifully appointed and comfortable home with a lovely patio and very comfortable beds. John brought us fresh eggs and the paper every morning! He is an incredibly gracious host and we enjoyed getting to know him. We loved being in Los Ranchos and we walked to coffee shops, restaurants and shops. We will be back and will be recommending this home to friends and family."

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice and quiet place, lots of room. If you like to make a big meals this place isn't it. I brought up lots of food to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But it only has two small heating surfaces. That was the only downside. But overall it was cozy. Thank you! 😊"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stayed at Donavan’s place for 2 months while working in Albuquerque. It was a nice quiet neighborhood and quick access to both I-25 and I-40. There is no stove but the countertop burners and toaster oven worked great. It is a well stocked apartment. The decor is minimal which is how I like it. Donavan was very responsive when I needed something. I would not hesitate to stay there again. I truly enjoyed my stay there.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a quiet neighborhood! Would stay there again.

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is very spacious. Furnishings are sparse. Couch is a foldout bed which is uncomfortable to sit on in the middle. No chairs, no stove, one of two heaters inoperable. TV remotes inoperable. It was serviceable for our needs but could use some attention."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious kitchen and living room. We really appreciate the private driveway and carport for guest use. Very easy access to lots of activities such as downtown Albuquerque and Petroglyph National Monument. Thanks again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked two nights here, but got snowed in before we could head down so we ended up missing the first night. Donavan was great and gave us a partial refund (which wasn't required).
This was a great place. Good wifi. Really quiet. Super clean. So nice to have a peaceful stay between visiting with relatives."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,From start to finish our host was very hospitable and welcoming. The unit is in a very safe feeling area and the neighborhood vibe was quite nice. It was our first time in Albuquerque and definitely sparked thoughts for a second trip. WiFi connection was spotty at times but managed to reconnect again. This might have been related to the cold weather. The beds were comfortable including the sofa bed where I ended up sleeping during this trip. Thank you Donavan for allowing us to stay here at the unit with our furbabies. We had a wonderful stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, spacious, affordable, and good location!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great and cozy place for my family and I. The kids had so much room to play without me worrying they will break something.
It was perfect! The only thing is I didn’t realize they didn’t have an oven or stove top which there isn’t one listed but they have some things that help to make up for it. Reminds me to pay attention to details. Anyways great place and will be staying again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Donovan is a good host and provides an excellent rental experience. Certainly recommended
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second time staying here and I just love this place. It’s very clean, easy to find and plenty of room.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I enjoyed this place a lot. We traveled with our dogs a teen and a kiddo. It was exactly as described, very clean and full of great vibes! We got surprised that although being very close to other houses, you cannot hear a peep - at least that was our experience during our stay from Thursday to Monday.
The place had all that we needed, and we felt right at home in it. We enjoyed the fact that the house was located just a few miles from parks, museums, The Breaking Bad Store LOL! And some other amazing places.
The host is very responsive, and easy to deal with.
Overall, we highly recommend it, and we hope to come back soon!"

The location itself is a great location in Albuquerque with access to lots of great food spots and easy to get to/go other places.

Checkin was a breeze and Donovan has provided a list with all the information. He had given us a map with the all the things to do which was helpful. He was very responsive and a great host. Weather was cold due to rain so we could not use the grill outside. He was flexible to let us checkout early than planned."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Donavan's place was the perfect place for my family (4 adults, a child & 2 dogs). We loved the large space, clean atmosphere, fast response & close to everything. This is a place to stay at it if your visiting Albuquerque, NM."

We stayed for 28 days and fell in love with the Sandia mountains, the house and Albuquerque! The house is super close to some amazing hiking trails too. This experience did not disappoint!! And the hosts were awesome - thank you Ashlee and Janos! We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,we had an amazing wedding reception. There was plenty of room and the views were amazing!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Best Airbnb stay ever! My wife and 21 year old son had the best stay here. So peaceful up in the Sandia mountains. The greatest views at all times of day and night. Secluded mountain home in a small neighborhood. Upscale amenities. Comfortable and peaceful. Ashlee and Janosnhave spared no expense. The patio was my favorite just being surrounded by the Sandia mountains (ancient home of the Sandia Indian tribe). Evening cocktails on the patio and morning coffee outside were just what the doctor ordered. We cooked six dinners and went out one night. Her local recommendations are spot on!
It felt like home and we fell in love with Albuquerque and New Mexico. This is the perfect base for exploring the region yet we were always eager to return to the house. We have sun, wind and snow all in our week here. Nature lovers will appreciate this majestic home in the mountains. And you’re 20-25 minutes from everything you need in town.
We can’t wait to come back and stay here and explore more!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I booked this gorgeous home to host a few out of town and local family and friends for our renewal of vows. It was perfect! You can’t beat the view of the city and the comfort of the home. We had a beautiful time. Would totally book again.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely awesome view of the city to the southwest and the mountains to the east. We could see the snow covered crest and radio towers from the kitchen. It looked like they were right there.
We hiked the la luz trail just a 2 min drive up the road. It's views are amazing too.
We got 4 inches of snow the next day and hiked the la luz again in the falling snow. Beautiful! ( a very short hike). Had trouble getting back up the first hill in the snow and had to get out and push. But later in the morning snow plows cleared the roads. Very nice!
Such a beautiful place to stay! Will do it again sometime!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow!! This is probably one of the best air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. It is not just a beautiful home, it’s an experience. The house is incredible, and also pristinely clean. You’re living in the mountains, but town is still easily accessible. I can’t recommend this place enough, it’s one of the few listings that the pictures do not do the amazingness of the place justice. And Ashlee was friendly and communicative. I hope she’ll have me again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place tucked into the Sandia foothills with expansive views of the valley. Perfectly clean, easy check in. Great stay"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Blue Door is an amazingly beautiful house. With 360 degree views of ABQ, it’s a wonderful retreat and still so easy to get around the area. Ashlee and Janos are fantastic hosts with such clear instructions. Warm, considerate, and even creative with special greetings in the house.
My family and I so appreciated all the curated details. It was such a lovely stay!

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing house with a beautiful view the best I’ve ever seen at an Airbnb home, I can’t even begin to describe the surroundings, the mountains the homes the city view.
Overall very satisfied with the home plenty of space and very clean I highly recommend it. The pictures don’t show it justice so much more beautiful in person."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? If I could give this place 6 stars I would! Communication with Ashlee was above and beyond, check in was easy, and communication was crystal clear. I find sometimes hosts can over communicate sometimes and she was just perfect. Now the place was just beyond incredible!!! The house sits at the foot of the mountains is incredibly well kept, and surrounded by such beautiful natural splendor! And the view!!! The view was absolutely stunning. The patio was our personal favorite! Anyone traveling to NM or ABQ needs to do themselves a favor and stay at this house and get a true taste of the southwest!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home with even more amazing views!!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gerardo is so fast at responding, and thankfully accepted my request to stay late in the day on a same day reservation. What a wonderful experience.
The cabin is beautifully built and furnished. It’s immaculate as well. The rooms are perfect for couples, a friend’s relaxing get away, or even a family. It’s not too far from restaurants or stores. My friend and I made several trips back and forth to go get things we needed but certainly try to be prepared so you can enjoy your stay/every moment. I will visit again in the winter when the mountains and hills are snow-capped."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house and surrounding area. We would have loved to use the fire pit but we’re not able to since there were no matches or lighter available to start it. It would have also been helpful to have a guide to the house to know rules and additional information.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gerardo’s place was very nice & clean . Clear instructions on how to get in and out of the place . Will definitely stay again ! Thank you !

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Gerardo's place. The surrounding woods are beautiful and give a very private feel. The space was clean, and everything was easy to utilize. Definitely enjoy some outside time at night if you can; the stars are bright and clear, and Gerardo has taken time to accent the trees and pathways with lots of lights that give the area a very magical feel in the evening! Would highly recommend staying here if you're looking for some R&R, we will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful spot just far enough into the mountains to feel like you’re getting away, while still being accessible to ABQ. (Less than 30 minutes.) Stayed over Pres. Day weekend and it was perfect! Cabin is AMAZING! Rustic and charming with all the amenities you’d want. Gas fireplace, wrap around deck, kitchen with all the necessities. Gerardo is a great host and checked in to make sure our arrival was smooth. Cabin is equipped w/ pet door that leads to a fully enclosed dog run, so no worries about pets running off or protection from wildlife. Would highly recommend to tourists and locals alike. Perfect, much needed getaway. Love that travel didn’t eat up our time, but really felt like I was able to escape. Can’t wait to return. Secret’s out! I hope it’s available when we want to come back! Thank you for sharing it with us, Gerardo."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, nice host. Beautiful cabin."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"serene and beautiful surroundings. clean, private and comfortable cabin. spacious and tastefully decorated. a really wonderful winter getaway, secluded but safe. extremely helpful, welcoming and generous host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is the second house on a dead end street in the woods - quiet and peaceful. It was very clean and had everything we needed. Gerardo kept in touch in case we needed anything.
Since rentals all come stocked differently, this isn’t a negative but for cooking there was just salt, pepper, and coffee pods. Best to bring anything else with you.
Also thinking this is just the way it is in the area in the winter but the water pressure was pretty low to the point that both showers couldn’t run at the same time. Not a big deal for the two of us but thought it was worth mentioning.
We loved sitting by the fire and watching the snow and going out to see the stars at night. The deck areas would be lovely in the summer."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin for a get away! It’s beautiful and very peaceful there but a short drive to anything you want or need. Anyone looking to stay in the area should consider staying here, we’ll definitely be back!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The surroundings are very beautiful. The cabin was great. We would visit again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing stay! The pictures don’t do it justice of how beautiful and peaceful this place is. The house had everything that you could need and furnishings were very comfortable. The host was very friendly and quick to offer assistance and respond. The only thing I regret about the trip was not being able to spend more time enjoying the Airbnb.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heaven in the wilderness. This was perfect. I could cook relax in the sunshine, sit cozily by the fire. See the stars from the porch.
It has a peacefully relaxing feel. You instantly feel welcome as you walk in the door and feel yourself relaxing.
It is so peaceful and quiet you can relax, meditate, think, dream of simply just be.
There are also several hiking and cycling trails within a ten minute drive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is phenomenal! It is quiet and tranquil. It is very clean, lots of areas to relax. Not far from Albuquerque. Is private and a great view of the stars! Excellent choice! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house looks awesome, is in the middle of a nice forest, has all the necessary amenities, and displays an outstanding taste for matching the building with the furniture. Very nice woodwork, including ancient pieces re-integrated and finding value in for new uses. I like the dining table made of an old, very thick wooden door, with the old-time lock still in place! While in a remote, wild area, the cabin is still at reasonable driving distance to Old Town Albuquerque, the Sandia Crest, and lots of other attractions. Perfect for a nice, few-days escape."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gerardo was great!! Super kind, helpful and responsive! A beautiful space!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful, peaceful and a joy to get to stay there.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We never had a problem with parking, the place was neat and tidy, the kitchen had everything we needed. The rooftop was quite lovely, and they had some nice body soap and lotions available. If you plan on cooking, there is salt, pepper, and some kind of chicken spice but otherwise you’ve got to get your own. Also plan on getting your own sugar. We left our breakfast tea and some gluten-free pasta for the next guest. Refrigerator was clean and did not smell."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's loft was a great and convenient place to stay. It was very clean. I loved the great toiletries.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. I would recommend it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I actually reserve this for family member who was with me. I was scheduled for a procedure at UNM. Overall was a good place but too small for 2 people. It needs a sofa bed in addition to the current mattress bed Extra sheets and towels had to be requested.
It was as expensive as Hilton hotel with the add on cleaning fee and other."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dan’s loft is a real gem in Albuquerque. The location is ideal, situated right on top of a cafe and wellness spa, and very close to UNM and great restaurants.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Serrano Loft at Lumen Lofts (Nob Hill) was perfect for us! In town for three days, we wanted a walkable neighborhood, easy access to highways AND nature: Balloon Fiesta; birding: Sandra Crest & Rio Grande Nature Center; proximity to good food. Dan’s place checked all the boxes.
Moreover, the loft’s cleanliness, design, functionality/layout, amenities, artwork, and colorful and comfy furniture made for a lively and easy stay. After a few days on the road, we appreciated a real fridge and W/D. Loved the rooftop patio too.
Dan was a friendly, responsive host. Checking in/out remotely was a breeze. Great being next door to UNM too. All good — looking forward to “next time!”"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan has created a turnkey setup in a lovely walkable neighborhood. Stayed for nearly a week and wish I’d gone downstairs to Lumen Optimal Wellness sooner. They have some forward thinking services to promote wellbeing. I chose the float tank and highly recommend it.
Also, the campus of the University of New Mexico is about a block away and features a lovely park that welcomes guests. All around great experience."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Dan's place—what was particularly great about it is that it seemed like just about everything we wanted to do was super easy to get to. And parking at the place was a breeze—there were several available parking spots, and we never had a problem.
There's a great little coffee shop just a few blocks away, and a Walgreen's across the street, and a local grocery store pretty nearby. Lots of great restaurants as well.
The space was lovely, and having access to the rooftop patio was a nice bonus: we watched a beautiful sunset there one night.
Dan was very supportive and responsive, and often would send little check-in messages unprompted throughout our stay, which we appreciated.
The value was incredible—most of the other places we were looking at wouldn't have been quite as conveniently located, and were a significant increase in price, so it was nice to be able to feel like we got fabulous value out of the place.
Thanks to Dan for being a great host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and easy place to stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dan was such a wonderful host! I wish I could have made an appointment downstairs but unfortunately my schedule didn’t allow much free time. Dan’s place is almost a quick 10 min walk to a bunch of cute coffee shops, restaurants, and local shops. There’s also a freak breakfast spot next door to his place. The amenities were just as he said in the listing and his instructions to get to the place were super clear. It was such a smooth check-in. :) If I’m ever back in Albuquerque, I will definitely be coming back."

It was an all-around great place to stay and I would 100% rebook the next time I'm in town!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, had what we needed for the most part. Was your basic place- no frills. A few bulbs were out in the bathroom, making it dark and there was no soap in the dispenser until I found a refill bottle in the kitchen. No body wash but don’t know if that was included or not. Kitchen and cupboards were stocked with what you’d need. Dan was very responsive and had great recommendations. Location was wonderful, as was parking. We got to walk to restaurants, entertainment, etc. The Nob Hill area is a great place to stay. Bed was firm and surprisingly comfy for a Murphy bed. Overall, good value."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a three night stay at Dan's loft in the Nob Hill neighborhood of Albuquerque. Clean and modern space in a vibrant area of the city. Funky shops and pubs within walking distance. Close drive to other attractions and the airport. Dan gave good directions and details about checking in and out so it was very convenient for us. He was also kind enough to let us have a later check out since we had a later afternoon flight. Would like to stay here again when we make it back to Albuquerque. Thanks for a great stay!

It was surprisingly quiet for its location in Albuquerque (though some nights you can't avoid the noise of ambulances and police cars). The check in and check out processes were easy, and Dan was responsive throughout our stay. Also, the rooftop is an amazing place to have a coffee and the view from there is beautiful!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the 10 minute walk to university and the open roof top deck with plenty of seating. Murphy bed was really comfy and loved the swivel lounge chair. Grateful there was a little coffee, but got more (and some wine) at Walgreens across the street Did not see a blow dryer, but that was not critical. Check in with door codes was really easy. Would definitely stay here again."

Although I didn’t get a chance to visit, it’s also over their little spa."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest Airbnb I've ever booked. The space was pristine and tranquil. The bed is beyond comfortable.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin and his partner were very kind and helpful. We didn’t get a chance to meet them, but they responded immediately to my messages, and the place was clean, comfortable, and in an absolutely gorgeous location…great views of the mountains and sunset over the city."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cannot say enough good things about Kevin's guesthouse. This is one of the best airbnb homes we've stayed at. It was super comfortable and cozy.
Upon arrival, Kevin was very nice to greet us. The guesthouse was very clean with lots of teas, kcups and plenty of water bottles.
The living room does not have a TV, but it was perfectly fine as we had our phones and plenty of interesting books to read. I enjoyed browsing the books. I wished I had more time here so I could just sit and read.
The loved how there's so much natural light in the house. The half moon window in the living room allow a gorgeous view of the desert hills in the neighborhood. It was breath taking.
The memory foam mattress was very comfortable. My favorite part was the bedding. OMG. The genuine goosedown comforter and bed linens were so soft. It felt like I was snuggling on a cloud.
We appreciated the good quality bathroom products and unscented lotion.
So glad we stayed here instead of a hotel."

Our ESA cat loved looking out the big window."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was absolute perfection! From the location to the communication to the coziness - it was wonderful. Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived and Kevin was super responsive when we had questions or needed suggestions. They were available if needed, but honored our space and privacy. The location is perfect because it’s in a quiet, beautiful, secluded area, but close enough to town to run out for a last minute pizza or two! Need something to read? Your options are endless. We appreciated the cookies and beverages that welcomed us, as well as all the outlets and charging stations for our devices. The beds and pillows were comfy, and the coffee options were plenty.
One word of warning - Google maps is very inaccurate in the area, so have another option ready! (Obviously not their fault, but I thought it’s worth mentioning!)
Look no further for a place to stay because you won’t find one better than this. They set the BnB bar high!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Ariana's place is very cool. It's located in a scenic spot overlooking the city and the mountains. Very private and quiet. The apartment itself has everything you need and Kevin is extremely responsive and made sure we felt right at home.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"THE BEST AIRBNB WE HAVE EVER STAYED IN. Everything was literally spotless. The level of cleanliness was absolutely superior to all other hotels and airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. The mattress was THE MOST AMAZING mattress I have ever slept on. The pillows were definitely high quality as well. No cheap mattress or $10 pillows here!! My husband and I were blown away at the level of comfort that was provided and the level of pristine condition that everything was in. The hosts were very helpful, kind, understanding, respectful, and hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was the absolute perfect destination after a long day of driving. Drinking water was provided which was so nice!!! As well as a coffee and tea area, and a mini fridge. All of our needs were met, and our expectations were truly exceeded. If you’re in New Mexico, you MUST stay here!!!!! You will not regret it!!!!"

Lovely window in front room, where sleeper sofa is, does not have covering so felt a wee bit exposed and let in early light. Great coffee selection but not a place where you’ll be able to cook meals. Well kept and spacious rooms."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place!
My husband and I drove over 8 hours and Kevin's place was perfect after the long drive! it was quiet at night and the bed was exactly what we needed. My husband was in an accident a few years back in which his L2 vertebrae was crushed and replaced with a titanium cage. He will forever have back pain, but the bed at Kevin's place is similar to the one we have at home and it helps lessen his back pain. There were also black-out curtains in the bedroom which was great because we are on the night shift schedule, and we didn't change our schedule for the trip, so we were able to get to sleep quickly.
The view from the living area is amazing! There is coffee and tea and a desk area for laptop and working. There is a great variety of books as well. If we were staying longer, we would've definitely been reading from their selection. Kevin and his wife were so kind to us and were prompt in answering any questions! We cannot wait to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely recommend! I hope to return again in the future.

Thank you for opening your door to us!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kevin's place was easy to find and was just as advertised on his site. He was extremely helpful in making sure we had what we needed before we arrived and throughout our stay. Recommend wholeheartedly and would definitely stay again.

Kevin had the sleeper sofa ready for us when we arrived which was much appreciated. Both the bed and the sleeper sofa were very comfortable.

He was responsive, accommodating to our last minute reservation and kind enough to reach out to warn us when the weather seemed it would be less than ideal for our arrival time from out of town. The coffee/tea bar is well stocked, there was plenty of books to read (should you have the time), extra thoughtful amenities like a hair dryer in the bathroom and a comfy bed- we would definitely stay again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin is an extremely hospitable host who bakes cookies, bends over sideways to accommodate his guests and communicates very well, in my opinion. Honestly, love the space. I will come back when I have more time for the incredible hiking opportunities right out the door. The space has everything you need. Bed is super comfortable. Towels and bedding are of excellent quality. Shower has removable handle and overhead adjustable rain shower. Host filled the fridge with water (a must have at this elevation) and coffee/ tea choices were top notch. I was torn between reading one of the stellar book choices or watching a movie on the state of the art television. Parking is located so close to the door and neighborhood is the best in Albuquerque. I could say more but I don't want this place to be so booked I can't return!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Definitely take the tram up to the peak!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Trey is an incredible host! He communicated in a timely manner and was very thorough! He’s extremely accommodating and we greatly enjoyed our stay. His home is amazing and the atmosphere was beautiful and peaceful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at many vacation rentals and Trey’s home was by far the best. The home is beautiful and comfortable, with everything you need to feel at home. We were in Albuquerque for golf and shopping. The home is an easy drive to everything we wanted to do. In the evening we would be back for cooking in the roomy and well equipped kitchen. We spent several evenings around the fire pit or on the back porch enjoying the cool evenings and spacious sky. The views of the sunsets from the living room are spectacular!
Lovely home and fantastic host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Trey was very communicative and we found the place beautiful and well presented. The house was stocked with little extras. The sunsets and morning coffee watching the balloons take flight in the distance was effect. Thank you Trey. Hope to come back the Albuquerque someday in the future. Thanks for opening your beautiful home to us. It was memorable.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was absolutely beautiful!! It was equipped with everything we needed.
We actually cooked/grilled dinner the first 3 nights of our 6-night stay, as the kitchen had it all. Trey was awesome! He provided so much information about the house and the area. The all glass window view was spectacular. There are no blinds or curtains impeding the amazing sunsets. That also makes for some bright sunlight at certain times of the day. The neighborhood is so quiet. It feels like you're so far away from town, but it's actually a short car ride. My husband and I would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Albuquerque.
Thank you so much for everything Trey!!!! You're an amazing host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Loved everything about it…!! Thank you for a great stay!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Trey was an awesome host and the house was amazing. Beautiful views, convenient location, clean and up to date, exactly what we were in search of for a perfect vacation. Trey was very friendly, responsive and had some great recommendations for local activities. When we come back to Albuquerque we will for sure book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location in a quiet neighborhood that is nestled in the foothills. Quick access to Albuquerque and Sandia mountains. Hiking trails at the doorstep and panoramic views from the living room. Trey’s house is amazing and he is an exceptional host. This place is a gem and looks even better than the pictures in person.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is wonderful -- plenty of room, well laid out, and well-stocked with linens, towels, and kitchen stuff. Trey went above and beyond the call of duty to help us enjoy the home, and to make sure everything went right. We will repeat when we return to Albuquerque."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trey’s home was our favorite yet! We had an amazing stay in this beautiful place. We had views of mountains outside every window, as well as front row seat to the most incredible sunsets imaginable. There were endless details we loved, include cactus plants everywhere, smart lighting, the most comfortable beds, local magazines for more options for recreation, a fantastic hot tub (that also offered a view to sunsets!), and hiking just outside the door. The ONLY negative we experienced was that we had to leave. Our daughters, ages 11 and 13, loved having their own space. Trey was immediately responsive from time of booking to time of exit. His communication was so great that he felt like an old friend. This home was an absolute gem, and it made for an epic spring break getaway for our family. We will forever remember our time in this house…thank you, Trey!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and convenient to everything!
Trey was a wonderful host and was quick to respond to any questions. His place is absolutely beautiful and we felt right at home. We loved how quiet and peaceful the neighborhood was while still being close to the highway (super convenient to get anywhere).
Quick tip—if you are not a morning person bring an eye mask. The bedrooms have lots of windows and do not have blackout curtains."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Trey’s place is beautiful, conveniently located close to the airport, town and mountains.
The views are incredible from every window! The house was spotless with comfortable beds and plenty of fresh towels and linens. The kitchen and living area is spacious and well appointed with every amenity. Outdoor space is really nice too.
Trey is so kind and quick to respond! There were no issues with anything concerning the house, instructions or check in.
It was such a nice and relaxing get away for our group of 5. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Trey's house is an elegant, beautifully appointed space, full of light, with a wonderful layout and gorgeous mountain views. My family and I enjoyed a magical weekend there with much laughter throughout the day graced by restful sleep at night. It was simply wonderful to wander into the kitchen every morning and nestle into one of the seating areas for coffee with whomever woke up next. And then in the afternoon to drive into town (15 minutes away) for lunch out or alternatively hiking the hillsides around the house. The house is conveniently located, in a very relaxing setting and everyone in our party remarked how they would happily live in Trey's house. We will definitely stay there again should the opportunity arise."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Trey amazing house was the perfect getaway will definitely be going back and I highly recommend staying here !!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was just what we expected — beautiful, clean and welcoming. Plenty of room and a fully stocked kitchen. Easy access to highways and groceries. Trey was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely rent from him again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was absolutely amazing and Trey was wonderful and so helpful during our stay. Highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trey’s home is amazing and he was very responsive before, during and after our stay. The home and surroundings look just like the pictures, if not better, and has everything you need. The scenery is beautiful and area around the home is private, safe and clean. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend his place. Thanks Trey!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is just as beautiful and pristine as it looks in the pictures, and Trey was an amazing host! He responded very quickly anytime I had a question, and he went out of his way to make several accommodations for us during our stay. We highly recommend this home, we will definitely be visiting again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Trey's home far exceeded our expectations. The home, beautifully furnished and immaculate, hosted many amenities - high quality toiletries, plenty of linens/towels and excellent views! Although you can see highway 40 and the trucks rolling down the road, their was no sound from the traffic. We enjoyed early January and the snow was beautiful. The pictures do not do the home justice!
Trey checked in often, answered all questions and provided good information for check in and out. The home is a ""Smart Home"" so we struggled with the lighting for a minute or two but then figured it out. The layout of the home offers privacy for more than one couple or a family but still has an open, expansive feeling. All of the appliances were top notch and easy to use.
The location, on the outskirts of Albuquerque, allowed us to travel to many beautiful places !
We hope to return and enjoy this Airbnb again as it is one of our favorites!
Thanks Trey for everything!
Melanie"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with amazing scenery. Trey was super informative and always there to answer any questions. Highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trey’s place is absolutely stunning! Nestled in the foothills — you get the advantage of being in nature (with spectacular views) while being proximate to major areas in the city (15 min away). His house is pristinely tended to, amenities galore. We especially loved the fire pit and hot tub! Trey was also incredibly responsive, easy to communicate with and kind. I would stay here again in a heartbeat :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay, highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trey’s home is beautiful, comfortable and clean. Kitchen is well stocked and equipped. We really enjoyed our stay and felt right at home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There is nothing that I can say about our stay that wasn’t amazing. The view, the cleanliness, the modern decorations and little touches made this stay one to remember. The linens were all clean and so comfortable, the home smelt so clean and fresh, the kitchen was filled with everything we needed and everything needed to restock as well. The modern touches were my favorite, the light switches, audio to the tv and the google homes were such a fun touch we loved while staying here. I can honestly say Treys home is five stars."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed living at Treys place. House is really beautiful. Owners have taken care in every little detail in the house. Furniture, appliance, linens, accessories, supplies are all of good qualities. Owners love cooking, and cocktails, have variety cooking supplies for making, including various spices, coffee, and many other things that make your daily life pleasant. like a house, it was stocked on most major things, even first aid medications, cleaning supplies, soaps, spices etc. Plants and decor that requires extra care, makes house beautiful. House is smart house, with some convenient features.
House has excellent location, with easy accessibility to rt 66, highway, and close to mountains on east with beautiful views from large windows. There was a telescope, a very nice one that can help viewing. neighborhood is quiet and safe. but also house is gated and secure.
Trey had been very supportive and interactive. He gave us some good suggestions.
we enjoyed our stay, and New Mexico."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Trey has a great place with everything being 8-20 min away. Meanwhile out of the city but very convenient. Hands down best place I ever stayed! 5 star rating
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our vacation to New Mexico was really good and Trey's house made it better. We were traveling with our toddler and Trey's house had everything we needed and was very safe for a baby who wanted to crawl around.
Things that we loved:
- Trey has all the appliances for cooking etc.
- His house is very well designed where you have space for group activities but also secluded rooms for some quite time.
- The hot tub, and outdoor space made it pretty special. The property is in the mountains, which made surrounding very scenic. We also got to see a family of deer.
- House has a lot of books and a really good reading space. It also has a very good entertainment system.
I would highly recommend Trey's house for group of any size."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Book now! So happy to have found Trey's amazing home. Beautifully decorated. Comfortable. Lovely views.
As a host Trey was amazingly helpful and responsive. Could not have asked for more."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our third stay at Trey‘s place. We always love staying here and will continue to come back every time. His home is immaculate and comfortable and our Albuquerque home away from home now! Trey is kind and friendly, as well as accommodating, and always responsive! So glad we found this gem."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best AirBnB we have ever stayed in - home and host.
We wish we could give more stars.
Beds, pillows, and furniture comfy. Hot tub and fire pit cozy. This beautiful home was easy to settle into. If you can peel away from the local New Mexican restaurants, you'll find the kitchen complete with anything you need to cook at this home away from home. Excellent wifi and office for remote work. Spacious for a family with teens to spread out. The home gets lots of beautiful light. If you're morning light sensitive, bring a sleep mask :)
An intangible - our teens are neuro-spicy (one ADHD & one Autistic). This home was GREAT for helping them feel at ease and met all their sensory/ comfort needs.
Trey was super helpful in finding food and entertainment. His Balloon Fiesta advice was sage. He always went the extra mile (including helping guide me to the best brewery and wrote a lovely note to welcome us). He even shipped our forgotten items to us!
Definitely a warm and kind host."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was absolutely one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at.
To start off, I was very paranoid about staying at this place because it seemed too good to be true. The pictures were absolutely stunning and the listing only had 1 review. I even went so far as to message the 1 review and converse back and forth with them to see if this was a legit listing. When we arrived, I knew that I had made the right decision.
This house was gorgeous and the pictures didn’t do it justice. Trey was absolutely the best host I’ve ever communicated with. He was attentive and simply has designed an amazing home.
While there were a few hiccups with the lock situation, Trey was able to help IMMEDIATELY. I’ve had digital lock issues before at hotels though so I would never fault Trey for this.
The space is magnificent and so inviting for multiple guests. You can’t beat the location either. Nestled against the foothills you feel like you’re in a different oasis.
You will not be disappointed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 out of 5 stars I would. This is easily the most beautiful home I’ve stayed in with Airbnb. Trey was extremely responsive, kind and courteous in our messages and gave us great suggestions about things to do and places to eat.
The home itself is stunning, yet comfortable with modern smart home features. The incredible picture windows look out over the beautiful mountains. The outdoor space is beautiful as well and we enjoyed some steaks on the grill and having our morning coffee on the porch.
The beds are some of the most comfortable I’ve slept on with luxury linens to boot! The master bathroom is phenomenal with its spa like shower and tub.
I loved the gas stove in the kitchen and fixing a nightcap using Trey’s craft cocktail area.
My husband appreciated the office to get work done while traveling and the WiFi was strong and reliable.
I cannot say enough things about our amazing experience. We’ve already booked a return trip back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at your charming house.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Bridge House. Leah thought of everything to make our stay even better. We enjoyed the decor and spacious rooms. The yard and desert garden were very inviting. The sweet scent from the blooming rose bush only added to our outdoor experience. We were able to spend some time enjoying the patio looking out over the backyard as well as relaxing in the private courtyard. Getting to do our laundry at the Bridge House was a big plus. The Bridge House is close to many points of interest in Albuquerque and it was easy for us to get around the city. We would definitely recommend to family and friends to stay at the Bridge House whenever in the Albuquerque area.
Sincerely,
Al and Sharon from Kansas"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the Bridge House, and we are already booked for July. We love everything about the house—the location, the history, the art and furniture, linens, and the cleanliness. The hosts are very responsive and live in the area.
There are several nice restaurants and shops in the area and a grocery store right down the street. Waking up to a mountain view is also incomparable."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This has to be one of our favorite stays in New Mexico! It was absolutely stunning, peaceful and we loved the Corrales area. We cannot wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this home! It was comfortable and beautiful at the same time. we were able to experience more of the area by staying here. It was close to everything and yet quiet and private. Our host was great and we had everything we needed and more! Highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I have just wrapped up a 3 week stay at the Bridge House and it was fabulous! The location in Corrales was close to restaurants, shops and an awesome brewery. The home itself was a sanctuary of peace and rest. We were also within minutes to walking trails, which was great for our dog, Josie. All the amenities for a long stay were provided, and the hosts were always quick to respond with any needs that came up. We would 100% recommend this home to anyone coming to the Albuquerque area, and we hope to stay again someday. Thank you to our hosts!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great! Very peaceful in Corrales! Clean house, easy to get to local restaurants and shops."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gorgeous gem in Corrales, NM! This historic yet modern appointed home was ideal for our quick trip to the Albuquerque area with our little dog. The private fenced yard with green grass was an absolute dream for her to run and feel right at home. Step inside and you marvel at how beautifully the historic qualities of this old Bridge house merge with modern furnishings, stunning art, ultra luxe bedrooms, linens and the coziest living room. We made some wonderful meals in the fully equipped kitchen and also enjoyed some of the fantastic restaurants and wine tastings just minutes down the road. Communicating with Leah was a breeze and there is no doubt that we'll be booking again for our next trip!! A GEM! HIGHLY RECOMMEND A++"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful peaceful area. Nicely decorated home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This sweet Corrales home couldn’t have been more cozy. We absolutely loved the home and the location. I would really like to stay in the summer, I can imagine how much more beautiful it is. Great stay!"

This is a wonderful home in a great location. It’s a charming and cozy home with everything you could need. We took our dogs with us and appreciated the fenced in yard and there’s also a nice walking path across the street! This home deserves 10 stars!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little home perfect for our holiday getaway. Lots of little touches that made us feel at home, like the Christmas tree for the holidays!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were so excited to find a home in Corrales and this one did not disappoint! Great grassy yard for our two pups. Lots of space. Comfortable furniture. Plenty of pots and pans to cook at the house when we wanted to. Quiet and private. Close to groceries and restaurants. Would recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful location for being in Corrales and exploring the north valley of Albuquerque!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A new home away from home for me! This casita has so much personality, is cozy, feels safe, and is located in a quaint location. I felt comfortable from start to finish and will definitely be looking forward to another stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a welcome respite from alternative hotel options! Great choice for a family with energetic boys who need to be outside in a fenced in yard (would be perfect if you wanted to bring your pet along too). Relaxing by the fire pit in the evenings was a wonderful way to end the day. All needed amenities were provided- the robes and snacks were a nice touch. Leah was so helpful and responsive- especially after we forgot our phone chargers in the master bedroom. Will be planning to stay here again for our annual trip.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Leah’s home is a gem! We felt comfortable as soon as we walked in! It has a beautiful fenced in yard-which was perfect for our dogs. There’s also a nice walking path across the street! The location in Corrales is perfect as well! We will definitely return!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house in a great location! We couldn't have asked for more. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this super comfy Corrales adobe. Leah has created the perfect NM vibe, including thoughtful touches. The beds and linens are super inviting and the fire pit was the perfect spot to relax. Great stay!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying in this beautiful home!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay at this beautiful Bridge House, best Air BnB in Albuquerque!!! Great Location too! Thank you"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful retreat, full of light and calm. (And, NM history!)
I am a light sleeper and bed sensitive, so I was alert to a previous review indicating that the home was beside a busy road. It was not an issue in any way and the beds were extremely comfortable :-)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at this charming casita in Corrales, while visiting Albuquerque, New Mexico, and we couldn't have been happier with our stay. From start to finish, our hosts were incredibly kind and accommodating, ensuring that our trip was as enjoyable as possible.
The location of the casita was perfect. Nestled in the beautiful village of Corrales, we were able to enjoy the tranquility and natural beauty of the area while still being within easy reach of Albuquerque. It was the perfect balance of peacefulness and convenience.
If you're looking for an authentic, cozy, and welcoming place to stay in Corrales while exploring Albuquerque, we highly recommend Leah's place. It's always a fantastic feeling to be greated by a very warm and welcoming host. A charming and homely atmosphere, made for a truly delightful experience. We would love to visit again in the future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Leah was a kind and responsive host. The house was absolutely beautiful and a peaceful place to rest and restore during our wedding week. Thank you for everything!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house & location are lovely, with a very relaxed feel. It feels further away from 'civilization' than it actually is. The east porch is a perfect spot to soak up the morning sun. Our trip revolved around seeing the Annular Eclipse and the Balloon Fiesta in October 2023, and it turns out that the porch is also the perfect spot to see all of that!
The house is spotlessly clean and welcoming, with some interesting history attached.
We very much enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend it highly."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly an authentic and beautiful place to stay. We felt right at home with the cozy high quality bedding and towels, authentic NM decor and beautiful private yards. Must stay!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Leah’s place in Corrales. The location was amazing given its proximity to the Bosque trails and restaurants in Corrales. During our 4-night stay, we did a mix of remote work and relaxation. Our dog loved the fenced yard. The hosts were responsive to our messages. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! The house was spotless and tidy. Lots of rich history there as well. We very much enjoyed our stay at the bridge house!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space! Perfect for our family!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was our FOURTH time staying at the Bridge House and at this point it feels like our home away from home! Leah and her family maintain this southwest jewel box so beautifully, and it’s one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever had. Comfortable beds, luxurious linens and towels, everything we could need in the kitchen, lots of room to spread out (and a fabulous yard for relaxing with our pups). Corrales is such a special place, can’t recommend this home and these hosts enough!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Leah’s space is a wonderful place to stay! Such a cozy and inviting space and conveniently located for our stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful and well furnished with lovely decor. It’s the perfect blend of historical with modern amenities. The grounds and courtyard stand out. We only used the refrigerator and microwave, so can’t speak to the functionality of the kitchen for cooking. The house was spotless with extra linens, blankets plus new, luxurious towels. Beds were comfortable (on the softer side as far as mattress firmness). Leah checked on us with daily messages, which was superb service. Would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our second visit to the Bridge House. We love Corralles - and the charm and location of this home. Our host, Leah, is professional and ensures you will enjoy your visit to this very cool Rio Grande Bosque village."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is off the beaten path a bit, but so close to grocery, restaurants, gas stations and easy access roads to get where you’re going. The pictures are accurate. Beds are super comfortable. The A/C is different but works well -no issues. This is a rustic place with antique furnishings that my Mom appreciated. I liked that there were floor fans in every room for air movement. Ample outdoor space too."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Leah’s place in Corales and enjoyed the spacious backyard. Each room is well appointed, and we appreciated Leah accommodating an early check-in. I enjoyed a few runs across the street along the acequia, and the house is just a short drive down to grocery stores, restaurants, and the Cottonwood Mall."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel a lot—in this country and in Europe-The Bridge House is in now our top 3–number 1 in New Mexico. We felt at home immediately upon entering. The hosts are so thoughtful —we had everything we needed-and more. The home is special. We loved reading the history and being around all the antique furniture and objects and art. We loved that the hole is well-appointed, but uncluttered. Very comfy beds and great linens. The sofa is also wonderful. We loved exploring Corrales from The Bridge House."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Bridge House was great! The house is beautifully decorated and very cozy. The beds are really comfortable and the yard is even better than the pictures. Leah was a great host. We’re looking forward to our next stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Leah was a wonderful host! The photographs don’t do this beautiful home justice. My mum and I were looking for a peaceful base from which to explore New Mexico for a few days. Leah’s place far exceeded our expectations. Not only was it absolutely pristine and quiet despite being near the road, but it was also beautifully decorated with thoughtful touches such as a bookshelf full of classic literature! Leah was extremely responsive and helpful with everything that came up during our stay. This is a gem of a property, and we would love to visit again in the future!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place & convenient location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here. The house was beautiful and it was located out in the country, but not far from Corrales and Albuquerque. They had a big, fenced in yard, with real grass. Our dog, Molly loved it. I went to an Albuquerque Isotopes baseball game. Great atmosphere. Really fun night. Jeremy came by on the morning we were leaving. Couldn’t have been nicer. The only negative thing we experienced was eating at the Dragon House. Really, really bad. But we would definitely come back to Leah and Jeremy’s."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It’s rare that an AirBNB is truly nicer in person than the photos, but this place is! It’s also much more spacious than the photos present. The ceilings, I’m 6’3”, also worried me because they looked low, but I had plenty of space and I loved the ceilings. Everything about this place is amazing and it’s full of incredible details that you just won’t see in the photos. Also right across from a vineyard, donkeys, antique tractors - incredible setting!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Can’t say enough about how beautiful, inviting, and down-to-earth this home is. Beautifully-decorated and stocked with all the necessary amenities needed for a week’s getaway. Leah was super responsive and accommodating. We will return to The Bridge House!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here! We stayed for a month and the house and location were perfect. We had everything we needed and the fenced in yard was great for our dogs. Good communication from the hosts as well. Can’t recommend this place enough!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed a week at The Bridge House and really enjoyed ourselves. It’s a great location in the lovely village of Corrales. Leah was terrific to deal with. Always responsive and anticipated our questions or needs. We had two of our dogs with us, and so we really liked having a fenced yard for them. Furnishings in the house are comfortable and cozy. I was looking for a quiet, relaxing week in Corrales. The Bridge House was just the ticket."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at the Bridge House and we've already booked our third! Leah is such a wonderful and responsive host, and the house was a quiet, peaceful home base for three adults and two pups. We were there during particularly chilly weather and the central heat was great, the house was always cozy. This space combines the best of a nice hotel with the comfort of home: High quality linens, towels, robes (!), bath products, a very well-stocked kitchen with great appliances, beautiful walking trails nearby and well positioned between the heart of ABQ and nearby Rio Rancho. It's even more lovely than the pictures and very fairly priced, if you're looking at this property just book it, you won't be sorry!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cozy house! Beds were extremely comfortable. Good location to quickly access ABQ and Santa Fe!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED the Bridge House! We felt right at home. If you want a great host, spacious bedrooms, a CLEAN home, and good location, this is your place!! Can’t wait to be back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family was looking for a house that was comfortable and family and dog friendly, and this house was perfect. We enjoyed our stay and even wished we were staying longer!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay. Comfortable, clean, great patios for catching a bit of sun. I was so happy to find breakfast tea in the welcome basket, as I am a tea drinker! I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. Could not have asked for more."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Leah's place is a fantastic spot when looking to stay in the Corrales/Rio Rancho area. The home was very comfortable and clean. You can tell that she has paid attention to the finer details to ensure a great stay for her guests. The beds are comfortable, towels are fluffy and soft, the living room is cozy and quiet. The home sits right next to the major road running through Corrales so there is regular traffic, but the home's walls are thick and do a great job of muting most of the road noise. Getting a solid night's rest was not an issue if you're a light sleeper like myself.
Overall, don't hesitate to stay here. Leah was communicative, the home is fantastic, and you're close to everything that you might need during your time in Corrales."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with plenty of room. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. Comfortable beds. Very clean and well kept with antiques which we loved. There was an explanation of the history of the house and local area that made for interesting reading. Charming. Would definitely stay again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay! This isn't just a house, it's a home! You can tell that this home is loved! Perfect historical adobe for a true New Mexico experience! Very clean with extra amenities! Great location close to restaurants and shopping! We would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable, quiet, peaceful location. set up nicely and conveniently located near anything a person could need. Great place, and great host. Thanks!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful house, even better than in the photos. Great layout, bright. Has anything you may need. Good quality furniture, excellent mattress, sheets, towels and even bathrobes! The house is well insulated, warm. Kitchen is well stuffed as well. Knifes are sharp, pots and pans pleasure to cook in. Amazing fenced garden, best in the area. Our dogs loved it and so did we. Great location, very peaceful, right on the trail along Corrales. Close to many trails around Albuquerque. Good restaurants. Our only struggle was that it is not walkable, especially important if you are with dogs. The host does not advertise it as such, so it’s not a complaint, just sharing in case important to someone reading this review. We could take our dogs in the morning onto the trail, but after sunset there wasn’t anywhere to go as most of the streets are dead ends.
Many thanks to our wonderful hosts for being very receptive and accommodating."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Bridge house was the perfect place to stay over the Thanksgiving holiday with our family and two dogs. Leah was easy to communicate with, responsive and extremely friendly. The house was extremely clean, spacious, had two extremely large private bedrooms and a great living area that was perfect for two couples. The whole house was well appointed with all the amenities you would need in the kitchen, including spices, oil for cooking, coffee, etc. and the bathroom also had all the essentials you might need, even an extra toothbrush if you happened to leave yours behind! The yard was completely perfect for our dogs to stretch their legs and it was close enough to walk them down the street to hike in the Bosque. This was by far one of the nicest, dog friendly places we have stayed and we hope to return in the future!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a pleasure to stay in this historic adobe home furnished with antiques. Spacious, beautiful, and such a good night’s sleep on very comfortable beds."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great experience! The Bridge House is the perfect embodiment of the desert southwest. So tranquil and charming. We drove all the way from NE Wisconsin and ended up spending most of our week in New Mexico at “home”! The location is easy to navigate from. There are lots of great restaurants nearby, as well as everyday goods and services. Our host, Leah responded quickly to any questions we had, and did everything possible to make us and our dog feel welcomed. We hope to be lucky enough to make a return visit someday!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can't say enough good things about the Bridge House! Leah's thoughtful attention to detail is evident from the moment you walk in the door. The house is sparkling clean and has everything a traveler could need and more. From the beautiful furnishings and comfortable bedding to the lovely outdoor areas and kitchen - we enjoyed every minute! The Bridge House ranks among our top stays - we felt so cozy, relaxed, and at home - the house made our time in New Mexico even more special.
Communications with Leah were a piece of cake and she was always quick to respond.
Corrales is a perfect location if you want to be situated between Albuquerque and Santa Fe and prefer to stay out of touristy areas. The village is fantastic - terrific breweries, wineries, and restaurants are minutes away by car, the locals are extremely friendly and welcoming, and every convenience from Albertson's to Target is just up the road.
If you're considering it, do yourself a favor and book the Bridge House! You'll be happy that you did. I can't imagine more perfect spot for a couples, friends, or family getaway!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful New Mexican home with easy access to Balloon Fiesta transportation, restaurants and grocery stores. The beds are super comfortable and the bathroom was nicely set up so several people could use it at one time. The living room was a great place to hang out, chat and watch TV. We have already recommended it to friends!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Leah was super kind and was great at communicating. Thanks so much!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bridge House is one of those special places that adds so much to a vacation stay. I was fortunate enough to stay there for two nights while attending the magical 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Festival. The home has a wonderful history and is as charming and beautiful as can be, with antiques galore and gorgeous artwork throughout. The bed I slept in was extremely comfortable with high quality linens. There were snacks in the kitchen, along with a welcome note and gift awaiting my arrival. I had my small dog with me and she loved the fenced-in yard with lush green grass (a rarity in the Southwest)! Communication was prompt, helpful and friendly, you couldn’t ask for better hosts! The property is well-located in beautiful Corrales, close to all that Albuquerque has to offer and plenty of its own special places to try. This is a rare find and I hope to return sometime soon."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough good things about this beautiful Corrales home. Communication with the host was fantastic (prompt and responsive, including going above and beyond to help me navigate some wifi hiccups on arrival that were no fault of theirs). The home is beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and set up like a five star hotel. The bath towels and bed linens were marvelous, the beds and sofa were very comfortable, and the whole home is filled with thoughtful decor and wonderful little southwest touches. The location is perfect for exploring Corrales and hopping into ABQ, and our two small pups had a marvelous time lounging on the patio and chasing the occasional bunny. The only disappointment was having to leave! We truly hope we have the opportunity to stay here again, and highly recommend this gorgeous home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a lovely stay, of the Airbnb's we stayed at this one is easily the cleanest, hosts communicated at the appropriate times, lovely fenced in yard for the dog, it is adjacent to a well traveled street which you can hear outside sitting on the porch, however the walls are so thick once you're inside you will not hear the road noise, would definitely stay here on our next trip"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time in Corrales staying at the Bridge House. It is filled with charm and hospitality. There is a lovely book with information about the history of Corrales and the house. We loved the authentic New Mexico ambiance.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! The lovely home felt very much in touch with the history of the area. Thoughtful furnishing, stylish touches, very clean, room to spread out. Very relaxing and special. Great communication with host. 10/10 would definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second extended stay at the Bridge House, and we could not express more how wonderful the home, location, and host are! Unfortunately we bought a home nearby and we won't have a very good excuse to stay again, but we will most definitely direct friends and family to The Bridge House."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bridge House is excellent in every single way! The interior is beautifully decorated with a perfect combination of historic charm and modern updates, not to mention it was extremely clean! My husband had to work a full day during our stay and he was very happy with the wireless speed and desk accommodations. The location provides a quick and easy drive to Albuquerque and Rio Rancho, but you will never want to leave the views from the patios and the relaxing, peaceful atmosphere that the Village of Corrales offers! We can't wait to stay again and again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying in the Bridge House. The beautiful home was spotless, comfortable and the location was ideal!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Book this AirBnB immediately! It’s so lovely, spacious, and unique — it’s what I hope for when booking AirBnBs. There are thoughtful touches everywhere — kids cups/plates in the kitchen, games and books in the living room, extra blankets, pillows, and linens, a welcome packets with recommendations for local spots, etc.
Corrales is adorable and this is perfectly located. We loved our stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an adorable old-style authentically New Mexican adobe house. My family and I loved staying here. The host, Leah, had great communication leading up to the trip and during our stay. The added detail of snacks in the kitchen and a few toiletries in the bathroom were a really nice touch. The beds were super comfortable and the sheets were like butter. The house is very comfortable, clean and beautiful. Loved the decor. The location was close enough to Albuquerque, yet felt like you were a bit more out in the country. You could see donkeys across the street and vineyards. My family and I also appreciated reading through the house manual which detailed places to eat as well as the interesting history of the house and the city of Corrales. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! My family and I plan to stay here again the next time we come to visit our relatives in Albuquerque."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was absolutely perfect for our extended stay. The location, layout and amenities were ideal for our family as we relocate to the area and explore the neighborhoods. The relaxing outdoor spaces and well appointed furniture and kitchen made it extremely comfortable. If you are interested in the slow pace of Corrales with the benefit of having a big city nearby, this is the home for it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful home and stay! Very welcoming and super quick to answer any questions.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is beautiful! A perfect little southwestern Oasis nestled in the perfect spot in Corrales! The view was incredible and we enjoyed our morning cup of coffee on the patio And enjoyed the sunshine and yard. Truly a little vacation destination. Very comfortable and best of all very clean! We used it for a bridal party to get ready and it was so much better than anything else we would have found!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Look no further and book this place! My family and I loved everything! The house is quaint and perfect. Beds were comfortable, there is plenty of space to stretch out, and the yard is perfect to hang out or let your dog roam. We hope to stay again in the future!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,11 out of 10! This house is so special and there are many unique and interesting features about the house and furnishings. It was very spacious and comfortable and we really appreciated the cute little enclosed private yard. The local restaurant recommendations were helpful and our dinner at Indigo Crow was delicious! The location felt private but was also very convenient to food and groceries. There are wineries close by and we were able to get lots of fresh items at the Sunday morning Growers Market just a mile away. It was our first time visiting Albuquerque and our stay here made it extra memorable. Thank you Leah and Jason!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a beautiful and clean place. The money is just not worth it if you won’t explore the place. For instance if you check in at 6 and leave at 9 the next morning, you might overspend on this."

I didn’t realize time that the apartment included a kitchen and living room that would be shared with three other apartments, but it really wasn’t a problem at all. Our ‘apartment’ had a comfy bed, TV, desk and a nice, clean bathroom. Everything was spotless and appeared to be very new. Wasn’t able to use the pool area this time, but we hope to be back!"

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this place for one night right before a flight. It was well located for that and the area felt very safe. Since it was just one night we did not need much except for a bed and a shower before a long flight. Unfortunately, the shower was terrible - almost no water pressure and the water stayed stuck in the bathtub. Also no soap for washing your hands in the sink.
Other than that the place was clean and the night was quiet even though we shared the house with other people."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for all

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Darron's place was quiet and his directions were easy to follow for check in. Any issues were extremely minor. I sometimes would have to enter the code multiple times to enter the front door. And 1 night it was pretty warm because another guest turned up the thermostat. Thankfully there was a fan in my room. But like I said all very minor and had no other issues. I would definitely stay there again when in town.

If you are a light sleeper, I recommend asking for an upstairs unit. It was my first stay in a shared unit but it did not disappoint. Looking forward to staying here again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing met expectations that were clearly provided through the listing and the host was helpful and responsive for a couple of inquiries. Host takes pride in the Airbnb and it was a great value! Right next to the airport to boot.

This was my first time to NM and the instructions and communication from my host Darron made me feel totally safe as a solo traveler. Very easy rude from the airport and I was given a power point with photos prior to my check in that helped make accessing my place a complete breeze! I would hands down stay here again (I was sad to leave!) and will be recommending to friends and family.! All the staff that I met on the grounds wee friendly and welcoming. Love the gated community as an extra level to add to peace of mind. Thank you Darron and Jay? Corrie

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location with direct airport proximity perfect for us, but also right to the interstate.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host(s) are all kind, cooperative and willing to answer questions. Their location is safe, secure and restful. I'll definitely look to them again in the future.
The instructions are a bit verbose. As a semi-professional writer, there's a lot of ""please read"" followed by ""also really important"". I can't even be mad, though because anyone who doesn't want to sift through all of that can simply message them directly and they'll take care of you promptly!
I'm glad I stayed here and give full credit to the host/co-hosts for not just ""getting me through"" my visit but making it convenient, efficient and positive.
Thank you."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I loved the place. The gated community was friendly and safe. The gym and pool were awesome (though the water was pretty cold this time of year). My only issue was that I didn't have a car, so I had to take a lot of Ubers to get around. The host warned me about that beforehand, so it wasn't that big a deal. Overall, I'd love to stay there again (with a car next time)."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely book again !!! place was amazing
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cost efficient stay at this gated community right next to the Sunport Airport. It's listed as a microhotel, which is a great way to describe it. It's a mix between a hotel and a hostel. Each unit has multiple rooms with their own key code locks on the door handle to enter. You also need a key code to get into the community and into the unit itself. There are a lot of shared community items in the kitchen and free coffee. It was fairly clean, although a bit of clutter in the kitchen given that many guests seem to leave behind a lot of food without marking it as sharable and forget to do their dishes. I would suggest a once a month deep clean just to clear it and to get some of the harder to reach parts in the house/rooms. Can't beat this for the price though."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Stayed here on our one day trip to Albuquerque. It was convenient and commutable distance from downtown

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home we stayed in was beautiful and I loved that it included a coffee bar. The other guests were friendly. It was conveniently located in town surrounded by things to do.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There had been a mixup and the room had not been cleaned after the previous occupants left. We arrived after midnight , but we still got a quick and understanding response. Darren changed the sheets himself in the early hours and the place was thoroughly cleaned the next day.
We had a fantastic time in Albuquerque, enjoying the rattle snake museum, cable car, the botanical gardens ( beautiful) and zoo, plus Albuquerque museum which had some wonderful art."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay again
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice for the price and felt very safe in the gated community. Outside of walking past other rooms, I couldn't really hear anyone. Only complaint would be the air as it does get warmer at night and there's no control for the rooms, only the house."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! The place is very close to the airport and yet very quiet. All the guests in the house were quiet and respectful.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing stay at Darron’s room really clean, easy to access everything from the gate to the room. It was a 12min drive to the aquarium/zoo and that was perfect. Even tho the house/room was close to the airport you don’t hear no airplanes pass by and can’t hear the highway either. 10/10 recommended!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5-star review for a comfortable and safe environment! Great communication and effective instructions provided.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value! The place is comfortable and clean!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little hitch once we got to the property: we didn’t have the proper instructions for getting to the unit once inside the gate. But the hosts were very responsive and then we found the place. The unit was clean and comfortable. Rather like a mini hotel. Other guests were in the house and we had interaction with them in the shared space only if we chose. The room was adequate, clean and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space! Owner answered messages within minutes! Clean, comfortable, with easy check in. Would definitely recommend and stay again when in Albuquerque."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Darron’s place is a hidden gem!

Thank you for having us.
Well definitely come back!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place to stay. A little bit out of the main city area but super quick drive to get to anywhere. Gated community that is super secure. It is next to the freeway though so if noise is a big thing for you, bring some earplugs. Easy checkin as it is all electronic but a little hard to get to. Just read their instructions and you can figure it out quick."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, and very quiet. My room was spotless, and comfortable"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying here, it was perfect!! Clean , quiet and very comfortable ! I would strongly recommend and would choose to stay again when I come visit Albuquerque!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hubby and I first experience sharing space with other tenants. Still felt very safe and everyone was respectful. Clear instructions provided so one could understand how space was organized. Would be a great place for a large group with 5 separate rooms.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Darrons place was perfect for our quick stayover. the pool and clubhouse were amazing! super close to the airport which is very convenient.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was actually better than expected. Maybe it was the room I was given but it was always so quiet and peaceful. Considering I mostly just slept there, this was important to me. I used the gym once, I couldn’t figure out the sauna it may have not been working, not sure. But other than that I had a short trip and I had a pleasant stay."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband & I had a great overnight stay at Darron's place. From the start Darron and his co-hosts were amazing hosts with prompt response to every need & question. The C room we had was basic but adequate. The bed was perfect with clean comforter; the house was peaceful, we slept like babies. The bathroom was clean and efficient. The house is in a huge condo complex, required some getting to and the view is of other houses. We didn't use the pool or gym. We are at the Frontier per Darron's recommendation. Happy we were here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable & clean. Excellent place for my overnight stay in Albuquerque. Hosts were proactive & clear with communication.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay! I just needed a safe place to stay overnight while I move for the military! All the hotels were easily $140+ but this stay was a lot more comfortable, safe, and extremely cheap for how great it is. Hosts were proactive and checked in on me every chance they could. Super easy to find and awesome key-less check in features. The other tenants were also friendly, quiet, and easy to get along with. Highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,the stay and price were good. the reason for a bad stay overall is because the A/C was not working upstairs at all. lowered the thermostat and the room did not cool down. it was hot in the room both nights. only saving grace was the fan in the room.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,clean and convenient
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bedding was high quality and the Bed was extremely comfortable!
I highly recommend this place.
The only recommendation I have is to make sure you use the parking pass, which is given to you, or your car will get towed!
I had a great stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to the airport, all amenities that one would need! Thanks for hosting."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend staying here. Extremely convenient to the airport. Be sure to check out fridge/cupboards before grocery shopping. I appreciate people leaving peanut butter and other unused/unexpired food for the next people to use. Everyone that stayed were quiet and respectful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hosts were very communicative and respectful. Instructions were clear once you find your building.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great deal! Very thorough instructions which were very helpful since you have to use several codes. Easy to get around Albuquerque since is right next to the 25.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The moment we walked inside the living space, we smelled the clean aroma! Very regal and up to date. Luckily we got the downstairs room because it felt like home coming out to the living space and dining area! Room was so cozy and clean! Spacious living quarter and everything we needed was in our reach. Definitely looking forward to our nexr stay"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,thanks so much for being my host y'all! what a great place for the money and all the values and amenities available. my second time to stay here and I'll stay again if I'm in Albuquerque area. only one snag with my stay completely out of their control the building lost power Tuesday afternoon I did not have power until the next day. it wasn't really a big deal cuz it wasn't very hot outside and Darren let me use the washer and dryer at another unit. he also refunded the night I was without power even though it was out of his control. See ya next time !
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lilith and I would like to thank Darron, Grace and Jay for hosting our stay in ABQ! It was very nice, clean and quiet environment. Thank you for being communicative with us while we had our flight delays!(:"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect homebase for our weeklong trip to ABQ. Five minutes from the airport but in a quiet gated community. We cooked in the kitchen daily, and enjoyed the fitness center and pool that were a two minute walk away. The team of hosts were incredible accommodating and responsive. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was perfect for what I needed. It was cozy, comfortable, private, and the bed was very comfortable. My one note (which isn’t a big deal) the towels could be upgraded. They leave little fuzzies all over your body and face. That’s literally my only critique everything else was 12/10!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"met all of my expectations and beyond. Perfect spot to sleep, study, work and has a great lounge downstairs with shared kitchen. Clean and fresh, furniture is new. Never seen beds so nice in an average hotel, this is like a 5star bed. It's not overcrowded and was very quiet, perfect airbnb by definition."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, comfortable space, especially traveling alone. (And I’m pretty picky about cleanliness…) The neighborhood is located right in the middle of the hotels and rental car location with easy access to highways and good dining. The hosts were especially responsive. I would definitely book a repeat stay if I’m ever in the area again. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I’ve lived there 21 days and found it really peaceful and clean, I recommended to other friends of mine to stay there through their training. Thank you so much dear Darron for whatever you have done to me."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 5 nights at Darron 's rental and had a great experience. He communicated check in instructions really well, and the place was exactly as described in the listing. The other guests in the unit were very quiet and respectful, in fact we barely knew there were other people sharing the space. Plentiful parking, easy access to the highway and great facilities- a very positive experience all around. We will stay here again next time we're in Albuquerque. Thanks, Darron!"

2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and worked, but I would not stay here again. The listing states that it is the entire home, but that is not the case. There is no kitchen, or even a microwave or even a table to sit at. The was a flimsy barn door that was locked and separated us from the rest of the house. It did not provide us with much security, privacy or sound control. I was woken up both nights we stayed there (at 1:30 and 2 am) from people on the other side of the door. We could clearly hear conversations, dogs walking around, a microwave, etc."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The good:
This host is very quick to respond. Place was really clean. The Bathroom has been upgraded.
The neighborhood is nice. No loud parties or music at night. I felt safe here.
There is porch seating overlooking the street, which was nice in the evening.
There is an electric tea kettle, a keurig, mugs, spoons, and coffee/tea provided by the host.
The neutral:
""Filtered water"" means a pitcher filter in the fridge. You refill it from the bathtub.
You can hear the host and her dog through the doors and walls.
If you are using the sofa as a bed, there is not much seating.
The bad:
The electrical outlets all are worn, so its impossible to charge a device here. Plus, there is the safety issue of worn outlets sparking.
One window in the living room has only a sheer curtain on it (faces windows of host home and neighbor), and the front window has semi-sheers. No shades/blinds under either one. Felt really weird at night, especially for sleeping in the living room."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for the last minute accommodation Meg! I had a last minute trip to Albuquerque for a repair job and Meg was kind to allow a last minute booking. Her communication was much better than mine, and I felt taken care of in a nice clean place. While I meant to book for a few days, I mistakenly choose one, which resulted in a misunderstanding of checkout time. Meg was gracious to allow a rebooking with discounted cleaning, however, I was not up for the mandatory new app fees. I would definitely book again, preferably not while driving or working on the roof, to make life easier for everyone."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Their place was super nice and cozy! Definitely a place I was looking forward to going back to after exploring out for a bit and having an exhausting day. They added a nice touch in the room with a bunch of pamphlets on places to visit or eat if you've never been and I appreciated that especially since I had no clue what to do aside from my own original reason for visiting. They were also nice enough to let my friend and I go back and stay for a few hours because we had no place to go and our train was delayed. Super hospitable couple and if I go back to Albuquerque I definitely plan on booking with them again :)

Also Truffle is a super sweet dog, and the linens are soft!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Volk and the pup, Truffle, were both friendly. Didn't get to meet Meg. They had treats for my dogs and a very cute space. Bed was a little hard to me, but obviously that's a personal opinion and I'm sure others prefer a harder bed."

The extra touches such as the power strip and the mini fridge stocked with a variety of beverages were unexpected surprises. Did I mention how soft the towels are? Yo should definitely considering booking this place if you are in the Albuquerque area.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean home! As advertised, with very nice touches like a power strip, mints. Perfect, low maintenance place to crash while in town!"

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I stayed here for one night during our road trip. The house was very cute and clean! And the check in process was also really easy & simple. One of the hosts went out of his way to show us around the neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for everything!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place. near airport. clean home, friendly pooch."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second stay at Meg's place. The space is cozy and quite spacious. Self-check-in was easy and the space had all of the amenities I needed. I also got to see Truffle again <3 I would not hesitate to stay here if I am in ABQ again and highly recommend it!
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent Value!!
Clean luxurious sheets
Hot Shower
Great location for an early flight."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Meg's place is the front section of their home. There is a large living room with TV and a comfy couch as well as a refrigerator where Meg provides drinks of various types. A curtain divides the AirBnB section from their living quarters. in addition to the living room, you have access to a private full bathroom and a large bedroom. The neighborhood is quiet. Restaurants on Central Avenue are about 10 blocks away.
Meg has a dog, Truffles. Truffles if very laid back and friendly and sleeps a lot.
Overall I had a good stay at Meg's place. I didn't meet Meg but spoke briefly with her partner. It's a fine place to stay on a business trip to Albuquerque."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room is clean and comfy. Meg is very thoughtful and prepared everything we need. Their dog Truffle is a super quite but sweet girl! We only spent one night here but we'd love to recommend this place to others!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a good stay at Meg's place for 3 nights while on a work trip. The space was perfect for my needs and I appreciated the thoughtful touches like filtered water, towels & toiletries, and mints. Truffle was my constant companion and I enjoyed having her around. I will be back for another stay when I return to Albuquerque in a few weeks. :)"
2018-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is not a place I would come back to. The bed was very uncomfortable (we could feel springs poking through in any position) and we were surprised at the lack of attention to detail. For example, when we arrived at night the porch light was off and the living room light couldn't be turned on, the bathroom was not very clean (ring around the toilet bowl, spots on the mirror), and one of our hosts ran a coffee grinder or blender at 1am. On the bright side, Meg and Volk were very responsive to texts and Volk was very personable and helpful when we met him. They kindly left the porch and living room lights on the second night, left us filtered water and glasses, and had refreshments on offer. Their dog was also very sweet."

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place
2017-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Meg's place is near ABQ airport and it is very convenient. I did not have a pleasure of meeting Meg due to her work schedule, her communication was immediate and clear. One thing I noticed was that she has housemate(s) who stayed up late night."
,,,"Be absolutely clear THIS IS NOT LACY'S PLACE. She has 40 plus other properties. The owners live a few metres away- met them spontaneously on departure. I have requested a full refund from Airbnb. The casita is gorgeous and was clean with interesting art/ location, plentiful hot water and a comfy bed BUT I did not appreciate hunting for the welcome book without success so looking online and finding it mostly out of date. Kitchen- food on crockery/no hand towel or tea towel or cloth to wipe surfaces. No info about what to recycle/ several pans need to be removed as the non stick surface is badly damaged. No tea and chipped mugs. No plugs for kitchen sinks. Bedroom- couldn't use main light as remote was missing/ box of dead cockroaches in cupboard- need clearing and dirty washing removing/ sheets incorrect size for bed. Terrible and inconsistent wifi. Bathroom- no hand towels or bath cleaner/cloth. Generic communication before and after visit. Initial responses to my concerns then nothing"
,,,"Aesthetically the place was nice, but almost everything to do with the plumbing was bad. I paid 300$ for two nights and the hot shower handle fell off, the toilet wouldn’t flush I had to fix it myself by adjusting the chain length inside, the shower head was not putting out water and fell off, I had to stand under it while it dripped on my head. And the kitchen sink is clogged with something which made it hard to do dishes. I was a place to bring my girlfriend to, but I would have been embarrassed so I didn’t. Id rather have gone somewhere else that had working parts for plumbing than stay somewhere aesthetic. It was difficult to get ahold of Lacy as she never answered the phone out of the three times I called. She was slow to respond with text messaging. And when she did respond, she just asked for photos but did not bother to fix the components. She later offered me another place but it was too late in the day and I had plans. I asked if I could get a credit and was offered 5% off. ☹️"
,,,"People inside the same house which i was not aware of, they only thing divided us was a door. They were loud couldn’t sleep because the other people were nosing/ loud at 3 and 5 in the morning. The house smelled like dogs"
