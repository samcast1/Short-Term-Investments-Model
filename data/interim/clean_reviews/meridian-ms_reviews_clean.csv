2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Downtown is a kind of interesting place. However Jeff's place is a very welcoming and friendly little community. Very safe and secure. Clean linens and all sorts of little things to make you feel at home while away from home.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great Apartments/Lofts in downtown Meridian – metropolitan loft living at surprisingly budget friendly prices.
Jeff and Sonya are a genuine pleasure to deal with, both make checking in a breeze and are always there should an issue* or question arise. We have stayed at every hotel/motel in town from the Drury INN to the Baymont and Microtel suites across from the mall – Lofts were hands down winner everything considered. Beyond the clear price comparison, each of the furnished lofts includes basic utensils, cookware, household items, wifi, full kitchens w/dishwasher, in unit laundry...and even complimentary supplies of laundry soap, dryer sheets and the like.
We can only speak for ourselves, but have traveled extensively both in the US and abroad and the overall experience would be hard to beat anywhere. Talking strictly within the Meridian area, during our (so far 7mth) house hunting journey we’ve stayed at nearly all available accommodations and are beyond glad to have found our go-to place/people for our future needs!
*Note: The only issue we had turned out to be ‘user error,’ cleared up within minutes of reaching out for clarity. (Husband couldn’t figure out how to use the shower and thought it was broken)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location! Super cool, historic building. Loved having a full kitchen and washer and dryer. I will definitely stay here again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Best deal in Meridian if you want full featured apartment with kitchen, washer/dryer. Very open and airy. Walk to the best restaurant in town, Weidmans. Also can walk to city hall, Dumont Plaza, Riley Center for any events happening there. Generally quiet. Friendly and very helpful staff."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location! Very clean and spacious! Jeff and Sonya are both great to work with! They are friendly and quick to respond to any questions or concerns. I will definitely stay here again.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was in a great location, all the stores and restaurants where less than 10 mins away. While still sitting in a quiet corner of the town.
It’s a huge apartment much more space than one person can need.
Jeff was very accommodating, he was even working with me to find housing for my coworkers"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved our loft!! Have nothing put positive to say about this place. Jeff is the bomb.com!! Thanks for everything and we will be back!!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Everything at my stay was amazing!!!! The entire place was squeaky clean!!!! Jeff made sure I was well taken care with everything I needed.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I stayed at Jeff’s place while moving back across the country. Our stay was longer term than the usual but he graciously worked with us and our ever-changing timeline while we waited to close on our home.
The loft was very spacious and clean with a full kitchen and a W&D in the unit. There was even a little goodie basket to welcome us! These small touches became tremendous comforts that went a long way while living out of our suitcases.
His hospitality and local recommendations made our adjustment to the area so much easier. We were less stressed knowing we had a comfortable place to call “home,” even just temporarily. I would absolutely stay with Jeff again and highly recommend his place to my friends and family."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What was amazing about this location is that they decorated it great taste. Especially liked the iguana placard on the kitchen wall. The washer and dryer came in very handy. With in walking distance of the Brickhaus (the best hamburgers in the U.S.) Really enjoyed staying there while working at the Navy Base for over a month.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice place and tall ceilings. Though close to the train yard were never a bother. Awesome to be down town and close to restaurants.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Jim's place was very nice. I felt comfortable there and everything was just as he described it. Check-in was super easy and all of his directions were spot on. It is a historic home, full of charm, but it also has all of the modern comforts desired. The bed was super comfortable:) If I ever find myself needing a place to stay in Meridian again, I will definitely check here first."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little suite with sitting area and well equipped kitchen area. All was very clean and neat. Had a real back then feeling. Neighborhood and yard was somewhat unsettling, but neighbor was very helpful and inside made up for outside. Would stay again. Great deal for the price."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to be close as our Mom is dying. Jim was extremely helpful with our request and the home was so beautiful it was a nice distraction to our situation. Our Mom would have loved the beautiful history and beauty of this home.
Beds were super comfortable, had everything we needed there and more. We will be back."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this stay! This is the second time we’ve picked Jim’s place. It is clean and welcoming. Decorated with beautiful antique furniture. We love how comfortable the huge bed was! The kitchenette helps to make the room perfectly accommodating. The house is in the perfect location to be able to safely walk to downtown Meridian.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and beautiful accommodations! We will not look further when visiting Meridian again. This was the perfect stay for us. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Pictures are accurate. Bed is incredibly comfortable. Jim was very responsive
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Halford House was like stepping back in time for a visit to Grandmother’s house, except it has the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect.
Our stop was a quick overnight on the way to Texas, and we try to stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim was very accommodating for me! The home is unique and beautiful!!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our overnight in Meridian! Historic house was gorgeous, super clean, and easy to find. Jim sent us very clear instructions which made check in a breeze. Neighbor Misty was very helpful and informative about goings-on. Downtown was walk-able and the area felt very safe and friendly. Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Halford house was not in best part of town.
The porch was high with no hand railings.
Tub/shower was a pretty old fashioned style but a high side step over with no grab bar and small with the surround shower curtains touching your body when showering."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this house!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house, comfortable bed. It’s an older home with charm."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stay was great. Facilities were great and directions were spot on. Just so others know, the tub is high and deep so need to be careful getting in and out. Homey. Sandy and Pippa"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very easy to find and convenient to the interstate. The bed was amazingly comfortable! Great value for the price!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating and helped us with any questions we had. Interesting old building and neat old furniture! Felt like stepping back in time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a large house with 4 separate living areas and entrances. This little efficiency apartment has all the comforts for a overnight stay. Comfy bed with nice linens are located in separate area from living area. The living area has tv, desk and daybed for an extra guest. Bathroom has nice clean towels, soaps and hair dryer. Kitchenette has coffee service and small frig and microwave. The neighborhood is older. The neighbor across street greeted us and made us feel at ease. This is 3 min drive to downtown shops. Treat yourself to a delicious meal at Weidmans (the oldest restaurant in Mississippi) it is a few blocks . The food was fabulous!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house, easy check-in instructions, great stay!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great experience staying in such an old home. Spacious rooms, included everything needed. Comfortable beds. Located right next to a road, so one can hear passing vehicles (maybe for light sleepers only). Overall good experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was amazing! Definitely one of a kind and very unique in its antiquity with so much Meridian history. Never stayed in anything that nice and peaceful before. And for that price you can’t beat it!! Mr. Jim was very responsive and Mrs. Missy is a true sweetheart who made the stay even more comfortable. I would Recommend it to anybody!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay very much. I will always treasure the opportunity to stay in this stately gem!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We fell in love with this house! It’s so neat and has so much charm. Yes, it’s dated but it’s expected (built in the 1800’s) The bed was comfortable. Water pressure was great. Everything we needed to have an enjoyable overnight stay. Missy was very friendly and gave us ideas of where to eat. We left our granddaughters glasses and they were prompt to get our address to return them! Will stay again!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely home, the neighbors are very nice and helpful."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay at the Halford house was very peaceful. Great for the price and Jim’s communication was great as well.
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was easy to find and very close to downtown where we needed to be. We had trouble with the lock, but a call to Jim helped get that resolved. The space was very nice in our suite, large and accommodating and well furnished including kitchen. The house is older, very large and needs some maintenance. We were the only ones there that night so being in a very large older home felt a little disconcerting. Everything operated fine so that was good but bedsheets were not fresh. Neighborhood on the whole was a bit rundown but proximity to downtown was excellent. A very nice next door neighbor helped us find the key and get us in. Thank you Jim for your help by phone and providing convenient place to stay. The home has old timey charm and no doubt lots of history!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The property was easy to find. The house was lovely and very cozy. I would recommend this to anyone. It was a very pleasant, stress free experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spent a lovely and restful evening at Jim's place in Meridian, within a stone's throw of all sorts of restaurants, cafes, museums, etc. Beyond this beautiful airbnb, everyone we encountered in Meridian was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to get back and log some more exploring. Especially appreciated the historical architecture and literature on the area which was helpfully left in the Airbnb. Spacious, clean, elegant, affordable. The very best of Airbnb."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great house with a lot of charm. Love the big south facing windows they let a lot of light in.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an intriguing property with plenty of character, and it added a fun top note to our overnight stay in Meridian for a show at the MSU Riley Center. It's very convenient to downtown Meridian, which is such a bonus with all the great events and activities the city has to offer. It suited us perfectly. Anyone with mobility issues may take note that there is a high step into the tub for bathing or a shower, but the water pressure's fantastic! We so enjoyed the experience, and this spot is a great contender for future trips to the city."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with helpful neighbors. A lot of museums and restaurants nearby. Jim’s place is an old home with a lot of character. Highly recommend when you’re traveling through Meridian, MS."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was lovely to be treated with a Victorian gem right off the interstate. The rooms were very large with plenty of sitting room and very comfortable bed. The bathroom sink could be updated with a new faucet to match the pedestal sink. Loads of restaurants nearby and gated entrance for secure parking. The friendly outside stray cats reminded me of mine at home. Thanks
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My sister and I stayed here on our way to Virginia. Upon check-in, we were impressed with the privacy, and beauty of the old home. The bed was amazing and it was nice and warm in the house! The kitchenette was very helpful. We met the neighbor because we locked ourselves out, lol. She helped us with her spare key. Just FYI, the door locks behind you so make sure you always have the key on you. Thank you Jim for a lovely experience."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s place was a prefect spot to stay on our trip from SW Virginia to central Louisiana. It was neat to stay in an older home that was well suited as an Airbnb. It was clean and I enjoyed reading through the pictorial history books of the area. Jim was responsive in his communication with us.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and spacious. Very nice stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what we needed on the way back home and surprisingly good water pressure for an older house!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim is super responsive and had great local recommendations! Nice, private suite. Would be great for a weekend getaway!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean, comfortable home with much character and charm. The expected signs of age here and there are part of the 19th century house's character; and none of them were service-affecting. Our host, Jim, described Halford House accurately and was responsive and personable with regard to our questions. While I was somewhat apprehensive pulling into the neighborhood at night, it turned out to be a very quiet locale. In addition, my son and I had the privilege of meeting several nice townsfolk the morning of our departure: A neighborly neighbor strolling by the house who was something of a local historian; a local business owner a few blocks away who replaced one of my car's window regulators in record time, a kindly elderly customer who stopped by the shop; and one of the friendliest drive-through attendants at a nearby McDonald's. We would have missed all that had we had not stayed where we did. I highly recommend Jim and Halford House."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time we stayed at Jim’s! This says it all! Comfortable surroundings—felt like home! Awesome value!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stay here everytime we come to Meridian, if available. LOVE this place."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim's communication was very responsive. The space is wonderful, especially if you appreciate historical homes. Very comfortable and roomy."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best value in Meridian!! The old house has great charm, and normal wear for a home over 100 years old. The high ceilings, original flooring, fireplace mantles, outside architectural features are amazing if you like historical homes. The neighbor Missy looks after things and met us in the yard when we pulled in. The ""suite"" is phenomenal: kitchen well stocked to cook easy light meals in, the bathroom shower has wonderful pressure (although the antique tub is tall to step in & out of), and the four poster bed slept wonderfully!!! There is only this house, another large house, and a funeral home on the whole block. It is a very quiet neighborhood, although not the most aesthetically pleasing area. My in-laws live outside the city and we WILL stay here as often as possible!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and clean. Quiet area and centrally located.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s bnb was comfortable and spacious.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It’s a cozy room in an older house. It has great charm. It could use a little maintenance though. Overall pretty happy with this stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim’s home is beautiful, easy to get to and exactly as it is presented on here. It’s a great place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely home that will remind you of visiting your grandparents. Check in was easy. Lots of room to unwind and relax after a long day of driving. The home was clean. Coffee and hot chocolate provided was a nice touch we enjoyed. Pictures are accurate of the home. It is located minutes off the interstate and a few minutes to local restaurants. We did not experience any noise from the road while we slept. The bed was super soft and comfortable. We ate at Weidmann’s (oldest restaurant in MS) you will not be disappointed. The crab cakes, cheesecake and custard will not disappoint. We only stayed one night because we were passing through on our way to our destination. We will stay again if we get the opportunity."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy & perfect! We enjoyed our stay just as much as the first time!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful historic home within walking distant of downtown. My husband and I had a lovely stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have to say this was one of best ""home away from home"" overnight stays I've experienced. Very comfortable and cozy. Spacious and accommodating When visiting Meridian, I will always make this my go-to for my comfortable stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The beds were comfortable and the house was very clean. We loved the town of Meridian.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was so much fun. I would highly recommend this little suite for a small family or a single person needing a few nights. The kitchen even had a little hot plate to make a good breakfast before our long trip began and had decent coffee available too.
If you happen to enjoy trips into the past like I do, this is definitely the place."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful old home. Well appointed and quite comfortable. Would stay again
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay in this historic, spacious home! Oh, to have lived here in it's prime!! Wonderful stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Air B&B was exactly as presented. We loved everything about this little place! Such a homey feeling. We stayed Thursday night-Sunday morning and wish we could have stayed longer—a little bittersweet leaving. We will definitely be back. Thank you!
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Jim was very communicative and allowed us to park our moving truck at the back of the property within the gated fence, which helped with peace of mind with stopping while moving our entire house. The Airbnb was an interesting old property, though very dated and loud. It was a little difficult getting to sleep with all of the sounds. This place has a lot of potential if someone were to take some time to spruce it up!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful old house with many interesting architectural features. The accommodations were comfortable, relaxing & clean. Needs maintenance."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for me and my partner. Jim was good at communicating and giving directions. The house is in a great area and not too far of a drive from restaurants and shops. Would stay here again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for an overnight stay. Like staying at someone's granny's house.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,was a great spot for what I was looking for
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in a historic house. Comfortable, with room to spare."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful historic home and my family and I enjoyed our stay. I agree with some of the other reviewers, I know it is an old house, but it does need some minor maintenance work. Also, the area does seem a bit sketchy, however, we had no issues. enjoyed a quiet night as we passed through on our way to our final destination."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for the opportunity to stay in your family home. What a pleasure it was to stay in such an exquisite older home and experience some history. I hope to be able to come back to use your extended-stay area during my travel nursing adventures. I met Melissa before I left. She was very kind and Informative. All around great experience for me.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fast response. Appreciate the hospitality
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Very comfortable bed, we will be staying again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value. Beautiful room.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall a great stay! The town is very friendly and beautiful!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, clean stay"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location and check-in procedure. We were less sure about how to check out, but figured several options were available. The home is absolutely charming and the suite gives a lot of space for a couple or even a small family. I loved that a variety of hot beverages were available, not just coffee. As with all historic homes, the beauty trumps any maintenance issues. The neighborhood is peaceful though there are train and other noises. We would definitely stay here again and recommend both the home and the host to others."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a super short stay here but the house itself was gorgeous, the location felt safe and was also near to anything we could need. I would 100% stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I reserved this for my 19yo son. Check in directions were easy. The accommodations were clean. He enjoyed the historic aspect of the rooms. My son felt he could easily get to where he needed to be.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was like walking into the past! The four poster bed had an awesome pillow-top mattress which gave me a great nights sleep. The huge French doors were beautiful. The Tiny kitchen was well stocked and with a K-cup coffee maker! The house is convenient to downtown. Jim was clear and timely with check-in instructions.
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a WONDERFUL Historical house! It does need some fine tuned attention. The location is not ideal. The unit was clean, however, this is a shared space in this house. The locks need updating. Insure you follow the owners instructions regarding the address, not correct if you use the Airbnb link for directions.
The interior needs some attention, window shades are faulty. If you have mobility issues please consider a different option. It has WONDERFUL potential, just not up to what was advertised."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great historic place. Love the high ceilings and the kitchenette met our needs perfectly. The yard was wonderful for our kiddo to run around in.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,An easy pass through location with plenty of space!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, daughter and I had a perfect stay at the house. Economically priced, clean and comfortable. Close to everything downtown Meridian has to offer."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Jim had a very very nice Neighbour saved us! I had a very very bad check in experience by inaccurate information. Almost felt abandoned on the street! Jim’s neighbors are angles they found us and helped us contact someone to get in the right location and entering the house successfully! Thanks God! I believe because of Jim should be a very very nice person and has a good relationship with his neighbors , they all help each other! Thanks God we finally had a such deep sleep and rest so well at this cozy home! The House is amazing to stay! Very Elegance!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My second stay at Jim’s place was just as great as my first, which was about six months ago. If you’re looking for a comfortable stay with historic charm somewhere within walking distance to downtown, you will not find a better overall value than Jim’s place. I look forward to my next visit!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home and the suite were very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The neighbor, Missy is a sweetheart!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the house! Fabulous sitting area with small kitchen. Great location and bed is super cozy!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in/out, comfortable and clean stay, and friendly hosts!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was a great host and super easy to communicate with. This house is 3 minutes from downtown Meridian, making it really convenient to get to the restaurants and shops downtown. There is lots of space, a claw foot tub, a small kitchenette, tall ceilings, and a great little daybed in a living room area. We were in town for a wedding and this place was a great alternative to a hotel. Parking was easy too and the directions made getting there and getting checked in a breeze! I might recommend bringing a sound machine because it is an old house and you can hear the dogs barking or whatever is going on outside, but that definitely wouldn’t stop us from staying at this place again."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you love old architecture, you'll love Jims' place. My friends and I enjoyed our stay and found all to be as described."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at this home. It felt like experiencing a piece of history. It was exactly what we wanted to get out of staying in an old home. Everything was clean and functional.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a good nights stay! The bed is super comfortable. Would definitely suggest sleeping with a fan if you’re not used to a lot of city traffic. House could use some updating, but overall great for the price!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Room was great for the value. The surrounding area was less than desirable.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Place was pretty much as advertised and we enjoyed our one night stay. We found it to be like a step back in time and very cozy and comfortable! The bathroom could use some updating but considering the age of the house not surprising and didn’t negatively impact our stay.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place is amazing. Although it's technically a ""private room"" listing, you essentially have a wing of the house to yourself. The space is clean, comfy, and beautiful. The historical details in the house are exquisite. I would love to stay again if need arises."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: Jim gives very accurate directions and instructions for accessing his suite. The bed is comfortable and kitchenette met our needs for an overnight stay. We were happy to have a private home versus hotel accommodations, and slept peacefully. Jim was quick to resolve our concern about the neighbors dog. Cons: You will hear traffic at night. This may be normal if you live in an urban environment."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay here! The bed is super comfy!! We sat in the two wingback chairs in the sitting area and played cards for several hours while listening to the old school R&B on 104.1! Such a perfectly relaxing night. We would surely stay here again! The suite is beautiful for anyone who appreciates older, historic homes. Oh, and Missy (next door) is great! 😊"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful old home. It is very clean and comfortable. The house is easy to get to and all instructions were easy to follow. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked. The neighborhood the house is located in was a little sketchy, but we felt very safe at the property. As a note to others - there is a BEAUTIFUL old ""clawfoot type"" tub in the bathroom. These tubs can be quite dicey to get into and out of under any circumstance - just beware.
We enjoyed our overnight stay and would readily stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My son, his wife, and I all loved this historic home. The soaring ceilings and workmanship reminded us of our family home, also belonging to his grandparents, where my son was small.
It had all the conveniences of home. We even sat in the rocking chairs out on the front porch!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but really enjoyed this impressive historic home! The 13 foot ceilings, incredible woodwork, and original light fixtures were really cool.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,…
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, and super clean."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Jim’s house is unique and gorgeous! When I had internet issues, he was responsive and corrected it quickly. I do wish he had a washer and dryer located in an area that both rentals could use."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s place was great.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As a guest, you will enjoy clean accommodations here at the Halford. The history and location of the house is an added plus. If ever in the area, I would highly recommend staying here. Jim was extremely quick to respond when needed."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great old house with many interesting details, comfortable bed (but it's very high), many amenities provided (books, maps, etc.) to tell about the area, bathroom/kitchen areas very clean and functional."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Huge room, very clean, and easy check in. The location is subpar but maybe that can't be helped, also no internet that we saw. The ghost was fun to talk to..."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The Halford House is great place to stay. Jim is a great host. He communicates with you in a timely manner. He provides you with all the information you need to check in and out to make your stay perfect. The beds are comfortable and my stay was awesome. The kitchenette is great and equipped with everything you need. The bathroom can use a little TLC but overall plenty of space and good hot water to shower with. I recommend the Halford House to all if your looking for a safe and private place to stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent suite. Super communication. it was spooky during the pouring rain when we checked in, but is very homey and reminded us of old European hotels we stayed at in Amsterdam. A few fit and finish imperfections which just add to the charm. We would stay again as it is an excellent value and was a good experience. My wife who loves old victorian's enjoyed it."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Stay! Host responded to questions quickly and rooms were clean and stunning. Warning: if you have a low car, you will absolutely scrape the bottom of your car getting in and out of the drive way (not just a little either). Dont let the neighborhood deter you!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. The house itself has a great historical feel. It could use some TLC (paint, rough spots on floors, etc.) and the noise from the cross street in the morning is a bit louder than expected, but it’s a good value and comfortably sleeps three."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best value for money you can get in terms of accommodation. This historic home has a charm not many places offer. Very spacious and peaceful suite with a very comfortable bed and bedding. Ample, easy and safe parking. All the amenities you can wish for. An absolute gem.
Jim answered our questions promptly and gave very detailed information on check in procedure etc."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anyone who hasn’t stayed here should be in for a surprise! It’s gorgeous yet comfy and convenient. So much for a great price!!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a very interesting stay. It was really cool to stay in such a historic home. The house needs some work here and there but it was still really cool! The location was also convenient to downtown. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable bed, spacious accommodations, convenient to downtown. The place could use a bit of TLC to make it great, though."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place downtown Meridian. Would stay again.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Jim’s home is stunning & his communication was good. His neighbor was right on site & greeted us warmly. It is an historic house with historic features & guests should be ready for that. We found the neighborhood a little sketchy, but our stay was fine. If you’re into accurate historic homes, you’ll really like this one."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a quaint place with class. So clean, easy in and out for anyone! A+ a comfy bed!"
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,Jim was very nice and quick to respond and help with issues.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim's place was exactly what we needed for our stay in Meridian. The house is a beautiful old home. The bed was comfortable and the space had everything we needed. The kitchenette was useful for coffee and reheating leftovers. The location felt safe and was close to downtown. I highly recommend this place for anyone traveling to Meridian!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful airbnb and super quick responses. We were only here for 1 night, but easily could have stayed a few days. The home is well kept and older, it was like stepping back in time. Very clean, and the bed was cozy. We slept very well. Highly recommend :)"
2021-01-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Don't go by photos , it's an old house and many things are rusty. but house Location is really good , neighborhood is good and smooth checkin and check out."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool old house to stay in.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim's historic lodgings reminded me so much of childhood visits to my great-grandmother's home :) The bathroom fixtures, the building materials, even the creaks and smell were similar! I loved the shower in the cast iron tub and i was pleasantly surprised by the volume of hot water available. There were plenty of fluffy soft towels available.
The tiny kitchenette is tucked into a corner and fully stocked with a Keurig, a variety of coffee and tea, plenty of dishes and utensils, a large dormitory fridge and a small microwave. The perfectly sized television it fits neatly in the builtin wooden bookcase and there are many cable channels available for those who choose to watch it. Only these barest of modern necessities have been provided without sacraficing the overall feel for the sake of modern conveniences.
The elegant 4-poster bed dominates the bedroom. I slept well and really enjoyed the extra touch of real feather-down pillows! The extra fleece blanket on the daybed came in handy also. Houses that are over a hundred years old tend to be a bit drafty and damp, and this one is no exception. I expected this and brought my own extra throw blanket.
This stay is definitely an experience; a walk back in time. If you enjoy the ambience of historic homes, if you find old European hotels quaint and charming, you will love your visit to Jim's place. If you prefer all the comforts and feel of a nice, new hotel, this is not the stay you are looking for."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Halford House was a perfect stop over point for us and located very convenient to the interstate. Jim's communication was superb and he had many thoughtful touches in the suite. If you love history and historic homes, this is the place for you! Highly recommend!!!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful home!!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful old home was like stepping back in time. Well restored. Large comfortable spaces. Luxuriously comfortable bed. The huge beveled glass doors are gorgeous. Lovely ambiance in the evening by lamplight. Just enough extra amenities in kitchen and bath for convenience. Enjoyed the books of old historic photos. Coffee in the rockers on the great front porch in the morning. So nostalgic (and romantic!) Been driving past Meridian for many years during travels but will never do it again without stopping here!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely 1800’s historic home! Bed rates 5***** for comfort. Great night’s sleep!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stay. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, great A/C (important in Mississippi), and too many architectural highlights to list. Jim is a good host. There's a Keurig coffee machine in the kitchen, and a small fridge. The bed is a four poster, and very, very comfortable. Coffee on the front porch sitting in rocking chairs is a plus. This is a nice, quiet neighborhood, and a great place to stay. I'd place this house in the top three of all AirBnBs where we've stayed, based on the home, the history, and the convenience to downtown."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was lovely, the home had a feel of gravitas that you just don’t find that often anymore."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sugar Magnolia. The house is beautiful, and we have plenty of room for two families. There is a basement area with a pullout couch, TV, and even room to put a blowup mattress on the floor. That was our teenagers hang out. There’s also a washer and dryer downstairs. On the middle level…you have your dining area with a big table which is surrounded by windows and a really cool place to hang out You also have your kitchen with a breakfast nook, two bedrooms with queen beds, a bathroom, and living room. Off the living room you have the front porch with patio furniture, which is where we drink our coffee in the morning and wine at night. The very top floor you have the master suite with a king bed and full bathroom and a huge closet. The location is great. You’re close to the north Hills area but also close to downtown. The neighborhood is nice and quiet."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a wonderful and relaxing time staying at Boocoodles. Fleeta was a terrific host and we would love to stay at Boocoodles again.
We felt right at home in the house. All of us (the 80-somethings, the 50-somethings, the 20-something) loved sitting on the covered porch outside the living room, watching the cows or reading a book, and taking in the sun or showers, and later the moonlight and stars.
We also enjoyed walking around on the farm, with Fleeta and Larry and also on our own.
A warm-from-the-oven cream cheese pound cake greeted us at arrival, and the kitchen was stocked with snacks and essentials. One day Fleeta and Larry brought over a delicious breakfast of Denver omelette and bacon. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well-stocked with fresh towels and bath products. Fleeta has thought of everything.
We had a wonderful time. Thank you, Fleeta!"

We stayed in the summertime and it was so relaxing in the morning with a cup of coffee and Fleeta's breakfast watching the humming birds and cows in the pasture. Their property is just stunning and we all felt right at home inside. If we get a chance to go back in the fall...we would love the chance to enjoy the rest of amenities, i.e. the fireplace(s)."

I’m truly amazed and more than satisfied. The sweetest most outgoing couple ever greeted us with the most warming welcome. (The owners) I can’t stress how comfortable the inside was and how amazed I am. They truly care and give it their all when it comes to satisfaction of the ones who are staying and go above and beyond . 10/10 recommend!

Can’t wait to return in warmer weather and explore more of this beautiful property!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best host I've ever dealt with. 👍 I highly recommend Fleeta! She and her husband are both very kind and really make sure your stay is nothing less than perfect.

We took a last minute trip to Mississippi to see our son get married (after it had been postponed due to the Coronavirus) and this house worked out perfectly. Since my son and his fiancé are both in the Navy they could not go to restaurants, etc. This home gave us a really nice place to spend time together and celebrate their wedding! It is a beautiful home in a wooded area. We loved taking walks and we enjoyed the breakfasts and the apple pie Fleeta made for us! Thank you to Fleeta and Larry for all of your hospitality. You helped to make our first visit to Mississippi a very memorable one!"

This home is on a lovely piece of property not too far out of Meridian and close enough to everything in the area. This working farm has beautiful woods, hummingbird and bluebirds as well as cows to greet you in the morning and great outdoor spaces to enjoy a little taste of country living.
Inside is a cozy and very clean home with comfy beds, a fireplace and a fun old fashioned kitchen with modern appliances. It’s quiet at night and our stay was refreshing and relaxing. As there is no television or internet currently, it is a real opportunity to disconnect and enjoy each other’s company. We will be back!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was good and clean and would recommend it. Love that there was snacks and beverages for the guests. We were there for a wedding and 3 ladies trying to do hair and makeup was difficult. The only thing I had an issue with was there was no outlet in the bathroom. Hard to curl or blow your hair. We had to use a small mirror to do our hair in the dining table which the lightbulb in the dining area was out and hard to see.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,He was very helpful. Place was wonderful.

The area is great and we visit often. This is by far the best place we’ve stayed in many years. Area is beautiful, in addition to being easy to locate. There are many restaurants and stores nearby for shopping. There are many things to see and visit nearby as well. Nice areas to drive and see the old architecture, and businesses. Variety of shopping! Great culture in Meridian. Lots of history. Bradley is most definitely a Super Host ! Most definitely will visit again soon!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and felt very safe (2 ladies) Close to everything we wanted to do and restaurants nearby. Actually met Brad and he was very nice and helpful and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. Apt is across from a hospital/medical center so there was a bit of activity with deliveries and things (noise) so be aware of that if in the balcony side bedroom but nothing that a sound machine couldn't fix. If back in Meridian we would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Brad."

It was well stocked with any snack or drink you wanted even a good selection of wine to choose from. The decor and detailed touches made it feel like home for the time there. The locatio.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bradley is the most generous host. He stocked the refrigerator and pantry full of goodies before we arrived which I’ve never had at an Airbnb before. We didn’t have to purchase anything unless we ordered takeout. The apartment is extremely cozy and clean with a fully stocked kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms. So beautifully decorated as well. The location was very convenient for me because I was working at the hospital right up the hill. It was quiet and safe. I did not have to worry about our safety at all. Bradley was very accommodating. He really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. I appreciated his kindness very much. I will definitely be staying here again if it’s available. I highly recommend staying here."

Bradley greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour of the unit. There were snacks, treats and a full kitchen of everything you need, just like home. He even provided coins for the laundry room downstairs. The area is so quiet and literally minutes from downtown Meridian with shops, eateries and entertainment. It was a short distance from restaurants, shopping and go ol' WalMart. This was the perfect location for a short term or long term stay. It was surely a pleasant visit with the most hospitable host. He should become a SUPER HOST real soon. It was a super visit overall."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I chose Sweet Olive Cabin for the weekend to celebrate my daughter’s tenth birthday. She loves Gatlinburg and BigFoot. We fell in love with the cabin because it was just like being in the Smokey’s! The cabin has so much character and perfectly decorated. The extra details and use of repurposed materials make the cabin something special! The cabin is also well stocked! I can’t think of a single thing that was not available for use!
My kids loved the spacious back porch to play games but the absolute favorite was the walking trails in the woods behind the cabin! If you love nature and the great outdoors this place is one you must try out!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Lenices little cabin in the woods. Private, secure and great place to sleep well with our kiddos. We were looking for a place that we didn’t have to unpack the entire truck, it be safe and get a good nights rest after being on the road for 12 hours. We live in the country and sleep much better in that type of environment and lenices cabin gave us this exact peace of mind.
We loved that we were able to park on the back behind the house. The house was unique, rustic and beautifully restored. I loved the uniqueness of the antique lighting, the antique doors and beautiful long leaf pine floors. This accommodation was clean, well kept and fully furnished with what we needed and had great and comfortable beds and pillows.
Highly recommend this little hidden gim. Well worth the drive out town to get a great night sleep."

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Five lady friends “of a certain age” gathered together on an extremely cold 3-day (4-night) getaway in January in this vintage cabin to play cards/games, eat, drink, and laugh. Our hostess Lenice was very easy to communicate with. She came to check on us the final day and we had a great visit with her, too.
We had most everything we needed . . . lots of towels, facecloths, kitchen hand towels, extra bed linens, etc. The kitchen is fully outfitted with all sorts of pots, pans, glassware, dishes and bowls, etc. There is also a 12-cup Mr.-Coffee-type coffee maker and paper filters.
This cute country house is on a quiet rural road across from the cow pasture and fishing ponds. It was waaaay too cold this weekend to sit on the front porch, but in warmer weather, it would be wonderful to enjoy morning coffee in the rocking chairs. The house is just as pictured in the photos."

I was there fishing a Bassmaster Open and it was just about the perfect distance from Ross Barnett Reservoir. There are plenty of things to drive to for supplies, but other than the fishing, we made one trip to the store and stayed at the cabin because of the comfortable setting. They have put a lot of time into the place and my wife and I will definitely be back to stay in the future. Mrs. Lenice answered every question i had immediately. When you are away from home and do not know anything about the area that is priceless. Her and her husband came and checked on us during our stay and they were just like us. Down home country living folks who just enjoy life. I highly recommend staying with them."

Even though it was dark and stormy outside, the cabin was easy to find and check-in was simple. This cabin is LOVELY. The kitchen is nicer than my kitchen at home! I can't imagine a better place to stop for the night--a comfy couch with recliners on each end, a huge kitchen to cook up a quick dinner, a large shower, comfy beds, wifi and Direct TV. We will definitely return."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here twice now and each time gets more cozy! It’s a perfect stop while on the road, but really seems like a great place to get away for a few days. I think a third trip that is much longer is in order."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is more quaint than I can describe. Everything you may need is already there waiting on you. The front porch swing is like a safe haven. The quiet, stars, peace... everything is simply perfect. Ms. Lenice is wonderful and truly makes you feel welcome."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy little cabin with a great view. It was everything we expected.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was such a sweet little getaway and exactly what our family Wanted. The view of cows in the morning, sweet pups coming to greet us and a relaxing time to unwind, we couldn’t have asked for anything better."

The kids played soccer, gathered nature things, went on trails, played on the hammock, went to see the cows across the street, made smores, etc. the place is very nice and surroundings are relaxing! The kids absolutely loved Major…the dog across the street. He came and played with them and they didn’t want to leave him. It was a wonderful trip!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful and peaceful stay. Lenice was very kind and responsive. Can’t wait to book her place again!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our 2nd stay in this lovely cabin and it's always a blessing. It has everything you need except groceries, so stop before you arrive. The property is beautiful, quiet, and safe. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful, but leaves the amount of interaction up to you. Always readily available if needed. We look forward to seeing you again. Thank you for your help during the anticipated bad weather."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! We rented it so our daughter had somewhere for her and her bridesmaids to get ready for her wedding. We will definitely see if it is available next time we come to town to see her. It is a beautiful home! The owner was very reapsove when I asked questions. I highly recommend their place!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lenice's place is just what you need if you want to unwind. It is so peaceful. It is not near anything so bring food to cook. This is a place to just chill with beautiful surroundings for sure.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time again. Our kids enjoy the space of this cozy out of the way spot. All you need for a short or long term stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sweet Olive Cabin had everything we needed and more for a quick, small family getaway for the five of us in the country. The kitchen is open and spacious to cook in for this size of a cabin and the decor is unique in that it is modern industrial blended with rustic wood cabin. Lots of neat design touches and very cozy and comfy spaces. The shower and bathroom sink are functional and fun. Every part of the cabin was organized and sparkling clean. The outdoor spaces are open and relaxing. We enjoyed hanging out on the back porch and listening to the waterfall. My family also loved the hammock near the patio for relaxing. This cabin is really amazing and a great value—I highly recommend it and hope to come back soon!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just stopped in overnight, but we would have really enjoyed spending more time in this charming home!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was warm and inviting and beautifully peaceful.
The space is utterly charming, to say the least. We were pleasantly surprised by different kinds of butterflies, the cows across the street, falling leaves and beautiful bird songs.
If you're on the fence, go for it.
We only wish we could have stayed longer."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to disconnect from city life. The kids loved the rustic style: the faucet decorated like the olden-days pump (but runs water like any normal faucet), and the watering can-designed shower head. The only difficulty was getting decent hot water ... although the owners explained how to get hot water, it was a bit tricky to set up after a long day of traveling. Most of us just skipped the luke-warm water and passed out. The beds were comfy enough and the hosts provided plenty of blankets."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for relaxing

It is easy to find, meticulously clean, beautifully decorated, well equipped and so relaxing - (you arrive to a fountain running on the back porch). Her instructions are clear and I felt right at home from the moment I stepped in. If you want a sure thing when you book, book here!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the sweetest little place to stay in all of Morton, MS. A darling little house made of repurposed materials that is so much fun. Also handicap friendly and sleeps 5 easily. Always clean and repairs are made in a very timely matter. Been coming here about 4 years and it’s my favorite AirB&B!"

There were actual plates, saucers and coffee cups with a coffee pot provided with coffee. Also available were plasticware and a fan. We love using a fan to help us sleep, even though we brought our own box fan, an additional fan was great to have. It was so Clean, cute, smelled nice and felt so homey out in the country.

2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Listed in the amenities were blender, refrigerator, mini fridge (listed separately) and microwave. Okay, so there isn’t explicitly a kitchen listed however where would a guest be expected to run a blender with no kitchen? (Blender was NOT there) if you’re just needing a hotel like stay with bad internet service then yes this is the place for you! I have dietary issues and so have to cook a great deal of my meals and was not happy about one VERY important picture “conveniently” being left out… and that was the one listed below. There is no kitchen and you better take every single thing you need. There was no iron as listed, the host did provide one after request. There was not even a plastic spoon to stir the coffee however there as great coffee creamers! The internet was horrendous, I couldn’t do any work and a bed pillow case was soiled. It was gated, it was a comfortable and clean (except pictured) and it does have hot water. It is extremely small. One room with a bathroom but cute."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed in Meridian overnight while visiting the MIL. It was perfect for us and had everything we needed for a quick stay. The home was clean and comfortable.

There was many options, but sitting out there at night on the porch, drinking a couple of beers, listening to the wildlife was just amazing and it was nice and secure because they have a Private entrance with a gate which is great and it was just a really nice peaceful place if I am ever through that area again which I will be I am definitely going to stay"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little getaway, as a full time RV’er like to get a break and just relax without all the setup.

Delicious food, great stay, our dogs loved the view of the chickens. The chickens were well secured which was great and I loved seeing them.

It was a very nice stay and you can’t beat the price! Perfect for our weekend getaway. 😊"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny house was exactly as described in the listing. Jairo was easy to communicate with, and the directions were spot-on. It was a little too expensive for what you got -- with only a microwave, mini-fridge, and coffee maker, it was functionally little more than a motel room. But the setting was much nicer!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable tiny home inside the large gated yard of the host home. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was great! We visited for 5 nights for local work and the hosts respected our space and made sure we had what we needed! Wifi wasn't strong enough to work on our laptop from home, but worked well enough to stream the Roku with no issue. Verizon didn't seem to have good service in this area. We would definitely stay here again if working in the area!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was amazing…..bc the people are phenomenal. We had a couple of hiccups bc of the extreme cold weather but they were so accommodating and hospitable. I want to go back and visit. Go enjoy your stay and love your time with them.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were just looking for a stopping point on our road trip and this place served well. The room was, essentially, a super-clean and quiet bed and bath on the host’s property. No TV or wifi, but we were just looking for a bed and bath to rest, so it was a nice place for our trip. The room gave convenient privacy and quiet for less than a motel room would have cost."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Evelyn’s place was great and we very much loved her hospitality and that of her furry co hosts.

Evelyn's home also stands out because of the fitness room available to work out the tension of a long day's drive. She was there to meet us when we arrived and chatted while I ate dinner. The bathroom also directly adjoins the bedroom, so it's easier to find in the middle of the night than in many homes. I'd encourage folks to stay there."

I was there for a travel nurse contract so I was there for about 2.5 months. The house is a split plan so you basically had a side to yourself. The room was large and had a bathroom attached. The bed was comfortable and she even had blackout shades on the windows.
You must love animals to stay here. She has 3 dogs that are well behaved and will welcome you home. Luna even escorts you to your room :). I never had an issue with them barking. The only time they bark is when you come home.
I will stay here again if I ever do another nursing contract in Meridian!"

It’s a quiet neighborhood. The accommodations are clean, and amenities include coffee (Kuerig), microwave, and a mini-refrigerator in the room. Evelyn and the pets will interact with you as much or as little as you wish. I stayed with her both coming and going to Dallas to pick up a dog, and she made my stay so pleasant both ways. My dog got to meet hers, and they were just wonderful. I think it really helped take the edge off of Captain ( my dog) once they met in the back yard."

The bed was super comfy and we had a great sleep after a very long day of driving. Great energy. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot brag on this beautiful cottage enough. Kris was so very generous as well. The cottage was so nice, very big and spacious and very very comfortable. I give my stay a 10++++. I very much recommend staying with Kris and her family. I was completely satisfied!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The owner of this quaint cottage is amazing! Very kind and extremely helpful. I was their first guest and caught them off guard. They’ve just moved In Meridian themselves and had listed their guest cottage the day I requested a reservation. It wasn’t totally ready, but they couldn’t have been kinder and more accommodating. If I was in the area I would definitely book it again. Chris will definitely be listed as a Super host in the future.
Beat wishes to you Chris!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at John’s place.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"First of all, the hosts here are above and beyond kind and helpful. When previous guests trashed this property and refused to leave on time, they quickly punted and offered us The Lodge instead. In terms of the lodge, it is at the end of the road near a beautiful small lake. The air conditioning worked quickly, and the place was cool by the time we went to sleep. Full disclosure, the lodge is not really designed as a family home. There are no TVs, no real sitting areas to speak of, no window coverings in the bedrooms. The two bedrooms operate on the same light switch. The bathrooms and showers are community stall style. The kitchen is very nice and easy to use. People can keep sleeping while you cook because it’s kind of insulated. Good storage room, too! It probably says all of this in the lodge description, but I just wanted to be thorough. It’s a great stop as part of a church camp activity. Beautiful surroundings!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful space and peaceful - perfect for a retreat! Will be going back for sure.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The bed was VERY comfortable and the portable heaters worked great! If you have a pet, taking walks around area to tire out your dog is great. Beautiful woods all around."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"John was a great host! He was very responsive and sent instructions on how to get to the place. It was quiet, peaceful, and a great place for us. We had animals and were just taking a quick rest from the road. The only things I would improve upon are the beds. The mattresses were on the older side and not all of them had mattress covers. Either way, it was the perfect place to stop over in MS!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great respite on my travel route.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Was a good place. Plenty of room.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John was beyond accommodating for our stay and we are immensely grateful! The Shack was perfect for our weekend away with our dogs and is exactly as described. It was a little challenging to find in the dark when we arrived as it is one of several spaced out buildings at an old camp, but it was easy to get back into town to go out to eat. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet cabin surrounded by woods. Pond access is a short walk down the road. Lots of things to explore and everyone was friendly. Suited our needs for a large dog and 2 kids.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place and felt right at home. The host was very nice and super helpful. We will definitely come back if we are in the area again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Shack was a great place to overnight with my small family. It was simple, clean, safe, and exactly what we expected being used to staying in cabins at retreat locations. Not much cell phone service, but that was a plus! The internet was super fast and John was quick to respond to any questions. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shack was perfect for our needs especially because it can be hard traveling with a dog. With town 10 minutes away, it was convenient, as well as private. The lake was a definite plus. We took a kayak out one morning and enjoyed the splendor of the place from the center. The living room furniture was very comfortable even though it was old. This is the place to come when you need to unplug. I’d come back in a heartbeat."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at ""The Shack"" was all we expected. Its a small home nestled in an array of different trees. If youre expecting a 5 star resort this might not work for you but if peace,privacy,and a quiet getaway is what you need......this is the perfect spot. The Lewis Family plans to make it a yearly destination."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and quiet cabin, yet close to town for eating and shopping. We five sisters enjoyed our stay at The Shack!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay if you are looking for a get away right here in Meridian.
This would be a great stay for someone with kids because there are bunk beds in addition to the main master bedroom. Also this stay is pet friendly and our dogs loved it. John is super awesome and helped us out so much. He is very welcoming and will answer messages promptly.
This stay is literally on a private campground and is a great place to stay if you want to be in the forest and do fun camp things.
Wi-Fi was amazing and my husband was able to work from home."

This place is great, if we're ever in this area again, we'll certainly stay in the shack again."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Please don't let the name fool you, the ""Shack"" is by no means a shack! It is a lovely home with everything you need for a comfortable stay!

,,,"Avoid this place if you don't want to be intoxicated by extremely strong glade plug in fumes. We asked them prior to our arrival if they would remove any if they used them, due to them exacerbating our asthma, which they claim they did, but the smell was so intoxicating we had to leave the second we arrived due to it making us sick and hard to breathe due to the strong odor. And for a one room place, it is extremely overpriced. Luckily Airbnb was able to refund us but it was a headache literally having to deal with that coming in late from a long trip."
,,,"First off the host Family was down with a stomach bug and could not clean the cabin and said they hired a new company to clean. Also please note we were refunded 100% and John was very apologetic and nice. BUT with that being said, I absolutely hate to write anything negative but I need to be truthful. Unfortunately the cabin was filthy, extremely dusty, trash in cans, food on kitchen table and chairs, tiny braces rubberbands on the kitchen table, dried pee on the toilet, the shower was almost black it was so dirty, no sheets or lines of any type provided( it does state that in the listing and was my error of overlooking), but mattresses were all ripped and stained..we ended up leaving and getting a Hotel up the street. The land the cabin was on was beautiful and again John was very gracious and refunded our $ 100% . Again I hate to say anything negative ever, but I felt it necessary to be Honest."
