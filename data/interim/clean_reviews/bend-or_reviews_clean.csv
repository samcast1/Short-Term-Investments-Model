2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very pleased with the place and with Somer as a host.
A very nicely decorated studio. There is everything you need and it was very clean. Can only recommend it. We will be happy to come back."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Rodney was a great host. The accommodations were clean and appeared newly built or extensively remodeled. Heating/AC was guest controlled for every room. Kitchen was fully stocked. Close proximity to the park was a huge plus since we were traveling with a toddler. It was easy to get into downtown with just a short drive. The only drawback was the driveway. We had an oversized vehicle that was a bit of a tight squeeze.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, exactly as advertised."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Sound Smith Guesthouse with our two young kids. The space is very clean and has a wonderful layout with lots of light.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The visit was nice. Parking was awkward. No TV unless you stream and bring your own keurig. On a fairly busy street. Nice close walking path.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great place to stay as a family of four in Bend! Rodney's home is away from the main property allowing for plenty of privacy. We did see the owners a few times throughout our stay, and every time, they were pleasant and welcoming and gracious. We would absolutely recommend this place for others who want to visit Bend: it's in a really convenient spot, the kitchen was great for cooking meals, and it was just a fantastic experience!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This one was hard for my family and I. My elderly mother visited myself and granddaughter here in Bend. It happened to have a rare ice and snow weather pattern that occurred a couple of days prior to our arrival. Rodney messaged me some hours earlier in the day to inquire about my vehicle to prepare for the arrival and possible struggles to get up his hill and up stairs to place we would be staying. Unfortunately getting up and down to the unit made this trip and visit very frustrating for us. My mother almost slipped twice (even with trying to hold her hand throughout) while trying to get up a hill that a viable path was not provided for us. My 8 year old granddaughter and I had to manually stomp through ice and snow uphill to get to the guest house. It was quite scary and I am thankful we didn’t fall and hurt ourselves. Rodney was outside and communicative with us and did express sympathies for us, which was appreciated, but we wish he had done to plow a path for us."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely spectacular stay. This stay was exactly what we were looking for during our weekend ski trip. I would definitely rebook for another trip to Bend.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place will forever hold a sweet spot for my family of 4. It was just the right size and provided for all of our needs. Most importantly it was the center point of all the activities and adventures we wanted to have! The hosts were friendly and easy communicate with.
My family stayed here for 5 nights in the heat of summer; glad to have a break from the heat with an ac unit in each room and ice cream in the freezer! The nights were comfortable too and got even more so when my husband found that he preferred the bottom bunk mattress, I was good on the mattress in the other room. Although there are no blackout shades and the space is near a busy road, it was quiet at night and we were able to wake up with the birds and start our days! This place was close to everything we wanted to do while visiting: family, parks (just outside of earshot and out the back yard gate!), local pools, lava tube, river float, rocks, food, & sun!
Would LOVE to stay again, maybe in a different season!"

Directions for check in/out were very clear. I arrived late at night and had no trouble finding and getting into the apartment. They provided a list of suggested things to do and favorite restaurants. It was nice to have access to a washer and dryer as I stayed a little over a week. I also appreciated the kitchen set-up and appliances, cooking several meals there.
The location was a short drive to most of the things we wanted to see and do in Bend. Definitely a place I would stay again!"

We were able to securely store our mountain bikes which was key for us too. Rodney and Shannon were so kind and easy to communicate with.

The kitchen is well appointed and the a/c works great. The bedrooms are quite light in the mornings so bring eye masks if this bugs you. Also the traffic noise is somewhat loud in the mornings so ear plugs if you are sensitive to this. Other than that this is a great place to stay!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was just what we needed for our stay. Andrew had everything we needed to prep meals and feel at home. Out the back door is an undeveloped area that is very convenient for exercising the dogs! Comfortable beds and linens, and a tv in every room. We will recommend to friends and family coming through Bend that want to stay in a house/neighborhood."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, uncluttered and comfortable stay! Kitchen was well stocked for all of your cooking needs."

Highly recommended."

The home is spotless and includes all the amenities you could need - high end finishes, stocked pantry, great decor, nice patio with a grill, Peloton for getting a nice ride in, etc. Andrew's home is an exceptional place to visit with friends or family, and serves as a great home base for exploring all that Bend has to offer. Look forward to staying here again in the future!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was clean, check in was a breeze, and it was a nice quite community."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything great!! Great house and great stay. Highly recommended!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great property in SE Bend! Home is brand new, super clean and has many amenities! Very nicely decorated and spacious! The property is located in a new development and on a street that dead ends, so there's not any traffic. Just a quick ride to downtown and easily accessible to many of the shopping areas located close by. While I was hoping to make use of the BBQ area, it didn't feel private enough due to an RV park directly behind the property. The kitchen was stocked beyond our expectations and even had most major condiments available for use as well as pastas, etc. The house looks extremely large in the pictures, but, there's only a laundry room on the first floor, so, everything is on the 2nd floor level. I really enjoyed the large master bedroom and bathroom! I had hoped to get more of a restful night's sleep, but couldn't because of a close by train track that is extremely loud and startling in the middle of the night."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This rental was pefect. We stayed for a short weekend stay in Bend. It was absolutely the cleanest home we have stayed in. The location was great and close to everything. We had 6 adult family members and felt we had so much room to stretch out after a long day on the river. The deck was peaceful and had a trail just behind the house where we could walk the dogs. We will definitely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This beautiful house was the perfect place to stay in Bend. It is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood that backs up to an open space with trails (great for dog walking) and a short drive to the river, downtown Bend and easy access to highway 97. The house is spacious, clean and includes everything you could possibly need. We loved cooking in a kitchen stocked by a professional chef! Andrew was super helpful and always responded quickly to messages. We highly recommend this AirBnb and look forward to scheduling another stay in the future."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous comfortable and spacious home. Nice quiet area and home at the end of the street. Great hiking literally just steps from the back of the house. Super comfy beds. Kitchen had everything we could need. We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We needed last minute accommodation as the place we’d booked fell through. We booked and checked in 15 minutes later. The space was perfect for a couple working and skiing. We looked onto a creek and walking path. The place was spotless and had everything we needed. Comfortable bed and linens. For someone with asthma it was a relief not to have any fragrances used for cleaning or linens. Would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great little place, super private, looks just like the pictures…Jessica was super helpful"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was just the right size. Very clean. Good A/C. The shampoo/lotion was very small bottles, so be prepared to bring your own. Easy parking and nice to be able to sit out front and watch the little river."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This spot is a hidden gem. This stay is close to everything in Bend and was a quiet private retreat when back at the cottage. Will definitely stay here again and highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jessica was a great host! Responsive and friendly. The cottage was spotless! It was almost like we were the first guests. It backed to a beautiful creek and was quiet and private. We appreciated the included parking. It was a short walk to Old Mill and Hayden Homes Amphitheater. We would definitely visit again the next time we are in Bend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great little place! Perfect location for all the outdoor activities that Central OR has to offer! Uber was readily available for a quick ride into the Old Mill district and Bond St. area. The house was well furnished and spotless. The kitchen was more than well equipped with everything to prepare meals and even Tupperware for leftovers. The neighborhood is extremely quiet at all times. Jessica responded with in moments regarding any questions we had. The parking area was safe and quiet. We had a wonderful stay and will certainly book again in the future!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had such a fabulous time staying in Bend for a week. It was super convenient to have an easy parking spot for us to load up our snowboard gear and ride at Mt. Bachelor. It’s very convenient to get to practically everywhere in Bend. The place was brand new and everything worked perfectly. We sat outside and grilled multiple dinners. The kitchen is fantastic and came with practically every accessory we could thing of. Will definitely be staying there again in the future.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cottage. Just what I needed for my stay in bend. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in bend.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable home, fantastic communication. I would definitely stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"home was great. Location on point. The only thing negative is that it didn’t snow and there wasn’t any in town, but that was outta your hands 🤗. Would love to be back"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great- perfectly located and super cute. The cottage was clean and cozy, had everything we needed, and it was a short walk to downtown. The hot tub was awesome after long rides and hikes during the day. We look forward to staying again next time we're in Bend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a fantastic stay! I came to Bend with my partner, our 7 month old baby, and our dog, and it suited all of our needs very well. The location is awesome --we walked all around town from the cottage. We love cooking so were thrilled with the well-appointed kitchen. Would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Bend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was great for our weekend trip to Bend. We were able to walk downtown, be close to trailheads, and enjoy the hot tub. The hosts sent detailed instructions for check in and check out, and also checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and great location. Easily walkable to all downtown shops & restaurants!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was all you could ask for and want. Perfect location. Comfy. Clean. Close to anything and everything. Hot tub was perfect. Shower pressure will blow you away (literally) and the mattress was not too soft at all as noted by others. And this coming from a guy with a bad back that needs support. Beautiful time of year to be here. Owners are crazy fast responsive. Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,House was spacious and clean

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the location of the house, it was walkable most places we wanted to visit during our trip. The home was family and pet friendly and all of our basic needs were met. The beds could use some upgrades but everything was clean and served us for the weekend. The host was responsive and welcoming, and we felt like if we had any issues or concerns they would be immediately addressed."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location, super clean house, wonderful amenities."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great rental! This place is close to the river, beautiful parks, and to shops, breweries and restaurants. My only complaint is that the central AC does not work. The 2 bedrooms in the house have their own AC unit (the master has a window unit, and the 2nd bedroom has a floor unit that blows out the window). The issue arises if someone sleeps on the pull-out couches that are in the main living room or in the bonus room that has a door to the back yard. Those rooms are hot at night when you are trying to sleep. Other than the AC issue, the house was great!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was just as described and in a great area of Bend. The main downside for us came down to personal preference but we found the beds way too soft and so we slept really poorly the whole trip, we ended up on the pull out couch instead. Otherwise, the property managers were friendly and easy to communicate with and being able to bring our dogs and have a private yard was great!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at A Stone’s Throw Bungalow. It was very convenient to walk downtown and along the river with the doggies. We were also very thankful for the room AC units and fans. Host was very communicative and house well stocked.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a perfect location for discovering downtown Bend! It's in a great neighborhood, and has great walking access to the Deschutes river trail or restaurants and shops downtown."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic. The ideal place to center a weekend in Bend! Spotlessly clean and beautiful fenced garden for the pup! Well appointed and stocked with kitchen equipment! Loved it!!!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in a superb location! Very close to breweries, coffee, downtown Bend, ax throwing (it was so much fun!). The kitchen is well appointed, and the hot tub was fantastic after a long day of walking around exploring. Highly recommended. Would definitely stay again."
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location cannot be beat! We could walk to downtown Bend in under ten mins. The house was a perfect size for us with plenty of space, the backyard and hot tub were amazing to relax in after a long day of exploring. My only issue (and why I didn’t give it a five star rating) was because of the bed. The mattress was saggy and the frame itself is super squeaky so anytime you move or roll over, it would wake the other up. Not the best nights sleep during our stay but the hosts were very nice & welcoming the day of check in."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The space was perfect for our family. The hot tub was lovely, and it is in a great location. Perfect! In addition, the hosts were super nice. We had to postpone our trip because our dog got injured at the very last minute, and the hosts were super nice about allowing us to postpone to an open week rather than cancel. We will definitely be back. Thanks very much."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is as close to downtown as you can get and is well appointed. This was our 4th time staying here!
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable home in downtown Bend with great hot tub for aching muscles after skiing. Enjoyed our stay.

2020-02-01,3.0,Group trip,Sleeps 5 comfortably
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Terrific stay for our trip! We had 3 adults and 4 kids, with adults having private bedrooms and kids on sofa beds and pack-n-play. The house has space for a group, is in a good neighborhood and very near to downtown (walkable). The road in front of the house is pretty busy but we were never out front as the back is private and fenced, and the hot tub was great after a day of skiing. Communication was fast and easy. The 30 minute drive to Mt Bachelor was easier than expected and scenic. We discovered Newport Avenue Market - strongly recommend for any grocery needs! We would stay again!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home. Highly recommend, would love to come back."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our trip to Bend was wonderful and the people at A Stone's Throw in Bend did a great job with this location! The house was clean and everything worked perfectly. Their binder of information was very helpful but the best part about this place was how central it is to breweries and restaurants

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Easy walking distance to downtown Bend which was awesome. I appreciated the dog friendliness and the fenced in backyard was perfect for my dog. The place was very clean, tidy, comfy, well supplied. The bed in the small bedroom was on the softer side with egg crate style foam on top, I found it quite comfortable, but a heads up in case you don't care for that. You can park in front or in back in the driveway/parking spot off the alley. Overall a great stay with helpful, efficient and professional hosts."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great spacious place with everything you need. Close to everything. Nicely decorated and plenty of room for 2 couples. Highly recommend!
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy space with awesome location close to downtown.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is on a quiet street and an easy walk from central Bend. Street parking is right out front. It is very well kept up and comfortable, and the property managers, who appear to have other houses in the area, are responsive. We enjoyed the chance to use the kitchen and outdoor grill and can recommend the Newport Ave Market nearby. Of course, there is no shortage of places to eat and drink in town if that’s your preference. A couple of cruiser-style bikes are supplied though we didn’t try them. There is only 1 bathroom, so I would not recommend this house for larger groups. Also there is limited AC, though Bend seems to have cool temps at night so it wasn’t an issue for us. Definitely recommend this place- I only wish we got to stay longer."
2019-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was central to everything we we had planned in Bend. We had a lack of communication from one incident.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Shower pressure was on point and couldn't have asked for a nicer neighborhood that shows off Bend's personality. Everything in the house was on point as well from the kitchen, to the shower pressure in the shower. Definitely coming back!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here with our three kids. The location was perfect and we had enough space for all of us to sleep comfortably.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here. Amazing location in a clean and comfortable home.
2019-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location!! -- This home is clean and spacious. It is very close to downtown (5 minute walk), which makes it nice for walking or riding the bikes that are provided. If you need a spacious home with great walkability score, this one is good value for the square footage, but it only has one (1) bathroom that is very small. The backyard is private and has a jacuzzi, which was nice after hiking all day. The master bed is very comfortable."
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,What a fantastic place to stay. The location is ideal for exploring downtown Bend and walking around the beautiful residential neighborhoods.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The best part of the house is the location! Close to downtown and everything else we did in Bend. The beds were very comfortable and plenty of extra towels and bedding. It was an extra bonus to have a high chair and pack and play already at the house for our use. Our daughter loved that the tv had Netflix already so she could watch some movies after a soak in the hot tub. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay on the Westside of Bend!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and spacious! No water from the fridge, but ice part works and they did provide a Brita filter water pitcher inside the fridge. The hot tub in the large, private backyard was amazing! I found this place to be quite in a suburb about a mile from downtown brewery's and shops. The initial description alluded that it was right downtown in the hustle and bustle with art and brewery walks. While it is walking/biking distance, I found the home to be in a quite and relaxing neighborhood."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 just spent a fabulous 2 days at this wonderful, sparkling clean Air B&B with all the amenities we could ask for!

The hot tub in the spacious backyard was perfect. We can’t wait to come back for another visit!"

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cascade Cottage is a great house to stay at and a great location near downtown Bend. Nothing beats a soak in the hot tub after a long day skiing or access to local restaurants and breweries. Our hosts had excellent communication both before check in and during our stay.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I drove up to bend with my girlfriend and our lil dog and loved how close you are to everything. The house was walking distance from downtown and only a couple drive to markets or other stores. The house was warm and inviting, and glad that it came with a fenced backyard to play fetch for our little girl(dog). The nights were cold but the house was warm , look forward to coming back in the future!! Would recommend!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brook, Heidi and Diana's place was just perfect. Check-in was easy. Location was great - close to downtown Bend. The house was clean and had ample amenities. There is a fenced back yard with a spacious, luxuries hot tub. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider booking again when in Bend next."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, cozy, and clean - a great find in the heart of Bend."
2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great!
2018-11-01,3.0,Group trip,"This house is in a great location. The hot tub was awesome and the neighborhood was quiet. There were plenty of utensils and the kitchen was nice and large.
However, this home really comfortably only sleeps 4. As the click-down futon in the 3rd bedroom isn’t adequate for sleeping 2 adults at all really. Maybe one or perhaps two kids. Plus, the pull out in the living room is permanently at a 45* angle, making it like sleeping in a recliner. Not to mention it’s in the common space, meaning if you want to use the living room to socialize you have to put it away and get it back out every night.
Other than the sleeping situation the house was nice. The linens and pillows were surprisingly wonderful. The heating system worked really well.
I did contact the host, Heidi, and responses were timely..... albeit disappointing. Which isn’t necessarily her fault as I apparently didn’t read thoroughly enough the description of the sleeping amenities/situation in the house.
Overall, since it doesn’t sleep 6 comfortably, I’d have to say it’s not the greatest value. But, that being said... what is in Bend, Or? If you’re looking for a 2 couple get away in Bend, it’s perfect."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonder place to stay in Bend. Very clean and comfortable with extra amenities. I would be happy to stay here again. Brook, Heidi, and Diana are very responsive and helpful."

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed with our 1 year old daughter in this adorable, clean home for a week. We walked almost every day to down town Bend which was about a 10 minute walk (so easy!) and we loved that the park and Deschutes River was just a few blocks away. The house itself was clean, comfortable and had everything you needed. It has a lovely front porch that we hung out on in the early mornings and an awesome apple tree out front with delicious red apples on it. The beds were comfy, and the kitchen was fully stocked with cookware/utensils. The hot tub and back yard were a huge plus, and we loved spending the end of the evening soaking in the tub. I would definitely suggest this spot to friends!"

There were plenty of linens and towels for our stay which was much appreciated for the hot tub use. Super perk included the alley parking and entrance that made it easy to load and unload luggage. We did not take advantage of the bikes in the shed but will next time. There are so many bikers in Bend!!!

Bachelor and this place could not have been more perfect.

It was also a 5min walk from multiple breweries and the start of the cute downtown area where we spent plenty of time exploring shops and filling up the growler provided by the house.

But overall we absolutely loved our experience and would definitely stay again!

Fantastic location - quiet, but convenient to downtown, super clean and comfortable. We loved the location and strolled the few minutes into downtown at least once every day. The house had ample space for the three of us to relax together or in our own cozy spaces. The beds and linens were very cozy and comfortable. We made a few meals and found the kitchen to be very clean and well stocked. We were only there for a few days, but would have been comfortable for much longer. Highly recommended!"

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Everything was as described and the hosts were very communicative. You are literally waking distance to everything.

Would recommend this rental."

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a short walk through beautiful streets to the river and downtown area. There are many parks nearby, perfect for children. The home is clean and well furnished, had everything we needed for a family of 4 adults and two children including comfortable beds with nice linens/down comforters, plenty of towels, games, comfortable seating, and well equipped kitchen with nice dishes/glassware. The hot tub was not as hot as we like it, we did not look into adjusting the temp setting."

2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! The house is clean and roomy, and the hot tub was a wonderful amenity. Just note that it isn't actually three blocks from downtown. Factor in a little more of a walk if you want to walk to restaurants or bars."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diana, Chris and Marta's place was perfect - close to downtown, affordable, comfortable and of course the hot tub. Our group came for a short ski trip with a full house plus a dog. The fenced backyard is perfect for the dog while the group hung out back. The beds are super comfortable and the shower water pressure is amazing. We walked to Mirror Pond and downtown for dinner each night. Couldn't have asked for more out of the house and I would recommend it to anyone I know. We will definitely be back in the future. Thanks."

The house comes with most amenities, including shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom and oil/spices/containers in the kitchen. The hot tub was lovely after a day of hiking or beer drinking. And downtown is just a 10-15 minute walk away. If we were to ever come back to Bend, I would definitely stay here again!"

2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying in this home during a ski trip to Bend. We are a family with older teens and young adults. This is a cute recently renovated mid century house in central Bend- warm, hardwood floors, nice modern furnishings, full modern kitchen, washer drier, nice big hot tub with an easy to remove cover. The hosts communicated well, offered to clear snow as needed. With winter weather we didn't take advantage of the deck, BBQ and bikes, but I'd think it would be a great summer home. The home could work well for two couples or for families with children."

We had a great time."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host seemed very friendly, didn't ask a bunch of questions about our stay. I liked that I didn't feel I was getting hounded for my life's story. I got a Message with the entry information prior to our arrival, the owners weren't there when we showed up which was nice since we had been in a car for 3 hours and needless to say were ready to just relax for a bit.
The house was very charming, the pictures made it seem smaller than it actually feels when you're inside. Very open space, clean, well decorated and they had information and instructions for everything in the house. We came to Bend to do some exploring and needed a place to call home on our down time, this was perfect! The beds were extremely comfortable as well.
The next time we are planning a trip to Bend this will definitely be on our list to find reservations!"

The property itself- trees, etc - is an attractive refuge while still being easily accessible to major roads."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bungalow is a great base camp when out adventuring but also a quiet, private space for a getaway.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time! The house was clean, warm, and easy to access. Yuvia was very responsive to messages and their Airbnb page was super helpful.

The bungalow is extremely cute and clean. I especially loved the wood details. The composting toilet is very cool as well.
Cute little backyard patio seating area, beautiful juniper trees with hammocks.
Just lovely!
Will be back!
Thanks Yuvia ☺️"

The views of the sister mountains from the hot tub were breathtaking. My family and I are already planning another trip to stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stacy's place is wonderful! Brand new and spotless inside. Plenty of room in the two bedrooms (and the built-in phone chargers near all beds are a great touch.) Didn't use the hot tub but loved the patio area in back of the house as well - for morning coffee and looking at the mountains. Everything was absolutely great!

Not too far from town but far enough to enjoy a peaceful stay.
Beautiful views
Everything you can ask for, brand new house, clean and very friendly and responsive host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and a few friends stayed here, it was a fun spot to hangout for a weekend. It’s about 15-20 min to downtown bend & we loved coming back home to hangout in the hot tub. My bestfriend and I think this would be a great stay with for a bachelorette party since one of the rooms has multiple beds, or for a family with kids, group of friends etc! We’d recommend this place if you like to grill, have a hot tub, a peaceful morning with a country like view. Stacy was very friendly, super helpful and has a detailed guest book, and does her best to make you feel right at home with multiple things to do. 10/10!"

There were fresh farm eggs and a yummy bottled ale upon arrival. We were in town for a sports tournament in Sisters and loved having the hot tub to return to each night. All the amenities were high-end and straightforward to use. There was excellent instruction for anyone who needed to learn how to use them. Our kids loved the bunk room, all the games in the dresser, and the ""hand-waving"" flushing toilets.
The bath towels were super soft, and everyone commented on them. Funny, I know, but I had to add it. It was a perfect location for us, as we wanted the flexibility to get to Sister and Bend within 20 minutes. We would gladly stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sage Haven is just as described. This house is immaculate and the host has thought about everything, with careful attention to detail.

The setting made for a relaxing evening and we were able to take in the scenery in a quiet atmosphere. The space was clean and very well decorated.

I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to enjoy the area while having a quiet space to come back to at the end of the day!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a fabulous time at Katie's place and were blessed with gorgeous Spring weather. The guest house is lovely and perfect for a couple. What can we say about the view!!! Wow! The 3 Sisters are right there and with the weather we had, we could see peaks from Mt. Bachelor all the way to Mt Jefferson. The location is ideal with easy access to Tumalo, downtown Bend, Sisters, Redmond and Terrebonne. If you're coming to enjoy outdoor activities, the attached garage provides ample space to safely store your gear. Although the guest house doesn't have a full kitchen, there are appliances to accommodate your needs. We used the BBQ grill to make steaks and had a gourmet dinner with a million dollar view. Katie was easy to communicate with and once we met her sweet dogs, they'd greet us. we appreciated all the little touches she added and we would stay here again. If you can, stay for two nights."

It even felt bigger than I thought it would due to the high ceilings. The view of all the peaks is just incredible, we could have been quite content to just sit out back all day long. Without exaggerating, this was the perfect airbnb experience."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow. What a view. We were so lucky to find a place with the best views in Oregon. Waking up to a cotton candy filled sky with the three sisters in the back is an experience I won’t soon forget. Katie and Brooks were friendly and greeted us when we arrived. We look forward to coming back.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wont tell you what they did for me, because I don't want to create unrealistic expectations, but lets just say the owners went WELL BEYOND what anyone would expect in terms of hospitality!

They built themselves a beautiful (luxury) homestead on a ranch with a view of the Sisters. What a way to wake up. Perfect balance of convenience and rejuvenation. Spend a night at the food truck pod a few minutes down the street (by bike or car), come home, wake up to the sight of mountains and grazing horses. What more could anyone want?"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was just what I expected. It was cozy, stylish, and clean. We would definitely recommend."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place is great
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful views of the mountains and a beautiful space!
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Katie’s place. The view from the room wasn’t what we expected because of the cloud cover around the mountains at the time of our visit. The guesthouse is away from the bustle of the city which is what we were looking for. The nearby Tumalo town had an amazing coffee place called Tumalo coffeehouse that served cinnamon latte, recommended by Katie. It failed to disappoint! We highly recommend Katie’s place for a short visit to Bend (1-2 nights). However for a longer visit, this place may be a tad bit less quaint."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thsi placeiIt is a slice of heaven!! Nothing beats sitting in bed watch both the sunrise and moonglow on the mountains. The host made us feel totally welcomed and at home. We will be back.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The view is incomparable! I did really see the view from our room just like displayed on the listing.
Feel like seeing such a nice painting.
You can see horses or cows of neighbors and even friendly and lovely Aussie as well.
The owner is really nice as well, I hope i could have more time in here.
Hope to come again next year!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay in! Everything is less than 15 minutes away if you need to go the the store. And a lot of local brewies around. Also if its your first time in Bend, Oregon the host suggest local outting to do. Very friendly and caring people."
2020-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Nice and quit house in place. Kitchen should be equipped with minimum products.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! We really enjoyed all of the recommendations that the host provided either through messages or through the information that was left in the apartment. Such a charming and clean apartment with the most incredible view.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming studio with an outdoor patio that provides outstanding views of the surrounding fields and mountains. The hosts were wonderful (as were their friendly pets.) We’d definitely return.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"View as fabulous as advertised! It was an incredibly relaxing place to spend a few days on a solo getaway. I suggest contacting the hosts in advance if you have specific amenities that you plan to use (good advice for all Airbnb actually!). I arrived with fish to grill but the BBQ then required a lot of doing to be able to use it (made more complicated by the fact that the hosts were out of town) and the gas outdoor heater wasn't available. They were extremely friendly and helpful from afar, but things would have gone much more smoothly if I had confirmed in advance exactly which of the advertised amenities I was planning to use. Armed with this knowledge, I would still return as it was a truly incredible spot."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. The guest house was very clean, private, and had a great view of the surrounding mountains. A nice bonus was that we could park in the garage. Katie was very helpful and had some good recommendations for restaurants to try nearby. Would love to stay here again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie and Brooks were very gracious and helpful hosts! The location of their property is close to town and the views are spectacular! The hosts were very easy to contact and were very willing and resourceful when it came to recommendations in the area. 10/10 recommend this place!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view from the back porch is better than expected. Quiet with incredible views of Three Sisters. Perfect for viewing sunsets.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous place in a great location with fantastic hosts!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very cozy and the views were gorgeous! I was delighted by two blue jays investigating a nearby sunflower while I sipped my morning coffee. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's place is perfect for a much needed getaway stay. Located on their property with amazing views of the mountains. The apartment is well appointed, clean and very quiet. We loved the touches she has added make the place so inviting. We will return for sure."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always awesome, one of my favorite places to stay!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were amazed by the views out the backdoor. The space was comfortable, cute, and had everything we needed. We felt far enough from the city to enjoy a country feel, but close enough that it was a short drive to necessities. Can’t wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful with exceptional views and thoughtful hosts
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unbeatable views and a perfect little getaway in Bend. Great location to get into downtown Bend or to so many hikes and outdoor activities! We loved our stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guesthouse was a very lovely place to stay, the aesthetic was super cute! We enjoyed a nice dinner on the back patio, watched the sunrise over the mountains, and stargazing at night. Katie and Brooks were easy going and very easy to communicate with. We’d definitely come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This listing is even more beautiful than it looks in the pictures! I was so pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful touches and decorations that Katie set up the place with, not to mention the amazing view! Katie also was very prompt and transparent in her communication, and was very mindful of privacy as well. I've been to many Airbnbs and this was one of my very favorites. I can't recommend it enough."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Brooks were wonderful hosts. They were there to greet us upon arriving and offered us some tips for exploring all Bend has to offer.
The space itself is much better than it looks in the photos -- and it's the perfect size for 1-2 people. We enjoyed waking up each morning to a beautiful view of the three Sisters mountains. It's the ""country"" so don't expect to be walking distance to anything. That being said, the place is located about a 5 minutes drive to the town of Tumalo, which has a few dining options and a gas station.
Everytime we had a question the hosts were quick to respond and accommodate.
What more could you ask for?"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful place with a gorgeous mountain view and great hosts! It's also not far from Bend, which is nice."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can say without exaggeration that Katie and her husband are the best hosts I've ever had. Every little detail was perfect and they went above-and-beyond in their hospitality. The place is perfectly appointed and the sunset views you'll enjoy from the deck are the best I have ever seen.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and had a warm cozy feel. Made the stay in Bend pleasurable.
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean unit with great views. Only drawback is the drive into town; about 20 min each way but that is the trade off for the Mountain View’s.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful spot with amazing views! Can’t wait to return!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot! Very colorful and quiet. Very comfortable bed too. Surrounded by mountains and ranches. Can look outside and see horses/cattle grazing. A very relaxing place to stay.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy place! I had a rainy weekend so I didn't get to see the mountains, but the space and views were great, even with the clouds and rain! And, there was a clear night where I think I saw more stars than I've ever seen before...so gorgeous! A very comfy, cozy spot for a weekend away!!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a peaceful environment and happy space. I love staying here when it’s available. Super quick drive into downtown Bend, but far away enough to enjoy peace and quiet."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the spot for you if you want peace and quiet and views of the mountains when it's clear and of the farmland and cows and horses when it's cloudy. It was heaven for me on a work trip, with easy access to Bend and Prineville, where I had work meetings. Great advice on where to eat and drink in Tumalow as well as in Bend. The garage and automatic gate make getting in and out very comfortable."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect home away from home, for those who like to stay away from the hustle bustle of the city. You get an amazing view of the mountains directly from the bed. On a clear night, sip wine and enjoy stargazing from the attached patio."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t be happier with Katie’s place. It was like a home away from home with a once in a life time view! The stay at Katie’s place made our trip to Bend so easy and memorable!

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Katie’s place. It was a great spot for us to stay while snowboarding at Mt. Bachelor. Small, cozy, and a major perk to be able to use the garage! Katie was a great host, she made check in and out very easy and made sure we had what we needed. We would suggest this place to others."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Katie’s place is beautiful and cozy! Unfortunately we didn’t get to experience the gorgeous views due to lots of snow, but we came to Bend to enjoy that snow. We are hoping to come again during the summer!! Katie’s place is very easy to find, clean and you get your own garage to use during your stay which is so awesome during the winter season. The absolute best part of our stay was getting to meet Katie’s dogs! They both came and greeted us and it made our whole experience so perfect. My husband & I would both highly recommend staying here, we definitely plan on staying again!"
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has a million dollar view of the Cascade Mountains. Really spectacular.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, all you would want. The property is absolutely beautiful with horses, cows & goats to see. The hospitality was amazing, Katie and her husband are amazing, great conversations with them! Thank you!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little place for two. The view of the mountains was spectacular! We really appreciated being able to park in the garage because we were there during a snowstorm.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found Katie's place very comfortable. The space is private, a separate small apartment with use of garage. We were there for a climbing competition for my teen, and he found the foam mattress queen bed extremely comfortable. I enjoyed the harder futon/couch. The space was cozy, clean and with nice touches. The wide view of land and the mountain range beyond was stunning. We loved seeing cows and horses out the window, on a neighboring property. Katie and Brooks were very communicative and Brooks generously offered suggestions on places to visit. The couple's two dogs graciously welcomed us as we came and went. We highly recommend their place!"
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy studio, and although it was cloudy during our stay, the view was still great! Plenty of parking for small or larger vehicles, and outstanding hosts, who's hospitality and friendliness made the stay that much better! Highly recommend Katie's place!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The check in process is just the best I have ever experienced in all of my Airbnb experiences. The check in process was so smooth. (Honestly, on par with the best Airbnb stays I’ve had) The guest house is spotless, warm and inviting. We had the best sleep; cozy room, super quiet setting, very nice bed, effective heating for cold weather. Everything I wanted after a long road trip."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,From the listing all the amenities and what's to be expected about the place was pretty accurate. Nice location for the price when visiting Bend. We were welcomed by Brooks and he was very helpful giving tips of places to eat and drink. The absolute winner for this AirBnb is the views of the mountains and snow. We were also lucky to have a full moon that night with the light glowing on the snow.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Katie’s place is a true gem! When we arrived, we were greeted by her husband who showed us the way and made us feel welcome. The property is a quick little drive from the heart of Bend but it is quiet and peaceful. You truly feel like you’re experiencing central Oregon at its finest. The place was clean, the instructions were simple and the check-out was a breeze. I cannot wait to stay here again!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy little apartment was just as described. Easy communication, great location, nice people, and beautiful views. You're provided your own parking spot in the garage and pretty much everything you could need in the apartment. The view of the mountains in the backyard from bed is a perfect start to the morning. This was a great stop on our travels. We can't wait to stay again in the future!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Katie’s place is awesome! What a view! It had nice cozy and very private feel. I highly recommend staying here.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice short trip to Sisters and used Katie's place more for a place to sleep compared to using the room for the whole day. The house was easy to find, as we arrived after dark and self check-in was easy.
We would recommend for a quick trip to Sisters or Bend anytime"

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our favorite Air B and B experience EVER. Katie and Brooks are so accommodating and friendly, and the book of recommendations was invaluable in planning our time in Bend.

We also really enjoyed the opportunity to use the fire pit in the backyard- we were sad to leave and we plan to stay here again!"

We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit Bend!"

The best part was the hospitality. You cannot find better hosts. Thank you so much for having us."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay, it's a cute place with an absolutely gorgeous view. The only negative we had was that the shower made a very high pitched whistle, which didn't make us want to shower for too long. Everything else was wonderful."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Katie’s place was a perfect place to stay in Bend. Perfectly clean, with lots of thoughtful touches and an incredible outdoor space. We loved stargazing outside at night on the lounge by the suite, and it was so nice to wake up to the incredible view through their big glass door! They had everything you needed to cook (though we opted for pizza instead) and make coffee in their little kitchen area, and provided great recommendations for things to do in the area. All in all, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience or more friendly and helpful hosts! We are dreaming of coming back already. Thanks Katie and Brooks!"

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights with Katie, Brooks and their wonderful pets. You will not find nicer people to host you or sweeter dogs to cuddle with.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Brooks were fantastic hosts! They were so warm and welcoming. My husband and I were impressed with how thought out the Airbnb was, you can tell that they took the time and care to decorate and stock the Airbnb with essentials. For example: assortment of dishes in the kitchen, clean towels, plenty of local guides and information, fan for warm nights, etc. We had everything we needed and were super comfortable during our stay. Also want to mention that the sunset over the Sisters (which you can see from the Airbnb and outdoor patio) is absolutely beautiful!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a beautiful, tranquil, comfortable place to stay with spectacular views, you just found it.
Watching the sunset over those mountains was breathtaking.
Katie was happy to answer my questions and give recommendations when I arrived.
Silent nights and a comfy bed were just the ticket after long days of exploring. The kitchen had everything I needed but I opted for eating out and was surprised how close the apartment was to fantastic food.
This will be my private get away whenever I'm in the Bend area.
Thank you Katie, Brooks, Remi, Hank and Jack the cat!"

We can’t wait to come again!
Thank you Brooks and Katie!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Katie's place is exactly as she pictured (AMAZING!), but you can't understand the view until you visit in person.

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's studio apartment is very cute, cozy and clean. There is plenty of space for a couple and a third person can sleep on the futon. The location was perfect for us, as it was a short drive to several attractions including Smith Rock, Sisters and Downtown Bend. We had beautiful mountain views- just as the photos show. I highly recommend staying here for a vacation in Central Oregon."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First and foremost, Katie and Brooks are incredible hosts AND lovely people. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The space was clean, the bed was comfy, and the view is everything it is made out to be - gorgeous! Strongly recommend that anyone staying in the Bend/Sisters area stay with Katie and Brooks."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stopped here for a quick overnight on our way to Portland. This was the perfect little resting spot. The place was very clean and had everything we needed.

The communication between us was excellent. Katie and Brooks were very accommodating. Enjoyed our stay very much."

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend staying here! Katie has created a lovely space full of love, warmth, and thoughtful attention to details. She and Brooks are fantastic hosts. They greeted me when I arrived and I felt like I was staying with old friends. They've written up descriptions of their favorite local eateries and outdoor activities that inspired me to try to get back to their place for a longer stay so I can check out more of their recommendations. And the mountain view out the back through the glass doors is truly spectacular. I would absolutely stay here again. Thank you for creating such a lovely and inviting space!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy space with AMAZING views of the Cascades! Off the beaten path but very easy to access and only minutes from everywhere you want to be. Super quiet and private. Katie has decorated this cute little apartment in eclectic style. Comfy bed, a garage for your car or gear...pretty perfect. I would love to return in the summer and use the private patio and watch the sun go down. Our host was quick to respond to communication and flexible on arrival time. Great stay and we will be back!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to spend the night especially after a long day of exploring the places nearby. And the view....is breathtaking. Check-in and check-out were simple.

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Two of us came to Central Oregon for one night to run a race in Sisters. Katie and Brooks are outstanding hosts. Brooks greeted us, and both hosts were very easy to communicate with. The space has stellar views of the mountains (though it was overcast during our short visit) and a nice patio and fire pit for watching the sunset. The space has its own garage stall for guests too! Coffee was provided with the option to use a French press or a Keurig. Their restaurant recs were useful (we ate dinner at Worthy Brewing; 👍🏻). We asked to check out 2 hours late, and our gracious hosts allowed it. I would stay again!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The view is great! An adorable and comfortable accommodation. Much better than almost every hotel we've ever stayed at. Fantastic value and warm, welcoming hosts Katie & Brooks. We'll stay again! (The bed is a full-size bed which we are used to but others may not be.)"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie and Brooks were extremely accommodating to us and their and had some great recommendations for dining and hiking the local area!

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Katie’s BnB is exactly as shared in her pictures and description. I had a delightful overnight visit with the lovely and comfortable setting and the Mountain View is “the best”!! Katie and Brook are lovely hosts.
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie’s place was the perfect little vacation spot. Clean, cozy, quiet, and incredible views. Watching the sunset from the room and the patio was fantastic! Close to Bend and easy to find, but far enough away that you are able to enjoy the peace and quiet of the farmland. The home owners were very easy to get in touch with and had great recommendations. We enjoyed a nearby hike along the Deschutes River, and great local food (brewpubs/coffee are plentiful)! Superb location for a relaxing getaway."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second stay and we look forward to more in the future!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great Airbnb for a weekend trip to Bend. Beautiful rural location on a farm; it was fun to visit their pigs and chickens. Very peaceful location but just 10-15 minutes to downtown Bend.
The only thing to note is there is no shower, only a claw foot bathtub (which is lovely); just worth noting for longer stays."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect and easy in every single way. It was squeaky clean and beautiful. You CANNOT go wrong with this place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, cozy, comfortable. We were greeted with a pair of friendly horses in the morning. Highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, private, peaceful, easy access, clean. Only issue was the tv, navigating the menus was painfully slow and it froze several times to where we had to unplug it to reset. Ideal otherwise though, and we’d be happy to stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasure staying at Alex and Tiffany’s property. The place exceeded our expectations: it was even better than described or depicted in the pictures. It’s hard to explain exactly what “at home” feeling is but that’s what we felt staying at their cozy suite.
Highly recommended and will definitely come back!
Thank you."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, private, way more space than it seems in the photos and one of the cleaniest airbnbs I've stayed in! The bathroom is very spacious, with a perfect clawfoot tub sitting next to a window. Two sitting rooms: TV sitting room and another sitting room without TV. It's about a 5 to 6 minute drive to restraunts, gas stations, and grocery stores. The host quickly responded to my last-minute booking & was very accommodating!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice, and the claw foot bath tub was a super nice addition to the location. It was super secluded in the countryside surrounded by beautiful farmland and livestock! Overall, it was a very nice spot! In our personal experience, we found that one of the lights in the living space that got turned back on after we went to bed, (at about 2:00 Am or so). We were unsure about if there was potentially some miswiring, if any of the lights were on a timer that we didn't know about, or if someone forgot we were staying and came inside the apartment to check on it while we were there."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family's stay in Bend was great. Being 15 mins outside of the hustle and bustle of Bend was perfect and the surrounds were lovely. The accomodation was super comfy, although it does take a min to get used to un-orthodox angles to not crack your head. Of particular note is the claw-footed bathtub - so rare to find nowadays!
Highly recommend staying with Alex & Tiffany!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As someone who has always wanted to live in the country, the views from this air bnb were a dream! The horses were right outside the window and you could see them grazing from the bathtub. The bathroom was awesome- I felt like I was at a spa. There is only a portable AC in the living room but the temperature was fine with the windows open at night. There were also plenty of fans and amenities. I would love to come back the next time I’m in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Alex and Tiffany’s place. It’s very peaceful and the space is very well put together! It’s a bit smaller, but they have done a great job with the space. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful suite and surroundings. Located about 6 miles outside Bend proper. The bathroom was amazing with vintage style claw foot tub although no shower.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My grown kid and I really enjoyed this place. Very quiet, plenty of space, enjoyed the rural setting but still close enough to town. Loved the tub and luxurious bathroom."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An adult-sized tree house with plenty of possibilities to relax and recharge. Interior is exquisitely crafted with locally-styled materials utilizing every square foot. The bed is comfy and the shareable claw foot tub reigns over the lovely bathroom. Every window offers pasture views and plenty of blue sky. Well-appointed unit has hidden treasures in design and amenities. Thoughtful hand-written notes provide guidelines (battery-operated candles throughout, welcoming breezes, kitchenette use, etc.)
We will certainly be back!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean, as described, and well equipped. Price was very reasonable even though there was a big festival in town and lots of folks were gouging. I also appreciate that this place is a great little efficiency and not a full home that could be rented to a local worker in the area.
The claw foot tub was fantastic and the horse neighbors were a lovely bonus. Would stay again and totally recommended for others."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved their personal touches that made my stay peaceful and relaxing. It was beautiful to rest, work, and rejuvenate in. I will definitely be booking again when I stay in bend! 😊 Thank you!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little place! Fun layout, nicely arranged and appointed. Loved the horses outside of window and roosters in the morning. Would definitely stay again. A great choice that was perfect for us. With no shower and only a bathtub I miss my morning cold shower a bit. A minor thing. Overall, great!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great for a quick stop just outside of Bend. Very friendly and helpful host
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The huge bathroom was incredible. I enjoyed my relaxing bath with the beautiful view. Others in my party were hoping for a shower option. Have you thought about adding a shower head and brass oval above the tub to hold shower curtain?
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious and clean place. First time in Bend. Great value compared to hotels etc
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Wonderful home inside and out. The sunset was beautiful from the picnic table right outside the home. The bathtub was great as well! Alex and Tiffany were very responsive whenever we had any questions.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice spot just enough outside of town to be quiet but close enough to go do things easily. It was a cute place and the host gave great instructions to get there.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time back at Alex and Tiffany’s, and it won’t be my last! Great communication, fantastic location, super comfy bed, and their place is SO AWESOME! It was so nice to relax and enjoy my weekend at Bend.

Thank you for a lovely stay."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at this cute little B&B, very clean, nice furnishings, and very attentive host!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! Very thoughtful decor and helpful reminder signage. It was very clean inside. I especially liked the use of repurposed cheese wheel lids, the tub, and the bath spa products. Reading the other visitors’ visit memos was fun too. The wall heaters kept the space warm, but it was very dry heat. This isn’t so much a review for the hosts but for future visitors - the tv remote doesn’t work well for volume, so turn the volume to where you’d like it on the tv itself BEFORE you play a show or movie!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Huge thanks for another amazing stay! Simple, easy, amazingly comfortable... I can't thank Alex and Tiffany enough for sharing such an amazing space!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Tiffany’s place is perfect for a quick getaway from Portland’s rainy winter weather. It’s peaceful and the unit looks exactly like the pics. Perfect for couples :)
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a treat to get to stay here! The claw foot tub alone would have made it worth it. The space feels so quiet and relaxing and private. It’s out in the country, but close to everything in Bend. Really lovely and comfortable! Alex and Tiffany were very responsive to any questions. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little space with great views.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything perfect

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Tiffany were able to accommodate our engine boss for his days off. He loved that the unit was secluded yet close to town. It was exactly what he needed before heading to a new fire.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this cozy apartment/suite! It’s a perfect location between the town of Bend and Pronghorn Resort where we attended a wedding.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cozy, quiet stay! Comfortable bed & living spaces, very clean, and bathroom & kitchenette are well-stocked with the basics (and then some). Definitely recommend for staying in the Bend area if you prefer to stay a little ways away from the hustle and bustle."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is seriously such a gem! Everything is exactly as shown in photos the place is so cozy and you will feel very at home! The claw foot tub is INCREDIBLE and so spacious. The cows just outside the window are so fun to watch and really give you a farm feel. The movie room is so fun with super comfy recliners for movies at night after a long day of adventuring in bend. The bed was also really comfortable. The location is amazing! You are just far enough to get a rural experience and be able to see so many stars at night, but you are also a short drive from all that bend has to offer! All around such an amazing stay, we highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They were wonderful hosts that have a beautiful place to offer. Loved the countryside and how quiet it is out there. Within 20 minutes of most places! Recommend staying here!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect escape spot in Bend! Beautiful stars, an amazing claw foot rub, and just enough space to be cozy. 100% recommended!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we stayed at this suite for our second wedding anniversary. we used it as kind of a ""home base"" for a bunch of central Oregon adventures and it was just perfect! the owners have some cows that came right up to the fence to say hi! super friendly! everything was clean. directions to the suite were very clear. we are bigger people and the tub was fine for us. ac worked well and was easy to climate control."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay for when traveling through on business or whatever. The place was very clean and we enjoyed the country setting. Just a note, there are lots of stairs. So, if that’s a problem for you then this isn’t the place to stay. Other than that though, great accommodations and hosts."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Comfortable and quiet.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for our party of two to hang out and rest while not rockhounding east of Bend.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, private space for able-bodied folks. Stairs and a few low-clearance spots means you have to be able to navigate the space, however it's very comfortable and we'd absolutely stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cute little place for our stay in bend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alex and Tiffany's place was wonderful! Beautiful views, peaceful and perfect for a quick trip to the Bend area!
They were also very accommodating to our needs and the communication was quick/easy!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cozy, creatively done spot. It was nicely off the beaten path of Bend and tucked away."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cute and unique place, the bathroom with the clawfoot bathtub next to a sunny window with cows outside was the best part. Hosts are kind and communicative."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were kind, courteous, and quick to respond. We appreciated how clean the space was and the idyllic property it is on. Our family would stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot - quiet and peaceful - with good proximity to town and outdoors activities. If you’re doing a race/climbing/hiking and need a place to recover from the day’s activities, this cozy place and the old school bath tub are just right."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, nice place, with a comfy bed. Nice and private."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First great response time. I had to have some insulin shipped overnight and she was so kind to run it right over! Overall I give this a 5 star with a couple minor problems.
All the positive; very quiet, relaxing country setting. Alot of thought put into every inch of this add on area to maximize the space. Well done! The accents and touches are very beautiful! The best part was the bed. I'm very picky and this mattress is a dream!
A minor downside is the TV room is only 6 foot tall and I'm 5 ' 11"" so no problem there .. but the doorway into the bathroom from the TV room goes alittle more down to below my height. After a couple of bumps (and don't wear a cap!) I quit hitting that area ... but for some reason I couldn't remember to duck when getting into the mini frig.
My main concern was having to take a bath for so many days in a row (7 days) I was well aware it only had a bath and I LOVE baths (great old tub!) ... but a week was just too long without a shower (As l normally wash or at least rinse after baths). I wouldn't of mined taking only a bath for maybe 2 or 3 days.
Also The heating system is just wall heaters that don't connect to a thermostat so it's just impossible to get a nice consentant temp. (I'm a diabetic so I probably get cold easily) And since there's no real air flow from room to room, every room was either too cold or too hot. I was constantly adjusting as I was getting up out of bed several times in the night to go over to the wall heater to either turn it up or down. (But It was no problem the first few days until a cold front came in. I imagine this could be a problem in the summer as well .. and the cow poop will warm up nicely in summer!)
The steps into the bedroom are huge and awkward. In the daytime they are no problem but at night.. Oh my, I had a very hard time maneuvering them when I had to get up half a sleep. (there is a hand rail) And than forgetting that short doorway going into the bathroom...
The bed is up against the wall so a second person will have to work at getting in and out.
Sounds like a lot But overall it was great vibes and great people to deal with. I may go back if it's reasonable priced (no discount for a week) and if it's spring or fall ... for bath only shorter trips."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Alex and Tiffany went above and beyond for me! I’m a night shift RN and they made sure the bedroom was pitch black so I could sleep during the day. They’re very considerate kind people! Very clean place! Comfy bed! Highly recommend!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and comfortable bed.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice drive to the outskirts of Bend. This was the perfect place to rest our heads for the weekend to do some antiquing and shopping. On the way to check in we saw a doughnut shop not to far from us so we went there for breakfast. Our hosts were very generous and we appreciate them letting us enjoy this Corky little apartment in the sticks. We giggled every time a cow mooed.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a WONDERFUL place! It is out in the more rural area of Bend but about 5-10 minutes away from everything you might need. We loved the quiet and the nice views out of the windows. The description and photos are accurate. The self check in was super easy and the hosts were quick to respond to any communication. The place was very clean and it had everything we needed for a great stay. Our favorite things about this place were the bathroom (old fashioned claw footed tub!) and the attention to the design of the entire unit. The unit is above a shop and it is such a wonderful and unique use of space. If you are in the Bend area, you should stay here! I HIGHLY recommend it!
Please note that there are a couple of things to be aware of which added to the charm of the place for us but might be an issue for some people. There are stairs to get up to the unit and there are steps inside the unit (the bedroom and entertainment room are a few steps up from the living room). Also, there is NO SHOWER in the bathroom. It has a tub ONLY (we LOVED IT!). I believe that these things are clearly stated in the listing and I want to confirm that this is accurate.
I hope that we can stay here again sometime in the future!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was absolutely perfect… we really enjoyed being just outside of town, and getting a feel for what this area can be like away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas of Bend. Loved the cows that came to say hi, and the amenities and views out of the bathroom and main room windows were spectacular to watch the sun come up on the snow…
A+ experience for us!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute a perfect place to stay while for a weekend away! Everything is perfectly thought out with care.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little apartment. Like the description states - it's a good 15 minutes from town, but there's lots of peace and quiet & lots of attention to detail. I highly recommend this little apartment if you ever find yourself traveling to Bend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, quiet place with a cool farm out back. Was able to meditate while being serenaded by the cows. Hosts are responsive and communicate all logistics very clearly."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolutely lovely quirky suite. Very cozy with the best huge tub. Alex and Tiffany were wonderfully helpful and responsive. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easily one of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed in. So many great touches and thoughtful details. The clawfoot tub is dreamy! Truly a beautiful spot to unwind for a few days. Communication with Alex and Tiffany was a breeze. Can’t wait to come back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was so cute and comfortable! Alex and Tiffany are amazing hosts- so accommodating and always available and quick to respond! They even offered to store my bike when it was raining, as well as provided tools and help with my trailer. I felt safe as a female traveling alone and so appreciated all the small extra touches they put into their place! Definitely recommend :)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place if you're looking for a quiet home base outside of town. The very comfy bed and big clawfoot tub were my main enjoyments, but there is also a (turquoise!) room with two recliners and a large flat-screen television, and of course other basic amenities. I was only there nights and it worked perfectly for my needs--and only 15 minutes from my main in-town destination. It's very clean and with a thoughtful and efficient use of its interesting space. Would totally recommend."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The power went out for a bit, but it wasn’t at all anyone’s fault- just my luck. Super sweet people and adorable cows!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great stay. It was the perfect spot while up in Bend for work. Alex was very helpful and courteous. Would love to stay again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very cozy and well designed. A little like a cabin. It's not very close to town, you are a bit off the beaten path, but it's quiet. Bathroom is awesome!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany have a wonderful little getaway and they've thought of all the little details to make it cozy and comfortable. We really loved staying here, and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet nice place!! The mattress is a must, we were able to rest well. They are 15’ to the downtown."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great, inexpensive place to stay! Very clean, and neat when we got there. It was very hot outside and with limited airflow in some places it got quite hot, but there was an AC so never terrible.
Additionally, the cielings in some areas are low. My friend who is 6’ felt a little claustrophobic, and had to bend over a little bit when moving through these areas. Just a heads up!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany’s suite was spacious, cleanly and beautiful views with amazing sounds of nature. Their communication was in time and friendly. When I come to visit Bend, Oregon again I will MOST DEFINITELY stay in their guest suite!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean. Helpful hosts.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place and would 100% stay here again. Hosts were super responsive, listing is accurate, and space is unique. If you want to a home base out in nature (with the cows, chickens, meadow, and tress), but close to all the downtown Bend activities with a short drive, this is your spot!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy suite on a lovely farm. The hosts were very inviting. Thanks for your hospitality.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's hard to imagine you can find better value in Bend. Close to town but super quiet, small but we'll designed with fun quirks and a beautiful bathroom. This place is great!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to unwind and relax.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a GREAT getaway! The hosts were so accommodating and sweet. I highly recommend this spot if you want some time time to yourself with an awesome tub! Plus, there are some cute cows around :)"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little place to chill at while you’re staying in bend. We really enjoyed trying out the country lifestyle, and we even made friends with the cows next door! When you come, make sure that you bring a charger with the wall accessory as the usbs mentioned in the listings don’t work.
All in all tho, we enjoyed our stay a lot. The hosts respond quickly, and gave bomb food recs. My fave was McKay cottage for brunch. Y’all got to try it!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a quiet, clean and nicely decorated place to yourself, this is it. The bathroom with claw foot tub is sublime for relaxing as are the serene cows outside your window if you want to stop and slow down. The hosts were very responsive."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely would recommend Alex and Tiffany’s getaway! The tub was a dream and the bnb was clean, cozy and peaceful, and my husband and I will be back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great little unique place on the farm! I’d definitely stay here again. It’s outside of town but Bend is small so that means it’s only about a 15 minute drive to get to everything. Alex and Tiffany were really responsive and great hosts!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cute!! Loved the tub! Would definitely stay again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect place for rest & quiet in a rural setting! I was going to a wedding at Pronghorn Resort & this place is literally 10 minutes from there. I also love hiking Smith Rock which is about 30 minutes north.
I really appreciated the tub, the wood work, the sunsets from the bedroom & having a little kitchen. Having the cows & chickens just outside was also a plus for me.
Self check in was a breeze, super easy to find & very clean. I highly recommend it for a little get away or as a base for exploring Bend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the natural light and the cows!! great stay, the bathtub was amazing"

2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying here with a friend. Great value for a spacious place in Bend, which was comfortable for both of us. Absolutely loved the claw foot tub. The battery operated candles made for a candle lit bath with a starry night visible from the window. TV room was fun and relaxing. Immaculately clean. Would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you Alex + Tiffany."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent spot to land on a Bend adventure! Comfy bed, very clean, and the claw foot tub is a nice bonus to soak in after a day spent playing in the snow."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing once you go inside! Loved the bathroom especially, but watch your head going in and out! Quiet place but not far from all the action in Bend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious enough for two people to work on Zoom without disturbing each other. We worked, played board games, watched movies. The kitchen is well stocked, the bathroom is bliss. Very clean and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cozy and cute place. The tub was a bonus. Thanks again!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany are great hosts. Their place was just as they described: cozy, comfortable, and immaculately clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alex and Tiffany’s guest suite is a cozy and quirky little home, perfect for a weekend getaway. Our group of four was very comfortable for the night after we had spent the 3 days before that camping. There is no shower but that wasn’t a bother for us since we just spent one night - there is a soaking tub though! The place is easy to find with GPS, and the hosts are kind enough to send very detailed instructions.
Would definitely stay again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place would definitely stay again
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany were prompt communicators when an appliance issue arose and made sure to get it fixed quickly. I really appreciated that hospitality as well as the small touches like salts for the bath, snacks, and tea.
A great value stay for Bend adventuring!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy spot with beautiful views through many picture windows! Alex and Tiffany were very clear with directions on how to get to the suite, and it served as the perfect home base for Bend adventures a little ways from downtown. Favorite feature was definitely the clawfoot bathtub overlooking the yard and the mountains, and all the accompanying bath salts. Looking forward to staying here next time I'm in Bend :)"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely love this cozy farm studio! Alex and Tiffany are the sweetest people and want to make you feel at home. I stayed an extra day, because I truly didn't want to leave. I hope to return to Bend in the near future and stay at this sweet spot again! Thank you so much for everything!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy and charming space! We loved relaxing in the tub, hearing the cows moo and chickens cluck, and enjoying the comfy recliners and awesome viewing experience in the theater room. Loved it! If you're around 6' tall, this place might not be for you if you're not comfortable ducking ;-P There are also quite a few steep stairs and different levels to watch out for. But all in all, this was a very relaxing and charming place to be!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely will stay again
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend staying at this cozy and locally located space. Enjoyed a wonderful weekend here!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great! The location was a short drive to town and shopping. It was very cozy! We all took turns taking time to relax in the clawfoot bathtub the first night that we arrived. It was very relaxing.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome, I wish I was in Bend longer just to enjoy it more. I loved taking baths and they have epsom salt and bubble bath to complete the experience. Finding it was easy, leaving was a bummer. ;) It felt like home- super comfortable. ♡"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place tucked into a nice area where you feel close to town but a farm stay. Easy to find and nice amenities and touches. Fast response and great communication. So appreciate being able to stay at this location when I needed to.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little home away from home couldn’t have been more perfect! My husband and I were looking for a little get away for a few days and this place was it! Cute, cozy, and simply a gem! It’s location was perfect for us too, as it was far enough from the city to star gaze but close enough to go and enjoy some great food and drinks during dinner and lunch. The bed was super comfortable, the movie room was awesome and the claw foot bathtub was dreamy! The little touches of candles, soaps and salts reminded me of a spa. Lastly let me just say the golden hour in this place leaves you speechless, when the sun is spilling through the windows you can’t help but be in awe. We loved this place and can’t wait to come back. Thank you Alex and Tiffany for being amazing communicators and for offering us chairs for outside and even setting it up for us to stay an extra night, we enjoyed it all! P.s. my husband also said hello and goodbye to those cute cows every time he walked in and out of that door lol. He said he named them Bobby and Whitney LMAO!!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place just outside of Bend! Great way to have a relaxing space out of town but get back into Bend quickly. We loved it here

Would certainly book again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Tiffany were very responsive with comminucation and their suite was great. Everything was very clean and the atmosphere was relaxing. Great place to stay after long days exploring. Thank you!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A sweet little haven. Charming and petite, but missing nothing in cozy comfort."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Convenient location and such a cute, tidy space. We would love to revisit this property."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect launch pad for some excellent outdoor adventures around Bend & Redmond! It was more than enough space with plenty of thoughtful amenities, and we actually enjoyed being a bit outside of the hustle and bustle of Bend. The claw foot tub was especially appreciated after all of our hiking!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what a fabulous place!! Only 15 minutes from town, and I couldn’t ask for a better location. The place was sparkling clean, felt super roomy, and I loved the addition of the DVD player so I could rent movies at Blockbuster! I let Alex know I was going to watch the meteor shower one night, and he graciously left out a lounge chair for me. He went above and beyond! I would love to come back and stay. Thank you Alex & Tiffany!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is cozy and eclectic, full of nice touches from the hosts, and an all-around lovely place to stay! It's tucked away in the country while still providing easy access to downtown Bend. The hosts were accommodating, quick to respond, and friendly. I would absolutely recommend this spot!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most relaxing perfect bath ! Totally worth it, it was everything described and more! I would definitly stay again. Thanks Tiffany and Alex for your beautiful home."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Its a beautiful space with cute quirks. Nice country drive to town and real nice setting. I would totally stay again.
Thank you"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint country place not far from all the needs of town. Much more modern and comfy than the outside of the shop building would suggest. Lots of little touches, from snacks to aromatherapy. The clawfoot tub was dreamy, but a shower was missed. The lingers on the tiny TV room were comfy, except that the heat in the windowless, upstairs room was a bit stifling. Two portable fans helped though. Elsewhere the portable AC unit did the trick. The cows outside the window were good neighbors!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Tiffany’s place was great! Very fun location and just minutes from Bend! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had such a wonderful stay at Alex & Tiffany’s place! Would definitely stay here again.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Tiffany have the cutest airbnb! The clawfoot tub is perfect for bubble baths while looking out at the adorable cows nearby. The place was very clean and comfortable! The theater room was a great addition.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect way to get away and be Covid safe, especially with a nice bath tub and very sweet cattle in view. This was a stop over on a long drive and downtown Bend was a short drive away.
Alex and Tiffany are extremely prompt in responding and there were a lot
of nice little touches to the space."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Detail oriented, spotless, charming, and overall just so wonderful. A nice private place, beautiful, and has everything you thought you needed - and more! AC, a theater, comfortable bed, huge bathroom and wonderful bath, I don’t see any reason to stay anywhere else in Bend. Thank you so much Alex and Tiffany, we had a wonderful birthday get away. I think there were prairie dogs running all over the place, whatever they were, so flipping cute and funny! 😻"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, attractive and comfortable. The claw foot tub was really fun. The only downside is that it is a little tricky to wash your hair without a shower, but we knew it didn’t have a shower when we rented. A great value and great, quiet place to stay just outside of town."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in Bend! The place was clean and comfortable, we would absolutely stay here again."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect, all of the little touches you can clearly see Alex and Tiffany really went the extra step to make this little getaway feel like home."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a fantastic time! The space was the perfect size for the two of us (and since we're both about 5'5"", the movie room was, too!)
I really appreciated the french press, and the snacks Alex and Tiffany left for us. The bath salts were a really nice addition, as well.
Directions were clear, the hosts kept in communication with us before and during our stay, and the space was incredibly clean.
Thank you for a spectacular stay, Alex and Tiffany!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute loft space! The bathtub was to die for and the theater room was a nice touch. Both beds were comfy. I would totally stay here again!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bathtub sold me when booking this beautiful Airbnb, but when I got there I was so happy with the living room space, comfy bed and theater-esque entertainment space. Being quarantined here was much better than in Portland and we had way fewer neighbors. Thank you for having us!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place ! Everything was perfect and sparkling clean. Movie room is an awesome touch.
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, well done and thoughtful. A bit off the beaten path, but a great place to stay outside of town. They were very clear about some of the low ceilings, but it was still a bit of a challenge to adjust to."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany’s place is a perfect quiet getaway for a couple like us! It was clean, easy to find, roomy, and a lot of fun to stay at!

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing stayed here for a week while in Bend for work. Everything was spotless and exactly as listed. Hopefully I’ll be able to come back on vacation instead of work it’s beautiful!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany's place was just as described. It was cozy, quiet, and spotlessly clean. It was in a quiet country setting, yet only a 15 minute drive to downtown Bend. Communication was excellent. We arrived at 2am due to driving through a snow storm. Checkin was flawless and great communication from this hosts."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect place for a weekend stay for attending a wedding. Many thoughtful amenities. Lovely woodworking throughout. Highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Delightful stay! Quiet, cozy spot with all the sweet touches to make your stay relaxing and fun. Did I mention how cozy the space is!? Nice new carpet, soft blankets, clawfoot soaking tub and battery operated candles galore. Loved our stay here!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can tell that the host put a lot effort into the unit. We had a very relaxing time in Bend.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful space and Alex and Tiffany were so helpful. Definitely will return.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed the stay, very well kept and clean. Great town"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, really clean and well kept :)"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Slept like a baby! The bed and pillows were super comfy and the cool breeze blowing in was so nice. Such a cute place and plenty of room for three. The hob bath before bed was such a treat as were the bath salts provided! Thanks Alex and Tiffany!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at this sweet spot on the outskirts of Bend. We loved that it has a quiet, country feel but we could also hop into the city quickly. One of our favorite parts was the dreamy bathtub, where you could relax and wind down with a countryside view. We appreciated the extra space with the additional couch/bed and TV room. This place is perfect for a couples getaway!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was amazing I love that area I used work on a farm over there too
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little hidden gem was comfortable and quirky. Very clean, and the bathroom with the claw foot tub was adorable. I guess one wouldn't want to be too tall to stay here as there is an approximate 6 foot ceiling in the tv room. But you realize it as soon as you enter so no big deal. The apt. was immaculately clean and lots of welcoming snacks, breakfast oatmeal, and coffee. The cows outside the window were so cute. This is a great place to stay if you want to be out of town, but not too far out. Dark star lit skies at night. WE would definitely stay here again when we are in the Bend area. Directions were on spot, and the place rocked. Thanks again Tiffany and Alex. Comfy quarters indeed."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing. Clean, with nice touches, the bathtub and cows were our favorite. It was just close enough to town and a perfect place to relax. We will definitely try to be back!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex and Tiffany offer a unique and fantastic place to stay while visiting Bend. It’s cliche but the pictures do not do it justice. The main bedroom is so comfortable, the living room is peaceful, the media room is a great touch for some down time and the bathroom could be featured in a magazine. The space is also very private and only about 10 minutes from downtown Bend. The cows were very welcoming too! It is a great option for a couple or a small family."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway! I had the most relaxing time during my work trip. The views from the claw foot tub was the highlight of my trip.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I wish I could put 20 stars on value because this is one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in and one of the best prices! Don’t pass up a chance to stay here if you’re on the area. Excellent host and excellent place.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alex and Tiffany were so easy to communicate with and made the entire experience so comfortable. I reached out to them just a few hours before I was hoping to stay there, and it felt as if they’d been waiting for me to call! Very comfortable, very clean, very quiet. It’s also nice to spend a little time chatting with the cows on property and watching a sunset...before retiring to the theater room and those awesomely comfy chairs. I’ll definitely stop back in next time I’m in Bend."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend for anyone coming from the busy city life. It was an excellent stay and a much needed time away from the noise and clutter of city life. Host’s were extremely thoughtful, and set the bar very high for my next AirBnB experience."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quite an unusual layout but everything is wonderful inside. The bathtub is heavenly, the setting is peaceful and it's actually not far from Bend. This place worked very well for us. We'd like to come back!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Short distance into downtown Bend, yet out on the quiet countryside.
Alex and Tiffany were great. It was a last minute booking, and they were super quick to respond and confirm the reservation.
It is a fabulous space. Great for a getaway weekend. Has all the amenities. Place is brand new, and well decorated.
I would highly recommend staying here when exploring Bend"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don't always say this about the places I stay, but... This place was LOVELY! You can tell that it is lovingly maintained by Alex and Tiffany. The space is clean, and the raw wood accents make the whole space incredibly charming. We loved the clawfoot bathtub and the theater is a nice bonus too! Everything is tidy and new and comfortable. It's a short drive out of Bend, but that means the space is incredibly peaceful and calm. It was so picturesque - we woke up to roosters crowing in the morning! The only small warning I have is that this is NOT accessible if you can't climb stairs - the entryway leads directly to a small flight of about 10 stairs."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First of all - what an amazing place! About 15 minutes outside of Bend, in a quiet area surrounded by amazing views and wildlife. The house/barn was amazing, with a comfortable bed, tv area, and bathroom. You WILL NOT be disappointed staying here!
The hosts were great communicators and respectful. Overall, a 10/10 experience for my partner and I."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space is beautiful! It’s modern yet rustic- not sure how these two pulled that off! The peace and quiet on the property was so wonderful each night after our busy days running around to see all that Bend has to offer. The space is about 10-20 minutes away from everything you need in town and Tiffany and Alex are both such amazing hosts. Can’t wait to go back soon!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay! Loved the garden area and the hot tub was awesome. They even left a empty growler so that we could pick up local beer if we wanted which I thought was a nice touch! The Airbnb is very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As fellow hosts with multiple properties we find ourselves judgey every time we stay somewhere. We have stayed all over the country and in Mexico.
Our stay in Bend was so incredibly spot on. From the precise description of the space to the communications we had with Alex to the well thought out and intentional furnishing of the property. We walked away humbled as hosts and will certainly be ‘borrowing’ some of their ideas for our own properties. Truly a gem of a property and can’t recommend any higher."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay — hosts are communicative and attentive, even though we didn’t need anything.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special place!
I actually live in Bend and booked the enchanted dwelling for an anniversary get away for my bf, visiting from out of town.
Quirky decor, excellent local recommendations and a magical intentional experience in each room. The garden is beautiful & we enjoyed it even in the chilly weather. The hot tub was a nice amenity and offered a stunning view of the stars in the evening after a long day of hiking. Alex offered his attendance as needed, such an easygoing and attentive to messaging, though we didn’t need to contact him much during our stay because it was so fantastic. An affordable option here in Bend, at an excellent value! Something that’s not easy to find anymore… definitely recommending to friends and family when they come to visit!"

We were close to the Bend restaurants, Deschutes Nat. Forest and museums. It was a great stay, we really appreciated it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful! Love the location of this spot, only 5-10 mins away from downtown and yet off the main roads. Super quiet neighborhood with lots of wildlife. We really enjoyed watching the sunrise from the hot tub on a cold winter morning — what a treat!
This welcoming space was very clean and well labeled. It’s a super cute “cabin in the woods” studio/loft vibes with a great desk. We remote worked here — the wifi was great and stable. The main bed was very comfortable, and the kitchenette worked great for our short stay.
A few comments: The walk-in shower is a bit small, with a very tall non-adjustable shower head — fyi to my short folk out there who don’t want to get their hair wet. Reminder - the layout is a bit funky, you have to walk through the bathroom to get to the bedroom.
Overall, my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and look forward to staying here again!"

The area, the scenery, the decor, this place was beautiful and had everything you could need. Our room had a kitchenette, access to a hot tub and laundry. It’s a place for a quieter stay, as to be mindful of others next door, but we prefer that anyways. If you’re looking for a unique, cute and retro place to stay, this is definitely it. It’s right in the center of Bend too, so nothing is more than 5-10 minutes away. 10/10 Would stay again!"

Alex was super responsive from the day we booked through check-out, and even accommodated a slightly early check-in.

The home itself was beautifully furnished with all the home comforts you could need. We especially loved the balcony in the evening along with the hot tub to unwind. The large bathroom was another great asset again beautifully decorated.
You are able to walk into the centre of Bend easily, which makes for lovely evening meals and drinks. The walk along the river is especially nice.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I came here for a weekend getaway. It was perfect! We walked downtown and spent time relaxing in the space. Although it says the walls are not soundproof. We rarely heard any noise.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Eric was a wonderful host! The place is decorated with a sweet thoughtfulness. The handmade wood touches were gorgeous!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and clean upon arrival. Great location, only a 15 minute walk to downtown Bend. Host always responded quickly."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described....that being said the bed was very very small and uncomfortable. I would not recommend this particular dwelling for more than one person as sleeping two in that bed was really hard. The room was very stuffy and quiet and the windows didn't have screens so it was hard to leave them open at night. They were very kind and it's a nice place, just really did not work for us, and getting two poor nights of sleep makes it hard to leave a fabulous review."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in the garden apartment. It was very cozy and suited our needs perfectly. Even though there were a lot of listed rules, they were all fairly commonsense. The hot tub was wonderful, as were the other amenities. The walls are thin, so hope for good neighbors. Looking forward to coming back on our next trip to Bend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at the Garden Apartment— availability popped up last minute for a weekend, and I was able to reserve within a few days’ notice at a discounted rate. Bend was snowy and cold, so making use of the hot tub a couple times during the visit was truly a treat. Host is always quick to respond and I have felt warmly welcome each time I’ve reserved with Enchanted Dwellings. The space is cozy (the luxurious bathroom is a star feature!) with the help of the easy-to-use gas fireplace. The induction hot plate + toaster were helpful in reducing dining out costs as well. 10/10 experience and will definitely stay for a third time in the future!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming little apartment in a GREAT location to enjoy and explore Bend! We stayed for our two year anniversary and it was the perfect place to cozy up at night and explore Bend during the day. It was a quick 15min walk into town, or to other food areas on the west side of the river. The space was uniquely decorated and designed, and just had a homey feel that makes you never want to leave. Between the cozy loft, retro appliances, hot tub, claw foot bathtub, and charming fireplace… it was perfect. The Garden Apt was right by the hot tub, so it was super convenient, although since it is a shared hot tub, be aware that other guests will be using it and it is right next to the living room window of this unit. We didn’t have an issue, with guests being disturbing- just be sure to close the privacy blind on the inside otherwise it’s a direct view into the apartment from the tub. We ate out mostly so I can’t speak for the kitchen, but it had one hot plate and a ton of utensils (including salt, pepper, hot sauce and oil). It also had a kettle and French press and some coffee grounds. Would 100% stay again!!"

I brought my mom to Bend for a two night stay and she loved the claw foot tub inside and hot tub outside on the deck. I had fun cooking in the small (but well stocked!) kitchen, if you have a simple meal in mind the single burner is not a problem at all. I made delicious veggie tacos easily! Very cozy and well coordinated space. Best suited for couples or intimate friends due to the fact that you have to go through the bathroom to get to the bedroom. Would definitely consider staying here again. Thank you!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great and accurately describes what the place provides. I've stayed in this sectional house before and it's amazing (especially with the hot tub). The host is an amazing communicator and makes sure you feel right at home.
If I was critical about one thing, it'd be the bed. It's a little small for two and the pillows were a bit flat but that's being nit-picky.
You can't go wrong with this place when you're in Bend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly wonderful! Just like the last time I stayed!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a jewel of an apartment!
A small space, but with so many distinct, special, spaces —that it feels palatial.
From the cozy bedroom filled with natural light, to the cozy living room, spacious work desk with a lovely view, the cute kitchen, the luxurious bathroom, delightful loft sitting room and balcony, every area has its own distinct feeling, tied together with a theme, and sense of beauty, grace and fun.
The information, instructions, and suggestions are so detailed and anticipate every need and every eventuality.
I cannot describe what a wonderful oasis of peace beauty this is and how effortless the host makes everything.
The host is thoughtful, welcoming and responsive. I was so touched by my welcome and the thoughtfulness of the host. Though honestly, the apartment is so well equipped—I really cannot imagine needing anything.
Once you stay here you will look for excuses to come back as often as possible!"

Parking was easy and kitchenette was nicely stocked with coffee and important gadgets. I would stay here again anytime!"

The yard was PERFECT for our doggo, he enjoyed the open space with a tall fence too! (our boy is a big boy so we felt secure knowing he couldn't jump it!) We would love to book here again soon!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Keri's place was a great base camp for our trip to Bend. We especially loved the quiet location near the river greenbelt. We wanted to give the cabin a 5-star review but one of us has back issues that were made worse by the style of furniture and mattresses in this cabin. If sitting in recliners, futons with zero back support, or on very soft or drooping mattresses are a challenge... be aware the cabin is absolutely lovely but it might be a challenge to get comfortable. If these things aren't an issue for you... we highly recommend this spot along the river!"

Easy! Keri was also on site at our arrival and extended a warm greeting and shared our excitement about a great day of skiing! it was such a nice way to begin our stay!
We loved the cabin! It was architecturally interesting and a great place to cook and share meals, do art and hang out. The dog was happy with her easy-access backyard.
Both humans and our pup loved being able to walk out the back gate and cross the street to the Deschutes River Trail! We saw buffleheads, Canadian geese and hooded mergansers on our walk along the river and soaked up the beauty of the Ponderosas and the smell of the Junipers. We hope to stay here again!"

Heads up to those that travel in groups that this home doesn’t have much bathroom privacy. There are sliding door, but they’re pretty much curtains. This wasn’t an issue at all for me and my partner, but I think it’s worth pointing out just in case."

The proximity to the Deschutes River for a stroll to the Old Mil for morning coffee or a walk to the south is the highlight of the location.
Highly recommended and would happily stay here again."

Exceptionally clean, very well equipped kitchen space with everything needed, comfortable beds, wonderful stone shower, and love the glass roll up garage door. The location is fantastic, we walked the short distance to Old Mill shops, restaurants and breweries, and the park along the River is just out the back door. Keri was very responsive and I would absolutely rent this cabin again next time we go to Bend. Thanks Keri!"

,,,"Brooks and Katie were incredible hosts. This was our first time staying in an Airbnb and they set the bar high. We were on a road trip before our first baby arrives, stopping in towns that caught our attention. Brooks and Katie were welcoming and warm. They suggested a fun brewery/observatory with a Beatles cover band playing and we had so much fun that night. We also ate at Katie’s favorite breakfast spot and had such a fulfilling meal. The room was so bright and cheerful, beautifully decorated. It far surpassed a stay at a generic hotel. They were so helpful about finding things in the area and easy to talk with. Hopefully one day we’ll make the trip again as a family of three and get to stay in this cute studio again."
