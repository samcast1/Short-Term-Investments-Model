2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is very clean and nicely decorated. Although the kitchenette is small, it was adequate. The pool area is lovely."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I liked staying there. If I ever go back to Redding I would stay there again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice and clean. Darlene was attentive to us. The area where the house is located is very quiet and safe.
The only thing that was a little uncomfortable is that one of the smoke detectors was not working well and her husband had to go three times to check it."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was very comfortable and the place felt clean. We really enjoyed the outdoor patio space. However, the couch bed was not as comfortable as we had hoped, but we understand that it's a couch bed, so we weren't surprised. We were thankful that it was there though! The toilet was a bit tricky and clogged easily, but there were clear instructions provided for how to manage it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A quiet cozy spot with friendly hospitality!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic hosts!They were incredibly kind, patient, and responsive. The place is beautiful!Adding a few toiletries would enhance the experience, but it was still a lovely stay.Thank you for your wonderful hospitality! Beautiful place and excellent location!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptionally communication and such kind, helpful people - lovely unit and great location - I’m so grateful I stayed here and would love to stay longer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This unit was lovely and exactly what I was looking for. I was a little shocked by the long list of specific rules that came after I booked, it would have been good to understand the amenity limitations beforehand (there are rules around backyard usage - only a small portion is regularly available; there is only a washer - initially the rules said we had to pay by load, but Darlene waved the fee; because we stayed over a week there was a mandatory weekly cleaning fee for someone to come in and change the linens and do a light cleaning of the unit.) these rules are fine, but it would have been better to know before booking. In entirety our stay ended up amazing and felt like home. The space was lovely for my daughter myself and our dogs. We only went to the laundromat once, and otherwise there was a clothes rack outside that I used outside to dry the clothes when the rain wasn’t pouring. The toaster oven in the kitchen was perfect for anything we would have used an oven for."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,"We had a good time at Darlene's place!
The apartment is in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Opening the door with a code works perfectly.
Communication with Darlene went very smoothly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Darlene was an amazing host. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place look forward to coming back
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice experience
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were there for 5 nights The place was tip-top, everything clean, very well furnished."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has the 3 Cs: Comfortable, Clean and a host that’s a good Communicator. Would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darlene's place is worth your price in every way.
Communication worked wonderfully - clear instructions and very quick response to questions.
For a stay in Redding and its surroundings - for example to visit the nearby natural parks in Lassen or Shasta Mountain- Darlene's apartment is an ideal location.
Also the residential area is very and beautiful. The car is safe and there is this separate entrance to the apartment - very pleasant.
Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to use the patio and pool.
We'll be happy to come back.
Ralf"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very convenient location for visiting Bethel Church. Very clean, well-organized and well-stocked. The property is beautiful. The instructions for where to park and find the entrance were very clear and helpful. Appreciated all of the thorough instructions. The bathroom had a door to the bedroom and another door to the living room which was actually a big plus for us since we were traveling with our toddler. While we didn’t use the pool, I definitely appreciated that it was an option. The only drawback was that the AC unit was in the living room so the bedroom door had to be open if we wanted to stay cool. Overall, would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean place, and we felt like home!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"All in all it was a great experience Darlene is a great host, peaceful quiet neighborhood, close to scenery, 1.5 hours away from Lassen National park and close to Shasta Dam/lake as well. The place is cozy for a family of 5 with 3 teenage kids. The kitchen was fully stacked and counter space was limited but manageable. The pool is shared with the hosts and request can be made to access after 5 pm when it cools down a bit in summers."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Darlene was a great host. She communicated well. The apartment was very clean and well equipped. We had access to the pool. The yard was large and fenced in and great for our dog. it is located well to central Redding. The parking was great and we had easy access to the apartment. Very private, quiet and relaxing. I'm looking forwarding to returning in the future."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The property is clean, very quiet, good air conditioning. The pool is a nice feature in hot weather. The host is friendly and very responsive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt very comfortable in Darlene’s well equipped apartment. She put a lot of thought in providing wonderful place to stay.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place! Host was nice to allow extended pool hours for my family.
The only downside, and full disclaimer this was my oversight: I didn’t realize that the property was attached to their main house.
Being that we had a child and dog I felt nervous that we would be too loud or intrusive of their space. This wasn’t anything the that was the fault of the host, we are just always concerned that our family (a loud Italian family) will be too loud.
The photos gave me the impression the pool was directly outside of our outdoor access area, and in fact it was directly in front of their main house. The host did a great job throw of pulling down some screens to provide some privacy while we were out in the pool area. As mentioned before, this was a complete oversight on my end, as I did not realize that it was attached to their main house.
Aside my own insecurity and fear of being too loud, we had a wonderful stay. It was peaceful, quiet, and such a beautiful property. Thank you so much for opening up your home to us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean cozy place for a quick get away!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very private, quiet, and clean. Had to adjust dates a couple times while booking, and host was very accomodating. Messages from host were a little excessive for me, though others may appreciate that level of communication. I have not stayed in another airbnb where there was a list of housekeeping tasks for me to complete prior to checkout. Also, host seemed anxious for me to leave early on day of checkout, which was a bit offputting. The accommodations were exactly as described and comfortable, but I did not feel like I could completely relax."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we definitely would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darlene's Place is a peaceful haven on the edge of town, easy access to highways and main thoroughfares but tucked into a quiet neighborhood. The patio was perfect for morning coffee, the kitchen was well-stocked with many thoughtful touches, the apartment comfortable and pleasant. The hosts were friendly and responsive and left a very complete orientation manual with suggestions for things to see and do. I enjoyed my stay and hope to come back soon!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was my first experience with air bnb. Darlene set a standard that will be difficult for any other bnb to keep up with.
Clean, private and close to town while still feeling country like.
Thank you darlene for a wonderful experience."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet peaceful neighbourhood. Close to Bethel Church.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a great location to explore the area. We did some good hikes at Whiskeytown Reservoir and Lake Shasta. I walked and ran at the park around Lema Ranch most days. The backyard was beautiful and relaxing looking out at deer and a mature oak forest. It was really peaceful. The kitchen was functional and we prepared some great food.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful location-quiet. Everything needed was there. Comfortable bed.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were very clean and accessible. Our host showed great communication. Would definitely recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay are Darlene's was simply amazing. Complete attention to detail and the needs of the guest. The location was quiet and safe and in a really great neighborhood and was only 4 miles from my work for the weekend. Thanks you so much.
Jim Thibodeau"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Darlene's place was in a great location, and dog friendly!! Had a great stay, will go back again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This 1-bedroom self-contained apartment was very clean and peaceful. The kitchen had all the amenities, including basic condiments. It had its own outdoor patio space with furniture where we enjoyed the sunshine. A swimming pool was available on the other side of the patio wall. The location was very close to I-5. The check-in and check-out procedures were simple. Communication with Darlene was easy. Highly recommend this place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,place is nice and location is nice and quiet.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and comfortable one bedroom apartment in the ‘suburbs’ of Redding. We loved the private patio and daytime access to the host’s pool. About a 10 minute drive to downtown Redding, where we learned about Redding history using a well-designed app from the Shasta Historical Society."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,private apartment attached to the main house. safe neighborhood and about 10 min from downtown. about 30 minutes to whiskey town and just over an hour to Burney fallsa
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, near bethel church"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and easy access
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here!! Darlene was amazing to work with, she quickly got back to all our messages and really went above and beyond to make our stay great. Would definitely book with them again!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I keep coming back!! It is clean, comfortable, and consistently predictable. The host Darlene, is always responsive and helpful. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed our stay! The host kindly allowed us extra pool time, which we greatly appreciated! It’s an hour drive to Lassen (easy non windy roads), so a nice spot for adventuring. It does not have a stove, but does have an induction burner that works surprisingly well for making eggs or quesadillas."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, comfortable and clean. Enjoyed sitting by the pool on a hot afternoon."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Darlene’s places is very clean and quiet. He had a great time visiting our kids and friends. Looking forward to staying there again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darlene was wonderfully communicative during our stay, and was kind enough to extend it when our travel plans changed. Her home is beautiful and has everything you need to be comfortable. We will be returning when we’re back in the area!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Darlenes place is truly peaceful and a good place to rest. The living room seemed a bit crowded with huge chairs, especially after the fold out couch was opened. There is no actual stove, but a plug in one in one of the drawers. there are a lot of rules and warnings posted and that felt harsh since we never met the host and had paid a cleaning fee."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quiet. Nice place to stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clear directions. Nice space. Clean and inviting. We had a great stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were more than impressed with our stay. I was hesitant when booking because there seemed to be a bit more check-in instructions than usual (maybe it was just airbnb updating and not the host), but we had one of our best stays ever. The apartment is fully stocked with really nice cookware and appliances. We were able to make full meals there. Usually an airbnb will have thrift store finds for their kitchen (I’m a thrifter as well, so no hate here), but this kitchen was stocked with beautiful, quality cookware, utensils, and appliances. It made it really fun. Everything about this little place is well thought out and truly cared for. We commented again and again that the shower was the cleanest and nicest shower we’d every taken :) There is a beautiful outdoor area that the family pets will frequent occasionally, which makes it even better. This is a subdivision we took many walks in and it’s a beautiful, safe area. I can’t say enough good things about this space and we would definitely recommend it. There were two of us and it was perfect."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darlene was a great communicator - very speedy replies. The unit is darling, in a good neighborhood, very nicely decorated. Everything was as described in the listing."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is place is in great location. Extremely clean and tidy. Very cute and highly recommend. All the amenities were great and just a peaceful calm environment.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The place is very nice and cozy. Darlene is good with communication. I would recommend the place overall, there were no problems at all. I missed the pet fee, which I thought was expensive (more expensive than hotel fees), then it was too late to cancel when I was charged - but fair game, it was there and I didn’t see it, and the Airbnb doesn’t charge automatically when you’re booking. The place is really nice but be aware that there are a lot of rules (even though there’s a cleaning fee, you have to clean all dishes, return everything to specific places and remove all sheets and put them in a specific spot) - we felt a bit overwhelmed and didn’t feel super relaxed because we didn’t want to break any rules. But I don’t want to be unfair, it’s totally a nice place to stay, just gotta be aware that it’s a bit of work."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great communication, easy check in, great location. we we were really happy with our stay. highly recommended!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! Everything was exactly as it was advertised! It was clean, quaint and in a great and quiet location."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Darlene had everything we needed to cook dinner for 4 people. We utilized the large electric skillet and crock pot. It was nice to have a medium sized refrigerator/freezer and kitchen sink as well. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It was nice to have a private outdoor space to sit in right off the dining/kitchen area. It was a perfect set up for a couple. It probably would be a little too tight for 4 adults. Darlene was a great communicator and very accomodating. The neighborhood is nice and Trader Joe's is nearby.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, updated place to stay while in Redding. It's just outside of town but still close enough that it's easy to get anywhere you want to go. We liked the how it was more updated with high ceilings and in a quiet neighborhood. We had our dog with us and there was plenty of space for him inside and to go to the bathroom outside. If you're planning to have someone sleep on the pull-out couch be aware that the outdoor AC unit occasionally rattles the wall when it's running and that might get annoying overnight."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice location in Redding, a quiet neighborhood but still close enough to grocery stores and other businesses. My main issue was that I did not read the House Rules before booking, and did not realize there would be an extra $75 pet fee, which I thought was a bit high. So, dog owners, just be aware that this is the case, and that there are a lot of rules regarding pets, as well as very detailed check out procedures.

But the apartment was clean, had a basic kitchen for cooking, a nice comfy bed, and only a little bit of noise from the attached house, but not much. Overall, an enjoyable stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stay here as often as possible when we are in Redding . Consistently clean, comfortable bed, great shower and very accommodating hosts. We usually do not need all the provisions for cooking, but they have just about every appliance (instead of oven and stove) for guests to prepare meals and be quite comfortable. Over the top on value."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice little spot to stay. It is conveniently located in a really nice neighborhood. After we snooped around a bit, we were able to find everything we needed during our stay. We hope to stay here again the next time we're in the area."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darlene and Ove’s Air BnB was amazing. The location was perfect and was exactly what we were looking for in a home away from home. The guest house was clean and stocked with everything we needed. We were able to enjoy downtown Redding and also ventured out to McCloud Falls and Mt. Shasta, which was a very easy drive (not to mention beautiful). The guest house was very accessible and quiet. Thanks again Darlene and Ove for a great place to stay!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This private apartment is beautiful and peaceful. The location is convenient, and in a very nice neighborhood. The queen size and is very comfortable. We found nothing lacking. 5 stars all the way."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay while visiting Redding.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place….very comfy
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The space was quiet and cozy, perfect for a short stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,A nice and quiet neighborhood to walk around and run in - beautiful mountain scenery. Convenient to other places in town.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I call this place small but mighty. It has little touches that make it great. Like a nightlight in the drawer for those middle of the night restroom trips… and a wonderful hair dryer. The shower was amazing water pressure and for actually tall enough for me, which is rare. Also super comfy mattress. Highly recommend!! 👍🏻"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Clean and quiet; easy access to everything.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place to stay. Close to food and stores
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a small but beautiful quite place to stay while we visited with our kids and finished some projects on our rentals a few of blocks away. Looking forward to staying here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s really a cute place for just a couple. Very quiet. Pet friendly, but just make sure you let owners know you have pets."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, really clean, quiet and very private. Darlene was great about recommending places to eat in the area. Can't wait to book again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You couldn't ask for a better place or a better host. Easy check in and out. The house is immaculate and fully upgraded. I can't say enough about this place. I will definitely be staying again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A great place to stay while visiting Redding! Clean, comfortable and in a great location. I’d highly recommend and I would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very convenient location in a private neighborhood. Lots of lovely little extra touches. The space is comfortable and well appointed
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Easy entry with a door code. The apartment is compact, but has all that is needed. The kitchen is well equipped. Thick fluffy bathroom towels. Ceiling fans in both rooms helped keep us cool along with the air conditioning. Enjoyed relaxing and cooling off at the pool. Hosts were gracious and responsive. Easy drive to near by attractions."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a lovely space. The room was comfortable and my kids loved playing in the pool.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was so smooth. Our drive down took longer than expected due to the fires in the area and traffic conditions. Darlene tried to stay awake for us to make sure we got in okay. She also gave us an air purifier to use so the air was smoke free while we stayed indoors. The pool water was too warm during the day because it was just too hot outside to keep it cool I am sure. The apartment was cool and cozy and it felt more like I was visiting family. I never heard much noise from the main house at all. It was also very well stocked with everything you would need to make meals and tidy up. Darlene even provided beach towels for the pool (which I didn't need) but it was nice. Everything was really clean. I will say I originally booked it for 4 people and I am glad two people dropped out because it would not have been comfortable for all of us. It might be good for a couple (to share the bedroom) and two children on the sofa bed (or one adult). It was prefect for me and my teenage daughter and our puppy. It was a really nice getaway!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We have stayed here often. Darlene and Ove's guest apartment never disappoints! Great host's, great accommodations."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, clean, great value, has all of the basic modern amenities. We were there during extremely hot temperatures (>100 °F) but the AC and a dip in the pool sure helped our comfort level! Location is great with Lassen NP, MacArthur-Burney Falls just about an hour away. Very peaceful and quiet to sit outside on the porch in the evening."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space is such a cute and quaint Airbnb. It is not super big - it worked well for my toddler, husband, and myself - but definitely has everything you might need for your stay! It might feel a little cramped if you have more than 2-3 adults, though.
Easy access, good location, and very clean, we felt right at home and comfortable for our weekend away. I would definitely recommend this space and encourage anyone who is visiting Redding to check it out!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Anytime we're in Redding we will always try and stay here!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great neighborhood! My girlfriend and I stayed here for a month while working remotely and it was a great location. Close to Lassen and Shasta.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using AirBnB and We enjoyed our stay very much at Darlene’s place. Everything was clean, easily accessible, and comfortable."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Place was clean and nice.
Quiet ,and also great neighborhood 🙏🏾"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A clean and neat property.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and Darlene was very helpful would definitely stay again 5 stars
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in a very convenient location! The hosts were very attentive and responsive, and they made sure we had everything that we needed. The rooms themselves were very clean; not too big, but very well equipped: we enjoyed having evening BBQs and watching shows on the TV! I can definitely recommend Darlene's place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Redding."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Planning my next visit to Hope Lane apartment! Nicely appointed, clean and comfortable, and quiet! Big bonus for nicer weather is a large private patio with table/umbrella, chairs, and BBQ looking onto ""open space"". Darlene is a SUPER host - responsive and clear communication from reservation to check out! We'll be back! Thank you!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay. We were visiting family so this was the place we picked to crash at night. Was very nice. And adorable little place. Would stay again!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely 2 night stay in this little apartment. Quiet neighborhood, plenty of hot water and a well equipped kitchen made for a cozy stay. We would return if the situation presented itself!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and comfortable. We most definitely will be back. Darlene is a great host. Bed is the best!!!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Darlene's place was very nice. Perfect for what I needed. I will say that, although she mentions there is some noise carryover from the main house in her description, there was more than I expected. It didn't go too late or anything so wasn't a big problem but if you're needing a very quiet place to stay then somewhere else might be better. The bed and pillows are SO comfy, though! The place was clean and roomy."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In a subdivision with large lots. Very quiet and peaceful. Backyard has view of grass and pretty oak trees. Kitchen is a little tight, and uses induction hotplates, no range."
2021-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, easy check in & very clean."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, super easy parking and entry, stylish, high end, clean, attractive. Bed was very comfy. Kitchen amenities included pretty much everything you could imagine and super nice to find small things like chip clips, ziploc bags, foil, little single serve creamer in the fridge, flash lights. Would stay again."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is our 5th stay at this Airbnb. We have never been disappointed! Bed and shower are our favorite. Great communication. Perfect for the 2 of us and considered our basecamp while visiting family and recreating in the area.
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant area, quiet space."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darlene’s place is perfect. We stayed 5 nights with our two-year old and our dog.
The house is well-equipped, clean, secure and very comfortable.
The internet/WiFi is good too - I worked remotely during the week and had no issues with connectivity or latency.
We enjoyed walking the neighborhood and discovering the trails to the “wilderness” beyond.
It’s a nice place to stay if you want a quiet break with family!
Thanks, Darlene & Ove!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very hospitable, clean and easy check-in process. Only 1 hour away from Burney falls and Mccloud falls"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and very well maintained place in nice neighborhood.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it,comes with great little kitchen and the backyard is awesome and even has a privacy wall to exclude and make you feel at home.I can’t wait to come back and I loved the neighborhood it was in."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, well supplied, comfortable bed and overall, relaxing accommodation. We have stayed here several times and have never been disappointed. The host is exceptionally responsive and will reach out to ensure your needs are being met!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Darlene was always very responsive. The place provided ample space for me to ""work from home""; internet was absolutely sufficient for my purposes. The outside table and chairs were a welcome addition to my morning breakfast and afternoon breaks, air conditioning in the living room worked very well (not noisy at all), bed and bathroom definitely large enough for one person (I traveled solo, but could imagine 2 people easily for leisure trips). Ample storage space in bedroom and bathroom."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay here in Redding!The binder was very helpful when looking for fun local activities! Very clean & easy access to all Redding has to offer. We would definitely stay here again!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a special little spot! Darlene is a really thoughtful host. 100% would recommend!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow. This place was amazing. Darlene was so responsive and communicative the whole way through and even offered helpful suggestions through Covid time. We were a group of four traveling together and felt the space was perfectly sized was us. The kitchen was superbly stocked for it being so small. We were able to cook all our meals just fine. The use of the pool was incredible and she was so accommodating! We felt like it was a private space. Would absolutely recommend to anyone and I would love to come back! Thanks Darlene!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice space, everything was tucked away nicely. Beautiful nature trail at the end of the road. We would stay again next time we are in the area."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The guest apartment was well equipped but extremely small, specially the kitchen area which is a bit claustrophobic. The pool is great, but can be used only between 10:00am to 5:00pm, unless the home owners are out of the house."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The posted photos really don't do justice to how nice this place is. We found it supremely clean and tidy. Extraordinarily well stocked kitchen (utensils, equipment, etc.). The bed will especially please those who like a plush mattress. Highly recommend exploring the footpaths in the natural area just a block up the street (we were thrilled to spot a giant jackrabbit there)."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to relax and swim.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the quiet, convenient location of this apartment. Darlene was thoughtful and rearranged furniture to accommodate our portable crib before our arrival. The apartment is very well- appointed, but felt a bit crowded with all the furniture and gadgets. Having access to the pool during designated hours was so nice-- especially with our kiddos. The apartment stayed nice and cool somehow even when the A/C was turned off, which was great. The bed initially seemed too soft but we slept great on it! We would definitely return."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a cute place! For a smaller space, it packs some punches. Super tidy, great use of space, private and quiet, and not far from town. There were 3 of us (adults) so we used the sofa bed. Not a lot of places to stash the sofa accent pillows but we were creative. Darlene was very quick in her responses and accommodating when we had some special requests. The pool was wonderful-my husband and daughter even got on the slide! Easy check-out and great value (better than hotel) means we'll be coming back again and recommending this apartment to our friends."
2020-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This place is cramped and only good for 2 people max. Space is very limited and amenities like the TV, stove, etc are stored away in the closet and need to be removed and put back in order to be used. We were constantly jumping over our luggage and re-arranging furniture in order to make it work. For example, pulling out the sofa bed required pushing all the furniture towards the dining room and kitchen making the whole space unusable."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed here several times. The quality, cleanliness, value and consistent hospitality make this rental outstanding."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Perfect get away

2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good location if you are planning to visit Burney Falls and Lassen Volcanic national park. My kids had fun in the backyard and in the swimming pool. With 4 adults, you might feel congested (we were 6, 4 Adults and 2 Kids (5 and 2)). It would be nice if Airbnb has an option for hosts to tell sq. ft area for the location. Overall we liked our stay."

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! This space was perfect for our week long stay. Clean, nicely decorated, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, great location. It is in a quiet neighborhood but has easy access to HWY 299."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little hideaway! The unit was perfect for my needs. Close to Bethel for anyone who wants to visit the church. Their unit was clean and stylish, just as described. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you."
2018-07-01,2,Stayed one night,"We booked this rental for a one-night stay during a family vacation up the Pacific Northwest. Visually, we felt the place looked sound. We had a rather late check-in, and upon arrival inspected the “welcome” binder containing the house rules and instructions. Immediately we felt bombarded with anxiety over what we found to be, strict check-out instructions.
We are familiar with hosts asking guests to wash dishes, strip beddings, and take out their trash, however we’ve only experienced hosts asking this after explicitly mentioning they ask this of their guests to keep their cleaning fees lower. However, based on having paid a $45 cleaning fee, amounting to nearly half the cost of the rental, we were shocked at the specificity of some of the requests i.e., using HOT (bold and italicized) water to clean dishes and cutlery (not sure how you’d be able to tell when cold or lukewarm water has been used), to place the hamper provided, which is in the bedroom closet, in front of the kitchen door (not sure of why hamper placement has been an issue to warrant such a specific location), and to place pillows and blankets “back in place”. Failure to do the mentioned tasks, as well as the normal “wash dishes, strip beddings, and take your trash out” incurs an additional $40 fee. The threat of an additional charge, in addition to the asked $45 cleaning fee seems to us to be absurd, especially for guests that are staying one night.
To be sure we were not being too dramatic over our shock of being asked to do additional tasks we were not used to, with the $45 cleaning fee we read ALL reviews. Only two other people make mention of the rules but we acknowledge none to this extreme. One reviewer calling it “strange” to be asked to do such things. We also noticed one reviewer mentioned having to vacuum excess crumbs, but that seems to have been revised in the “welcome” binder. We just want to inform everyone, that could also been in the same situation we were in."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful place to stay. Close driving to downtown but remote enough for privacy and peaceful seclusion. Great host and good communication. We recommend this Airbnb as one of our favorites!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything in this guest suite was perfect for us! My son was attending a 2 week music course at Bethel Church. The location was perfect and only a few minutes away! I took advantage of all the local recommendations that were in the notebook that Ove and Darlene prepared. I visited all 4 coffee shops and loved them all. Whiskeytown, Burney Falls and Lassen National Park were also great day trips. The suite was very private but Ove and Darlene were always available if we had questions. It was very clean and up to date. I walked in the neighborhood every night. It is safe and the neighbors are friendly. The mountain views are beautiful! We will definitely stay here again if we come back!"
2018-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location to area stores and restaurants in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Clean, cozy place."

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a wonderfully peaceful place. It is so quiet and clean. Ove and Darlene have great taste. It felt like a small version of HOME. If we are ever in Redding again I would not want to stay anywhere else.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very last minute booking and arrived in the wee hours of the night. They were very accommodating of our late arrival and even sent us very detailed directions in case we had any trouble. We found a small and extremely immaculate apartment that perfectly fit our needs. They have a binder set up with instructions for everything you might need and everything in the apartment is set up to accommodate every need. Because we arrived late, I very much appreciated the super plush bed and didn't have any trouble sleeping, which I usually do when it's that late! Thanks for a great stay, we would definitely stay here again."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Redding! Highly recommend.

2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ove and Darlene’s place is in a new development, very quiet, newly seeded yard.
The bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows and comfortable blankets.
Full sized fridge and microwave with single burner hot plate and toaster oven. Also egg cooker with several options.
The apt is next to their home, though they were gone, their daughter was available to help with questions. We will definitely look up their place the next time we are in Redding."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a trendy little space. It was close to restaurants and shopping/easy to access. It was private, safe and very clean. Highly Recommend!"

2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for some a single person or even a married couple needing a place to stay. The atmosphere was very good and would love to stay there again if I was in the area
2018-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"The cleaning expectations I felt were too high, ""excess crumbs picked up, dishes washed, dried and put away, all trash taken out, bed stripped and put in hamper by door"" and it was hard to relax after a long trip, knowing so. I felt that the price should better reflect the cleaning and expectations should be upfront prior to booking, and or that more time should be given for check out and to allow for the cleaning time, in that case. Otherwise the stay was good."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! It’s private, clean, and had everything I needed. Highly recommend!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I needed a place to stay in Redding for a month and found Darlene and Ove’s guest house. I’m a bit OCD when it comes to cleanliness so this place was perfect :) The hosts have great attention to detail and the kitchen was equipped with just about everything I needed for my stay. The bed is super comfortable. Good WIFI connection. It’s located in a safe and quiet neighborhood, and I enjoyed going for walks every now and then. I would say it was a 10-15 min drive to downtown Redding and super close to Bethel and the BSSM Civic Auditorium. Darlene was accommodating with requests and very kind. I only briefly met the rest of the family and they were very friendly. The entrance is on the side of the house with a parking spot just by the front which gives you your own space. I really appreciated that they respected my privacy since that was really important to me for this trip. One thing to keep in mind is that although they aren’t loud, you do hear everything from the bedroom/kitchen wall on your side that’s connected to their kitchen and dining area. Other than that it was the perfect place! I’d be happy to stay here on my next visit and definitely recommend it."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay ... highly recommended

The room is nice, the bed is comfortable, the linens were clean and of a good quality, and there was even some light exercise equipment like an exercise ball, some resistance bands, and a yoga mat provided. Jason and Karli have thought this out and created a very nice rental. 10/10 in my opinion.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jason and Karli’s place was like home away from home. The location was easy to get to, in a nice quiet neighborhood and close to shopping. The room was a very nice size, set up well with everything you would need. The nice touches were extremely comfortable bed, soft comforter, fluffy pillows and it smelled heavenly. After a 9 hr drive, it was perfect!!
Another important item is always good Coffee creamer & a Keurig. It may seem silly but some overpriced hotels have awful amenities!
I would highly recommend this stay. Communication was clear and prompt as well."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. It only has a microwave & keurig so be warned but we did just fine. The bed is very comfortable. You can often hear the house/family but they are super quiet after 10pm. Best responsive hosts to any questions etc. recommend this place!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although my stay was without my spouse, she would have appreciated the full length mirror and comfy bed. She would appreciate the security of room, house and surrounding neighborhood. As for myself, I’m always so impressed with the ingenuity and creativeness of Air BnB hosts. Jason and Karli are no exception. Thank you for your hospitality.
Jeff"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One great respite in Redding!
Jason and Karli’s place was truly a wonderful Airbnb that became a total four night stay for us. Immaculately clean, private, and a very comfortable roomy space. So very comfy were the bed, pillows, and sofa, along with a spacious bathroom and a walk in closet. We definitely appreciated the generous coffee bar (with regular & decaf!), paper plates, bowls, cups, and eating utensils. The neighborhood was so peaceful and quiet for good nights’ of rest and sleep. And it was a really reasonably priced stay considering everything. Hosts were always very responsive and helpful in our scheduling to stay according to weather conditions traveling in our northerly route home to Oregon.
Our grateful thanks Jason and Karli!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I am a repeat guest and love staying here. it feels like home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Such a cozy and comfortable space. And I slept great on that bed! One thing for future travelers, it takes the water a couple minutes to heat up in the morning, so leave a bit of extra time to shower and get ready. Overall, Jason and Karli were wonderful hosts. Very responsive and helpful in answering questions. Gave me space to do my thing, but also checked in with me after a few days to see if I needed anything. Very thoughtful!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were driving back home from Oregon & didn’t want to stay at a hotel, Jason & Karlis room was great! We would’ve paid about the same for a hotel. Difference is we felt at home here, clean, super happy! Would stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. It felt like a boutique hotel. We never saw anyone else and the entrance and check in was on a different side of the house from Jason and Karli's side. The bed was comfortable and soft. The pillows were so soft that my husband ended up using 3 of them (I brought my own). Lots of throw pillows and throw blankets. Immaculate and quiet. We will be back for sure. The Kurag coffee maker was awesome with a great selection of coffee pods.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described. Plenty of space for the 2 of us with 2 huge luggage. Jason and Karli’s place was perfect for us for our 2 nights in Redding.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. It was the perfect location for us as we were there to visit Bethel. The bathroom was large and easy to navigate as two people. The large walk-in closet wasn't fancy but it made it easy to throw our suitcases in, have it be messy but easy to access everything and could shut the door so the rest of the space was clutter free and spacious. Lovely neighbourhood."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be visiting again!
We were so impressed with the cleanliness of the Airbnb, 5 stars!
Very cozy and 3 minutes from Bethel Church."

Jason and Karli were great hosts and with the private entrance, you’d never know that you’re staying in their home.
Everything was clean and organized, with plenty of room; the coffee bar was stocked nicely as well.
Thanks for having us, I’d definitely recommend it.
-Jesse"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been using AirBnB for quite some time now and Jason & Karli's private bedroom was the best we have experienced. Definitely a 5-Star place! Clean, very luxurious, very roomy. Loved the bathroom! I was envious of the space! The area was very nice and quite. We prefer a private room and we definitely received that with this room. Karli was very communicative, open and helpful. We hope to use them again to visit our kids and granddaughters in Redding!

This was a wonderful respite while traveling."

Will definitely come back when we are in the area to hike or visit Bethel. This was our stop back home from Taylor Swift Road trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say they went above and beyond doesn’t even do it justice. I’m a musician and I needed a guitar but couldn’t bring mine so I asked if they had one and within the hour they had someone DROP ONE OFF!! So great.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had booked Jason and Karli's place for my parents. since they are in their 80s and not likely to set up an Airbnb account of their own, and I'm a host myself, I was glad to do that. Jason and Karli were more than happy to accommodate my older family members and communicate through me. I really appreciated their help. My folks had a very easy time getting to the house because there were clear instructions, and it was very easy for them to get into the space again because of the clarity. It was really appreciated."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We didn't meet Jason and Karli, and had no direct communication with them. There were other guests, or perhaps Jason and Karli themselves, making a lot of racket this morning in the other part of the house: banging, dropping things. We were already awake, so not a big deal, just a little strange. We didn't know what procedure to follow for taking out trash or stripping the bed, or what, if anything, else they expected at check out, since they didn't contact us. But the place was clean, nice, comfortable, in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Check in was easy, instructions were clear and simple."

Literally just finished yet another review of this particular property & the subsequent stay (this one just before the craziness of Christmas began) and as I have said in every review, it was perfect, no negative comments, just memories of a great stay! I would say that I will be back again soon, but since this is a review of an “older/previous” stay, all I will leave you with is this, read all of my other reviews for the property & Rebecca herself and it should be crystal clear on my thoughts about the property & it’s proprietor, Rebecca. Thank you! • Happy New Year!"

2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean and overall note bad but there are a few issues I would like to bring up.
The indoor fireplace does not work well at all. There is a problem with the ventilation .
I had to convince the host to be able to use the fire and even then it did not work well.
If you are looking for a place with an indoor moody fire do not go to this spot.
The hot tub was great and the bedroom was cozy. Very clean.
The other issue was the kitchen. There was no pot of soup or boiling water... only one small saucepan.
The coffee maker to heat up water also did not go a good job and all our morning chai was cold.
We then had no pot to actually heat up water or milk so were kind of stuck with cold beverage every morning.
I think if they can fix the ventilation issues with the fireplace or not advertise it and add a bot to boil water then I would give this place a higher rating."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quick trip to Redding for one night, place was as advertised, great value, would stay again!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It was perfect for me and my wife.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A little late with this review but has nothing to do with our stay. My better half and I had an amazing stay even though it was just for one night. The house immediately gives you that “cozy” & “right at home” feeling the second that you walk through the door. The Hot Tub/Spa was the highlight for sure! Especially with a little bit of light rain. A little cold outside but the hot tub was perfect. Finished the night with a movie on the couch, perfect, just perfect! Thank you so much again Rebecca! Will be booking again very soon."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay at the country oasis Airbnb! The serene surroundings and lush greenery made it a perfect escape. The pool and hot tub were delightful additions, offering relaxation with a touch of luxury. Rebecca was incredibly welcoming, and the charming decor added to the overall ambiance. A truly rejuvenating experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was peaceful and comfortable. The bed is very luxurious, the living room perfectly cozy. It was the perfect landing pad after our days of exploring the surrounding mountains."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Needed a place to stay the night when passing through Redding. Rebecca’s Airbnb was in a private and safe neighborhood. The driveway had enough space for to cars. Only wished we could have stayed longer so we could have used the jacuzzi! Would stay again if ever in Redding.
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,Really lovely place and very nicely decorated and very clean! A couple of surprises were that the house is joined to another unit with a shared wall and closed door between. The patio pool and jacuzzi is shared with other guests. I was told the jacuzzi could be used after 10pm and the guests reserved it from 9-10 but when I went out at 11:30 the other guests came out saying it was their time to use it which was a bit disturbing. There is also a glass door so I felt like they were watching me the whole time I was in there waiting for me to leave. I could see into the other unit and see them easily. I booked to practice music and thought I was gonna be in a remote country setting but it’s a neighborhood and house is shared w other guests so it wasn’t very private at all. Then I was informed to be quiet after 9 because it’s a very quiet neighborhood. If I had known these privacy issues I would not have stayed there. Good snacks/drinks. Responsive to messages. V Comfortable!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable. Rebecca goes above and beyond to make sure the place is prestige down to the smallest detail. Grateful for the hospitality!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"As always, a wonderful place to stay. This has become my home away from. Rebecca is wonderful, and kind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rebecca was wonderful. Super easy to communicate with. The hot tub under the stars was epic!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and peaceful location for relaxing night and the hot tub was a blessing. The stylish modern amenities were well balanced with comfort and charm. When I reached out, Rebecca ensured no fragrances used in the air or linens. A memorable stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for letting us stay it was a beautiful experience
:)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Rebecca’s place while visiting our granddaughter in Redding. We arrived earlier than expected and was able to check in early. The place was clean and comfy. Kitchen had everything you would need. We appreciated the bottled water in the refrigerator, snacks and variety of coffee kcups. Even though we didn’t have time to use the pool or hot tub, it was very nice and inviting. Rebecca responded quickly to all messages. She was a great host and we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca is the absolute best host. She is so kind, warm and welcoming! I love staying with her and always feel right at home there. Can’t wait for my next stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca was very attentive and the place was great. I would definitely stay there again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for the night! Has everything you need and host is super responsive and helpful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,was awesome
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific value on the outskirts of Redding! Ten minute drive to restaurants and stores downtown. Peaceful, quiet neighborhood and you might even catch a glimpse of a wild turkey who lives down the street! Unit is super-clean and everything works great. The hot tub and pool are an incredible bonus after a day trip to Lassen or wherever. Great find!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great neighborhood. Perfect location if you're enjoying Whiskeytown. Good BLM trails for running. Conveniences down the road.
Pool was perfect at check in. Always hot in Redding."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was so amazing! We felt very relaxed and safe! Thank you so much
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca checked in on us during the stay and asked if we needed anything. I did recommend she get a mat for the inside of the front door. Walking into wood floors after being in the rain, it would have been nice to put our shoes on a mat. Something I didn't mention that I also recommend is hooks in the shower. She supplied wash rags, and we brought our own body scrubs, and one thing we've come to dislike is that most people don't think of hooks of some kind in the shower to hang these things."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca was responsive for our request to check in early, and the house was spotless and easy to find. We loved the pool and hot tub. The hot tub was not working correctly when we got there, but a quick phone call to Rebecca solved the problem within just a few minutes. The house was in a great location and was easy to find. We loved the peace and quiet and had a very restful evening until we left for our final destination. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was a great host, and her place is really cosy and well equipped in a good location. The hot tub and swimming pool are added advantages. We really enjoyed our time here, and it was a good spot to visit Lassen, Burney Falls and Lake Shasta. Would definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable place to stay in a quiet neighborhood.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this stay around 5 pm on the day we planned to arrive. Even so, we found the unit spotless and we didn’t see any of the residents at all. The one thing I would note is that use of the laundry room is by appointment, so we didn’t use it because it felt like too late notice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t wait to book my next stay here! Rebecca was very kind, and helpful and responded super fast! Her place felt like home away from home and was so cozy!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"She did tell us that the hot tub was too hot but if you leave the top off for a bit it cools down to 109° so that was a nice surprise. The place was very clean and spotless. She had kind bars, water and sparkling water. Everything was decorated cute!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay , we were busy at a conference so we didn't get to utilize the pool much but the price was fair and while there was a bit of travel time to our meetings each morning we really couldn't ask for more. We will be contacting Rebecca next time we travel to Redding."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca was friendly, accommodating, and responsive. I felt the listing was a great value with all it had to offer. The surroundings were amazing and the attention to detail was spot on. We loved the pool access, property views, and cool, comfortable unit during a very hot day. She even was able to let us check in a bit early, which was a great break after the hot drive from the coast. As an Air BnB property owner myself, I can professionally say that Rebecca “nailed it”. It was a very special little mini trip for my teenage daughter and me. I don’t think there was anything more I could have asked for. My daughter felt very spoiled. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this listing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place we have ever stayed at in Redding! Very quiet. Rebecca respected our privacy and answered my messages within minutes of my sending them. Great communication! The pool was a great relief from the heat. The guest house was clean and as described. Definitely will rent again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! It was quiet and cozy and the pool was truely delightful!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite places I've stayed so far! It was super peaceful, clean, and smelled phenomenal (I'm pretty sensitive to smells, so this was a great plus). Rebecca was super nice and very responsive and it was an overall beautiful and comfortable stay away from home :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful! The pool was a nice treat during the heat wave, and the house itself was nice and cool when we arrived despite the summer heat outside. There were cold sparkling waters waiting for us in the fridge, and the house was very clean. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My gf and I had a wonderful stay. I would definitely recommend it. Rebecca was a great host and got right back to me with any questions. Thank you for the stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca's guesthouse was the perfect place to rest after a 7 hour drive! Even with high temperatures this week, the guesthouse was cool and comfortable with AC and a plethora of fans. We were able to enjoy a quick dip in the pool and marveled at all the constellations above us! Rebecca has literally everything you could need, I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,This stay was nice but you can only have you and one other guest over and that sucks cause me and my cousins wanted to go swimming I was in town visiting family and was told they couldn’t come 😭it was really clean tho easy to get in and the pool and jacuzzi did look really nice.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Rebecca's home immensely! We were looking for a mini retreat space in between travel and were more than pleased with her space and delighted by how many thoughtful touches she had throughout.
The pool was a dream to beat the summer heat, doing all our laundry was a luxury, and we slept very well.
Rebecca was extremely communicative and accomodating and we would absolutely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed the house, amenities, and many outdoorsy locations within the Redding / Shasta area. Rebecca is very responsive and super friendly. We will come back!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had EVERYTHING we needed from all of the toiletries even including body lotion!
The hot water and stocked coffee bar with keurig pods was a great touch.
She was very responsive with arranging private time for the pool and spa.
Cleanliness, seclusion and the location made it a great hub for the area."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at an Airbnb property, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. From start to finish, everything was well-organized and exceeded my expectations.
First and foremost, the communication with the host was fantastic. They promptly responded to all my inquiries and provided detailed information about the property, amenities, and nearby attractions. Their warm and friendly demeanor made me feel welcomed even before my arrival.
The amenities provided were top-notch. The kitchen was fully equipped with modern appliances and stocked with essential utensils and cookware, making it convenient for me to prepare meals. The bed was comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep after a long day of exploring the area. Additionally, the Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, allowing me to stay connected throughout my stay."

There were plenty of linens, pillows, towels for any need. There were many thoughtful touches, coffee, snacks, make-up remover towelettes, lotion..."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the cleanest and quietest Airbnb places I've ever stayed! The location is a few miles out of the Redding madness and situated on a nice quiet lane. Perfect if you're like me and don't like busy/loud environments. I slept well and felt right at home. The bed was quite comfortable.
I didn't use the pool or hot tub, but they both looked well-kept and inviting.
The host was very responsive and had good suggestions along the way.
Honestly, I can't think of anything negative to say about this place. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommended!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very relaxing time. The space was just enough and nicer than being in a hotel. Clean and very quiet. Rebecca was very good about communicating.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was very happy and comfortable staying at Rebecca’s. The place looks newly renovated & has everything you need. I can tell when a host has really thought through what someone might need.
The towels are nice and fluffy & there are beach towels to use in case you use the pool or hot tub. The neighborhood is quiet& peaceful. It’s nice to go into the backyard to sit at the chair & table.
Rebecca is a great communicator. I stayed for about three weeks & she checked in to see how things were & if I needed anything.
It was nice to be able to do laundry by appointment.
Being mindful that there could be noise because the laundry room is all that’s between their home and your stay she has a fan running all the time so this isn’t an issue.
It’s nice to be able to park right in the driveway.
Her kids are great, they had a lemonade stand ( on the further side of the house) one day and it took me back to my childhood. Great stay!"

The host was so helpful and responsive, including being flexible on check in time when we arrived way earlier than anticipated. Everything was clean, beautiful, and so comfortable. The hot tub was a delightful luxury at the end of each day as well. Proximity to delicious places to eat and to awesome hiking at Whiskeytown Lake was amazing!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a home base during a short week of road bike training, Rebecca's place was luxurious. It had coffee and snacks to get me going, and then a stocked kitchen for subsequent food prep. The bedroom was flawless with plenty of storage I could not even use, the bathroom was clean and stocked and, to top it all off, the jacuzzi was 104 degrees. Her responsiveness was unrivaled.
I'm eager to return."

P.S You do need to wash your own dishes though, and avoid shoes inside."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised. But a bit oppressive once we got there and saw that we couldn’t wear shoes inside, we had to hand wash all the dishes, and we had to leave the house as “clean as when we arrived”. If I had known that WE were going to be the cleaning crew, (even though there is an additional cleaning fee), I might have chosen a different place."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's place is cozy, peaceful, and cute😁. She had a quick response and is helpful with suggestions as to what to do in town. We had a great time and would definitely recommend for a couples get away."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca’s home is easy to find from I-5, very comfortable and easy for a stop over. Her place was clean and comfortable. I personally prefer a firmer mattress, my only note would be that the bed is very soft and bouncy which some may really love! It was snowing and dark so I didn’t have a chance to use the hot tub or pool but Rebecca has a very pretty backyard and made every effort to make it available to me. Great host and stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Very comfortable and cozy. I will definitely be going back. Rebecca was awesome and I had zero issues. I only left because my work sent me to another location. I 100% recommend this property and plan on returning in the near future

The beds were oh so comfortable. You will feel like you are visiting the home of a friend. The back deck and view of nature was such a treat. It was so peaceful and relaxing, and it was camouflaged from the neighbors. You won't feel like you are in a track home in Redding. Sitting in the hot tub each night helped me sleep like I was in a coma! The next time you are in Redding treat yourself and rent this ""gem of a home"" in Redding."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful and well-kept home. It was super clean with nice decor. The neighborhood is great and backyard with the hot tub was a bonus 😌 Also really appreciated that the kitchen dish ware and pots and pans were co-ordinated and clean unlike other places that have a mish-mash of stuff..... We had to change our stay days and Erislene was very flexible and we had great communication! We visited Lake Shasta, Caverns, Burney Falls and Lassen and this place worked out perfectly.
The only minor inconvenience was that bath towels were only just enough (usually places have extra towels -- makes it easier to have more) and no hand sanitizer.
But these are so minor -- I give this place and the host 5 stars and would love to come again and stay at this lovely lovely place!!😃"

We are looking forward to going back"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about this place is perfect. The location, space, amenities, and hospitality. Everything is white so you can see, smell, and feel the cleanliness when you walk in, sit down for a meal, jump in the giant bath to relax, and when you last down to go to sleep. I will never take my family to another hotel again, when a home away from home like this is an option. The location is only 5 minutes from the mall and several other stores, and 15-45 minutes away from amazing adventures. My son was in heaven when he saw the yard and surrounding woodland, and spent most of his days hunting for critters. As that's an experience we don't have in the city. all around this house was perfect for my family and not one of us wanted to leave. The beauty of the home makes it very easy to keep clean. The hosts were amazingly communicative and were open to accommodation and were quick to respond to my messages and were so kind after check out. Not only did they compliment the cleanliness of their home when we left but also let us know what we had left behind even though it was only 2 pairs of socks and a charger. This is most definitely an all around 5 star place. Thank you!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we were looking for a place to stay in Redding, it was important that we had fast internet, a place with plenty of natural light, and a bonus was a hot tub. My husband and I needed a place to participate in a virtual conference and decided an Air B n B experience would be more fun. Erislene's place was all of this plus more! We were so grateful to have a well-stocked kitchen, amazed by the huge master bedroom/bathroom, and grateful for the monitor that we could hook up to our computer to be able to participate in Zoom meetings. The bed was perfectly firm, I loved the well-lit vanity area, and plenty of comfortable furniture throughout the home. The neighborhood was perfect for short walks, and the proximity to stores like Trader Joe's was ideal as we cooked our own meals in the kitchen. We look forward to coming back!"

The cottage exceeded my expectations. It is fully stocked with everything you need from cooking, bathing and entertaining needs. It’s absolutely perfect.

2024-01-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie and Deb are very nice people, and
the place seems nice on the site, and it did match the pictures.
But I did experience some difficulties.
First off, it was a little difficult accessing the key from the lockbox but Deb came right over and helped retrieve the key.
Unfortunately, with the weather being cold, the heating was a little difficult to maneuver. I stayed in the front bedroom with the king-size bed, and it seemed like all the heat was going into that room, so I had to lower the setting to 64° plus I left the door cracked to try to balance the temperature.
Also, the bed was not comfortable. It was a flat firm, that's the only way I could describe it.
People like myself who have arthritis in their body, for me, it is severe in my lower spine; firm beds hurt me more. Sadly
with the heat and bed situation, I did not get enough sleep.
While it's a cute place, there is always room for improvement, especially the bed situation ☺️
I wish Carrie and Deb the best!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quick response, quite peaceful and comfortable."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly what we were looking for to break up a long road trip with our dogs. Nicely fenced back yard for your furry friends and a convenient location near downtown and the highways. It’s an adorable old cottage with a cozy feel!

We loved the vintage touches and decor! The fenced backyard was perfect for our dog. The place is perfectly priced. Carrie was kind enough to accommodate my fragrance sensitivity (even though we booked same day), which was so above and beyond amazing!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The place looks exactly like the listing, and was easy to get to.
It’s a nice safe neighborhood and is close to restaurants and bars downtown. I would recommend the Rose Bar that’s a couple minute drive away.
The kitchen was super cute with a SMEG coffee maker and cool retro fridge. The whole cottage was very well decorated, I loved the vintage feel. The AC was great especially since Redding is super hot right now.
Would recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Magnolia May Cottage is just as described and photographed, which means beautiful & peaceful :). The home has many little touches we enjoyed, including whimsical artwork, welcoming patio and good tea 🇬🇧, of course! Carrie was quickly attentive to any requests or questions, and as a frequent Airbnb guest, this home is now in my top 3. We didn’t try the fireplace, but I can soundly recommend the AC & the beds win for comfort anywhere. Lovely!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved my stay here. Carrie really thought through all of the details to make a space feel homey and comfortable. Totally recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a great stay at the cottage. Squeaky clean, unbelievably comfortable beds (!!), really adorable. I had a little trouble understanding the shower set up - my daughter however, understood the instructions perfectly. I also had some difficulty with the SMEG coffee maker - but some trial and error got it going eventually. These are MINOR MINOR compared to the overall comfort of this place. A highlight was Evergreen Coffee Shop recommended by the host…do not miss it. Airy and bustling with super friendly service - two of the best breakfasts I ever had!
My daughter is with CalFire up here so I will definitely be back!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second time to stay at Carrie's cottage and we felt completely at home. We had a question about the AC system and within minutes, the co-host, Deb, was at the door. Deb is very friendly, helpful and immediately remedied the concern. It's our 'home away from home' as we travel between our Northern California and Southern Oregon's homes."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was very nice and comfortable. Had everything we needed. We also enjoyed the lessening to the records. We tried to open the door to the backyard but couldn't get it open. It would have been nice to use the back yard. I tried to contact Carrie about the situation with the door. I never heard back from her. If there was a reason for not being able to use the backyard that
would have been understandable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what we were looking for.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is great. Very nice artistic touch to it. It was comfortable even though the outside temperature was above 100F (42C).

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie's place was the peaceful, relaxing house I needed for vacation. It was as if all of my needs were met before I asked: I wanted to toast a bagel for breakfast - there was a bagel toaster; I needed to boil water for tea - there was a nice Fellows kettle. The house was consistently cool in the super-heat of Redding in July, and the location was within a very walkable, quaint neighborhood with other beautiful old houses. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We only stayed one night here and wish we had time to stay longer! The cottage was so cute and had everything we needed.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was very cozy, and it was just what our family needed to relax at the end of a Northern California road trip.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This humble abode was the perfect pit spot on a long 12 hour road trip to Oregon from Los Angeles.

I loved the thoughtful touches in the kitchen, living room and bathroom. Thank you for th charming stay and hospitality. Much love"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Carrie’s cottage is so lovely. I wish we had more time to stay and enjoy it for longer. It felt like we were in a beautiful James Bond safe house in the English countryside. Would definitely stay here again for longer.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage is a gem. We felt totally chill and peaceful in the eclectic and charming neighborhood. It's near EVERYTHING -- walkable to pizza, ice cream, beer pubs, and more, plus a ten minute drive to Whiskeytown Natl Rec and everything in Shasta.
The bedding was soft & comfy, the AC and fans provided a lovely respite from the stifling early summer heat. The living space & yard are...livable! Great charm and style without feeling stuffy -- everything made it very easy to just chill out after a day of exploring the area."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely house in Redding with a driveway. Very clean interior and the record player was a nice touch. I know it’s likely because of its proximity to downtown, but there were a lot of roaches in the yard at night. Did not see any inside though."

Allowed us to check in a bit earlier than their normal time which was super appreciated 🤍"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie’s home is absolutely beautiful! After a long drive up to Redding, all we wanted to do was shower and go to bed. Her home is so warm, cozy and we felt right at home! Carrie and Deb were both super responsive and helpful — I asked for coffee & food recs and they did not disappoint!
Bonus point for the AC because it was so hot in Redding 😅 and also how dog friendly her place is! The living room has some blankets/throws for the couch and my dog Tuna snuggled on it all day!
The check out instructions were easy and definitely not an exhaustive list. Thank you, Carrie and Deb for the amazing stay! We will be back again next summer!"

A great little retreat,"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect home, exactly as described. Great host with terrific communication!"

the friendly hostess responded quickly to some supplies and was therefore very helpful to us.
We expected a little more contact during the week of our stay. She might not want to disturb us!
On a next visit to this city, we will definitely try to rent this home again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I made a stop at Carrie's Magnolia house on our way back home and it was perfect! We desperately needed to do a load of laundry, stretch out, and relax before hitting the road again. My husband immediately enjoyed the hammock out back and we both took turns enjoying the deep bathtub. I appreciated the provided cooking oil in the kitchen and the filtered water. Carrie was a responsive host and had clear instructions throughout the whole process. Definitely a cool little stay we recommend and would return to."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very charming space! Carrie was quick to respond to questions and the space was cute as heck. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked for cooking needs

Kitchen is well stocked, had everything one could need. Nice fenced back yard for our fur kids. Carrie was super communicative and accommodating. We would love to stay again! Thank you, Carrie!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House was great. We were only there for one night one our way north so didn’t spend to much time in town. The one night we were there we went down to sundial bridge, as recommended by Carrie. Great are for the dogs and so much to learn and see. Highly recommend for kids too. The house was warm and inviting. The beds were comfy and the back yard was much appreciated by the dogs. It was a cute little neighborhood and felt super safe. Definitely check out Carrie’s place is your heading to, or through, Redding."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie was a great host; she promptly answered questions and was great with communication.
The bed was very comfortable and the bathtub was awesome. There were many little amenities available such as sanitary napkins, soap, shampoo and conditioner, etc."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great host!! Extremely accommodating. She refunded me a full day when the water was off for maybe two hours in the morning on our 2nd night.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Centrally located with easy access to the 5. My dog and I had a very brief stopover for the night and with the exception of not having the Nespresso machine (was told it broke and will be replaced) it was advertised. They did have a regular coffee maker as well as a French press.
Hot water, good pressure and loved the bath. Very convenient laundry located within the space and fenced small back yard was perfect for a quick stop. Definitely functional for a longer stay for 2-4 people."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Carrie was a delight to communicate with. We requested an early check in and she continued to communicate throughout the day with updates. Her place is adorable too! I love the wood stove! ❤️ I would love to stay here again for a little private retreat.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in dozens of airbnb properties over the years, and this was one of the nicest experiences thus far. It's as described, cozy, comfortable beds, clean and a very kind host!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here with my dog while waiting out a snow storm on I-5 to the north, and it was the perfect place to cozy up and watch the snowfall. The views while walking the surrounding neighborhood of the mountains are quite nice, and it’s easy driving distance to anywhere I wanted to be. The fenced backyard was nice for my dog. The neighborhood is quiet at night. Carrie was always friendly and communicative. I even managed to leave both my lighter winter jackets hanging on a hook when I left, and she mailed them to me, which she had to go out of her way for."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was very beautiful and clean and I was honored to be staying. It was a nice spot to stay and would definitely do it again given the chance

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night to break up the drive from Seattle to Los Angeles. Carrie's home was the perfect place to rest for the night.

They were able to accommodate my last minute booking and were helpful and responsive to the questions I had! The dogs really enjoyed the backyard and I found the house super cozy and tastefully decorated. The backyard was fully fenced so it made it easy to let the dogs out in the morning while I enjoyed some coffee; there was even a dog bed on-site which I greatly appreciated. I'm not surprised this space has so many good reviews - if I'm ever in town I would stay here again! :)

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay over Christmas at Carrie’s house. It’s clean, cozy and very cute, with an effective heating system (and I’m sure AC, too, for those crazy Redding summers) and well-appointed—well, everything. There are extra linens and towels if you need them, cute vintage touches, and the King bed is immensely comfortable. There are some cats who linger and may spray around the house, so we noticed a bit of a kitty pee smell—but nothing that a candle doesn’t cover. Highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for a comfortable and conveniently located home in Redding for a few days."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super awesome place. Pictures make it look a lot bigger that it actually is but that wasn’t a problem for us.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Halfway through a two month road trip this was pure luxury having a whole house to ourselves. This is an immaculate and charming, not so little, house with all the amenities. We felt spoiled. Everything was easy about our stay. Having a washer/dryer was a real treat. Although our daily schedule didn’t leave a lot of time to sit and luxuriate, it was a real pleasure to come “home” to this lovely house. And we were able to extend a day, a real bonus. Cannot say enough good things about the experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Magnolia May Cottage was excellent.

I recommend this location for a multiple day stay in the Redding area, and the host was very wonderful with communication."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely clean house ❤️ first time to the states and that was the perfect wee house to stay in.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in this sweet cottage which is situated in a lovely, safe neighborhood close to downtown Redding. Our hosts were especially wonderful. Carrie was both warm and welcoming and thoughtful and attentive to our needs. Sarah was beautifully responsive to an internet issue that arose and had it attended to and remedied within an hour. The cottage was really clean, charming, and thoughtfully equipped and the beds and living room furniture extremely comfortable. We had a perfect stay here and look forward to staying here next time we pass through Redding."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our second visit to Magnolia May Cottage! Carrie is such a thoughtful hostess in making sure all needs are met and then some.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. Quiet and comfortable. Great space, had everything we needed to enjoy our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this airbnb for a place to stay during our roadtrip from Southern California to Washington as Redding is a halfway point for us. When we looked at hotels in the area, the pricing was about the same so it just made sense to book a house opposed to a hotel room. The nieghborhood is cute, about 5 mins from the freeway and close to restaurants, gas stations and stores so very convenient. Carrie was a great communicator, answered all of my questions and ensured that we had everything we needed. Check-in was a breeze, the house is very cute, the backyard was perfect for our dogs and the bed was VERY comfortable. We will definitely be staying again :)"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very cute, comfortable, and clean. It had everything we needed. The location was excellent, walking distance to downtown and the river. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood. It was a short drive to the Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay. There was some some traffic noise during the day, but it was quiet at night. We would definitely stay there again."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect quaint home for 2 or 3 people. There is no television but, there is WiFi. I’m not a big TV watcher and enjoyed the record player.
The master bedroom is next to the street and is very noisy, even wearing earplugs. Be prepared for that. We slept in the spare room the 2nd night.
The bathroom is small, but functional. The kitchen was just enough.
This is an older home and has great wood throughout, with hardwood floors. I wondered how many families had made memories there.
There is a backyard space, if you need it.
Nice little touches throughout.
There were a couple housekeeping issues like, laundry on top of the washer, a couple of towels laying on the floor in the laundry room, thick dust on lamps and a full pod tray in the coffee maker.
The house is affordable and has everything you need. Carrie is very very responsive."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"“ I had a great time staying here. The room and house was very clean, and organized. Luke greeted me at the door and was easy to reach if I need anything. Luke was very helpful and hospitable! I would highly recommend staying here!”"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb experience. He takes his business very serious and really cares about the guest’s experience. Way above and beyond any expectations.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a blessing. I didn't know how much I needed the time there until I was there. So restful. Luke was so kind. I'm so very thankful for everything.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for attending the Bethel Leaders Summit. Very comfortable bed. Appreciated the coffee available in the mornings.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,very helpful and thoughtful
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Luke is an amazing host! He communicates super well and his house immaculately amazing. This is all worth the price you pay for it especially for whats included. I will stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay to explore Redding. Always clean; and the host is so nice!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic homebase for the conference I attended nearby. Didnt spend much time at Luke's place, but it was great to be able to cook stuff in the beautiful kitchen, and had a fridge/freezer of my own in my room. Shared the bathroom with one other guest, but that went smoothly.
Luke was great about letting me bring my roadbike in the garage since it was supposed to be rainy. The bed was comfortable, and the light had a dimmer so it could be bright or dim."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! The place is just as described/pictured in the listing, so if you’re looking for a clean, affordable, well-equipped spot from which to explore, this will serve you well. Luke was a responsive host and made it easy to get situated. He was also kind enough to let me stay a bit past checkout time, as I was exhausted from a late night of travel. Thank you Luke!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,it was great very attentive host
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you very much to the owner of the house for the comfort
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Man, where do I even begin? Luke (and Juan) are in the right business and this is what every SuperHost should aspire to replicate. They put together quite possibly the best AirBnB I've ever stayed in. Everything in the house is labeled, instructions are framed (literally) and they went through the effort to give local restaurant/cafe recommendations. Connecting to the wi-fi was as easy as taking a picture of a QR code. The tv had streaming services available. There's a sign in the driveway telling you where to park. And the bathroom had everything ready for you. When you've been traveling all day, you don't want to worry or think about the small stuff. This place is beyond accommodating and is a wonderful value.
My one regret was only getting to stay there one night.
Next time I'm in Northern California, this place is on the top of my list."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was bery clean and it was a very convenient check in

2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had such a good time. The room was perfect, and walking distance to both shopping and Bethel. Luke is a great host. And everything was well organized."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay! Luke was responsive and flexible. The place was spotless and had full amenities. I would stay again and recommend this spot.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Luck’s place was absolutely impeccable & pleasant to stay embracing every moments there, five star rating of cleaniness and neatness, conveniently provided essentials, oversized closet & TV screen, irresistible fluffy queen bed, coffee machine in modern kitchen, nice and quite environment with easy access, blameless & spotless place enjoying every amenities, come to heavenly place in Redding!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came here Because we wanted to be able to park our show cars in a safe location. We could not be happier with the location. Super clean, comfortable and very well kept up. We hope to be able to reserve it next year."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Jeremy and Mandye’s place. Peaceful, lovely and beautiful — it’s perfect for a quick trip or a week long staycation like we did! Plus it’s super close to all the shops, restaurants and attractions in Redding.
Will definitely stay here again!
Bonus points — the wifi is great if you’re looking for a place to work!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We only wished we could have stayed longer to fully enjoy Jeremy's place. The beautiful countryside and modern home with hot tub and pool were ideal for relaxing in between our biking trips. Next time we'll come back with our daughters!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,5 out of 5 very peaceful very helpful on directions and super clean with a book on a lot of recommendations on what to do and where to go
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed the night here on our wedding night and we absolutely loved it! Wish we could’ve stayed more than one night but we plan to make this a yearly visit.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have legit never been in a more beautiful airbnb. Everything was so well thought out and executed. We were only able to spend one night there, but we wish we could have stayed forever. Do yourselves a favor and book a stay at this amazing place. You won’t regret it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was fantastic. We happened across the listing when looking for an off-the-beaten path place to stay on our way to and from Yosemite. The house was nicely furnished and comfortable, and we really appreciated the outdoor space. It felt a little small for our 4 because we have 2 fully grown teenage kids, but we knew that going in. It’s a lovely spot."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Recommended
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful and spotlessly clean! We loved it and hope to come back :)

The amenities were wonderful and everything in the house is labeled and explained. Beds and other furnishings were comfortable. The outside space is great. I wish I could have packed it up and brought it home. It is very well designed. I would definitely to visit again when I return to the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's place is GORGEOUS first of all! as soon as you pull into the driveway, you count your lucky stars that you booked this gorgeous space. The property is beautiful and so spacious. Great for a morning walk with a cup of tea! The house itself is beautiful as well and totally clean and comfortable. The space is designed very well. The space itself makes you feel like you've indulged in an ultimate luxury because it is so beautifully decorated and the architecture is lovely. The beds were comfortable and the space worked out great for two small families with young children."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 (kids 14 and 10) stayed in Hannah's house for 2 nights for a quick winter getaway. We enjoyed the hot tub (in the rain) and outdoor shower. The property was beautiful, quiet, private and secluded. Conveniently located near Shasta Resort where we went up for the day to play in the snow. The house was cozy - not too small, not too big - and we had everything we needed to prepare our meals and chill. Hannah was very responsive when we asked for tips on where things were, how to light the fireplace, etc. We'd love to come back when it's warmer to enjoy the outside amenities."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved how charming this place was and would definitely stay here again. The welcome book was very helpful showing how everything worked as well as recommended restaurants. The extra touches were great. Thank you for making our stay so welcome!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome property to unwind! Turned my phone off and watched the rain from the expansive windows in the living area, providing serenity and peacefulness only rivaled by the beauty of the view. Hosts are friendly and proactive in their communication. Architectural design matched perfectly with the modern European style minimalistic decor, which was the final touch for the perfect weekend away from the noise of life. Thank you so much, I’ll be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hannah has a beautiful home with great amenities. We really enjoyed our stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, new, peaceful and remote. We loved Hannah’s place and can’t recommend it enough. It was perfect for a quiet peaceful evening but also close to restaurants and things to do in town.
Our kids loved the hot tub, book selection and the swing out in the yard. Place was spotless and beds were comfortable. Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great! Thank you for hosting!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a find. Comfortable bed and lovely peaceful setting. We live on a ranch so it can be hard to find a peaceful stay on airbnb and we have stayed in settings all over the world. This was one of the best airbnbs we have ever been to. The perfect setting for coming and going or just hanging out and reading in the hot tub.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our visit!! Hannah was wonderful!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Will definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic little find. I booked here at the last minute as we found ourselves in the area.
The whole place was well decorated and spotless throughout. We only stayed one night but would have happily stayed longer if we could."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were truly amazed by the stunning beauty of the home. The meticulous attention to decor details and overall management was outstanding. It’s a well-crafted Airbnb that left us wanting to stay longer. Despite having to leave, we’re already planning to return just to enjoy the Airbnb itself. Don’t miss out on this gem – highly recommend booking!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,We were thrilled with our stay & will definitely plan to stay there again! The property is beautiful & very peaceful… the house could not have been more perfectly decorated. We loved it & felt right at home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time at this stylish retreat. The place was spacious, clean, and comfortable, with everything we needed for a relaxing getaway.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a cute little place completely outfitted with chic, modern touches."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay. 10 minutes from everywhere, easily accessible and absolutely beautiful. Worth the price and double. Great for kids, great for couples, great for groups. An investment from Hannah and Jonny that has already, and will continue to pay off far into the future - for them and their guests. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Redding, save yourself some time. Stay here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow. This home is breathtakingly beautiful! So peaceful and private. Everything is so well thought out down to the smallest detail. I felt like I was staying at a friend's beautifully done property, it felt personal and like someone really designed it well for themselves. I woke up early just to walk around the property and take pictures of the sunrise -- the mountains in the distance are stunning in that light! So thankful we got to stop here and I hope to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property. Beautiful home. I definitely recommend this property if you are visiting the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I was here for one night only but the space was beautiful. Great stay close to Lassen National park which is why we stayed here in the first place. Beds were comfy and the house had all you need for a stay. Great place!!! Totally recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what we needed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was absolutely perfect! It’s beautifully decorated inside and the outside was just as beautiful. Private and away! The home was super clean, best shower ever and I haven’t slept that good in my own bed in forever haha! She was quick to respond and kind. It was a perfect place for me and 2 of my girlfriends to go, get away, pray and have fellowship time! Truly a blessed weekend for us! Would recommend 10/10!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed it very much and exceeded our expectations. Everything is very high quality and designed with love for detail and taste.
The huge property where you are all alone, just outside of Redding is impressive. We watched dehe, birds, squirrels.
The large outdoor area was wonderfully suited when we celebrated a birthday and the part of the family living in Redding came here.
The house is very sensible and built in a quality that you won't find so often in houses here. The kitchen equipment is good and we were able to do everything though we cooked a lot. The fridge is a water filter.
Particularly note is that there were a lot of towels, more than sufficient. The equipment with consumables such as toilet paper, kitchen roll, spices, garbage bags, etc. were also available in large quantities.
We felt very comfortable here and will be very happy to come back. Thank you."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah and Jonny’s place is absolutely beautiful. The design, amenities, and little homey touches far surpassed the typical rental home. It was perfect for our group of three girls up from San Francisco. We wished we had booked longer so we could make use of everything the property had to offer! The hosts were generous enough to offer a discount because we were expecting to be able to use the hot-tub, which turned out to be seasonal. The pool was quite warm and made up for it. 10/10, would absolutely book again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It is a nice cozy place and very private. It met all our needs during our stay and we will be very pleased to stay there again. Especially nice was hanging out in the morning before the heat of the day and after the sun went down in either the sitting area in the front or the back of the house.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was beautiful inside and out. The shower was amazing; definitely the best shower I've ever taken on a vacation. Bed was very comfortable. The house was clean and had really nice electronics. Hannah was very friendly and responsive in our interactions and labeled everything in the house clearly. The front and back porches were both comfortable spots to relax. I was so pleased.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,The home and location are absolutely beautiful! This will definitely be our go to location for future visits. Super close to Shasta college for family visits.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our mother-daughter weekend getaway. The home was spotless, incredibly peaceful and surprisingly spacious for a smaller home. Our favorite part of the house was the outdoor space. We enjoyed sitting outside in the morning with our coffee before heading out for a day of adventure. Many great things to do within a reasonable drive, we visited Lassen NP, Burney Falls, McCloud Falls and Lake Shasta Caverns.
Hannah and hosts were also great with communication; prompt, attentive and friendly. There was some confusion surrounding the hot tub, but it was resolved rather quickly and in a more then appropriate manner. We greatly appreciate their generosity and look forward to staying here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Hannah has a lovely place . We would be happy to stay here anytime. It is beautiful and quiet but close to Redding shopping.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place and location. The house was very clean and perfect for our stay. For being on 5 acres it was still very close to town. Also the place felt unique on the 5 acres with the slate exterior and the outdoor shower but still had the pool and everything else we needed for our summer night stay.
Great hosts and already looking at going back in September for a longer stay to soak up the relaxing atmosphere."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous house!!! So beautiful and peaceful, just what I needed getting out of the busy busy city. Thank you so much for your patience hannah!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was an absolute delight! I would highly recommend staying for at least two nights, one just isn’t enough when you realize how wonderfully peaceful the whole place is.
The pool provided a nice little refreshing dip on these super hot days. The Airbnb has everything you could possibly need in a house. Very clean & quiet. Host is super responsive.
My favorite part was probably the outside space, you can sit out back in the early part of the day and enjoy the tranquil sounds of the water features. Then as the afternoon sun starts to move over the house you can move to the front and enjoy the outside temps without the intensity of the sun. There were so many stars out at night. It was so beautiful to stop and just stare at them.
It’s in a great spot within driving distance to Whiskeytown, Lake Shasta, Lassen National Park, Mount Shasta, and so much more!! Definitely one of the most peaceful places I’ve ever stayed. Will continue to come back here for years to come."
