2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robert and Laurel have the best mountain retreat! The cottage is as every bit as cozy as it appears in the pictures. It is not advertised as a hikers paradise but it is! I spent the week hiking Kings and Crowder's mountains and this was such a a great spot to begin and end my days in. There are several grocery options both north and south of the cottage that offer pick up which is fantastic after a long day on the trails. I will definitely be back. Thank you both!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute place! Felt right at home! It was super convenient how close to the Iron City Race Track it was making the drive worth it! Better than any hotel we would've stayed at!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's home is a beauty in the country. Huge front/side yard. As we walked in, it was very clean and wonderfully decorated. It smelled of fresh linens and looks exactly like the photos. Very cozy. He provided everything we needed for the kitchen so that was a huge plus for us. Each bedroom had its own theme which made it feel more homey. Also, I liked that they offered different pillows of soft, firm, and cooling gels. Being from the country, I loved it had a nice seating area outside on the back deck. I enjoyed how peaceful it was to drink my coffee and watch the cardinals from there. There is a grocery store about 4 miles from the home. Our commute was to Gastonia and was only about a 30 to 40 minute drive. We would definitely recommend Robert's home. Robert is an excellent host. Very responsive and friendly. We had a storm come through and he checked on us and told us where to find a lantern if needed. 5 star stay!! Thank you again!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Robert is a gracious and caring host. He made everything extremely easy and accommodating when I arrived. His communication was timely and accurate. And he was extremely responsive to all of my questions. The home is an oasis in a rural area, with beautiful plants and landscaping all around the house. Would highly recommend the home and Robert to any guests who are looking for a quiet “country” stay. Thank you, Robert."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Robert and his family were amazing host's and the cabin was amazing with so many homely touches me and my family felt so very welcomed. There was plenty of wild life to see and hear and they had a beautiful blooming garden quite close that was so wonderful to watch grow and change everyday. I would recommend this to all my family and friends and anyone giving this a read. It is definitely worth the stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at Roberts play and I must say it was great like the first. Very clean, comfortable, friendly quit and relaxing place. Looking forward to staying again if the opportunity arises."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is BEAUTIFUL! The photos don’t do it JUSTICE! I am a country girl at heart & I love love love the country and the scenery which is what attracted me to this lovely home. This home is EVERYTHING! It is secluded, quiet, & finding this location was not hard at all! And if you’re from the country you know the country is prone to having “ country bugs ” listen to me, I didn’t see ONE BUG! Not a fly or anything & I loved that as well! My family and I drove in from Texas & upon entering this home we felt as if we never left Texas. We had everything we needed and even things we didn’t realize we needed! Robert even checked in on us personally & I loved that because it is very seldom that I actually meet the host in person. 5 stars just isn’t enough for this stay! This home needs 10! You will not be disappointed!! If you need a place to get away and reflect, this is the place for you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with my family about a month while waiting to close on a house. Nice quiet location, and the house has all the modern comforts you'd expect. The owner was very responsive and helpful. Very family friendly. Great stay overall!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent service and neatness
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice stay...peaceful. We cooked out on the provided gas grill. The view of the river is very calming. The kitchen was stocked nicely. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! It was very clean and private. The instructional videos were very helpful. The host (Jeff) was super responsive and patient. I hope to book this place again when I visit family in the area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay and I will be going back. I had to leave in a hurry due to some family stuff but would have booked longer if I could.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was just as listed on the site it’s beautiful the surrounding is peaceful everything worked out great I would definitely be booking again in the future
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay here and they were super responsive and easy to communicate with.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to get away in quite the remote location. I did not get to spend as much time as I had hoped on the porch just watching the river go by, spending most of my time away. Just know that it is definitely remote, so driving in at night can be a bit of an adventure. Getting into the door was relatively easy, though a little tricky opening both locks. I felt secure in the setting."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this trip here. So peaceful and quiet, no one bothered us. definitely will be going back here again. Highly recommend this spot."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and i had a great time and stay at Watson's place. i like that it was on a river and was very peaceful. only downfall was it was just a bit tucked in the land and was a 15 min plus drive to get food and supplies. location distance between Charlotte and Asheville was what i was looking for just wish amenities were a little closer and more option. The place was perfect for me and my son and was the type of getaway i was looking for me and him. the set up of the RV was very nice. had a nice rustic feel and a nice deck that was created for the place. I would say a slight downfall would be that there was not any wifi, but i think that help my son and i find more things to do together and bond more. so i would not give that a negative mark."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved this place! The view of the river was amazing and the area was very quiet, almost as if time has stopped. We found great hiking near by and a surprising number of good places to eat. We'll definitely be back!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great last minute stay will return!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect! Plenty of room for two (much larger than you'd expect for an RV), on a lovely piece of property. Ideal for a getaway or home base for exploring. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place for our two day get away. Location was very private and quiet. Home was extremely clean and everything we needed was provided. Host was great communicator. Due to cold weather, we did not take advantage of the welcoming front porch that overlooked the river, but plan to do so when we return. Kitchen was stocked with essentials including coffee pods. Seating in living area was comfortable. Fireplace in bedroom provided great ambiance. We brought several DVDs and enjoyed the surround sound system. updated pull down u blinds throughout provided all the privacy you could want. Pictures on listing are great representation of the home. Thanks to host for a secluded unique retreat!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice quiet spot for the week. Looking forward to checking it out again in the spring.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and location. Will definitely book again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! The pictures did not do it justice. It is very clean, well maintained and is in a beautiful location. It is warm and cozy and felt like home. I loved the front porch! It is so relaxing to sit and watch the river and listen to its rippling water. Watson is a wonderful host. Very responsive to massages and even sent videos with instructions on how to work everything like the thermostat, gas stove etc. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and will definitely be back. Well worth the money!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great host
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cute and comfortable. This place is a real gem!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, WARM, CLEAN.
We have verizon and had no issues with connection, was kinda hopeful that we could not connect...kinda. i honestly am the problem lol. My adhd gets the best of me in perfect silences, but not hear. It did rain for our stay but it didnt matter. The porch!!! Omg. The rain on the metal roof, the perfect static from the river, i truely didnt miss my phone. I actually lost it for a whole day cause i forgot where i sat it and didnt even realize till about time to check on the minions at home. Cookware, dishes, good size fridge, bed was great, i want the couch, its just a cool couch lol. Super clean!!! Never saw anyone except just driving by in the drive way which was only twice, and didnt hear anyone. Ohhhhh bruh theres this little fat squirrel, he hangs out top and in the tree he runs down the beam and gives ya the stank eye. He also peeps in the top window in the living area little creeper."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and secluded! Property was clean and very well kept. Access was easy and the host was very helpful with communication. The property was really clean and in great condition. Had everything you needed for your stay! Enjoyed this location and amenities!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great peaceful place! It is deep in the forest and right on the river. We fished and enjoyed the views. If you do fish, be aware of trees and bushes. We lost a few lures but still had fun. The water was fast moving and shallow. The sound system in the house was nice and we watched a couple dvds. We will consider this place again if in the area."
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect kept, interior is a darker design, and lots of shade outdoors, and a little rugged roadway. Tv n dvd needed explanation, didn’t end up watching it. Has a nice table and some comfort."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,definitely recommend watson is an amazing host had a great time
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This location was exactly as described & pictures were spotted on! Very peaceful & private! We will definitely stay again if we need to!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved it! Loved the view very peaceful had a great time will definitely be going back!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’d love to stay here again. Some things weren’t in places where they should be, but I eventually found them with help from the host and put them back where they should be. The host was helpful.
Some minor things didn’t work, like the porch lights, some blinds, and the bedroom door. But for a quiet place with peaceful surroundings at an affordable price, I’d say it was overall a good stay."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Lack of TV. Kitchen could have been better equipped. Lights on porch not working. Glad we stayed only two nights
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"View of River was nice! And sound of the River peaceful. We enjoyed using the picnic table and campfire with our 9 yr-old granddaughter. The camper was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The covered porch was also great, and had a little outdoor kitchen area that my husband used in the early morning so as to not wake our granddaughter up. We went to another granddaughter’s competition at a farm that was about 15 minutes away. With 3 hours between her scheduled events we were close enough to pop back to the camper for lunch and relax awhile. It looks like there may be a seasonal Kayak rental 2 doors down to the left. The public access to the river near the kayak rental was used by a Kayak according to tracks left in mud. Access is overgrown. Bring a grill tank with fuel if expecting to grill. Or bring charcoal - there was a small charcoal grill."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place to stay. My only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer. Everything is clean and the area is extremely peaceful. Just as described.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here and will be back! We had an event in Casar , so really didn’t have time to spend at the camper, but we will be back to just spend some time relaxing here!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding in Every Way ! Well Done .
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place exactly as described
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The fifth wheel was probably the nicest one we have ever been in. The cabinets were beautiful and the space ample. We felt very comfortable and wished we had booked it for 2 nights so we could have just sat on the porch for a day and relaxed. We would recommend bringing whatever meals you would like to prepare/eat while staying as it is quite a way to town.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place right on the river. Wish i didnt have to cut my trip short. Hopefully i coukd tent in again one day under better circumstances.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely setting by the river, neighbors were quiet, peaceful location. Listing matches both pics and description."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here yet again! So relaxing and everything you could need to stay there comfortably. The river was very clear this time and ended our stay with a magnificent thunderstorm! We hope to come back again soon! Thank you!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderful for a nature lover I ready to come back already. I wish I had more time.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were not sure what we should expect as to whether the pics portraying the camper inside and out were true to real-life or not. But they were, and we were not disappointed. We are already talking about when we might have a return visit."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Serene and clean
Would stay there again"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Don’t hesitate to book this one! It’s a wonderful relaxing place and very much ready to rest and rejuvenate with everything you could need to enjoy. The river is peaceful and neighbors are very kind. Thank you so much! We will 100% be back - bring your own tubes to float the river 🙌
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place to relax. Place was clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is a great experience! I really enjoy the comfort of an RV. It is homey and compact. Watson's RV is more than expected. It has a very nice porch. The inside is super nice and clean. The bed is very comfortable and the pull out couch is such a nice addition. The built-in surround speaker system makes listening to music and watching movies a nice experience. I plan to book again very soon!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful. There’s no reception so we weren’t able to scan the QR codes that tell you how to use the gas stove. But we enjoyed cooking outside.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cozy and nice spot to just relax
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful place to relax and sleep. I wasn't there to fish but if you want a nice fishing trip, this would be a great choice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very peaceful and quiet. the camper was spotless.we didn't get to spend as much time as I would have liked to there due to visiting friends but I would definitely recommend Watsons camper if you need to just get away and relax.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a really cool place on the river.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fun little getaway only an hour from Charlotte. Only a 12 minute drive to a local trailhead if you want to get your feet in the river. There is no access to the river at this site.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I highly recommend Watson’s RV. You would never know it’s a camper. The most comfortable place I’ve stayed at. We are already planning on booking again 😊

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cozy place to stay a few nights. Everything was just as promised and clean. Watson was very quick to respond with any questions I had and also checked on me after my stay. Would do it all over again. Very pleased!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great. Perfect for a couple’s getaway that need a peaceful and private place to stay. Cozy RV, clean, great location and the host was always attentive and asking if we needed anything. 10/10 will absolutely be coming back for another stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The camper by the river was truly a relaxing and peaceful time for my girlfriend and I. The land and the camper had everything we needed to have an enjoyable time. We will be back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This camper by the river was awesome. My son and I had a peaceful time that we couldn’t ever get back home. We both feel refreshed and recharged and can’t wait to bring the whole family back next time and hopefully for a lot longer stay. The camper had everything we needed to make it a 5 star camping experience. Thanks again for letting us stay.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at this property was great for the price. The kitchen is small and it can be a challenge to cook but definitely do-able. Furniture is pretty comfy and the decor is warm and inviting. The area is nice and the property is close to plenty of attractions and good eateries (We recommend trying the Carolina Cafe if your not on a diet). All in all definitely a comfy stay if your looking to stay in the Gaffney area.

The Rv was a great experience. Our kids loved it! Beautiful animals that are friendly. Everything was great for us. This is really something you have to see in person. I definitely recommend this Rv. The Host was amazing! Both her and her husband did a great job with explaining information about the RV and surrounding area. What ever we needed they provided. We even had a lesson on how to care for farm animals. Not to offend you see clean animals. All their animals was well taken care of and we loved it. If you are looking to find some peace this is the place for you. The noise from the roosters did not bother us. You could barely hear them from inside. Everything matched the description. The whole experience was a amazing for my family. We would book again if in the area."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cute little apartment was perfect for my husband and me to spend a few days near our daughter and new son-in-law. The bed was comfy and we had lots of hot water in the shower. We cooked breakfast in a couple of days and enjoyed some quiet late nights together. It was a good location with easy access to everything we needed. Check this place out!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley’s listing was just as described I liked that she mentioned that the stairs are steep. Be mindful that there is a club on the same strip as the apartment so at night it gets loud. You do feel a bit intimidated by the amount of noise that you hear outside. I would say the one thing missing was a full body mirror other than that this airbnb felt like home. If we come back to Gaffney would stay here once again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An AWESOME place to stay!! Ashley's LARGE & beautiful condo boasts LOTS of soft, fluffy towels, cozy beds with high end linens, tasteful modern decor, full-size dressers, & nice sized closets with plenty of hangers. The AC/heat & washer/dryer worked perfectly, & the condo is close to everything downtown. It was also SQUEAKY CLEAN! Ashley provided plenty of paper towels, toilet paper, trash can liners, soap, shampoo & body wash, dish & laundry soap, COFFEE, bottled water and chocolates, too! Everything is new & fresh! READ THE LISTING ABOUT THE STEEP STAIRS & THE TRAINS nearby. I'm 50+ but went up & down the stairs just fine (thankfully, my strong husband took my suitcase up & down for me.) I slept with EARPLUGS and didn't have any issues. The neighborhood was a touch noisy at times with people out having fun over the weekend, but I felt perfectly safe inside Ashley's condo. And parking is right outside the door! Can't wait to stay here again!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time! The city of Gaffney is so cute and everyone is so friendly!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Ashley’s place was was one of the best experiences I’ve had with Airbnb. On top of being very helpful and responsive, she’s a great host who goes above and beyond to make her guests feel right at home.
Great location if you like local restaurants and attractions, everything’s within walking distance. As far as the space is concerned the pictures don’t do it proper justice, it’s so much bigger and better than you can imagine…forget you’re in Gaffney while you’re there.
I recommend it to anyone coming through, book with confidence you definitely won’t regret it."

Cost isn't outrageous and the house had all you needed and very clean. They had an abundance of cleaning supplies as well
Check in was a breeze. The owner was very proactive and accommodating. Ensured that there wasn't anything needed and we were able to check in early with no issues.
Big surprise were the chickens on site which my family had a ball feeding and gathering eggs.
The only con was that there was only 1 TV to use which was in the main living room. The TVs in the bedrooms worked but weren't connected to any service."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Yekaterina's Place was wonderful. We felt at home and there was plenty of space for all 6 of us. We loved the chickens and the back patio. We had 4 automobiles and parking was a breeze. The home was absolutely spotless! It looked just like the photos and the descriptions given. We had everything we needed for our 2 week stay. Yekaterina and Marina were responsive and helpful with any questions we had. We could not have asked for better hosts. Also, the locals were friendly and welcoming.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect. Calm and quiet .The kitchen was well stocked and had current appliances. Lots of room in the bathroom and bedroom. We felt welcome. Even though it’s next to the main home they are extremely conscious of the guests privacy. Loved the fenced in yard for the dogs.

Very responsive yet gave us our privacy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for ppl and dogs! Fenced yard is great. Surroundings are peaceful.

Thank you for a comfortable and memorable stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy cabin with sweet NEIGH-bors (lol) was just what I needed. From the view on the drive up to the peaceful surroundings, I had all I needed for a great stay. My dog Ruby loved having the fenced yard to roam in.
DJ went above and beyond with printed instructions and well as by email. There was a long list of recommendations - I tried two: Mon Amie Morning Cafe and Willy Taco. Both were wonderful!
Ruby and I went hiking at Croft State Park and enjoyed the beautiful colors of a South Carolina fall. (We are from Florida so we don't get much of that).
Thank you, DJ and Cat, for a lovely few days."

We are looking at coming back again in the future.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Short but amazing stay at this fabulous cabin on the farm. DJ and Catherine have thought of everything to make their guests feel welcome, comfortable and relaxed. Even had a stunning bouquet of Cat's Cut Flowers waiting for us when we arrived! Farm is so peaceful, gorgeous sunrise over the pastures with horses grazing, private feel yet good wifi and just a short drive into downtown Spartanburg. Bedding was so comfortable, cabin was fresh and clean, fenced in yard was large and perfect for our lab. Incredibly friendly, helpful and responsive owners with great recommendations for restaurants and local things to see. Will absolutely stay here again if we find ourselves in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the tiny house this weekend. It had everything we needed and our dogs love the fenced in yard.

This is a slice of heaven I’ll surely return to next time I’m in the Upstate!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was exactly what we needed. The location and area were beautiful. DJ was respectful of our personal space and privacy.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This precious tiny house log cabin on a horse farm couldn’t have been more perfect for us and the dogs! The fenced in front yard was so much bigger than in the pictures and the dogs had a blast being able to run around outside whenever they wanted, occasionally saying hello to their farm friends, Brumby and Marshal! When we walked in, we immediately noticed how good it smelt and how clean EVERYTHING was. In addition, we normally travel with extra items from the kitchen, including spices, but DJ & Cat had everything we needed. There was a plethora of towels, extra blankets and pillows, travel coffee cups, laundry detergent, and so much more. The bed was insanely comfortable and I loved how dark and cold (a/c and ceiling fan!) we could make the room! Best nights sleep and one of our favorite Airbnbs. Definitely will stay here again when in the area!"

The hosts are very responsive to any needs that arise and the fenced-in yard is large enough for my big dog and safe enough for my little one!

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great cabin! The amenities were abundant and the quiet locale was a great place for a very peaceful rest. I feel lucky to have stumbled on this great out of the way place.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny house is so cute, and if you have ever watched the show Tiny House Nation and wondered what it would be like to stay in one, here is your opportunity. Everything you could possible need/want is there. the bed is comfortable, and it was a fun get away."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a hidden gem! Nestled in a unique spot that puts you just minutes away from something for everyone! Couples and families alike would enjoy this quaint little cabin! It was sparking clean and had a fully equipped kitchen with a washer/dryer! DJ & Cat have made sure you have all the little things we travelers tend to forget, like great soap and shampoo to laundry products. The crisp clean linens with super soft blankets were a warm welcome after our journey. The futon was perfect for us all to cuddle up and watch a family movie and quickly transition it to a soft bed for the twins. While compact, there was plenty of room here for my family if 4 PLUS our 2 fur babies! DJ & Cat love dogs as well as their horses and have thoughtfully designed this space with its OWN fenced in area! The cabin has a small covered front porch and the yard itself is shaded by large trees. Your fur babies will be as happy as ours to be able to come with you on your stay!
While the best tips came from the “cheap sheets” Cat has for you in the cabin, TripAdvisor will also show you the TONS of things to do and see right near.
I highly recommend this place for even just a weekend getaway! Although the next time we go, we will be staying longer!!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good space, secluded yet close to stores and the highway. I good space to relax or a small couple getaway."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The front pasture is very pretty, especially when the horses are out there. The guide left for nearby wineries was a nice touch and we visited two during our stay. This is a great place to sneak away to for an “unplugged” weekend although there is WiFi and a TV. The house is very close to where the hosts live so we kept the curtains partially drawn. The space wasn’t as clean as we expected based on prior reviews but the hosts quickly came over to correct this. We loved the fence which allowed for our dog to roam around and still say hello to the two dogs that live there. Overall, great location to get away and relax without draining your budget."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sparking clean, excellent and prompt communication, simple check in and all the amenities you need to have a perfect stay! This quaint tiny cabin feels like a regular home. Beautifully decorated and surrounded by nature as well as beautiful horses. Catherine and DJ are wonderful hosts.

I HIGHLY recommend it!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cabin was extremely clean, perfect size, and extremely well priced without huge cost of cleaning fee as some locations have. The mattress was new, firm, and extremely comfortable with no sagging in the middle. It was also nice to have the selection of different types of pillows to sleep on! Most places have saggy flat pillows. Would HIGHLY recommend this cabin to anyone."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little tiny cabin has been my home away from home for about 4 weeks! By far my very favorite ever.

This is YOUR place if you or your family are in this area! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What can I say? If u look at how many reviews I have written it speaks what words can describe.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"DJ’s space was perfect! Incredibly clean, great directions and a quick, beautiful 15 min drive to downtown Spartanburg. My husband, dog and I were relocating to the area and stayed here for a week prior to moving into our home.

Thank you!"

The beds were very comfortable, plenty of towels and extra linens. The futon was an easy place to lay for the kiddos during the day and a second bed at night. The fenced in yard was clutch.

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WHAT A WONDERFUL PLACE! It looks small in the pictures and it’s certainly cozy, but it has all the appeal of a log cabin with the modern features we’ve all grown accustomed to.

We walked into cool AC, chilled fruit, cold waters and sodas in the refrigerator, there was a Keurig machine and he was even nice enough to leave K-Cups. We refilled a lot of it when we left the next person who stayed there, because it was simply the right thing to do. It had everything you needed such as towels, soap and other amenities that the owner went out of the way to provide. A great place for a quiet getaway. Everything you would expect and more.

There were potential locking issues with the front door, however, prior to our arrival Jared made us aware which in turn did not present a problem. My family and I were abundantly aware of a moisturized odor that enveloped the entire living space, perhaps that others would not notice. We combated it with some air fresheners, febreeze and dryer sheets on the vents. Otherwise, the stay was par."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely adorable and so so so cozy!! Jared and his wife have a lovely Airbnb equipped with comfort and spot on accommodation. I flew to Gaffney to visit my boyfriend and wanted a place that wouldn’t be too far from his parents’ house and to just stay close to the local area. This place sits conveniently close to everything you need from a small town and just offers that comfortable, cozy feeling of living in a wonderful little home. It’s super clean, updated and modern (with still a touch of classic and dreamy), and spacious enough for a couple and their 1 or 2 children.
The lighting in this house is beautiful. I’m a sucker for natural lighting (it lifts my spirits) and this little house is just beautiful during the day when the sun peaks in through windows.
Jared and his wife communicate very well as hosts and even left a suggestion book for places close by and activities to do. It was just an overall fantastic stay and experience. Thank you for having us!! We will definitely stay here again in the future!!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable and comfortable little cabin which was very easy to access and host is on site for anything you need. Adorable sheep and goats and dogs and one cat that stayed on the front porch actuating to get in. I guess he really liked us lol.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Thank you for such a beautiful place. Everything was spectacular and perfect for our stay. Amazing host. Best stay in our books
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! It's a gorgeous above-garage apartment that is very spacious, updated, clean, and is on an absolutely beautiful piece of land. Getting there was easy, getting inside was even easier, and Carly's instructions were very easy to follow for WiFi and everything else that we needed. :-)
Beautiful surroundings, an amazing host, and a very comfortable and clean apartment - overall, I would highly recommend! We'll definitely be staying there the next time that we come through!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our second stay here and it's wonderful - comfortable and homey. The shower head has great water pressure, the bed is so comfortable with really nice sheets and comforter, and the host is friendly and accommodating. It's a very peaceful place to be!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First let me just say that Carly, the host, is Wonder Woman incognito.
Honestly, I have no idea how this amazing mom of what?... 4?... 5?! young babes had the courage to up and leave her career in nursing and start a working farm AND air bnb! Talk to her and hear her story, you'll find both truly inspiring.
The Farm Apartment:
Super cute, stylish/up to date, comfortable, and is well stocked with supplies for any needs a guest may have.
The bed is soooo comfy and fluffy, we loved it so much we actually ended up purchasing the same bedding when we returned home!

The apartment is surprising very, VERY clean. Keep in mind here, this rental IS on a working farm so you WILL see life.... which means insects (outside and in). Very few and also harmless.... its a farm. If you're mindful of what you are renting and reasonable with your expectations of nature and you'll LOVE it!!!
Overall 10 of 10!!!
Highly recommend this gem!!!
P.S. Theres a private campfire too!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was just meant to be an easy place to leave our stuff at as we had a wedding to attend in Shelby however it ended up being the cutest place that I didn't want to leave! Between the reading nook, fresh bagels (cinnamon sugar was amazing), the peaceful surroundings, and the barn cats - it was honestly perfect. The place was clean, Carly was extremely friendly and always responsive if we needed anything (also super flexible to our terrible check-in timing!!). We will absolutely be back again with time to tour the farm. Our favorite part though? The cute little black barn cat that insisted on hanging out with us in the apartment, hehe. Thanks Carly + Family!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Carly’s AirBnB the week of our wedding.

We stayed for three nights, with a 2 and 4 year old, it rained none stop for 24 hours and we still had a peaceful, fun, relaxing, interesting and welcoming stay. Carly and her three girls took us to meet the 4 hour old baby goats and see her other animals. They spent over 90 mins with us, answering our questions and showing us new experiences. The place is comfy and cute and bigger than we thought. There is a playground area, places to drink early morning cups of tea and coffee (along with the rooster’s call) and great things in Gaffney. (Recommend the Peachoid, Wilkins Jolly flee market and John’s Ice cream. We would love to visit again for a weekend of peace and family time. Thank you, Carly! You’re great!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Giving Marina only 5 stars feels like a disservice!
The day of our trip to Gaffney, she was also very proactive in her communication, and even made herself available should we need any assistance upon arrival.
Walking in, we were SO IMPRESSED! The decor is modern and incredibly charming. It is very apparent that she has spent a lot of time, and effort in putting this together.
The house was spotless and smelled freshly clean, but the amenities are what made our stay extra special. The whole house is fully stocked with anything you could possibly need. She really has thought of everything!
There are games galore to play, kids toys, a small office space with a printer, extra toiletries, blow dryer, curling irons, a TV in every room, extra blankets, the list goes on and on.
The backyard had a firepit and a hammock. It was a little cold for us outside as we stayed in November but it would be perfect for a nice spring or summer evening! I would give Marina 100 stars if I could!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place! stayed with our 3 children for a baseball tournament in Gaffney and it was 10 mins from the facility and easy to find. perfect for a family! felt right at home... it is stocked like someone lives there, not a rental.

The place is very clean, beds are super comfy, and Marina made sure to checked in several times to make sure everything was taken care of for us.

It also sits on a fairly quiet road with lots of open space around the area which is a great plus! 5/5 stars!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed our stay! Comfy beds and nice fluffy towels in the bathroom. The kitchen was spacious and the washer and dryer worked very well! My husband commented on how clean the floors were as he walked around in his socks! The wi-fi was great as my husband works remotely. Marina checked in with us almost daily and made sure everything was up to our expectations. We will definitely visit again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Clean and organized with labeled cabinets and drawers in the kitchen. The blankets were so soft and cozy. The furniture was comfortable. Had board games, foosball and a box full of toys for the little ones. I loved how she provided makeup wipes, face masks and hair styling tools! Had pots and pans, condiments, seasoning, glassware and a cute popcorn machine. She always respond to my texts in a matter of minutes and kept in touch the entire time. If you plan on staying here do not think twice about it and book it before someone else does!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marina must have a hospitality background because she has it all together.
I think this was the cleanest home I have stayed in yet. The furnishings are tasteful and comfortable.
Her attention to the little extra amenities...coffee, snacks, filtered water, luxurious towels, private yard for the pooch...were above and beyond. Everything was spotless. I also love that the kitchen cabinets/drawers were labeled and she had all the instruction manuals together so no fumbling around trying to figure out how an appliance works and/or worrying about breaking it. I have been in homes where I couldn't even figure out how to power up the tv so these extra measures are much appreciated.
Thank you, Marina!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here with our children, and it made life so much easier. Had toys, a popcorn maker, coffee, plenty of room for the kids… everything was clean and smelled good. The house is super cute and has everything we needed for our stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would gladly stay here again. The house was perfect for what we needed, the description was spot on, it was clean, and the owner stayed in communication the whole time. 5 stars. Strongly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and a great place to stay… if your booking in gaffney this is definitely they way to go
,,,"I was very disappointed with this booking. The host failed to list the train or other loud noises such as barking dogs 24/7.
The train blares through town all day and at night; it's worst at night on a continuos pass through every 2-3 hours. The freight train blares the horn for 1-3 minute increments. We have videos of this situation and could prove our concerns.
Sleeping here was nearly impossible. After 2 days we notified the host of the circumstances. We couldn't bare it anymore.
We decided to leave and requested a full refund for the remaining 2 days. I notified ABNB and they said the host
Gloria denied our request even though though said she would work with us.
She was dishonest and not transparent. We did not get reimbursed and ABNB Admin did not show support to the patrons only to the host.
This was a very bad experience for me and for my husbands 1st time staying in an ABNB.
We lost our money and kept our sanity but they lost a guest and a lifetime client."
