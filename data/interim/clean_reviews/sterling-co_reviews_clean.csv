Everything was very clean, and it had everything we needed: full length mirror, handheld mirror, fans, extra pillow.

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Good, if small, space for an economy minded traveler. Reasonably updated, good bathroom, simple but basic kitchen.
Only problem was bedding that smelled of cologne, which I‚Äôm sharing. Also, unless you are agile and have some strength, getting down the entry stairs with bags might be a challenge. It‚Äôs a squeeze, but I managed."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I just had another nice stay and have another stay coming up in a week! I like the location as it is close to my job. There are a few hotels and motels in the area to choose from but frankly don't compete. This stay is much more affordable than the hotels and way nicer than places with similar rates.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There aren't many low cost airbnbs out there, but Bruce's surely is. If you're traveling through the Fort Morgan area, it makes for a clean and comfortable overnight. Good wifi, friendly pup, off street parking. It is in a basement, so you'll need to navigate 5 or 6 steps with your belongings, but no problem -just be careful. Would stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really good price for a few nights stay compared to other options such as hotels and motels. This stay had everything I could need and was close to the St Elizabeth hospital. Which is great because I was staying in town bc I was on-call.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for almost 3 weeks for a work assignment. Everything was great! Good location, easy check in, and a quiet, comfortable space. The kitchen is well-equipped and they even thought to add a hot plate for my long stay. The hosts were very responsive and helpful.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Bruce‚Äôs place was a great stay and they were very pleasant and accommodating when we arrived a little before check in time. It was a cozy basement apartment that felt right at home. The bed was a blow up mattress, but the price was right!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved Brice's house! Very comfy, but also incredibly spacious!! You can see he is in the process of fixing the house up and he's done a wonderful job with the bathroom and kitchen ‚ù§Ô∏è The in home movie theater was so fun, too. My husband enjoyed it just as much as my kids! Lol We also had to leave early for my husbands job and Brice was so understanding about it which we appreciated so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è He was also very quick with his responses and to help us with anything we needed!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was in a really peaceful neighborhood, everything that we needed is walking distances from the house, store, food, restaurants, etc. The place was just like it was described in the description, I highly recommend it."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed for 8 nights. It was very enjoyable, very quiet neighborhood. Brice was very helpful and kind. He is very friendly and flexible with check in and check out."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, not super impressed with this home in Fort Morgan, Co.
Home was not clean upon arrival: dried urine on the toilet, last tenants personal shampoo left in the shower, dirty/dusty floors, etc.
Some items mentioned in profile were not included/available: coffee, hair dryer, etc.
Projector setup in the main room was not functional and/or was not intuitive to use.
Home is pet friendly with a fenced in backyard, but dog owners beware - the backyard is largely unkept and full of stickers/thorns. Our dog unfortunately got injured by the thorns so we didn‚Äôt allow him in the yard.
A couple of the beds were not on bed frames, but rather box springs directly on the floor. Many of the blinds were broken. Siding was falling off the home. Broken outdoor furniture on deck.
Could be a great little stay with some TLC. Owner was very prompt, proactive and a pleasure to work with."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was not impressed with the house mostly because it was not clean on check in. urine on the floor in the bathroom, dishes in the dishwasher, and dust and dirt on the floor. The bedroom and bathroom downstairs wete not cleaned at all before arrival. Only one bed was made up for use. After speaking with the host I opted to move the bedding to the bed that was actually on a bed frame. While moving the bedding it was obvious that the space between the box spring and the mattress was not clean. I could not get the projector to work. there were no instructions on how to use it. I ended up watching movies on my tablet my whole stay. I cleaned the bathroom, kitchen counter, and put the dishes away that were in the dishwasher. The house has potential to be really cute. My stay was not ideal but it was better than staying in a hotel for a week. The host is responsive and did offer to come back to make the bed but I declined."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Brice was a great host and responded very quickly when we had a small key issue. I would book again with Brice if we're ever in the area again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed for a week for our Grandsons 1st birthday. Was so nice to have a whole house that 6 adults could stay at with a living room, dining room and kitchen. Sure beat having to spend $ on three separate hotel rooms. Bruce was easy to work with and very responsive."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would come again! We were looking for location to see the HGTV‚Äôs Home takeover projects! The kitchen was well renovated and met our needs! Plenty of space for multiple guests. Brice was attentive and welcoming!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an enjoyable time on our first visit to the area. Brice's place was spotless, easy to find and had comfortable beds that gave us a great night's rest. Brice communicated promptly to our inquiries and was a very kind and considerate host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brice's place was exactly what we needed for our group. The beds were really comfortable, it was close to interstate, private driveway to park your car, the area was quiet and we felt safe there. Brice adds some cool gadgets to the house like the projector, speakers and coffee maker to make the place unique!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Brice was very friendly and offered to meet us at the house. The house was very clean and the beds very comfortable. Could have had a few more items in the house but had pretty much what we needed for our stay. I would love to stay there again if we are in the area.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, a clean place, though the basement was a little dirty. There was an odd smell in the air outside-not good."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable place to stay while in the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in a well kept older neighborhood that is surprisingly quiet considering it's central location.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, gracious host, would definitely return again if in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Josh and Leslie went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They prepped the kitchen with a bunch of snacks, had new full size toiletries for our use, dropped off an extra heater in case of colder weather, and were super responsive to any messages. They also had good recommendations for where to eat in town! Thanks for a nice stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was cute. Clearly a lot of effort has been put into restoring the older (1910s?) property. It was nicely decorated with comfortable furniture. Josh left us a lot of snacks, including the proverbial chocolate on the pillow. The soap smelled good and there were a number of different products to choose from. Plenty of extra supplies (paper towels, plastic bags, dish soap, etc.) were provided.
Sterling/NE Colorado isn't exactly a big tourist destination, but we were visiting relatives and explored the town a bit, and this location was within walking distance (less than a mile, with sidewalks the whole way) to all the little shops and cafes.
When we originally made the reservation, we had some questions that Josh answered almost immediately."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here about a week ago. Brice was a great host. We had to check-out earlier and he was very helpful with adjusting the reservation. Location is ok. Property isn't fully fenced so if you have pets you'll have to walk them on a leash. The unit itself is decent. Comfortable beds and a lot of natural light comes in which was nice.

Checkin was a breeze with signs leading us to the private parking area.

The seating in all areas was comfortable also.

The hot tub was toasty and a welcome soak after a long drive through a couple fierce thunderstorms. Overall, the house is as pictured and described."

We loved everything our host offered."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the house and yard! Very nice house lots of goodies and extras! Wish we would've had the time to enjoy the tub! The only thing I would change would be to add a top sheet to the beds. Very quiet!!! Will stay here again!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shawna's place was perfect for us. We needed a safe place to stay for a night where we could park our trailer and not worry about it getting broken into. The home itself was lovely. It was very spacious, comfortable and clean! She had everything we needed to cook dinner and have relaxing night before we hit the road again. Shawna was so kind and helpful. She made sure we were comfortable with where we parked the trailer. Would stay there again and highly recommend the spot!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Shawna's place was a perfect spot for a one night stop on our road trip with our pups!

We especially loved the comfortable bed, big family room tv and tree swing. Shawna was also very helpful and responsive. Location is a quick couple minute drive to the downtown area with restaurants, grocery store, and parks. Would recommend 10/10 if you need a large and private space in the Ft Morgan area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a dream ~ exceeded expectations. There were so many personal touches and the home really did feel like ""Home away from Home""

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super helpful with directions and check in. It was very quiet and peaceful.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house looks newly remodeled. Floors wood and/or laminate, perfect for pets as was the fenced in yard for airing them. Large living room and kitchen. Good snacks, plenty of bagged ice in freezer upon our arrival. Shawna responded immediately when we requested a pooper scooper. Beds very comfortable. Outside pictures show a very nice house, which it is, but it doesn't show a view from property outward. You are basically surrounded by buildings or privacy fence. But for us, that was fine since we were in the outdoors all day at a hunting lodge running our dogs in a hunt test. But if you are looking for a view in pastureland, this is not for you. They do have an area in back that you park in and is 100% secluded and private with a nice grill and hot tub which I think makes up for lack of view."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. Everything was amazingly clean and stocked. Felt like a home away from home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, easy stay, thanks for having us."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay here and the owner has thought of everything to make the stay go smooth. Simple check in and easy parking. Lightning fast Wi-Fi with plenty of bandwidth for HD streaming. The house was more than expected. Large, open areas inside. Spacious bedrooms and comfy beds. Bathroom was clean and fully stocked with everything from towels to toothpaste. Kitchen was stocked with coffee, spices for cooking and bags of ice in the freezer. We were surprised to see a smart tv in every bedroom! The 65"" tv in the living room made for an enjoyable game night on the PS5 and a chill spot for watching march madness. Our pets were allowed to vacation with us and they LOVED the large fenced in yard. The yard was clean and well kept with outdoor seating and swing. Hot tub was a huge perk. Piping hot with powerful jets. The house is tucked ofo of the main road for easy access to town or a quick route to the west to check out the mountains! We look forward to returning!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"this place was perfect for us - two adults and two dogs roadtripping to colorado. easy to get to off the highway, very clear instructions to get to and into the house. it was super clean and warm when we arrived and very quiet. the bed was very comfy, soft linens, and a nice big kitchen. shawna was very proactive and wanted to ensure that everything went smoothly. highly recommend!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, and well-furnished place with an amazing hot tub! Shawna is a superhost and very communicative! Everything was well thought out for a comfortable stay. The home is SUPER clean!
Unfortunately none of us in our group found the beds to be very comfortable. The king mattress is super plush with no support whatsoever. The double bed is a memory foam (enough said). The queen bed is firm, and somewhat comfortable but not the best. All seemed to be very cheap beds. The mattress quality would be the biggest area of improvement for an AirBNB at this price point."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time renting Airbnb . The home was a perfect ‚Äúfarmhouse‚Äù. Very open large living area. Cozy fireplace with plenty of wood that was supplied. Just nice overall !
Hot tub was great. Very impressed with Shawna the host. Very prompt and extremely kind and helpful with any and all questions we had during our stay.. Would definitely rent again."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, clean and easy access to the houseS"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This awesome AirBNB is tucked away off the main road. Unassuming on the outside, and beautiful, modern, clean on the inside. A stealthy hide away. easy to find, once you know what landmarks to look for. No garbage disposal, so be sure to put all food waste in a garbage bag. Highly recommend this property and Super host."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is perfect! Most comfortable Airbnb we‚Äôve ever been to. Super clean and lots of thoughtful touches that we appreciated. Even though the Airbnb is at the owner‚Äôs property it is very private and we really felt at home. The bed was amazing too! I wish we would have stayed longer. They deserve more than 5 stars!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Shawn‚Äôs renovated home. Bedding and linens are comfortable, slate and hardwood flooring (no carpet) nice furnishings, fenced yard, privacy. Shawna was very easy to communicate with. We recommend this place."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous country home with plenty of room to relax and great amenities.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shawna‚Äôs place is FANTASTIC! Everything was above and beyond expectations. We only stayed one night, but the yard is a very nice size for the dogs to run around in, and the kitchen is fully stocked! Shawna goes above and beyond for her guests and I would absolutely love to stay here again if I‚Äôm the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication all the way through the process. Easier than expected to find because the pictures are so up to date and clear directions.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I came to town to visit my mom and we went downtown and watched some of the filming of the show Hometown Takeover. Hometown Takeover picked Fort Morgan to do a show on.
I loved the newly remodeled fully stocked kitchen. The sweet treats they left for me were nice to have. You can really tell they are trying to update everything. The owner said that new windows and a Hot Tub are on order. I will definitely be back to enjoy the Hot Tub. The yard was peaceful and very relaxing. I watched them ride their horses that evening. The yard has nice solar lights."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a peaceful and pleasant stay with our dog Ruby. The yard has a fenced-in yard and Riverside Park is a nice place for walks a few minutes drive away.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect place to chill, sprawl and relax. Super clean and charming. This is a family homestead, obvious from the arched doorways, mature trees and cool, green lawn. Modern upgrades and three(!) bedrooms make it perfect for families or groups of friends. Spent a weekend here with my husband and our dog while we were cleaning out a family property and it was the perfect retreat for the weekend. Shawna was a great host and we would definitely come back."
2022-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"the host is generous in the linens, pillows, and towels in the home. the utility room - while the first thing you see when you walk in, along with the furnace & water heater - is big & a great multipurpose room for storing travel things/coolers/shoes/winter clothing, etc. the host is quickly responsive. but this is a double-edged sword as the airbnb and her home shares a sectioned off yard with a privacy fence. she & her family & their employees drive by the house multiple times a day, so the only real privacy is in the airbnb house with the curtains closed. and they make a point of inspecting you if you are in the yard. unfortunately, this was the first time I ever experienced racism, and it came in the form of this type of drive-by inspection and then the host & her husband invading the space we were renting from them. the host also tried to accuse us of damaging the sprinkler system as the irrigation system was programmed to run in the middle of the afternoon - prime time when kids or adults were in the yard; luckily, I am a landscape contractor & know how to inspect a sprinkler system for damage (everything worked fine upon inspection except 1 low-pressure or plugged nozzle, which was not our fault). I visit family in the area multiple times a year; I will not bring my family back to this location to stay; we will find other accommodations."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! My husband, daughter and I really enjoyed the space and private backyard. Shawna was super responsive and helped us with anything we needed."

This unassuming little cottage opens up to a seemingly whole nother world of luxurious modern ranch style comfort inside. An absolute steal at it‚Äôs rate. Ms Gina makes sure You‚Äôre provided anything needed, and extras from self pampering, to self help, in complimentary publications She‚Äôs authored.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit because I loved it so much! It is centrally located to my job sites and easy to get to (electronic maps will lead you astray-go to CR27 and look for the big brown pole barn). Sterling has some good restaurants-Parts & Labor brew pub, The Grill at River City, and others. Check out Mavs at Fort Morgan and Victor's Sushi in Brush. The place itself is peaceful and so quiet I could hear my heart beat. The small airport/landing strip was great! We loved watching the plains. If you are adventurous, Lindsey's dad will take you for a plane ride for a fee (I haven't worked up the courage for that yet) Lindsey is an awesome host!"

Great space, clean, plenty of seating to visit.
Easy to work with and very accommodating."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful and spacious. It was a little difficult to find with GPS, but we figured it out:) it was located on a small air strip, so we had fun watching the planes! (There were no noise issues with the planes) The views were absolutely beautiful"
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great stay, house was clean, and there was lots of room. We were a little disappointed as the AC listed was just a unit in the living room window and it was a hot weekend. But other than that it was perfect!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We used this house for a hunting trip. Spacious and clean with comfortable beds. Only tip would be to adjust the thermostats slowly to provide heat as it can get warm in there in a hurry. Great house and great host.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly owners!! Comfortable, country home!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect spot for our needs on a work trip to Sterling! Plenty of space and very friendly hosts.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the stay was amazing and I would recommend it to everyone
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place and great view
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay, but I do want people to be aware of one thing. When it says it has air conditioning, it means there is a wall unit in the main common area. This is obviously only a problem in the hottest times of the year. They supplied a couple floor fans, which helped direct the air to the back bedrooms, but it still was almost too hot at night and there aren‚Äôt any ceiling fans. Opening windows wasn‚Äôt the best option because a neighboring area had spread manure and at times the stink was overwhelming. The manure is not a criticism, I just like people to know what they are walking into so they can plan properly and be prepared. The host, however, was great, the home was clean and very comfortable. It‚Äôs definitely worth booking and I would do it again if we needed to, and would probably plan a stay during the cooler months."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to spend time out at North Sterling Reservoir, this is the place to stay! Only 25 minutes from the lake, place to plug your boat in, and plenty of accommodations including a nice gas grill."
2021-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,That place needs a lot of work all around the whole house and if you're having people stay even kids or women you might want to put thicker curtains up because that is ridiculous I could see right through those curtains all the way to the street lights out there so if I were to turn on my light someone can see inside I didn't feel like that was safe at all. And I do believe that sewer was backed up because I had a really nasty funky rotten smell in the kitchen. Felt like I was taking advantage of next time you get to any rentals I would go around and check and make sure that everything is good to go before you even think about renting that place
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All around a great place to stay yet
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Accommodations were perfect for our group once again. Thanks for the stay!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We needed a place for employees to stay for an extended period of time for a project in Sterling. The house was great and hosts we very friendly and helpful!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Roomy and secluded.
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great space and loved the location. In the country but very close to Sterling. We celebrated my great grandson's 1st birthday and the place was perfect for our needs. Would definitely stay again.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place worked perfect for our family. We were in town for a family wedding and loved having a space of our own. Family room with TV and pool table were great added features for some family fun in the evenings. We will definitely stay again.
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsay and her family were great to work with. It is a bit out of town, but nice to run away to at the end of a long day. Lots of room, big deck for a beautiful breakfast each morning. Views would have been far and wide, and we were there during some bad Colorado fires - Sadly this actually add to the beauty of the sunrise and sunset. Watching the planes take of each morning was exciting, they are little planes so they don't make much noise. It didn't bother me to hear them that early but it did others in the group. We hope to have this event again each year, and if we get it set up I would definitely use this place again for the sleeping arrangements."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was large and spacious plenty of room for everyone. The kitchen was stocked with all utensils you would need. It was pretty cool having the airstrip next to the house and watching the planes take off. The house could use central ac as it gets hot inside in the summer. Overall a great stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, exactly what we needed for our fishing tournament!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! Very accommodating

2019-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We weren‚Äôt given a way to get into the house and when we were, it didn‚Äôt work. We were locked out. There was no internet the whole time. But very clean and worth the value."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very quiet with a wonderful country view. We will definitely stay here again, highly recommend"
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was absolutely perfect and much better than expected. We had a great time and a lot of room. It is out of town just far enough yet close enough if you need anything. The landing strip is close so you get a 615 ‚Äúwake up call‚Äù, if noise bothers you get earplugs. Also the mosquitos were bad so bring bug spray. All in all though I would rent again!!! That is all part of the ambience of living in the country!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Myself, and 3 others, stayed here while doing some business in nearby Sterling. The house is conveniently located just outside of town. It is very peaceful and quiet, with a lot of space to spread out. The beds are comfortable, and the kitchen is well-stocked. Check-in and check-out are easy and quick. We really enjoyed our stay, and would stay here again."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It truly is the perfect landing! Everything you need for a relaxing stay is here or right up the road in town. Thanks Lindsey!
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great property. Plenty of space and nicely furnished.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and 3 of my friends stayed at Lindsey's place this past weekend. The house is very spacious, comfortable, and well-stocked. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Lindsey is very responsive and helpful -a wonderful host! We enjoyed it immensely and would return for another stay. I highly recommend it!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This house was better than expected. For a crew of workers that normally stay in hotels this made living on the road much more comfortable. Lindsey was great to work with and the house was very roomy. I would recommend this to anyone. If i ever have work around Sterling again this is definitely where i will be staying.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent place to stay while visiting. very nice people and great place to stay.

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice play to stay, easy check in"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"The space was clean and the host communicated efficiently at first. After check in as problems arose they were less easy to communicate with.
I‚Äôd say this place is great for a short stay or someone who doesn‚Äôt mind a louder environment.
I worked night shift and the lack of insulation was a problem for me trying to sleep during the day.
If there was anyone in the room next to me I could hear everything, word for word, as if they were in the same room.
The WiFi was so bad I had to go get a hotspot about it on my phone and when I asked the host about an extender or a suggestion of how to fix it or make it better their response was ‚Äúthis is just the way it is in the town‚Äù. So probably not the best place if you need WiFi.
My last complaint that I have is that I (again) could hear everything in the room next to me. As people checked in and out. When they came to clean they badmouthed the guests who had just stayed there. The first time they called this woman foul names and swore up and down about her. The second they badmouthed someone for saying the place wasn‚Äôt clean.
I felt this was extremely unprofessional to badmouth guests.
I canceled my reservation early because they would not accept a modification of the dates I had reserved.
I have no doubt that with the behavior I witnessed that I was probably added to the roster of guests that they badmouthed.
I will not stay with them again and I would not recommend it."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the joint/ shared open space.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"you will like it. As a travel healthcare provider myself, this place suits me very well."

,,,ASK FOR EXGERIOR PICTURES and parking location pics.
,,,"Host cancelled our reservations 20 hours before check in leaving us very few options to find accommodations. Then was unresponsive regarding the refund. I had to contact Air B&B direct to get a refund, but they were very helpful."
