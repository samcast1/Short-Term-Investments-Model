2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Condo was clean and organized. Decorated beautifully but also free of clutter and not over done. Directions were clear making check in easy. Beautiful view of the bay. Condominium was quiet and well maintained. Thanks for having us!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED staying here. Andy &Christy went above and beyond- even changed the code immediately when my Airbnb app altered me to suspicious activity (someone else had logged into my account) & gave me a great deal on an additional night request. Obviously that can‚Äôt happen all the time- and it hesitated to mention it as to not create an expectation for future guests- if they can, they will! And that makes all the difference I will definitely stay here again. The space is also amazing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was perfect for what I needed and was exactly like the pictures shown. Very quiet and the beach access is a quick 5 minute walk. The boardwalk is easily walkable as well. The extra amenities were great.. beach chairs, ice chest, iron/steamer. There was a miscommunication with the cleaners and Andy & Christy were quick to respond when I reached out upon arrival and had them promptly sent over in under an hour on a Sunday evening. I hope to visit again and would definitely stay at Andy & Christy‚Äôs!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"quiet, easy beach access, and nice view of the bay. 0.8 miles to the boardwalk‚Ä¶easy walk or drive. Great little condo‚Ä¶met all our needs!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! Would definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a quick getaway. Andy and Christy have done a great job making their place a little more modern and comfortable.
There‚Äôs nothing crazy about the building, but you can easily walk to the beach or a short golf cart ride to nearby areas! Perfect for a couple!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Bay View Condo. I booked last-minute for an unexpected few days off in early spring, and Andy and Christy's place was clean and well-stocked, even with short notice. The location is steps away from the bay, and the Gulf beach entrance is right across the street. It is quieter than some of the more ""downtown"" options but is still just a short walk (or an even shorter drive) to restaurants and shopping. The decor is understated for a beach condo, so it has a calming/relaxing effect after a day or night out doing all the things. I appreciated that beach supplies like towels, umbrella, chairs, toys, and even a cooler were provided, so we didn't have to chase all that down. Getting checked in/out was easy, and Andy and Christy were super friendly and accommodating. Hoping to be back soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing!!! We had to extend our stay due to weather delays and they were so understanding and responded right away! Stay here, it‚Äôs AWESOME!!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was spotless, ultra clean. The beach vibe was presented well. Two TV's was a nice luxury. Having a bathtub is a plus. The unit is so easy to get into. Kitchen is basically equipped. Would add an electric tea kettle. Nicer neck pillows would also be a step up. In general this is a very nice unit. And the owners are very professional. A good experience."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely convenient and easily accessible to the beach and other activities. Everything was either walking distance or less than a mile away. The condo itself was really clean and beautifully decorated, definitely a beach theme but very relaxing and calming, not tacky and overwhelming. Andy and Christy were very accommodating, we decided to extend our stay upon arrival and they responded right away! They even had complimentary beach supplies available to use including an umbrella, beach towels, folding chairs, a small ice chest for drinks and snacks and even sand/beach toys (if you have children). Definitely loved our stay!"

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The place need more TLC. The outside of the build need paint and carpet. Walking up to the door is dirty and old and smell like it was wet. The furniture need to be updated including the drapes. Drapes are old and faded. The location is off the hook. Very nice I just filled out the building just not very well-maintained.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was cute and within approximately a 20 minute walk of anything you may need. Very clean a nice views!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely book this place again. Perfect for 2 people. Super clean. Just a great place. AC is cold, fantastic on hot days for sure. Balcony is comfortable, private, and a great view. Trolley stop is a short walk, easy walk to the beach, or an easy drive to the gulf side of beach, about 3 minute drive. Complex was quiet and nicely landscaped. Kitchen had all we needed except for a blender for our homemade drinks. We recommend this place and hope to be back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! A 5 minute walk to the beach, beautiful view of the bay, AND they had a beach umbrella which was so awesome to have on the beach. Would 10/10 stay here again. Also you have to stop by Cafe Bistro. Great breakfast, coffee, and delicious ice cream!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great customer service, clean, and nice beach."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely clean. My wife and I have learned that, above n beyond almost any other thing, this is very important!
That‚Äôs not to say we had any issues, either, because we didn‚Äôt! The AC worked great, the place was very clean, had enough cookware for my wife n I to make multiple meals, good beach access, and the location was just as we expected.
My wife and I have been going to Pcola for years‚Ä¶ engaged and married there‚Ä¶ this is a solid spot that I‚Äôd recommend to folks who are wanting to go to Pensacola."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This rental was immaculate. I could not find a spec of dirt even if I tried. It is exactly how they described and the location was perfect
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My adults girls and I have stayed at Andy and Christys place twice in the last two years now and have enjoyed everything about it. They are very gracious hosts.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was as described. Loved the short walk to the beach and lots of restaurants close by. Owners were extremely responsive and resolved a small issue upon checking in within the first few minutes of us messaging them. Good price for the area!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! Minutes walk to the beach - much easier than staying at a hotel on the beach. The unit felt just like home - so comfortable and nice. We‚Äôll go back for sure.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unbeatable location across the street from the beach. Andy and Christy were so nice and responsive to any questions we had. Kitchen had everything we needed. Bed was comfortable. Love that the parking is covered.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay a few minutes walk from the beach, a little bit away from the crowded arepa of Pensacola beach proper which was great!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay, and would definitely look to rebook if we were back over to the States in Pensacola. Andy & Christy were very responsive which is always a relief when you're not in a hotel, and also staying in an area unknown to you. Very quiet and the beach across the road is perfect. Kitchen had all the necessary bits and bobs for cooking dinners etc as eating out every night can start to add up. There were some beach goodies in the closet which were a welcomed treat! Thanks again üòÅ"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband came with me on my ‚Äúwork trip‚Äù this time. He loved the privacy of the condo and was so glad that we didn‚Äôt stay across the street at Holiday Inn. üòÖ It was so clean and so easy to get to and from the beach. We had a great time!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful beach condo.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really close to beach access and without a rental car I was still able to walk to many restaurants within about 3/4ths of a mile of their place. Clean place and nice and quiet building.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Christy‚Äôs place was truly a gem! The location couldn‚Äôt be better-5 minute walk to the beach and 15 min walk to the boardwalk and local restaurants. Back of the condo overlooks the bay and the beach is right across the street. The condo was neat, clean, comfortable, well decorated, and had parking, beach towels, chairs, and other essentials! The area was safe and the hosts were very friendly and responsive. 10/10 would definitely stay again. Thank you for having us!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Close to the beach and all the things we needed to do while in Pensacola! Would go back there and stay!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here. After booking the property, they told us about HOA construction that was going on on the property and offered us a full refund. We chose to stay anyways, and it wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. Would definitely stay again. Right across from the beach, and bay in backyard."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little spot. Clean, easy check in, great coms with the owner! Very close to Pensacola Beach and local restaurants."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great condo to stay in!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was great . 4 minutes' walk to the beach. the house has everything for a wonderful stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Enjoyed our stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was local construction going on at the time of our visit and Andy/Christy were accommodating every step of the way! Clear instructions, quick responses, everything you could want from a host. Place is a few min walk to the beach and 5-10 min drive to anywhere you want to eat/drink. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Christy‚Äôs place was very nice and clean on the inside, incredible value for the price, and it is walking distance to the beach as well as many good spots in Pensacola Beach."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Christy were very accommodating and very responsive. Their place was very clean and in a great location, walkable to the beach and great views. Definitely would be coming back if ever in Pensacola."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This condo was beautiful and thoughtfully presented! It was spotless! The location was outstanding! 10 minute walk to the beach and bay restaurants! Hosts gave us a heads up about construction around the property BEFORE we even booked! So glad we made the choice to go ahead and stay because the repairs were so minor that we barely noticed. Also super grateful for the recommendations on local food and things to do. Amazing experience! Book here!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was beautiful! Well furnished and in a great location. I had one issue and was able to get it resolved immediately, the host was very easy to communicate with!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and looks exactly as advertised! Within walking distance to everything, you can access the beach within minutes. Andy and Christy always responded on time, and I‚Äôll definitely stay here when I come visit again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it!! We will book again in the future!
Walking distance to the beach was less than 3 minutes. The Airbnb was cozy & nicely decorated. The only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù that I would make was the floor. The floors did feel a little dirty & it quickly made our feet filthy when we were barefoot but I think the host could easily get the cleaners to take care of this as long as he‚Äôs made aware about it. There is construction going on around the Airbnb site but obviously that is out of the hosts control. The Airbnb has some beach stuff in the closet that you are welcomed to take with you to use on the beach so don‚Äôt even worry about bringing chairs with you for your trip :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our quick stay here! They responded quickly and were helpful!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a great location at a great price. Super quick walk to the beach and a view of the bay from the cute balcony. There were a few issues when we stayed related to some nearby construction and the hosts very extremely responsive and proactive and helped us resolve everything ASAP (honestly maybe the quickest response I've ever gotten from a host). We stayed with our 15-month-old son and one of the good things about this unit was it was pretty easy to have a baby/toddler in, not many tchotchkes or exposed wires and such things that make you nervous as a parent. It is worth noting that the bathroom is only accessible through the bedroom, so if someone (say, a child in their travel crib) is sleeping in the bedroom, you'll need to navigate through to use the bedroom. Minor points off for 10am checkout time and 4pm check in."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andy and Christy‚Äôs condo is lovely and spotless. My stay at their condo was relaxing and peaceful. Andy and Christy made the booking process easy and I would definitely stay at their condo again. I highly recommend doing business with them.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so nice and clean inside, and the beach across the street is pristine! Super gorgeous and clean beach and waters and apartment. Great area of the beach. Quiet as well."
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and spacious but the shower did not work and the outside of building did not match the inside whatsoever! Plus lots of noisy construction, stepped out on patio to be greeted by a construction worker right beside me"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We originally booked a hotel but our plans changed due to weather and the hotel couldn't accommodate. This place was right across the street and considerably less expensive. Covered parking, walking distance to the beach and our favorite restaurant (Peg Leg Pete's), and great communication before and during our stay. We didn't use any of the beach gear but there was plenty of it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time! The accommodations were top notch. Easy walk to the beach!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andy and Christy's place was beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb around here! Super clean, spacious, great location, would recommend to anyone in the Pensacola/Gulf Breeze area."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The outside of the building needs updating but otherwise it was perfect!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little place with all the things you need to have a quiet and calm stay at the beach. I would suggest the owners invest in a better exhaust fan for the bathroom so that it helps disperse steam but overall this place was a delight and great value!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great apartment for a couple to hang out for a few peaceful days. We used the kitchen for small meals and then walked to dinner. The smart TVs allowed us to easily connect to our streaming services. Finally, we enjoyed easy access to sidewalks and the beach. We would stay again!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Christy were terrific hosts, leaving clear directions and quickly answering a few questions that we had. The place was really nice and super clean, with soft white bed linens and good pillows, perfect for a couple or one person. And of course, the location could not be better - the bay is beautiful at night and during the day and, as described, the oceanside beach is just a 3 minute walk to the crossover. We will be back and we highly recommend it to others!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andy and Christy were great hosts! Would definitely recommend booking your stay with them!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close friends of ours recommended this place to us. Location was perfect. Close by to the beach. Hosts were very communicative, and provided beach towels and chairs. Bed extremely comfortable! Condo very clean. If you‚Äôre looking for wheels yo get around the island, highly recommend renting a golf cart from Scooter Hut Rentals and go explore Fort Pickens! Native cafe was also one of our favorite dining experiences for breakfast."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely condo! It was extremely clean and the location was great! I loved having my morning coffee out on the deck looking out at the beautiful water.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Christy‚Äôs listing was exactly as posted! The location was the best part - close/walkable beach access, restaurants, and grocery stores. They also had perfect beach amenities for a couple - chairs, umbrella, towels, floaty, etc. We had no issues the entire trip and hardly had any noise around us. The neighborhood was nice and quiet! You can‚Äôt forget the covered free parking space as a great bonus. Overall a fantastic stay!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot right across the street from the beach! The beach was absolutely beautiful and not busy at all - felt completely private. The apartment was really nice, completely true to the pictures. I will say the exterior of the complex/hallway is not very nice looking. But - that‚Äôs not something that the owners can control. They were super nice and so quick to communicate the whole time. Would definitely go back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot!! Close to everything, and a great view from the balcony! Will definitely be back!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Andy and Christy were extremely responsive and accommodating, and let us store our luggage at the Airbnb for a few hours after check out ahead of our flight, which was so appreciated!
Check in was very easy and the beach is just a short walk away."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here! The room was clean and comfortable, and Andy was a great host! We would love to stay here again when we come back to Pensacola."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice Condo. Very clean and quite. Very good location. Would recommend this palce.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great stay! the location was excellent. it‚Äôs right across the street from holiday inn on the beach. the place was just very well put together. I could tell they spent quite a time to do so. A comfortable bed, spacious kitchen and living room. Even though we stayed around popular vacation season, It was surprisingly quiet! we definitely would stay here when we come back! highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway spot!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My stay here was great! Check in/out was easy, and the place was clean. Everything I needed was there. And it's close to anything you'd want to do while staying in Pensacola, which is real convenient!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I make quick trips to Pensacola beach a couple times a year have stayed in several rentals throughout the years. This rental is by far our fav! The unit was just as pictured, beautiful decor and design. Everything was extremely clean, the bed was very comfortable and it had everything we needed for our stay. I was a little nervous when we first arrived, the condominium hallway and staircase before you enter are older & outdated, but once you enter the unit everything was beautiful & perfect! Check in was a breeze with clear, easy instructions. Also, the reserved covered parking was very nice, I loved not having to search for a parking space. :) Great location!!! I highly recommend and plan to stay again soon!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, clean place! Me and my wife enjoyed our one year wedding anniversary so much!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,He was very responsive I had a few questions and he responded very quickly! And the place is absolutely gorgeous the pictures don't do it justice! very nice place very nice neighbors or workers too! I lost 50 bucks outside and the lady cleaning put it on my windshield and let me know about it very cool people!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication. The unit is a bit dated, but in all fairness, it is one of the oldest on the beach. Furnishings are lovely... Very beechy. Nice updates in the kitchen and bathroom. perfect for one or a couple who don't need to be beachfront. Parking is the only issue."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Apartment is just as pictured and immaculate! The attention to detail by the owner was very much appreciated. There were so many extras such as beach chairs and even a box fan in the bedroom closet to use for those hot days sitting on the patio admiring the bay. We had a very relaxing stay in a place that was made to feel like home. Kuddos to the owners for having such pride in their place and for sharing it with us! Communication was excellent before, during and even after our departure. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book this one ( although I kinda want to keep this one to myself ) !"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying at Andy‚Äôs place for the 4th of July and it was even better this time! He has a TV in the master bedroom now which is good for when it‚Äôs raining and you just want to relax in bed. We were able to watch some fireworks from the balcony, and today we saw the Blue Angels practicing as we were getting ready to leave. Amazing value for the price. Beach is within short walking distance, and it‚Äôs about a 12 minute walk to Flounders which is really convenient because of all the traffic on the night of the 4th of July. Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just as advertised. Very happy with our stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful!! We seen dolphins from the balcony! just a few steps to the beach. The condo is so quiet and peaceful! Can't wait until our next vacation!
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Apartment was in a great location! Very quiet and private
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I really enjoyed our stay in Andy and Chris‚Äôs condo. The location was amazing; within walking/biking distance of all the action, but far enough away to have a peaceful environment.
The beach access across the street is a short walk, and the beach was not crowded at all! If you don‚Äôt have your own gear, I recommend utilizing the chair service that is already set up on the beach for $50/day (well worth it!). The ‚Äúbeach‚Äù chairs at the condo are just foldable camp chairs, not great for relaxing on the beach all day. One boogie board and sand toys, but no umbrella.
The only downside of the condo was that the couch bed was way too uncomfortable for an adult, but kids should have no problem! The condo was spotlessly clean and well-decorated, with minimal kitchen supplies.
I definitely recommend staying in this condo, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girls and I had our first vacation and we enjoyed everything about it! Our room was clean, quiet, safe, and in a great location to all the activities we had planned."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When booking, I did not realize it was memorial weekend. The place was in a great location and away from the big condos and hotels which made the beach perfect. There wasn‚Äôt a huge crowd and it was family friendly. It was clean and comfortable to stay in. We loved having breakfast on the balcony every morning, the bay was beautiful to look at and enjoy.
Great stay for us!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is what made our vacation in Pensacola Beach as great as it was. It was very clean, super comfortable, beautifully decorated and had everything one could possibly need. Especially the free parking lot, the outdoor shower, the washing Maschine and the very well working air conditioning came in handy. The view on the bay is gorgeous and the beach is literally across the street. Stay here if you want your vacation to be perfect."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great people to book under! Clear communication and we received exactly what we expected.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Andrew and Christy‚Äôs condo. Everything was perfectly as described- super clean, convenient and comfortable. There is a nice view on the bay from the balcony, and the stunning white sand gulf beach is literally across the street. You are very close to restaurants and shops. Andrew and Christy always responded within minutes, and even accommodated us checking in a few hours early so our little one could take her nap. We definitely recommend staying here, and hope to come back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place for 2 people! We had great wifi for work activities and enough space to not get in each other‚Äôs way. The location is also amazing! You can walk anywhere on the beach in about 20 minutes (5 min drive). The pictures are accurate and Andrew/Christy are responsive should you have any questions. This is definitely a place we will return to soon!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cannot beat the location or ease if access. They even had complimentary chairs and sand castle stuff in the closet! No real complaints.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Good location, walking distance to restaurants about 0.6 miles not bad at all."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A home away from home. Andrew and Christy have created a comfortable space that will meet all your needs.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay. Loved the aesthetic and walking distance to the beach.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"YES!
Don‚Äôt bother looking at any other listings in Pensacola Beach.
Andrew & Christy‚Äôs place is perfect! üëåüèæ
This condo is across from the beach‚Äîlike just on the other side of the road and close to restaurants.
On some days, when we walked to the beach, it felt like a private beach.
Clean utensils, working appliances, quiet neighborhood.
We needed to check in earlier than we had planned‚ÄîAndrew & Christy not only responded to our messages in time but made it possible for us to do so.
Again, if you're looking for a home away from home in the Pensacola Beach area, this is it!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great for our quick weekend trip to the beach. You can walk right across the street and out to the beach, so the location is perfect.

Kate was an excellent responsive host who made the check-in and check-out process very simple for us. Will stay with her again.

The house we stayed in exceeded all of my expectations and was super cute, comfortable, spacious, and equipped with anything you may need (especially if you forgot things at home like me)! Additionally, I was super impressed with the cleanliness of the home and the well designed layout of the house. Kate definitely has an eye for style!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really liked the space for the couple days I was there it was clean all the appliances were clean the bed is comfortable the only thing is the ac is controlled by the host. It gets pretty cold in the daytime but it‚Äôs perfect for night time so I was okay for the most part!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean and spacious. Loved how close it was to everything and the extra things they had available to make it feel at home. Only would recommend to bring a candle or febreeze if you‚Äôre pregnant and VERY sensitive to smells like me. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt smell anything at all so it was definitely just my pregnancy nose lol and a candle fixed it completely. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kate was accommodating and her place was super clean! I would stay again any time.
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"First glance, it seemed like a recent upgraded unit. I immediately noticed an animal smell covered up by fabreeze or something. The bathroom had a large shower but really tiny vanity. No toilet paper holder so toilet paper was on top of toilet, which meant no space for my toiletries. Still all no big deal as the price was good. It was late and I needed a shower. The towels were disgusting. Super thin, with stains and strings hanging out like they‚Äôve been washed a million times. I got nervous and I looked over the bed closely. Huge stains on the pillows and hairs on the sheets. I went to Target to buy new stuff as I was grossed out. The next day it was freezing when I woke up. I looked all over for an AC control and cannot find. I messaged the host to locate and her exact response was I have it on 70, Is that not cold enough? So anytime you want the temperature changed you have to message the host? Unreal. Also no toiletries and no paper towels."

The thoughtfulness puts Rory far and above the majority of hosts we have stayed with! The creativity in the layout of the cottage is amazing. There is nothing that you could want for if you stay with Rory! There were pet amenities, plenty of human amenities, and extras that you wouldn‚Äôt even think of. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!!! Staying here puts you in close proximity to the Naval Aviation Museum, beaches, Pensacola Pier, Wahoos Stadium, myriad of restaurants and a great weekend Farmers Market! Even though you are in the downtown/historic district, we slept great with little to no noise. Best Stay Ever!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Rory's place was truly exceptional. Rory is not just a host but a proactive and incredibly helpful one at that.

References for local restaurants. Our dogs loved the fenced in backyard. We brought our anti gravity chairs along and caught plenty of sun, and as we had also brought our inflatable lounge chairs, we spent a good amount of time floating in the pool. Despite being the second week of March, it was warm enough to be comfortable. Incredibly comfortable bed with convenient location next to the backyard. There was also a deck storage box which had additional chairs as well as inflatables. One of the nicest places we've stayed!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Tastefully decorated with nice furnishings and quality appliances. Clean place with a great backyard for the warmer months. Absolutely perfect for a couple.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is my fianc√©s and I third or fourth time staying here and we always love it! The place is gorgeous as always and feels like our second home! Many more memories to make in the future here!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful place to stay! It was even better than the pictures. It was the perfect place to relax after a 10 hour drive. I wish we weren‚Äôt on a road trip and could stay longer than one night! I actually joked that I would love to buy it/live there myself. It‚Äôs extremely clean, well decorated, and the attention to detail is great. There was even a Christmas tree. We felt right at home and our dogs loved the backyard. I would definitely stay again if I‚Äôm ever back in Pensacola!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,stayed for a night and was everything we needed! Rory was very communicative and helpful. the house was clean and the Christmas decorations were so cute. loved the little backyard too.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rory's place was cute and well-furnished with everything I could have needed - pretty nice stuff too! I was extremely comfy there and would stay longer if I pass through again. Rory was very communicative and welcoming - made sure I knew everything I needed to know. I gave 4 stars for location only because it was in a small neighborhood that wasn't super walkable (surrounded by busy-ish streets). Still, it was a cute little neighborhood and neighbors smiled and waved, and it's a 5-min drive to the historic part of Pensacola and Publix. :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rory‚Äôs home by far was one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I have ever stayed in. It was spotless, beautifully decorated, had everything you could imagine, including a water station inside of the fancy refrigerator. Plenty of options on the Internet, TV and cable. The backyard was adorable. Fenced in for your dog. I love this house so much I wanted to look up the architectural plan so that I could one day build something similar. The bed was comfortable. The host was responsive. I can‚Äôt wait to go back and stay in this special home again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rory‚Äôs place was immaculate. Very clean and comfortable. Beautiful furniture and decor. Comfortable bed, snacks were plentiful, and good coffee was provided (and creamer too). My son loved playing with all the beach toys and my husband and I enjoyed trivia. By far my favorite Airbnb and host!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was very convenient to downtown, and easy to get to. The street that the house is on is very quiet - a mix of a few houses and a few businesses. The house was clean, modern, and smelled very fresh. We appreciated that the TV allowed us to enjoy services like Netflix. While we didn‚Äôt bring our dogs, it‚Äôs also nice to know that this is a pet friendly place. If you have an event at the Pensacola Yacht Club, this is .3 from it. Great location. Great communication from Rory."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is such a nice space. We enjoyed our time here and will definitely stay again. The little pool was perfect for our toddler to splash in and was comfortable for us.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rory‚Äôs place was literally one of our favorite Airbnb‚Äôs we have ever stayed in. It‚Äôs in a great location, very clean, super comfortable, and really adorable. It has a wonderful kitchen that is well stocked. We didn‚Äôt get to use the bikes while we were there, but they were so nice to have available! You are just a quick jaunt from Downtown, and it would be a great ride there. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here! It was a great place to bring the pets, super clean and relaxing. I loved the decor and the setup of the home as well. One of my favorite airbnb‚Äôs ever!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great spot! Off the beaten path but still very close to downtown Pensacola! Easy to find. Super clean! Rory is a great host! Extremely responsive. The breaker tripped somehow and I contacted Rory about it, he quickly responded with location of breaker and offered to come by and take care of it. We were able to take care of it ourselves but so nice of him to offer to come by! Great place for someone with a dog. Fenced in and secure! Also lots of great snacks available and coffee too! Thanks Rory we will be back!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the perfect beach cottage! It's so relaxing and we felt like we could stay home and relax. The little swimming hole in the back is my fave. Host was very kind and responsive. I would stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved üòç our stay at this beautiful and immaculate airbnb. It was very close to a wedding we attended at the naval base and the host was very responsive and gave us flexibility on our check in and check out times. We both loved the modern eco design and decorations. The shower was refreshing and the bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to wake up. Overall, I give this place 5 stars üåü ü§© and more if I could. We felt right at home üè° and we plan to come back to visit in the future."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rory‚Äôs place was incredibly clean and well maintained. You could tell he really thought about everything a guest may need and had it all available, easy to find, and organized. The house is a short walk to a restaurant/bar in the marina and is a very quick drive to downtown and the beach. We had a great time and will book again on our next trip to Pensacola!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We LOVED our stay at Rory‚Äôs! Rory went above and beyond to try and make our stay perfect. He is very responsive and kind.

We also brought our pups with us and he had everything for them as well! Plenty of doggie parks close by for them to run and play. Rory has really went all out! We will definitely use him again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of my favorite AirBnBs ever. My service dog and I felt right at home. There was amenities provided and even a snack basket.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We struggled to find a nice place to stay with our puppers! Luckily, this airbnb was pet friendly and so cute! it was very nice and the little pool in the back with the string lights was the perfect touch! Rory was easy to reach if needed and very nice. We would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great spot! We had a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was amazing. Our fur babies lived it. We were there during a heat wave and this house stayed cool the whole time. The street has more nice houses as well. The kitchen was cool. Rory thought of everything. Other places we have had to take the trash cans out. Rory even takes care of that. The place was well stocked with everything you need. Beach supplies including towels chairs coolers and beach toys for kitchen kids. We will be back next year for sure!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay! The house was exactly as described in the listing. Rory responded immediately to my one question. The house has everything needed and Rory provides many additional features to make the stay feel like home. The welcome basket was a nice addition! Thank you for allowing us to be guests in your home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,loved our stay! 10/10!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing week! The accommodations are perfect for two. It is a peaceful neighborhood with a wonderful back yard. The saltwater pool and soft patio lighting gave us relaxing evenings.
The kitchen is stocked with all of the essentials: cookware, dinnerware, glassware, etc. We love our coffee and brought a grinder, but Rory had that covered too. There is a Bullet and a full size blender.
There are two televisions, cable, and streaming services, and games like Battleship and Jenga for the stormy days we experienced. There were two bikes with helmets, and beach stuff.
The pictures do not do this place justice. We were expecting a very small one bedroom house, but we were blown away at how spacious it was. We were right at home from the moment we arrived. Rory is highly responsive, and provided us with a warm and relaxing home for the perfect Pensacola vacation. We will definitely look for Rory when planning our future vacation!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay here for our vacation. The place is perfect for a get away and close to restaurants. The beach is only 15-20 minutes away, we honestly really enjoyed the drive over the bridges specially around sunset. The view is amazing!! The mini pool was nice and Rory had literally everything you needed and more for the beach etc. We would love to come back. Thanks again for our stay. :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay! My husband asked if Rory had places like this everywhere we visit! The place is just the right size for a couple. Great sitting area. The kitchen had everything you would need or think of. There is a closet full of all types of beach items from chairs, umbrella and coolers. If you flew into FL and wanted to go to the beach you would be set. The bed was amazing. We haven't slept that well in a long time. We even enjoyed the backyard with the stock tank. Nice little relaxing area! Seriously, our only complaint was the air freshener was a tad strong and could be bothersome till you get used to it. We would love to stay again! Book this place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were just popping in for the one night as we made our way to 30A. Rory was so kind and offered us a late check out because he knew we would be getting in late. The house had everything you could need! Went over and beyond. I always appreciate the little things and this house was so clean, beautiful and had all the extras! The little 2 foot pool in the back with the lights was precious."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My 3rd visit to Rory's house. It is located in the perfect location to everything. Great restaurants within 2-3 minutes and a quick drive to Pensacola Beach. Make sure to eat at the Oar house, 5 Sisters Blues Cafe and Sonny's BBQ. Already planning to stay with Rory for my next trip to Pensacola. Why stay with the rest when you can stay at the best AirBNB in town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed there for a vacation to visit with our kids who were all staying over on Gulf Breeze. As soon as we got there and check everything out, we found it was one of the best Airbnb places that we have stayed. Rory was very responsive with any problems or questions we had. The description he writes on the initial page for Airbnb rentals is exactly as he describes. One day while we had our 4 year old great granddaughter with us while everyone else had other activities, we took her in the saltwater pool in the backyard and it was just perfect for her and us! We did not use the bikes or the grill in the backyard because we were just too busy. I would consider staying there again when Pensacola."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rory‚Äôs place was a great stay!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Rory‚Äôs place!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a little getaway before we welcome our first baby in a few months. The house was perfect- everything was very well thought out,clean,and beautifully decorated! The private backyard was so relaxing and cute! It was exactly what we needed. The downtown area was a bit further than walking distance, but only about a 7 or 8 minute drive. Pensacola beach (beautiful and many restaurants/shops) was about a 15/20 min ride. We used ride share to get around and also rented a car for a couple of the days. Rory was an awesome host - I would 100% stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for a quiet getaway with access to a lively downtown and beach area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay! The home looked just like the pictures. Very clean, smelled AMAZING, and in a quiet/peaceful area. It was more than enough space for a solo traveler. I really liked how it was roughly five minutes from the downtown area. Rory was very communicative anytime I had a question or issue. I highly recommend! :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although the weather didn‚Äôt fully cooperate, we had such a great stay! Rory‚Äôs cottage is our second favorite play we‚Äôve ever stayed!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best, well appointed, and comfortable places we've stayed at. We were so ready to come back and enjoy the space each day. All the extras were so appreciated, and the supplies in the kitchen, like coffee pods for those first couple mornings. Delish!
Thank you Rory"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place and Rory is great! It‚Äôs a cute cottage with an even cuter private backyard. The plunge pool is a great asset! Little touches with true designer kitchen and bathroom accessories. The bed is the comfiest, ever. Will visit again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rory's place was very cute, comfy, and clean. It felt sort of tucked away which was nice. Several amenities (to include some beach stuff, bikes, coffee & snacks, etc.) and pretty much anything you may need are available. Easy drive to downtown. There's a small fenced-in yard and little sidewalk on a side street if you have a dog with you, but the parks downtown are pretty close for dog walking too (Veterans Memorial Park, for example). Check-in/out was super simple. Rory was communicative and responsive."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 on all accounts! The home was perfectly stocked with any essentials that may be needed & the host left a perfectly explained and easy to follow list of rules, etc ; you name it we loved it!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is my fianc√© and I‚Äôs second time staying here and we always love it! Very peaceful and overall beautiful. We have found a place we want to visit every year! I would recommend this place to everyone!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Rory‚Äôs place! It was clean, tidy and well appointed. It was an easy drive to many attractions. Rory was kind and responsive to all our questions/needs. He was also spot on with his recommendations for restaurants and attractions."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice !
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rory is a fantastic host with a beautiful little home. Every amenity was carefully thought of and available..including the cutest little ‚Äúdipping pool‚Äù!The home was spotlessly clean and well appointed. The bed was super comfortable with plenty of pillows! Great communication and Rory offered early arrival and extended check out‚Ä¶five star service all the way around. I left kicking and screaming! Would absolutely return! Thank you for your flawless hospitality, Rory!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Close to everything and only a little bit of a drive to the beach. Very comfy place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was perfect, exactly what we needed after a cross country drive stop for the evening. The home is very easy to access, pulling right up in the drive way with our car with much room to spare.
The home is immediately comfortable and a relief of it being so nicely clean & organized, exactly as described. The outside backyard is super cute and perfect for our little fur babies. The home is very close to downtown in which we took a quick drive to grab a lavender latte in one of the coffee shops which was so yummy!
We are looking forward for the opportunity to book again next time we pass through. Thank you for the cutest cottage and providing such a wonderful experience short or long!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect stay for exploring Pensacola! Close to downtown with great food, music, and parks! Super comfy, quiet, and peaceful vibe. We felt right at home!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I and our medium-size dog have been traveling across the country, and we've stayed in countless Airbnbs. Rory's place is easily one of the finest we've visited. The home is immaculate and has so many thoughtful touches -- I would literally live here if I could! It's an easy walk into town, and we loved the privacy of the neighborhood. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. Thank you, Rory!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Downtown Pensacola is charming and historical, with lots of local restaurants and shops sprinkled in. Unfortunately, getting downtown was not walkable from this location. I was uncomfortable walking around this location, and the scenery was industrial with some dilapidated homes. Such a bummer because Rory's home is absolutely stunning! It was very modern, spacious, well-decorated, and stocked with everything I needed. I was staying over for a work trip, so the shotty location was not a big deal, but it is worth mentioning if a vacation is the intent for the booking."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Rory‚Äôs place and we were happy to be back! Thoughtful details throughout the home and very clean and inviting. Location is very close to many points of interest for us.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This places was exactly how it was described! The places was very well done, very clean, and made our visit to Pensacola so easy. The house is stocked with majority of the basics you'd need for your stay, and then some extras (games, bikes, books, etc.) The host does a great job of communicating proactively and being there if you need them, but also giving you space and privacy for your stay. The only thing I was surprised about was the industrial buildings on the neighboring streets, but it was quiet, private, safe, and super convenient to downtown Pensacola! I would 100% stay here again or recommend this place!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! Let me start by saying, we were only staying one night and didn‚Äôt want to go to a pricey hotel. This was an incredible value for the luxe touches and accommodations. One of the cleanest you‚Äôll ever experience (and I‚Äôm super picky and examine everything from blinds to baseboards-the place was spotless) coupled with lots a great homey touches‚Äîcoffee, snacks, water, lovely toiletries, poop bags, literally everything! The place exudes comfort and charm and expenses were not spared for bed, bedding, towels, etc. also had all new appliances including fancy fridge, washer and dryer, great coffee maker. We really loved every aspect and will definitely stay again. Cannot say enough about Rory‚Äôs responsiveness. We didn‚Äôt have any issues but he was happy to provide recommendations quickly and answered all questions. Check-in was a breeze."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great time exploring local attractions while enjoying the comforts of home.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my favorite Airbnb stays to date. So nice, clean and comfortable. Check in and check out was a breeze and Rory was greet about communicating. All the amenities you could ask for plus some you didn‚Äôt know you wanted. 100% would book again."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed at one of Rory‚Äôs properties and I‚Äôm never disappointed. He‚Äôs a great host and very responsive. The home is well equipped and has everything you may need during your stay. I highly recommend and anytime I‚Äôm in the area will definitely try to book with him again. The home is close to downtown and easy access to the interstate.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for my husband and I. Rory had everything we needed, and then some. Our 25# dog loved being able to run around the backyard. We just kept saying, ‚ÄúHe thought of everything and the house was so smartly decorated‚Äù. Would definitely stay at any property he had."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cutest place to stay! We were in town for a wedding with our 2 pups and the house was perfect. 10/10 would recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little house is lovely. I could have stayed for a week if I‚Äôd had time. Very comfortable, well appointed and very attractive"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a space to spend some time between two weekends of weddings - we needed space to work and relax and this house was just the ticket. The wifi was strong and we were able to have two people on video calls at the same time and Rory had so many nice amenities at the house that made us feel right at home. There is a great restaurant just down the street, and Rory gave us recommendations for other good places in the area.
We would absolutely stay here again if we were passing through Pensacola!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you‚Äôre looking for a getaway, look no further. This home is absolutely perfect. Very well laid out and snacks/treats to greet your arrival.

Simply put, our visit was a perfect 10 and look forward to coming back in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend, we will DEFINITELY be back, one of the best places we have stayed. The house was VERY clean. Decorated super cute, bed was comfy, spacious shower/bathroom. Everything you could need is there. Rory was very polite & responded super quickly. We had an amazing time."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Can‚Äôt say a bad thing about this nice little place. You‚Äôll get more value out of staying here for a week vs staying at a local upscale hotel. It‚Äôs quiet and close to Palafox and downtown. You can stand in the backyard and watch the Blue Angels. Rory has the place stocked very generously. Will stay here again for sure.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Clean cute and comfortable. The neighborhood was small and quiet. The atmosphere was very homey. We enjoyed the shower and the living room space. Bed is comfy
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rory was very nice and kept in touch up until check-in and then throughout the stay when we needed anything! The house is super nice and clean, a secluded location but close to a lot of fun places! I would definitely stay here again."

It says something when the beach is just a little bit away and you‚Äôre willing to just chill at the place too you‚Äôre staying at because of the coziness of it!
This cottage was adorable, so clean, quiet, quaint, cozy, convenient, and just all around wonderful!

The colors, the decor, the thriving plants were all a welcoming sight. Our stay was just overnight so we didn‚Äôt have time to use all that he has supplied‚Ä¶beach gear, bikes, etc. But we enjoyed our quiet comfortable stay (nice bed) immensely.
It‚Äôs on a quiet side road and we just took a walk to the Oar House for supper."

Rory was easy to communicate with- we ended up wanting to add a night and he quickly responded. The binder also gives visitors many good ideas of restaurants/bars to try. All amenities are thought out and appreciated- from hair dryer, curling iron, beach chairs, beach towels, umbrellas, coffee and all kitchen pots and pans- we did not lack for anything! The backyard is a sweet, private oasis with an area to enjoy a glass of wine before dinner or relax reading a book in the sun while dipping in the stock tank pool if it‚Äôs toasty. We went to a few Blue Wahoos games while in town- just a stone‚Äôs throw away! We‚Äôve stayed at Airbnbs all over the world and this is a top 5 location! Thanks Rory!"

That was nice to relax and not have to walk them every time they need to go potty. We will definitely be staying here in our future travels.

The house is also close to Joe Pattis, an awesome seafood market, that you can grab fresh ingredients from for dinner.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Rory's cottage during the week of Thanksgiving. We were visiting my SIL who lives in Pensacola and wanted to have a place to ourselves. We love our family but it's always nice to have quiet at the end of the day. This is probably one of the cleanest AirBnBs we've stayed at and this is coming from someone who has extremely HIGH standards of cleanliness. I don't know who cleans this place but the team or individual deserves a serious bonus. Rory's place is about a 4 minute drive from downtown. We REALLY wanted to take the bikes out to get to and from town but it was too chilly. If you are into fitness there is an amazing locally owned cycle studio (Ride Nation) in town and there is an Orangetheory Studio about 15 minutes away as well. This place is extremely quiet which is amazing considering it is near what appears to be an industrial area. There are train tracks nearby but we only heard the train once during our stay. We took a peek at everything and as others have stated anything you could possibly need for your stay is here regardless of the season. Everything was cozy and comfortable and it made for the perfect getaway. If we travel to Pensacola for Thanksgiving again next year, we plan to rebook if it's available. Thank you Rory!"

This amazing one bedroom apt gets a 10‚≠êÔ∏è All I had to do was think of something I may have forgotten to bring or something I could use and Everything was already their. So very clean and the bed so comfortable! Everything also was beautifully decorated. This home reminds me of how Bnbs use to be with using high quality sheets and towels plus making sure everything is available even before you arrive. This is precisely why it‚Äôs a 10!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay! Everything was clean and just as described. Richard is such a hospitable host. We felt very welcomed, and the environment was relaxing."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Richard's place was very clean and had everything you needed. Although we didn't use the kitchen much, it seemed to have everything you might want/need. On top of the regular dishes/pots/pans, they also provided some paper plates and cups. We were greeted with some home made muffins and a welcome note on the erasable board along with a few waters in the full fridge. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom has toiletries in case you forget something. We brought our husky (Romeo) and he seemed to feel right at home and had a treat waiting for him in the provided dog bowls when we arrived. The house is located in a relaxing area. They had several board games and my wife and I decided to play the Andy Griffith Show game since we were watching it while we had her dad living with us for a while. After 4 rounds, we were tied...lol. I was able to work from the unit one day that I needed to as there was a good Wi-Fi setup. Kim and Richard are super friendly."

Quiet Delight is the best!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the apartment is beautiful and as described. Our plane was late so we arrived late to the apartment. We had not had an opportunity to get something for dinner so we were very happy to find freshly made muffins on the dining table.
The bed is very comfortable. All of the furnishings are lovely. The area is quiet and peaceful.
The extra things provided, from cold water in the refrigerator to a basket of personal supplies you may have forgotten made the place even more wonderful.
We can't wait to return in September for a much longer stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I wish I could give more than five stars but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt allow that. Our stay here was absolutely everything you could ever ask for. We were greeted with banana nut muffins wrapped up for us on the kitchen table.
It was so thoughtful and the place smelled amazing. It was so tidy and clean. We did inform them of us bringing our dog and they left out a nice food and water bowl, as well as a raw hide free chew bone. They were very accommodating, as we booked last minute for a an extra day on vacation since it was on the way home.
It honestly seemed so much better than the pictures and they had a binder full of recommendations and the tv channel guide. They also had the basic travel size amenities, which was super thoughtful. The house was about 15 minutes from downtown Pensacola, which was nice to be away from the city while you slept.
Overall, we plan to stay here again when we vacation in Pensacola."

Super clean space, I would stay here again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I don‚Äôt even know where to start. They allowed us to check in early so that started the positive plus. My honey was in the area working a shut down and I wish we would have found this gem weeks earlier. It is exactly and more than what it is described. It was so peaceful so clean and completely beautiful! I would recommend this to anyone in the area. The place smelled so pleasant and we felt right at home.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really weren‚Äôt there long enough to give a thorough review as this was just a convenient and safe spot we booked for a very early flight the following day. We arrived late in the evening and went straight to bed and got up very early and went straight to the airport.
That being said it looked exactly as we expected based on the listing. It was also very clean.
It had a cute cottage type of feel. The beds were very comfortable and lots of blankets and pillows were provided!
Minor things we noticed- the bathroom pipes are very loud, the bedroom doors don‚Äôt close quietly, and the master bedroom bed is VERY creaky. None of these are deal breakers by any means but I like to give as many details as I can in my reviews!
We did have a last minute request that was never responded to but we sent it via airbnb chat and not via text so that might have been partly our error. That being said if you need something, I would probably text."

I would have happily stayed longer than 3 days. Thank you

The home is located within 15 minutes of everywhere we wanted to go while in Pensacola which made it super convenient. There is a park within walking distance that was a hit for our energetic 4-year-old, too.
The home itself was very comfortable was a firm mattress on the king-sized bed that was supportive and easy for me to get in and out of at 25 weeks pregnant. The queen-sized bed was low to the ground which made it the perfect height for my 4-year-old, who was also a huge fan of the TV and FireTV in that bedroom.
We would happily stay here again."

The overall house wasn‚Äôt well kept and was rundown. The area the house was in was sketchy too, Mobil homes down the whole street and stray cats + street dogs. When we were packing up to leave a gentleman on a bicycle came up to us saying he was the cleaner and was already going into the door before we could get out of there. Overall I‚Äôm so surprised by the good reviews I didn‚Äôt feel safe sleeping here. You could tell the owner has a couple cheap properties he has bought and barley fixed to used for Airbnb."

2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"As our first Airbnb stay, we were very excited! The pictures were accurate of the place. The interior design and decoration was beautiful. Loved the bathroom design!
Main 2 complaints: We didn‚Äôt realize till we got there that there isn‚Äôt a washer or dryer :/ (The room is under renovation)
AND it was really really dirty.. :/ The floors were filthy; made our feet a gray color. We swept up piles of dirt/sand from each room the first day. The bath tub was good, but the tiles were filthy. Like yellow spots. The only hand towel (kitchen) we had was damp and stained when we got there.
The fabric headboard of the bed was so beautiful, but the top was covered in dust. (The beds were great though. Comfy, very clean and crisp white sheets.)
The area was nice and quiet! I enjoyed the outside sitting front and back. Location was close to everything you needed!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for our visit this past weekend. It was very quiet, peaceful, and clean. The gentleman next door was very friendly and helpful. Everything was great. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay again."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice stay I would recommend making the two small beds, a regular full-size bed also the Airbnb that is beside it had quite a bit of traffic and was kind of a shock. We forgot it was there and quite a bit of people pulled up thinking that was the Airbnb they booked."

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was ok for the price but has ran down mobile homes next door. It's only about 20 minutes to Pensacola beach. There is also another rental on the property very close to rue house which is awkward. The floors and bathroom were dirty when we arrived. The kitchen needs more basics (mixing bowls, measuring spoons/cups, cheese grater) for those that want to prepare meals. The neighbors on the otherside of the fence have a dog that constantly barks when your outside and makes it impossible to enjoy the back patio."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was a great spacious place to stay with a good feel

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danny was extremely hospitable and friendly. The house was a very quaint old home with some of the original structure still there which was really impressive. The home had old time charm but still all the amenities we needed. Extremely clean. Pleasant and quiet. Beds were super comfy.
The street the home is located on was mostly older trailers or run down homes but then at the end of the street was this little blue house of Danny‚Äôs. It was a very pleasant surprise and he has outdone himself to make the home feel safe and secure.
We would definitely stay there again on our visits back to that area!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danny was a very good host with a nice clean home I will definitely recommend his place, a place to stay at when you come to Pensacola"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is in a quiet area, the house is as it appears in the photos, and the information provided is accurate. It's a nice place to stay if you go through it. Danny responds quickly and is an excellent host."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great deal on a full house with flexible check-in. Only complaint is the lack of the light outside. Pitch black at night and didn‚Äôt fee safe at all.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely little house, everything very clean and the beds very comfortable.
I would go back to this place again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is adorable, and I‚Äôd like to have stayed a whole month. The location is great, sort of in the middle of everything, and not too far too downtown or the beach (you need a car you get anywhere in Pensacola, works great from this central location). I didn‚Äôt try Uber or Lyft. It was very quiet at night. Not a fancy neighborhood but a gem of a spot. I felt very safe and I loved the quiet forested area. Master bed was very comfortable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was beautiful
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the stay at your home and I would definitely recommend it to others thank you so much!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danny was very helpful. Clear instructions on how to get in and out and where to find everything.

I would definitely book from him again and since I regularly stop in Pensacola on the way from Arkansas to Ocala, I very well may again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danny and this listing were awesome. He was easy to get a hold of and the check in was seamless.

Highly recommend."

The beds were super comfortable plenty of towels and privacy, local to everything and not far from the beach!!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Danny's place. He was excellent to communicate with, check in was easy and it is obvious he is working to have a really nice place. He is remodeling and everything was very new and nice. One thing to note since there has been fresh paint and work the home had a smell of remodeling maybe paint? Nothing extreme but I know some people may be senstive to these types of smells so this is why I am adding it to the review. The neighborhood might look a little run down but we had absolutely no issues and it was very quiet so do not let that keep you from this home. Close to beaches and food, the price is great considering how clean and new the entire home is. Would recommend and keeping it on my personal short list for great value stays near Pensecola!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Intendencia Suite is a great rental for two. It's on a quiet street in a great area of both newer and older homes. The suite is nicely decorated and comfortable. It was super easy to find and very convenient to anything you might need. We were able to walk to restaurants down Intendencia Street. One thing I was not sure of before our arrival was how the suite was set up in the house. I was pleasantly surprised the the front door is the entrance to the suite and completely private to the rest of the house. The front porch was ours to use with two comfortable chairs and the sounds of the fountain nearby. All of the windows and front door can be made completely private with shades and curtains, as the bed is right inside the suite.
We were able to park on the small strip of driveway during our visit, but on-street parking is available as well. We didn't have time to enjoy the pool, but it's very nice. I did have the pleasure of meeting Matthew. I did text him about restaurants in the area and he was quick to respond and very helpful. I would surely book with him again."

My husband and I stayed during the first few days of our honeymoon and were amazed at this space. It was secure, secluded, and serene! The first thing we noticed was how quiet it was inside, we couldn‚Äôt even hear if/when it was raining outside. We were also so pleased with the outside sitting area, and felt very comfortable sitting outside and enjoying the peaceful street.

It's a clean, quiet, cozy place to sleep, grab your morning cup of coffee, freshen up, and head out to what Pensacola has to offer!
We only needed to contact Malika for one thing toward the end of our stay, and she responded quickly and helped us resolve our issue (nothing she or her property contributed to).
Thank you, Malika, for being a wonderful host!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Malika was an incredible host and I was so happy we got to meet in person right at the time of arrival. The guesthouse me and my brother stayed in was amazing- you have a nice kitchen, a wonderful bed (even though I had to sleep on the floor for personal reasons), a spacious bathroom and an amazing smart HDTV. The only issue, nothing major, I had was the microwave; as I was putting the cook time to warm my meal, it wouldn‚Äôt start, so the only thing I had to do was press a certain # on the keypad to cook it. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience and if I ever come down again for a vacation trip again, I will definitely go back! 5/5 for me! üòéüëçüèø"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely recommend !
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin‚Ä¶ when I first landed in Pensacola Florida, I wasn‚Äôt sure what I thought about it. It felt bland and boring and it felt like I was so away from what I was used to. I was visiting my girlfriend who is at A school at NAS Pensacola and the one thing I needed to feel more comfortable is a peaceful place to stay, and a comfortable environment to stay the next 4 nights in. That was what I was provided by Malika and the comfort I felt when I stepped foot in the little house. It was small but surprisingly very spacious. The pictures don‚Äôt give that feeling but it really is a big area from the inside. The parking situation was very easy and attainable and most importantly safe. There was no problem getting in and out and the host is super helpful when it comes to little questions. Most of all I want to highlight the cooperation from the host. She was able to be very responsive as quick as possible and show her full attentiveness towards her guests.
11/10 rating."

Well decorated and furnished for the square footage. We were very comfortable and felt like there was plenty of space. We will definitely stay again.
PS--We were so impressed by Malika's firepit and the ambiance it created for our weekend, it inspired us to do something similar at our own house!
Thank you, thank you, thank you for the great vacation and inspiration :)"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Jennifer's (first was the upstairs Gotham by Knight) Both are fabulous. They have everything you need for a great getaway. Both themes are unique. The bed is so comfortable and what can I say about that tub . So convenient to everthing we love about Pensacola. We will return. Thanks for creating this special place!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Big Easy was great. The interior aesthetic is warm, cozy, and beautiful. The bath tub is wonderful and the bed was astoundingly comfortable.
Unfortunately we didn't make time to cook but I did notice the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you would need from various tools to many seasonings. This is something I appreciate a lot. Usually I end up having to buy miscellaneous items like cutting boards, etc, but here you'd be good to go.
Jennifer was responsive and kind. I'd highly recommend staying at this listing."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I absolutely loved my week-long stay in Pensacola. Jennifer‚Äôs place was super cool, very clean, and conveniently located to great coffee shops, restaurants, bars, shops, and happenings downtown. The kitchen was stocked with everything needed to cook, the bathroom was extremely unique and memorable, and the brick walls and decor added so much to the already awesome vibes of the building. You can definitely tell how much thought and care Jennifer put into the place, from the very cool design to providing robes and k-cups. Check-in was very easy and Jennifer even reached out beforehand to let me know it was ready earlier than expected. I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"one of the most beautifully decorated homes I've stayed in since I've been on air bnb. There were lots of very cool historical aspects sprinkled throughout the building that wonderfully meshed into a gorgeous, comfortable modern home. There are very few people that I can say truly care about a guests stay to the standard Jennifer does - I was honored to be a guest here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal. Probably one of the best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶if not the best. Jennifer‚Äôs place is even more beautiful than the pictures. Some airbnbs feel cheaply thrown together ‚Äîthis is not. You can tell Jennifer out a ton of money and thought into this place. The style and quality was awesome and the shower was cool as heck. She had bath bombs and other fun things. The kitchen was gorgeous with ample pots and pans and a cool gas stove for cooking. Super comfy and spacious bed. Television was a really wonderful addition. Safe location. And a 5-10min walk to Palafox which has tons to do.
1000% will stay here again."
