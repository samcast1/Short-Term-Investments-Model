2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at this beach cottage. It was perfect for our family of 4, including 2 older teenagers. The view is amazing and we loved sitting on the bench in front of the cabin to gaze at the beach and ocean. The location was great. An easy walk to shops, restaurants, and beach access. The neighborhood is so close to everything in Newport but quiet. The cottage had everything we needed and was very clean. We made a simple meal while we were there and had everything we needed. Gina was very responsive and worked with us to make check-in and check-out easy. We will be back again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay, highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay: short but very satisfying! Everything was top notch. Beach has to be accessed by leaving the property and going 100 yards or so to get to stairs! It's physically taxing so be prepared!
EVERYTHING was very convenient! The amenities are well thought out: the various chargers, folding chairs, a frisbee and the supplies of basics, bathroom was immaculate!
Highest marks! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a fun place! The weather could have been better, but that’s nothing we could control. The location was amazing and the place really cute. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view the view the view!!!! Gina’s place was very clean , had all the amenities you could need, very cozy with nice touches, but the view was the star. I don’t think we ever closed the curtains. From sitting at the window staring out to sitting on the bench outside watching the sunset the view was so spectacular. Area was super walkable with tons of shops, restaurants, and cafes. Will definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beach Bum Bungalow #7 was very clean and matched the description/pictures perfectly. The view was outstanding and the area was great for walking around town. Gina was extremely fast with responding to questions, which was very appreciated. The only negative is that the shower is small and tight for those that are tall or larger built. My teen son is 6'1"" and had to shower on his knees to fit under the showerhead. While it made us chuckle, it may not be that easy for others to handle. Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay! Thank you for such a lovely place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a peaceful and relaxing girls trip. The bungalow was absolutely adorable and beautifully decorated. Thanks so much for sharing with us!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to the beach and restaurants. The bungalow was clean and inviting."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I stayed for a week with our 4 year old and 1.5 year old and had a great time. Beautiful view, quick walk to the beach and shops, and the kids loved all of the decorations to look at outside"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was a very cute little cabin over looking the ocean, within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. What more could you ask for"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, cute space with a wonderful picture window ocean view. Walkable to the beach and town. Gina was so kind, flexible and responsive. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we booked this place for my dad and younger son. This was my dad's first trip since my mom died two years ago. The Oregon Coastbis full of memories for him so we did not know if even his adult grandsons could lure him out here (we live here). This bungalow was the icing on the cake. A beautiful peaceful place he had never stayed where he could build new memories. The quiet calm location so close to amazing restaraunts and the beach is absolutely perfect. The cozy homelike atmosphere in this historic cottage with indescribably stunning views and a kind thoughtful host makes this a place our family will book again and again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! Restaurants and shopping are super close walking distance and the ocean view is right outside your door. Leave your window open at night and you’ll fall asleep to the ocean waves. We will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I forgot to logout my streaming apps, but Gina went above and beyond and had housekeeping do it for me. Clean linens and actual Calphalon frying pans that worked!! Thank you Gina and staff. We were able to unplug and felt like the bungalow was from a bygone era. Cheers!!!!❤️😉"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A delight! Amazing views, great price. Will definitely come back again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A remarkable ocean view, and close to the Visual Arts Center where we attended the Newport Paper Arts Festival. It was clean and all needs were provided. Hosts responded quickly to questions or concerns.
The whole house was free of mildew and musty smells and it was tight and so well maintained. Parking was adequate for two cars for our place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This historic beach cottage has wonderful ocean views plus great walking access from cliff to beach and to Nye Beach restaurants and bakeries. Very enjoyable and comfortable stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second visit to the Beach Bum Cottages. The view from the living room window is AMAZING...so even if it's raining and windy, you can sit inside and watch and listen to the waves. If it's dry, there's a little bench outside that keeps you warm in the radiant sunshine.
It's super cozy and cute.
The beds are comfortable. We were there for almost a week and our back didn't hurt. (YAY!)
The kitchen is small but very functional and well stocked. We cooked several meals and ate looking at the ocean.
It's a short walk to a paved trail down to the sand. You can walk all the to the Agate Beach area or you can walk to the Harbor.
The Nye Beach area is quaint and not as commercial as the rest of Newport.
THANK YOU for a great stay! I am confident we will be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We LOVED this little beach cabin. the view and easy walk to the beach was unbeatable. We hope to return! Great memories were made.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Magical maritime bliss!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place! The view of the ocean and the sound of the waves was amazing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"my friends and I absolutely LOVED this airbnb! We only stayed 1 night during our costal road trip, but we were wanting to stay longer when it was time to leave! Views can not get any better. Location was great, we could walk to so many places. We would definitely recommend this place and this town in general!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Newport Cottage was a beautiful place to stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Beach Bum Bungalows and wished we were staying for more than just a single night. It was so special to see the sunset over the ocean and wake up to the ocean out our window. If we’re ever lucky enough to be back, we’ll be staying here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place was perfect — the location, the view, and the unit itself were all amazing. Next time we come to Newport, I’ll be looking to stay here again. I’ve already recommended it to friends who are often in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a window looking right out to the ocean. Host provided many little extras (like chocolate😊) Very tastefully decorated and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay here. The view was incredible, and they went above and beyond to provide anything you might need. My favorite touch was the personal recommendations they suggested! We ate at a restaurant they had listen in their welcome book, and it was amazing. Perfect place for a peaceful sea getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just perfect! The view, proximity to town, the kitchen...everything is just perfect.
I had the need to communicate with Gina a couple of times about some things - she was super responsive and helpful every time.
We go to the coast often. Gina's place will be one of the first on my list to see if it's available."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay! Gina was a great communicator and the little house was so cute, really well restored and decorated. It was a cozy spot to hangout and drink coffee over looking the waves. Thanks Gina!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, private cabin. Amazing views, beach, shops and restaurants are walkable. Super nice weekend getaway. Main bed was not able to be walked around both sides so it can be awkward to climb over your partner. It is a small house/cabin; if you are a larger person you may be claustrophobic in the bathroom."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy cottage with a beautiful view of the ocean. Would definitely stay again when visiting Newport
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I really enjoyed our stay! We loved the open ocean view and the peacefulness of the location! There was lots to do and we were provided with fun tools for crabbing or sand tools to take down to the beach. Overall, we had a good experience and loved our time at Gina’s place. It was very cozy and beautiful!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great clean place with easy beach access and great view of the ocean. what more could you want
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location: marvelous views, easy beach access, close to all the amenities of Newport"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Little cottage with cute decor. Wonderful Ocean View right out the front window. as described, had basic kitchen equipment we even made meals for company. in the night Beach neighborhood which is fantastic for a Newport visit."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,great place for wife and daughter
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was amazing. We loved the vintage feel of the space, the incredible picture window with a view of the Pacific Ocean that will never disappoint. The owner takes great pride in her home, and it shows. If you want to visit Newport, historic Nye Beach is the place to be located. You will be able to easily and quickly walk to many wonderful restaurants, shops and the beach is just steps away. Off street parking was great, and the area felt very safe and secure.
We stayed 3 nights and was honestly sad to leave. The space is perfect for two, but it could also easily accommodate a third traveler (just note as another reviewer indicated there are no doors on the bedrooms - which was not a problem for us!) If we were to return to the area, we would love to book this cottage again - for us it was perfect and exactly as advertised."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lively cottage. Great view!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place is so warm, cozy and one of the best views on the Oregon Coast. I could sit and look out the window all day. Stocked with everything you need to make your stay as comfortable as home."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice little bungalow right above the beach with a great view.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great view, can’t beat it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 (including a toddler) found the cottage to be so welcoming, cozy, and comfortable. We loved the fireplace. It had everything we needed and more. The location couldn’t be better. We would definitely recommend and plan to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A delightful place to stay! We loved sitting at the table and drinking tea with a full view of the ocean. The neighborhood is charming, and Gina is an excellent host!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great family vacation destination.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect cozy cabin weekend with amazing views of the ocean. Close to a lot of places for drinks and food!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! What an amazing view! The cliff behind gives a tremendous view of the Ocean as well as offering privacy from all the people on the beach.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All the expectations were met from the minute we arrived! Convenient private parking, easy access, very neat and clean, and we were absolutely blown away by the view in #7! What a beautiful place to stay on our mini vacation! There were so many things to see just by walking a short distance in and around Nye Beach... but we spent most of our days taking long walks up and down the beach, and then returning to our cozy retreat in the evening, playing guitar, reading books and enjoying delectable meals from our local finds in Nye Beach. We also took a short drive to Yaquina Head Lighthouse, then down to visit shops-n-sea lions down on the bay front, stopped for some fish-n-chips, and had to sample some decadent chocolate from the confectionery. As we began our drive home, we felt refreshed and ready for the coming week, fondly reminiscing, and thinking about when we will make our next visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a hidden gem and the host was wonderful! The views of the ocean are spectacular and the cottage is walking distance to shops, cafes, resturants etc. The cottage is clean, and full of everything you could possibly need on a vacation! The host provided goodies and even had chairs we took out to the beach for a little bonfire! I strongly recommend and will return!!! Thank you, Gina!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,The location and ocean view were the high points.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend staying here. Cabin number seven is as close to the ocean as you can get. It comes with a perfect view and very close to downtown Nye Beach. The cute little fireplace kept the place warm and cozy. The linens smelled fresh and clean. Loved it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet cottage! It has a beautiful view, being perched a bit above the ocean, and we saw many whale spouts while watching the waves. There are a bunch of nice restaurants and shops within walking distance. The bedroom is a bit small, but the bed is quite comfortable and there are nightstands and lamps on both sides. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. It’s also very quiet. We are happy we found this bungalow!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was truly relaxing with great views. Loved being able to walk around Nye Beach and having easy access to the beach.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Would look to stay here again next time in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beach Bum Bungalows are exactly as they are described, a Cliffside location near to all the Nye Beach restaurants, stores & art galleries. You can walk to everything & there is no shortage of variety in food, shopping & accessibility to many activities. It's a cozy space to enjoy the beach & your companions whatever the weather. A lovely retreat from our everyday lives!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, cozy cabin has everything you need for a stay at the beach
Great view and close to everything ."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place is quintessential Oregon coast. Historic, cozy inside and absolutely beautiful views. Gina has made an “old” cottage into a modern day, comfortable beach escape. Two girlfriends and I shared the space and were ecstatically happy. We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a really nice trip
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect for visiting Nye Beach. The cottage is fairly small, but so cozy and pleasant. It had everything we needed. The ocean view from the window is stunning. And everything was immaculate. Thanks!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great spot, we’ll likely be back to this spot again. Absolutely beautiful view."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful little cottage right on the beach. I would highly recommend the place to couples who are looking for a romantic place to stay. We were there with four people, one of them my 1 year old, so things can get a little crowded, but the location is amazing and there are really nice restaurants in walking distance."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for an authentic experience, this is your place. It is actually nicer than the photos show. You walk into a private gate that provides access to the 4-5 houses. The whole place has a nautical theme with some pirate touches that the kids loved. The house is small and close to original from 1910 but that was part of the charm. It worked great for our family of 4. The town was fun to explore and the beach is beautiful. You feel like you have your own private beach house overlooking the bluff. We would certainly stay here again. Thank you Gina for the great experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our experience was one of our best on the Oregon Coast!
What an incredible, unique, and thoughtfully decorated cabin, from the small community to the cabin itself. The view was breathtaking, and short walk to the beach.
We loved it! The location is AWESOME, super walkable around NYE Beach.
Communication was clear, thorough and proactive.
We would 1000% stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Gina’s place in Newport. Gina is an awesome host. The home is steps away from shops and restaurants and the beach.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this place! It was just a magical little cottage! Very well stocked and organized!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute seaside cabin. Comfortable and quaint. Best sunsets we’ve ever seen.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location with the most amazing view. Super cute cottage which was nicely decorated and well equipped with everything you need. Walkable to the beach and restaurants. The view was to die for! Would whole heartedly recommend
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Small and funky. A little rough around the edges but the location was great and we really enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy place, with an amazing view!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gina's place exceeded expectations - gorgeous view, squeaky clean, cute accents, everything needed, nice hot shower. We loved the quirky sea-themed decorations on the grounds and inside. It is obvious that alot of thought and care have gone into providing a lovely visit. I hope to return in the near future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We wish we had decided to stay longer! Great Beach! The hosts provide everything you would need to enjoy it fully, including Crab rings! The bed was so comfy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great space for a coastal getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. We surprised a friend with the trip for her birthday. Gina was kind enough to hang up decorations that we sent for the occasion. Our friend was surprised and we had a great stay. The home was just what we were looking for and had everything we needed. The view of the ocean from the front window was wonderful. It was well equipped and clean. Communication was fabulous. We would definitely stay again if we have the chance.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cute little cottage overlooking the beach and the ocean. Spotlessly clean, well fitted out with kitchen items, basics for cooking, coffee and tea, even chocolates! Gina was a kind and attentive host, making sure we found the place and knew where to park, and how to get inside. Gina's restaurant recommendations were great, and we particularly like Local Ocean and Zurita. The queen bed was comfy and we slept well. The view from the living room is simply amazing!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,very responsive and nice thank you
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a sweet little beach cabin and we enjoyed our stay. The view from the front window was lovely. A couple of things to be aware of - there aren’t any doors on the bedrooms which was uncomfortable for the person we were traveling with, but wasn’t a big deal for us. And the beach access is s short walk from the house, not directly in front of it like I thought. Gina was super quick to respond and this is a sweet place in a great location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location overlooking the ocean with all that Nye Beach has to offer just steps away. The cottage is comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. It was a lovely getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a magical experience! We are a family of four with two teenage daughters. It was a perfect, beautiful, peaceful ocean visit. We walked multiple times daily to the beach, plunged into the refreshingly crisp ocean, buried our bodies in the softest sands, listened to the roar of the ocean every night, and drank coffees and took in the tides from the tranquil serene seats right on the bluff overlooking the ocean. It was a homerun in everyway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location and cozy, comfortable place! Well-stocked kitchen with some thoughtful items for a starter breakfast. Would highly recommend and we look forward to visiting again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage has been kept in its original, simple style with nice flooring, comfy beds and furniture, and a very functional kitchen with all the necessities. It is right on the beach and walkable to good coffee, fun bars, and restaurants. We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is phenomenal. You look right out onto the ocean. Paved path to the beach is steps away!
Very walkable to book store, art gallery, wine shop, ice cream shop, bakery! Everything you need is in the cottage to make your stay complete."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and relaxing
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little find and was perfect for my mom and I. It's a good walk down to the beach and the view from the house is spectacular! Everything is clean and the area was quiet and peaceful at night. the beds were really comfy and couch blanket was snuggly and warm. Local restaurants, shops, bakeries were quaint and delicious. Would recommend and stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will return, and will recommend to my family and friends. The cottage was quaint, darling, clean....had everything we needed. Kitchen items were high quality! Cookbooks, selections of teas, cocoas, coffee.....The decor was perfect!
Beds were comfy. And linens fresh, clean and soft!
Loved reading the guestbook, and the magazines about the areas offerings.
Best thing was sitting at the table and watching the ocean!!! Thank you for a lovely time!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I want to live here in this cute clean bungalow! I was in number 7, the view was just amazing. Very comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The beach house is charming with an ocean view that can’t be beat. There are no doors on the bedrooms. While this wouldn’t be a problem for most people, it may be an issue for some. Other than that, we thought it was perfect. Unfortunately we had to leave shortly after checking in. I’m sure we would have enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina was a wonderfully responsive host and extremely helpful. The home was gorgeous, perfect as described. We loved the history of it and the area. You cannot beat the view!
Hope we’ll be back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy little cottage. It has great views and comfy beds. Having use of the crab traps was so nice!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gina's place was perfect for our needs. We had a great stay and it's even lovelier in person!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a great experience! Can’t wait to visit again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Fantastic view, easy to walk to beach and restaurants."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was fantastic! It was small but cozy. My family and I loved this place most throughout the vacation! We had a bungalow that overlooked the beach and nightly sunsets, very beautiful! The place fit our family of four perfect! Lots of restaurants around! We visited the Aquarium and Ripley’s Believe It or Not! We had a wonderful time. Thank you very much Gina! Will definitely stay again on our next vacation!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our one night stay. The place had everything we needed, was super clean, cozy, and had a beautiful view. The place worked well for 4 of us with one sleeping on the fold out. We parked and walked to restaurants for dinner and breakfast.
A couple of things to know that we didn't realize before staying there...there are no doors on the bedrooms, there are curtains across the doorways. You get to the beach by walking a block or two from the house and then heading down. Athough it looks like you can get there by walking out the behind the house, it's a high cliff."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, will definitely be returning ! Thank you !!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time staying, I would recommend Beach Bum Cottages to anyone. Peaceful, clean beautiful view and easy to access. I will be back in the future for another stay. Thank you for the memories."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this cottage! I have stayed here twice, and look forward to staying again in the future. Gina is a terrific host!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Gina is a wonderful host. the views are awesome. But as me and my mom are around 5 foot tall we had a hard time reaching the pull string for most of the lights. Also the fire extinguishers are about 3 years out of date, they need to be taken in. The fire detector in the living room kept going off in the night saying it needs a new battery. the tv has lots of options,but we couldn't get SlingTv or local channels or Netflix to work; so no tv for the duration of our trip. My mom thought the beach was walk-able right out the door,but you have to walk around the corner to get beach access, not far, but not right out the door. The location is good, walking distance to shopping and food. We did enjoy our trip overall."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay, wonderful host, would absolutely stay here again. Adorable space with a breathtaking view of the ocean; super-walkable neighborhood. Thank you Gina!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place, the two bedroom situation was perfect for our needs. Gorgeous location and responsive host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage RIGHT on the beach. You can sit right outside on the beach, get a full direct view of the beach. Gina was lovely as well!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cottage was lovely, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Gina was easy to communicate with and graciously allowed us to extend checkout time a bit. Another thing that impressed me was the lack of clean up Gina asked us to do. Some places ask so much you wonder why the cleaning fee is so high. Gina was very reasonable, and I would stay at this place again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Very peaceful and just as described.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect mid week getaway to the coast. Loved this place and would definitely stay there again!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only one thing needed upgrading: Higher quality toilet paper. Yikes.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. Perfect place for a family spring break vacation. Just steps to the ocean and many adorable shops and restaurants. Would absolutely stay again.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish we could give Gina 20 stars - 5 for each of the 4 nights we stayed at the Bungalow. It is in a fantastic location, with an amazing view of the ocean, so many places within walking distance, and so much to do in the area. The house was extremely clean, and well appointed. We had anything we could need for our cooking and kitchen needs, the linens and towels were sparkling clean, and it was just a comfortable place! This is our second year staying in one of the bungalows, and we are already looking forward to returning next year. Gina was so responsive with any questions I had. All in all, a wonderful visit for us!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the bungalow. The location and view are ideal. We loved the charm of the cabin and the yard decorated with the buoys and coastal vibes, it really added to the experience. Our family of four which included 2 kids, ages 9 and 11, were very comfortable here. We really appreciated all the extras that were provided: nightlights, granola bars/popcorn, guest access to watch shows at night, beach toys/buckets, etc. We are already planning our next vacation to stay here!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great trip!
At first I was indecisive between this listing and a hotel, however I AM SO GLAD I opted to stay here.
The cabin is cozy, but not too small. The view of the cape is great. Beach front access is only a 3 minute walk away. The added coffee and tea was a nice touch.
The walk-ability of the neighborhood is AMAZING. So many dining, bar, and shops in a short walking distance.
Thank you for a great trip!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous classic historic cottage by the sea. Perched a safe distance from the high bluff with a picture window full of breakers , seagulls, and even a whale or two. Decorated with all of the buoys and beachcombing treasures you can possibly gather if you lived there your whole life, your father was a fisher, and you collected beach art too. Comfortable and equipped with everything you might need.
If we both rate this lovely place, do we get to give it ten stars?"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Newport! The cottage was clean, comfortable, and well-stocked, and the view is unbeatable. Perfect place for a beach getaway!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is very cute and clean. Beds are comfortable. The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed. The best part of all is the location right on the bluff, and tremendous view from the living room This was a very good place to stay and explore Newport."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Nye beach was right outside your window, as well as walking distance to restaurants and shops. Perfect value!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. It was an easy walk to the beach and a great view.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic. You can’t get a better view. We are an active family and the location met all of our needs. We could walk everywhere! The amenities were all there plus some!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have found a better place to spend a mother/daughter weekend. Gina’s cottage is adorable and the location does not get any better. The welcome basket was so thoughtful and enjoyed! Everything we needed was within walking distance, beach, shopping and food. I would highly recommend Gina’s cottage."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun little place with a great location walkable to the beach and shops/restaurants at Nye Beach. It wasn’t large or fancy, but it was clean, well-stocked, functional, and charming. Worked great as a base for exploring the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was the best with a view that can’t be beat! You couldn’t ask for a better location either. There are so many little shops and places to eat with just a short walk, but because of how the house is set back off of the street it was so peaceful and we hardly saw anyone. We’ll be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very memorable stay at Gina and Alan's place. It was such a wonderfully appointed cottage - beach themed in every way possible - from starfish pillows to fish mitts to ocean fragrances and ocean themed books too! Very clean and well kept, and at a great location. Newport was a nice little friendly town as well. Highly recommend it for a couple or small family. Can't wait to visit again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the best vacation of my life. The bungalow was everything I could have asked for. AND THE VIEW from the bungalow was to die for. They thought of every detail possible. From a stocked kitchen utensils, to amazing bedding (so important after a long day of exploring), there is nothing that they have not thought of. The cabin was so clean and comfortable. We relaxed our first night and ordered Abbeys Legendary Pizza. OMGOSH.
Sitting in that dining room window, drinking some wine, and eating that phenomenal pizza, with the view will make your stay worth while.
I am from Nebraska, this vacation made my entire life. I’ve only dreamed of a vacation like this. I couldn’t be more life fulfilled after staying at their bungalow. The town is great, the food was PHENOMENAL, and the attractions are everywhere! We even saw whales (from the bungalow and at Depoe Bay)!
I promise you that you won’t have any qualms after staying here! There’s nothing that will compare. It was amazing. And I even cried a little when I had to leave.
Total 5 stars. I’d leave a 5 star every day of the stay if I could.
I will be back next summer for sure."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay in Newport at Gina and Alan's place. The location is fantastic, overlooking the ocean, a couple minute walk to beach access, and walking distance to shops/restaurants. The cottage is small (as advertised) and has no doors on the bedrooms, so probably best for folks who keep a similar sleep schedule and don't require much privacy. The hosts were very responsive and the only issue we had (a lock on the door broke while we were there) was fixed same day. We would stay again and recommend to others."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. The view was brilliant. The house has decorated very cute, lots of beach things. We had everything we needed. The beds were comfy. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Gina’s beach cottage was amazing. The cottage’s location is perfect. Close to the beach below and steps from shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars in Nye Beach. The cottage is perfect. Cozy and cute. Well maintained. We were impressed by the cleanliness. Everything was as advertised. Check in was easy.
We are coming back annually. My wife is already calling it “our place.” By the way, we are very discerning about quality, so we don’t write reviews like this all the time. Fantastic stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute bungalow over looking the ocean. Everything we needed was there and the location couldn’t have been better.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely amazing! If you open the windows in the bedroom at night you can be rocked to sleep by the mighty Pacific Ocean! It’s right by the beach and close to the main roads, so it supports a diverse range of interests and activities. Newport is a fantastic town with wonderful people, great food, and lots to do. The nature in this part of Oregon is also unparalleled.
Gina was very communicative and gave us everything we needed to have a wonderful experience. I’d give 10000/5 stars if I could. We definitely plan on coming back, and are incredibly grateful to our hosts for sharing this amazing place with us!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is amazing! You are on top of the Cliffside with a full view of the Yaquina bay light house and Nye beach. the location is quiet and easy to get too. It's very quaint and cozy!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The bungalow was absolutely perfect.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house has a great view of the beach & its only about a 5 minute walk to the beach. The house is clean and comfy and had everything we needed to make breakfast and dinner there.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gina was very accessible and helpful
Place was spotless
View was amazing"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was great in all the ways others have mentioned. The only drawback for us was that there are no doors on the bedrooms, just thin see-through curtains, so there isn't much privacy or quiet for the smaller bedroom which is right next to the kitchen and bathroom.
My son and I have different sleep schedules, so it was challenging not to wake him up when I was using the kitchen and bathroom.
Other guests didn't mention this, so it may not be an issue for most people."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place I've stayed on the Oregon Coast. You're literally right on the water, and wake up to a beautiful view of the mighty Pacific. We drove in from Portland, but didn't need a car the entire time we were there. There's a grocery store right up the street and it's super close to a bunch of adorable shops, great restaurants, and getting down to the beach. Highly recommend going to check out the Yaquina Lighthouse, which you can see from the Cabin. It's about a 5 minute drive and costs $7 to see the whole area, which includes gorgeous tidal pools. P.S. If you have a National Parks pass, the Lighthouse is free!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a phenomenally located quiet and cozy spot. We loved it!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Such a cozy little cottage. Amazing view of the ocean and awesome location. We walked everywhere- to the beach, to dinner, to the park, to ice cream after dinner. Gina was so accommodating. There were thoughtful touches throughout- popcorn, chocolates, bottled water all on arrival. Well stocked kitchen and full sized fridge made cooking for the kids so easy. Highly recommend!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was amazing. From a great location, a fantastic view to having basically everything on hand we might need. A vintage cottage with all the creature comforts. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of room for three adults. Gina very helpful if anything was needed (though we were all set). This is my new favorite place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Like paradise, overlooking the Pacific and in earshot of the waves. Everything was as promised and smooth. I would definitely stay here again. Lots of restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood too."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming, romantic, cozy historic cottage is perfectly located right on an ocean bluff for great views of the waves. The beds are comfy and Gina has lots of amenities and goodies for your arrival/stay. The town of Newport is cute with many good restaurants to choose from and coffee shops. Be sure to take time to visit the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area to see gray whales, a historic lighthouse and some wonderful views. Thanks again Gina for everything!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was perfect; so many things to do within walking distance, not to mention the beautiful view of the ocean. As a young girl I have stayed all up and down the Oregon coast at many locations, but this location was by far my favorite. The bungalow was so beautiful inside and out, and children friendly!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect easy location right next to the Nye Beach Neighborhood and just off of Hwy 20 after it ends in Newport. Clean beautifully appointed cottage. Minutes walk to the Performing Arts Center, the Visual Arts Center, Historic Nye Beach, Galleries, kitschy beach shops, and at least a dozen phenomenal restaurants. Plus it's well above the Tsunami Inundation Zone (You know...just in case)."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place so close to the beach! We loved all the thoughtful extras that were included like a pack n play and dog bowls!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As usual, our stay at Nye Beach Cottages (this time Cottage A) was great. We had everything we needed for a comfortable week visiting the Oregon Coast. Not only are the cottages within walking distance of the beach and shops and restaurants, but Nye Beach is centrally located on the coast. You're within reasonable driving distance of many of the coast's attractions. We'll be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, very comfortable and clean. The host’ are accommodating and the location is extremely walkable, few blocks to the beach, restaurants and shopping. Thank you for the stay!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean cottage in a great location. I've stayed in other cottages in this complex before and enjoy the location and the dog-friendliness. This cottage was very dark - there are no lights in the main living/dining area - only over the kitchen counters along the back wall. There's a nice ceiling fan over the couch but it's not a model that has a light included. My daughter was excited to see the jigsaw puzzles in the cottage but with no light at all in in the dining nook it was too dark in the evenings to do anything at the table or even at the coffee table in the living room.
Kitchen was clean and nice size. It's a little more bare-bones than other airbnb's I've stayed at. We couldn't find a baking sheet and only a small pot for cooking pasta. Bed was comfy and we enjoyed the little deck with chairs off the bedroom. There's even a little peek-a-boo view of the ocean if you look closely. Wish the checkout time were a little later. 10am is earlier than many other places"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Walking distance to good food and beach. Clean and cozy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! It was stocked with everything we needed and its a very short walk to the beach, restaurants, and a grocery store. When we arrived I had an issue with the keypad, but Leslie immediately answered her phone and helped get us inside."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice location and a warm, inviting, clean feel. The fireplace was a nice touch!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was just what we needed for a getaway. the location is perfect and we were especially grateful to have an option that allowed our little pup. I struggled a lot with the smell of the place (I'm sensitive to odors), especially the air fresheners meant to mask the smell. But the place was well stocked, lovely, and we'd be likely to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Spacious and comfortable unit in good walking distance to nye beach.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, easy check-in and clear instructions."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly we are never the type of people to write reviews but Leslie’s and Anthony place take the icing on the cake everything about it was just amazing, high ceilings very spacious bed was big and very comfy, kitchen was stocked with everything you may need, felt like I was just at home comfortable and cozy, washer and dryer definitely came in clutch even tho it wasn’t guaranteed to work but luckily it was up and running during our stay, my favorite thing about the whole house will definitely be the tub lol, but the beach is within walking distance location is perfect and close to a bunch of stores, was surprisingly quiet and private even tho there was other people staying next door, never once came in contact with the other people staying there 10/10 recommend booking with Leslie and Anthony, definitely will be back and actually already planning on making a trip back!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable cottage located within a short walking distance to the ocean. The cottage was clean, comfortable, and stocked with many thoughtful items such as beach gear and board games. The downtown area with local shops and places to eat was also very close."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was just what we were looking for. We walked to the beach and restaurants and shops. The bed was comfortable (and I'm particular about mattresses). The tub was so great, with jets! We didn't hear any neighbors or noise from outside. We will definitely go back."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,The room rate was fair. I think the cleaning fee is a little higher than needed for a guest that only stays for one night. Perhaps pro rating depending on how many guests and how many nights could be considered.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Booked this place last minute and the hosts were responsive and great about allowing us to book. Great location and wonderful spacious home. Would definitely stay here again!

Whole family was happy- including my husband and I, our dog, and our infant! We thought there was plenty of room to spread out with all of our baby gear!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, cozy and great location. Very comfortable bed and a fully stocked kitchen. Check in and out were extremely easy. Plenty of grassy areas for our dog to do their business.
It was a little warm for our comfort level so we appreciated the fan in the bedroom. However we would’ve loved having another fan in the main living area.
Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to the beach and local restaurants. It is about less than 10 minutes walk to the beach. The place has step to the bedroom and bathroom which I almost trip on few times on the first day. After I am aware of it then I was able to avoid it. Overall, we had a great stay there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, allowed us to have an early check in. Really nice house as well, perfect for a quick turn around and get on the road real quick. Really enjoyed the bath, best part of the house!!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"Convenient walk to both old town Newport & spectacular Nye Beach. Parking could be slightly tricky with a larger truck. Small washer and dryer did work while we were there, though we missed that it is not a guaranteed amenity.
Mattress or mattress pad smelled very bad of body odor, through the clean sheets. Both my sensitive-nosed partner & unbothered me noticed immediately upon getting into bed. We slept with our feet to the headboard and an extra blanket under us to limit the smell. A frustrating situation- I recommend to the homeowner to replace. Everything else was very clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Could hear the ocean and gulls from the deck door in bedroom. Would love a locked screen door to hear it all night hut got up extra early to relax on deck. Thank u for creating such a relaxing space.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was perfect for our little family. Would stay there again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and spacious cottage in a quiet neighborhood just a short walk to everything in Nye Beach.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Always a great stay in Nye beach, already looking forward to next year"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and will come back again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable stay, just what we needed. The oversized bed and jetted tub were definitely a plus and the short walk down to the beach was perfect for our dogs. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great communications with the hosts. We enjoyed our stay in Newport. The cottage was perfect for my husband and me. Very walkable to restaurants, bakeries and shops. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home away from home, comfortable and clean and very much quiet. Location is within walking distance of markets, shops, restaurants and the beach."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Accommodations were clean, close to the beach, and reasonably priced. We had many family members together who were able to stay in surrounding units so that worked well for us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had such a lovely stay in Newport in Unit A. The apartment was very spacious , and the beds were very comfortable. The location can’t be beat if you want to walk everywhere. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location lots of restaurants and beach access close by! Very pet friendly area. Cottage was clean, comfortable and homey would highly recommend. Would stay here again if I made it back to the coast."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is situated close to everything Nye Beach has to offer, within walking distance. We visited for the Newport Marathon, and the Start Line was only a 1.1 mile walk. Plus, it's right on the course through the Nye Beach section, so my wife got to cheer on our entire team, just about 50 steps out the door. The area is close enough to highway 101 for larger stores or other needs, but very quiet when coming back to relax or when sleeping at night. We had a few teammates stop by after the race, and all of them wished they'd found a place like this. Everything in the house worked as expected, and the provided amenities and consumables were more than adequate. We also enjoyed the fact that our unit had a small but cozy and relaxing deck off the bedroom. We'd definitely stay here again for it's proximity to Nye Beach, and it's location just close enough to downtown Newport, but much quieter."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spacious and cozy spot near Nye Beach. Easy to find and a dedicated parking spot right out front. We were just passing through but would have been happy to stay longer if possible.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time here and it was clean and comfortable; it was just the right size for 2.
Location was great, easy walk to beach access and restaurants."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very accommodating, walkable to the beach and restaurants. Very cozy"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was minutes from the beach and Nye Beach restaurants and shops but on a quiet peaceful street. Plus it's well above the tsunami zone. The bed was very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath was great. It had a well-equipped kitchen and it was easy to find everything we needed during our stay. The little back porch off the bedroom was cool. Leslie and Anthony were super responsive when we realized we left something behind. Great value for the price too.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place , wish it was a bit cheaper"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cottage and great walking distance to the beach and restaurants. The best part was how flexible and friendly the hosts were. They were very accommodating to our requests and responded very quickly! Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a really lovely stay here and would definitely go back the next time we’re in Newport! The beach is a 4 minute walk from your front door and there are many amazing restaurants close by. All in all a wonderful place to stay !
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Spacious, comfortable, quiet."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,They allowed an early check in which worked great for the event we were attending. Clean space and easy check-in/out. I’d recommend this cottage!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"it was a wonderful stay. the place was very clean, it's in a great location and was very peaceful. however, I paid about $430 with fees, I wouldn't say this was worth that. while all of the amenities were great, the water didn't stay hot for too long so I couldn't run a full bath and for the check-in/out time restricted to 4pm and 10am I only was able to spend about a day and a half. If I was allowed to check-in around 10am that would have been better."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and cozy stay! Quiet relaxing space was perfect for my partner, dog, and I. Would highly recommend! Even more spacious than pictures show. Although it was in a complex with other air bnb s, it still felt private and was quiet. Beach is close, just a nice stroll"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful vacation home! Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised with how much bigger the space was. It was super clean, instructions for check in and check out were clear. It was within walking distance to the beach and restaurants. We absolutely loved it! I will book this property again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy, quaint, basic cottage, very near Nye beach and all stores and restaurants. Absolutely loved the stove style fireplace."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really fun and great stay. Perfect location from the beach and other places to visit. Enjoyed the private parking and perfect size for 2 people for a weekend or two.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay. My daughter and I were comfortable. I like the reading nook by the fire. Nice lighting would help more with reading in the evening/early morning.
I requested a little later check out due to a meeting call that ends at 10 am and the host texted back with an 11 am check out. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was very nice and clean, easy to access. The place was much bigger than anticipated."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"second time in that house. it's perfect size, private and good location"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice helpful hosts, great area of Newport walkable to Nye Beach and lots of the highlight restaurants"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay at Leslie’s and Anthony’s. Perfect for us as we were driving the coast. We felt very st home and the king size bed was super comfortable. I highly recommend and hope to be back again soon.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful clean and cozy house. No view of the ocean which was actually all right. I got outside more. Great location . Restaurants close. I’ll be back !
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location! Dog friendly was a plus, we will be back !"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a former resident, so I was familiar with the neighborhood, and all my favorite restaurants are walkable. I intend to return and am looking forward to checking out the other units on the property. There are two things I would recommend for Cottage A. Better lighting over the table for card players, and a warning label on the bubble bath. This jetted tub is as deep as I have experienced and I swear I put in a tiny bit of the product supplied by the hosts (all great) and then had to fight the foam when I turned on the jets. It was comical, never overflowed, and no one to take my “like a movie” moment. I would suggest less than half a teaspoon, if you want to enjoy the jets for any length of time, before you have to turn them off. My friend from Bend told me about these units, and she was right. Praise worthy, and affordable. We will be back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for a coastal getaway
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"spacious one bedroom, beautiful location and the jacuzzi/bathtub was divine!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the third time we have stayed with Leslie and Anthony. We will be back because we love Newport and this is a wonderful place to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this cute little spot - so great to have a house to myself (and cheaper than a hotel room!) Careful - there is a step down into the bedroom and into the bathroom. There was a jetted soaking tub! And a gas fireplace that heated the place up quickly. The bed was comfy and the linens were top-rate. I'll be back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Easy, clean, well-stocked, safe. Thanks!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leslie and Anthony's little coastal cottage was simply wonderful! Newport is one of my favorite spots on the Oregon coast, and having such a wonderful spot to call home for the night, right in the heart of the Nye District, was fantastic! Me and my boyfriend felt at home from the moment we walked in. The very spacious kitchen was great for preparing dinner after a full day of exploring, and the fantastic gas stove in the living room was a definite highlight. Not only did it add a wonderful ambiance to the space, but it warmed up the entire cottage extremely well! We would love to stay at the cottage again on a future trip to Newport!"
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"When I made my reservation, I thought Nye Beach was on or very close to the beach. However, upon arrival I was not able to see the ocean from where I stayed and the walk to get even close to the beach was not easy. There was nothing from the the place I stayed but I had higher expectations."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful home for a night! Perfect for us in every way. Would definitely stay there again. Great hosts, too!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"love this property, perfect location to everything including a lovely coffee place and the beach. parking is very convenient as well"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our 5 night stay. Such a cute place! Our first impression was how nice it smelled. Very clean. It was cozy and very comfortable. The kitchen has everything to cook and serve full meals. The bed was comfortable. The gas fireplace kept us nice and warm. The bathroom was spotless and clean, with a roomy bathtub/shower. Great location! Easy to find, and close to grocery stores, restaurants, the beach and attractions. Leslie was very quick to respond to text messages. We couldn't have been happier with our stay, and can't wait to go back! Thank you Leslie and Anthony!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location at Olive and Brook offers easy access to Nye Beach and the little business community. The neighborhood is very quiet, and the manager was around every day and there to help if needed. The unit itself is well maintained and felt fairly private."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unit A is very spacious and cosy all in one. The bed is huge and comfortable. The kitchen provides all the equipment you might need. Very quiet neighbourhood and it's just a very short way to most amazing Nye Beach. There you also find nice touristy stores, restaurants (Nana's Irish Pub and the Tabhouse were great), Cafes ... you name it. I definitely would recomment this place, also for a longer stay. Last but not least: Leslie and Anthony were very fast in responding and helpful to me. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute and comfy place to stay and they had everything we possibly needed. A washer/dryer combo, comfy bed, and even had snacks available. Easy check in process with electronic lock, great directions and communication."

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location for food and beach!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute beach cottage with lots of room and large open kitchen. The washer/dryer were perfect for mid-way through our road trip. There is a full grocery store within walking distance which made dinner easy and cute shops to browse.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This 'beach house' is a great location and so close to the beach, literally 5 minutes walking! Super clean and well-stocked with those little extras for cooking in such as spices, cooking oil, foil. Soft, cushy bed and even the person who slept on the fold out said it was quite comfortable. It was cool when we arrived but there was just a bit of heat on and a warm, cozy smell made it so welcoming after driving. Quiet neighborhood with lots of little shops for food, coffee (essential for morning walks on the beach) and dessert! Leslie and Anthony are very responsive hosts. We'll stay here again at the first opportunity!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars all around. Great location, and within walking distance of lots of attractions. Close to the aquarium and a short drive to the Yauina Lighthouse area. Spotlessly clean and a full kitchen, which is nice since we like to prepare our own food. Hosts were quick to respond to any message I sent. A big plus for us was having a washer/dryer since we had been on the road for a while and it was great to leave with clean clothes!
I would recommend Local Ocean in the Newport Harbor for fantastic fresh seafood meals (you can also buy fish there to cook at home. ) :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"These cottages are by far the cleanest, most comfortable and well stocked Airbnb rentals my family and I have stayed in. An absolute pleasure. Lovely views of the ocean, close enough to walk to everything in Nye Beach, including an awesome playground for the kids, and pet-friendly as well! Truly a wonderful experience all around. Well done providing a home away from home for so many lucky travelers!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Clean, well equipped cottage with a very comfortable king size bed. Great location a few minutes walk to the beach with lots of places to watch the sunsets.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and pleasant place. The bed was comfortable. The pull out couch was good. Everything was well organized and truly felt like we were home. The only downside would be the parking but that is outside of anyones control. Located a short walk from the beach. We would highly recommend to anyone looking for a clean, affordable and comfortable stay in Newport."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This unit was so cute! It was perfect for my little family of four, two children being five yrs and ten months. Location was only blocks away from Historic Nye Beach.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location with an easy walk to the beach or park for your kids to play. The slide is extra long so worth the visit. Loved the basket they had for kids and the beach toys. Made it feel more kid friendly than most other rentals and my kid loved the giant bath tub.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot in NYE Beach— exactly as advertised. We checked in fairly late so the door code made it so we could come and go as we pleased. I loved getting up and walking down to the beach every morning and having a full kitchen made cooking at the cottage a breeze. Super close to all the best restaurants as well. We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This cottage is really cute and very comfortable! Enjoyed the spa tub for two! Hosts gave great recommendations for food and responded to our messages immediately. Just a quick walk down to the beach where we watched an epic sunset! Wish we could have stayed longer!

2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this gem in Newport. It was clean, featured a king size bed, and had a warm gas stove and a huge bathtub. The only downside is the hot water didn’t last long enough to fill the tub, so we had to fill it in stages. But we still loved our stay, and will definitely stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a fantastic cottage that is located a quick five minute walk to the beach, downtown Nye beach, and 45 minutes to Lincoln city.
This cabin was dog friendly, they even provided dog bowls for food and water, chair covers in case your pooches jump up on the furniture, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was well accessorized and a very pretty home with a lot of cute decor. The enclosed gas fireplace in the living room was amazing, and had all the advantages of your own fireplace, minus having to light it, add wood, or worry about smoke— it kept us super warm while it was snowing, and it also made us feel like we were in the mountains sitting next to a warm fireplace.
The cottage also had all of the channels you could need on its Roku TV: Netflix, Amazon prime, Apple TV— plenty to watch and keep us busy when it was snowing outside.
Also, Plenty kitchen Necessities needed to cook your own meals, and very clean. All in all this is one of the best air BNBs I’ve ever stayed in. (This was my second time staying in these cottages, and this one was even better than the first one. We will be back!)"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place that had everything I needed. You could walk to the beach and restaurants. Pet friendly. Apple TV.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a gem. Of all the Airbnbs I've stayed at over the years, this one is most thoughtfully cared for and maintained; clean and cozy and well thought out. It has everything you could need and not more so there is no clutter. It is obvious how much the owners care about their property! We had a wonderful time and loved our stay. (One note: for asthma sufferers, the cleansers used by the cleaning team are very strong until they dissipate. Bring your inhaler just in case!)"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place. Short walk to the beach and shops.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place to stay, and within walking distance Nye Beach. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little unit super close to Nye Beach. We were able to walk the dogs right down to the beach.
wonderful suggestions for places to eat.
If you have a bigger vehicle like a truck, parking is very tight. If someone parked next to us, we probably wouldn't be able to get out. We ended up just parking on the street which was just fine for us."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice and place in a great location. The fees costed more then the sticker price. $114 turned into $250 after all the fees. I booked for 2 nights but somehow was only confirmed for 1 and did not notice as the charges made since for 2 nights. It was a nice placed and wish we weren’t unexpectedly had to rush to get out after the locks were changed with our stuff inside still as we went for a walk by the beach.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location 2 blocks from the beach, cozy cottage with fireplace & large jetted tub, separate king bedroom."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved cottage A! Quiet, lovely set up and had everything we could need. Very close to great beach views, shops and restaurants."

2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,House was very clean and comfortable for two people.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little place! Had some trouble at check-in with a keypad code that didn't work but it was easily and quickly resolved.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute little cottage in a perfect Nye Beach location. Great value.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"This comfortable, cozy cabin is a short walk from the beach and from restaurants, cafes, and bars in the upper beach area. We enjoyed our stay and found the living room area comfortable and enjoyed the warmth of the gas fueled cast iron stove there. The bath and the bedroom were a little dark, but this did not bother us. If visiting Nye Beach, I would stay here again given its proximity to the beach. You might want to avoid the lower portion of the beach as it is crowded with touristy hotels and restaurants."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute cottage with great amenities and a nice soaker tub! Definitely worth the stay.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking distance from everything. The manual left for guests has wonderful suggestions in it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved everything about our stay here! Perfect for me and my little family of 3 for our short weekend getaway. Tons of counter space in the kitchen, huge jetted tub, washer and dryer, and the Apple TV connected to Netflix for my little one. Great location, clean, and up to date. Had me contemplating running away to Newport and starting a new life! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best place. Short walk to food and beach. Very welcoming for people with dogs. Clean, quite, and cozy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and great location!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was our favorite during our 2 week adventure. The cottage was very clean and comfortable. The hosts were attentive and even brought us a fan. Everything was clean and spacious. The bathtub was simply amazing!! I wish we had spent more time here and we will definitely stay here again in the future. The kitchen was huge and well stocked. The location can't be beat, the beach was 2 blocks away- we could hear the ocean at night if we left our door to the deck open. It was close to downtown and all kinds of restaurants and shopping, but it was also very quiet and peaceful. There was also a washer and dryer in the bathroom. I can't stress how amazing this place was!! Thank you for an amazing stay"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable, within walking distance of the beach and several very good restaurants."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent instructions for arrival
Host was on site to deal with questions
Place was nearly brand new
Bald eagles in the backyard
Very secluded and quiet"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin just off the coast. The spruce forest on one side, the beach on the other side. Beautiful views. The eagles in the backyard add an extra dimension. We had a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay in Newport on the beautiful Oregon coast. Walter pointed an Eagle couple and the nearby location of their nest. This hilltop location had a fantastic view of the beach across the road. The unit was quiet, clean and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had other arrangements for our getaway to the beach. A few hours prior to our trip we had to change our plans. We were able to easily find Walter's oasis and book it quickly. Upon arrival we were welcomed warmly and got into our vacation mode!
The location would be absolutely amazing on sunny days. View of the ocean and eagles flying above. Being Oregon, it rained for a good portion of our time. Being Oregonians, we went out and adventured anyway. Just what we needed for our recharge weekend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful forest location with peckaboo view of the ocean from the dining table and upstairs. On the east side of 101 and Moolack Beach is across the highway. Walter was a very friendly and helpful host and the house is still well stocked. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely experience for the two of us. We liked the simplicity of the furnishings, the comfy bed, the light and airy loft/living room, the excellent shower, the outdoor sitting area in the back. Easy to get back and forth to beaches, restaurants, and attractions in Newport."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The rental is very clean and well maintained. I enjoyed the view and the quiet. Walter is warm and welcoming. I would recommend!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and clean, friendly host, clear instructions of what to do when checking in/out. Overall a nice place to stay :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was clean and had everything we needed for our weekend. It had a beautiful view of the ocean and Walter was a great host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place, great location and view! We had a wonderful time and will be back again! Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent stay and nice view of the ocean from upstairs and down. Walter was very responsive and checked in throughout the stay to make sure we had everything we needed. Nature walk out back was fun. Right across from Moolack beach too. Great stay would recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I absolutely loved the house: super clean and has great views of the ocean. Walter is an excellent host and a really nice man. I highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, fun environment. Flexible and personable host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could give 6 stars! Even 10! Absolutely the best stay I’ve had anywhere ever. This place is beautiful even beyond what the pictures capture. The unit itself was spotlessly clean, smelled great, beautifully furnished, the perfect space for our 3-person party. The site is amazingly private - a quarter-mile trail loop in the back that’s easily walkable but not trampled-through like many public trails can be, and the woods themselves were gorgeous. The location was perfect - right across the road from Moolack beach, which isn’t crowded at all, and under a 10 min drive to downtown Newport. Walter was an amazing host - communicative, accommodating, extremely helpful, friendly and happy to talk, and even cleared out the fire pit and set it up for us to use! We will be coming back many times, and if you’re wondering if this is the spot for you: it is, book it now!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely vacation property in a beautiful private setting close to the ocean. Walter was very welcoming. The apartment was adorable, comfortable, clean and well stocked. It was the perfect size for two of us to relax upstairs and downstairs, and the location is perfect for exploring from Depoe Bay to Yachats and beyond. Unfortunately, we had two problems during our stay. The heater didn't work and it was cold inside. The power also went out for about 24 hrs. Although there were some delays in communications, we appreciate Walter's efforts to handle these unexpected problems. Next time we would communicate only through the AirBNB app rather than trying to call or text directly. Despite these issues, we had a great time here."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a couple night
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place - had everything we needed. Great room to sit and relax and very comfortable bed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing host. Incredible location. Will 100% stay again if in area. Thanks again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Walter’s place. When we look for a place, we want quiet and privacy…this place has both with lovely views. One of the few places that actually provided cloth napkins! 😊 We loved that. Excellent access to Yaquina head, Devil’s punch bowl and downtown Newport."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was superb. The only negative fact is our trip had the main purpose to enjoy fishing excursions. Next stay will include more time to enjoy the beautiful surroundings at Walters’s. The lodging is well designed, comfortable, and make’s return a big desire."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful guesthouse in a private and peaceful setting. Walter & Deb are gracious hosts, responsive and very welcoming. The house is quaint, uncluttered, and stocked with everything we required. This is a lovely guesthouse in a superb location. Highly recommended!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What great views! Just a gorgeous property and very private. You feel
Like you’re in your own private oasis. Walter and his wife are incredibly kind and we felt so comfortable. They were kind enough to allow us to bring our dogs and they loved it too. Bed is comfy, bathroom is large, lots of windows and light. Tastefully decorated without clutter."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed perfect privacy, beauty, and a hill top view of ocean sunsets here. We were surrounded by gorgeous trees and we took advantage of a lovely, walkable path through the woods out back. The location is perfect with the beach just a short walk away and it's just a quick drive into Newport. This lovely unit was spotless, had everything we needed as well as very comfortable beds. Walter was a wonderful host, available to answer questions or to make suggestions regarding the area. He even made sure to direct our attention to a tree top where ""George,"" one of the resident bald eagles, sat watching from above. Overall, our stay was truly enjoyable. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simply amazing stay, super comfy, clean, and had everything we could need such a gorgeous place to stay and Walter is so kind. I would recommend this to anyone coming to the area"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We spend few days there. Lots to do in the area, just across from the beach. Walter was the best host and would definitely come back next year again for our annual Oregon trip."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful rental. Great location with gorgeous surroundings. Rental had everything we needed for our stay. We appreciated being able to wash and dry our clothes since we had to pack light. Thank you for sharing your rental with us!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and secluded - what a delightful stay! This hilltop home is spotless and comfortable with a lovely host and lovely host puppers! (The dogs bark on approach, but after introductions they are both super sweet!) Enjoy sunsets over the ocean and a deep rich forest all around including the resident bald eagle. The driveway is narrow and bumpy so be prepared to go slowly. This is by far my favorite stay in the Newport area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay tucked in the hills right above 101. Comfortable downstairs bedroom, and great host. I’d happily stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful guest house on top of a hill overlooking the ocean. Two friendly dogs that greeted us and Walter was incredibly nice!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! We loved the appartment, the view from the patio and the beautiful woods next to the backyard. Walter was very welcoming and friendly. Thanks again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Walter was very kind and friendly, and the dogs next door were lovely too! The house shares a driveway with the owners’ house, they have a lovely little garden and he offered to let me use the space to watch the sunset, which unfortunately I didn’t get back from dinner in time to do. Loved the personal touches and the snacks set out at the coffee station! A truly well done Airbnb, would definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Walter’s place!
Walter was such a great host with great communication. When we needed help with a couple of things he was so kind & very helpful!
The place had everything our family needed for a nice weeklong stay at the coast.
Thank you Walter!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family loved our stay here - there were so many little touches (personalized welcome sign, snack bar, etc) that made us feel very welcome. Walter also had a detailed folder with great recommendations of the area (don’t forget to checkout the resident eagles!) and went above and beyond setting up a fire for us and sharing a book about the Oregon coast. We can’t recommend this place enough."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is really nice and special! Its in the woods and you feel surrounded by the forest. There is a little sign pointing the way to a beautiful walk in the woods. I love ICE and was pleasantly surprised to find ice in icetrays so I could make more. The amenities were just so nice, including granola bars and chocolate cookies. We were able to make a fire in a secure pit. I loved it and reccomend it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were very comfortable and enjoyed that we could walk to shops and restaurants. Parking was a little tight with other guests also having large vehicles, but overall was a great place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was 10 minutes walking distance from the beach and shops. It was cute, clean, and well stocked. Dogs were welcome. Parking was super convenient. It was exactly as described :)"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The NYE Beach Cottage “B” was just as described. Instructions were also clear. It was neat and clean, and the bed was very comfortable! I want to note that the cottage lists a bit towards the bathroom. We had some tiny ant visitors at breakfast, but kept them at bay by putting all unsealed food in the fridge, washing dishes immediately, and washing out any trash or recycle containers. The hostess was very helpful and also gave us a good recommendation for tidal pool viewing at Yaquina lighthouse. It was a very enjoyable visit."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice quiet location. Our welcome message didn’t have the code to the door, but when I texted Leslie she got back to me in just a few minutes with a code. Very responsive!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable. Great location in Nye Beach. Very well equipped. Private parking and easy access.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I loved the location, and the place was clean! Other than that it was a nice place to stay. Very close to just about everything in Newport."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Leslie and Anthony’s AirBNB. I will definitely be looking to stay again and possibly in a different cottage! others nearby were super friendly. The side yard for pets was perfect and the main reason why this listing was chosen, one thing to consider is other peoples dogs we did have someone who would leave their dog on the provided running line for extended hours of the day, as well as move it to their personal porch, this did not cause any issues as there are other places to take your dog potty right by the cottages and there is a large trash can in the parking lot for doggie bags. i would definitely recommend this airbnb to any couples looking for a getaway.
Beds and couches were SUPER comfy, extra towels provided, small kid toy basket/sand castle materials, doggy supplies (poo bags and bowls!)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome location, comfortable bed, private location. Added pup touches like treats were really kind, and the kitchen had everything needed. Loved being able to enter via code. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy little cottage which is small, but worked my Newport business trip. The kitchen was well equipped. Bathroom is small but skillfully remodeled and worked very well. The bed was very comfortable and warm. The weather was unexpectedly lovely for April. I would certainly come again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very comfortable place with easy instructions and a nice welcome basket with a few snacks and water. It was close to restaurants but had a nice well stocked kitchen if needed. Glad we found this spot!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little spot on the coast - easy access to incredible seafood - great place to bike on the beach all the way to Yaquina lighthouse!
The place is clean, the kitchen is well stocked, the wifi is fast (I'm a remote worker and was using it for some serious data downloads), and the hosts are super friendly and responsive!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nye Beach Cottage B was perfect for my wife, dog and me for a four night stay. It is centrally located, which was perfect for us. We found the cottage to be quiet, comfortable, and a nice walk down to the beach with the dog in the evenings."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely stay. This place had absolutely everything you could need to live on the beach for a little while. Kitchen, small dining table, couch area, bathroom, and bedroom. My only feedback is to extend the 10am checkout. Like many rentals, you don’t get this place for a full 24 hours. Wanting to sleep in a little on vacation, eat breakfast, pack up, morning walk etc. is a lot to squeeze in. I would absolutely stay again and maybe next time see if I could do an extended checkout. No one wants to feel rushed on the beach :) thanks!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely little place! Super cozy and has everything you need to feel right at home. Leslie and Anthony were AMAZING and accommodated me after I scheduled my stay dates incorrectly. This location is close to everything and is adorable! 10/10 recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay at this place. Very easy to walk to the beach and restaurants/shops/bars in Nye Beach. I would stay here again.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A nice spot for a day or two if you’re looking to be close to the beach! We didn’t have the passcode for entry in our welcome message but the hosts were quick to respond. The foundation of the place is wonky but didn’t mess with the trip. I liked having a designated parking spot! All in all, a good find for the purpose of our trip."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to stay. Perfect location. They provide you with everything you need. Thank you for being dog friendly and even providing some treats for our pup!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great affordable spot in an amazing area!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely felt very comfortable at Leslie and Anthony's place, slept well and appreciated the quiet. We have stayed at several hotels and Airbnb's over the last 2 years and many have had a terrible mattress making it hard to sleep. Full kitchen was a plus but we would have liked more counter space. The couch was also comfy but I would say that the chairs at the kitchen table were very hard and our guests had to bring a chair over as there were only 3. The bathroom was small but adorable with a great shower. Overall, we would definitely come back again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location. Pictures accurate. Liked the grassy area for my dog to go to the bathroom right outside. Heater worked nicely though on the louder side. Had a dog bowl which we appreciated after we forgot ours! Appreciated that checking out instructions didn’t include long list, only washing dishes."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were looking for a quick getaway and this place was perfect! We will definitely be back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage. Simple place that is close to the beach and shops at Nye Beach and close to everything else in the Newport area.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy bed. Roomy closet. Clean, and the kitchen had everything I needed. A great space for a long weekend/holiday trip!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was well stocked and very clean. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time in Cottage B! The space is small and quaint but perfect for 1 or 2 people and a pup. Walking distance to the beach and lots of great restaurants and shops. As others mentioned the bed is super comfy! The kitchen was furnished with very basic pots and pans - no frills, so I would bring your own if you're making meals here. There is also no kettle (as seen in the photos, so bring that too if needed). Quirky little beach studio - would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lodging was clean, tidy, and comfortable. Well equipped. No views, also I didn’t expect it. There are excellent opportunities all around."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent value, great location for Nye Beach and Old Town Newport"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay! Definitely will be back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was great for the weekend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at this Airbnb! Very cozy and well-stocked with everything you’d need. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and tidy cabin. I wish we could have enjoyed it more and spent time but we had business to attend to. Would stay there again and hopefully enjoy the beach. Lots of great restaurants close by.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best part about our stay was the location! We loved being able to walk down to the water and all the Nye beach shops within minutes. The place itself was clean and quiet, and the kitchen was well stocked. There was a radiator style plug in heater in the bedroom, which we used on the colder nights. Overall, good value!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anthony & Leslie's rental made a perfect getaway and base of operation for our 4 day stay. It was central, close to beaches, quiet & clean. And finally! A comfortable couch!
Neighboring renters were all friendly and respectful, as was Lori, the manager.
Will definitely rent from them again. This was our second experience with them!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, the cottage was immaculate and had everything one might need. Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cottage with a five minute walk to beach area. Clean and comfy. Floor is a little wonky towards rear of unit but nothing serious. Sink in bathroom is super tiny (one of those rectangular space spacer types) so be prepared for water splashing onto floor.😁 Overall, a comfortable place, relatively quiet, safe, and minutes walking to shops in Nye Beach."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was small but it was clean, well equipped, had a designated parking spot and was walkable to beach, restaurants and shops in the Nye Beach area. Just right for two people. Great set up for a dog with a grassy spot right outside and hose for spraying sand off after the beach. The unit had a strong smell of cleaning solution even after airing out so that was my one negative."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this little cottage and it was so close to the beach and restaurants in the area. All within walking distance. First time staying in Newport and this was a wonderful way to get introduced to this area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful little cottage in the heart of Newport. Close to the beach, shops, restaurants, groceries and many outdoor activities. A perfect place for visiting Newport. Assigned parking off street, quiet street, great kitchen, plenty of room inside. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to others."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, so close to the public beach access. Nice potty area for my dog. Really enjoyed having a full kitchen. Appreciated the couch cover, assuming they wash it with each guest, which made me feel more at ease. Also the bedding wasn’t the bulky type that always makes me wonder if it’s getting cleaned…everything at Leslie and Anthony’s place seemed perfect for full sanitation. Really just a relaxing and enjoyable stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great little stay, in a perfect location. Despite initially having trouble accessing the apartment upon an unexpectedly late arrival, the hosts were responsive and remedied the situation well. The home came with everything we needed to be comfortable during a week long stay. The extra items for our dog were really nice as well! One of us was working remotely and the internet was fast and reliable. We wished we had been permitted to leave our dog in her crate when necessary so that we could go to some of the places around town that didn’t allow dogs. Fortunately most places had outdoor seating and were dog friendly. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would be glad to stay again if we find ourselves back in Newport."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Unfortunately we could not make it to our Airbnb destination because of an emergency but Leslie and Anthony were very communicative and even though we were not eligible for a refund, they were accommodating with a future discount if the room got filled.
Above and beyond being nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful time, had a horrible time getting to Portland because of Amtrak and Leslie and Anthony were so understanding."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location! Everything that you need to enjoy your stay in Newport
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This place was fine for our intended purposes.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a cool place to stay right near the water.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good location close to Nye Beach. Bathroom is nice and kitchen has the basics and large fridge. TV has lots of channels and apps including Apple+ which was great. Not fancy, but it was a nice simple place to stay in a good location in Newport, walk to beach and restaurants."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at Nye Beach at Leslie and Anthony’s. The space was small but perfect for 2 people and our dog. Well equipped kitchen, extra blankets, fan, plenty of towels. We had absolutely everything we needed. Thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quant, quiet, and clean. Super central to just about everything Newport, OR!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, easily walkable to the beach, clear instructions, as advertised"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Because I made the reservation about an hour before I arrived, my guest code was never populated. When I extended my reservation a day, the lock still expired at checkout time. In both cases, the host picked up on the first call and immediately resolved the issue. My only “complaint” is the inflexible and early checkout (10am), but I can’t even complain as she was very clear about it in the listing. Town was charming and the house was perfect for a quick stopover. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our 3rd stay at the cottages and we have been thrilled with the stay each time! Super clean and comfortable, great location for walking to town or to the beach, and great grassy space for the pups to go potty! Cottages are usually full, but it still is quiet and peaceful. Very pleased with the cleanliness. The cleaner does a fantastic job!!! Looking forward to the next stay there!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cottage walking distance to the ocean. Beautiful views. Will definitely try and book again when back in this area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you need a little extra space and privacy, don’t look any further! We loved the full size kitchen, private sleeping space and the overall cleanliness of our space. What a great place to get out and walk, just know there is some inclines if you are going to the riverfront area. This place is situated in a great area to get out your car and go explore!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage by the beach provides a clean, comfortable stay in the NYE neighborhood of Newport Oregon. A short walk to the beachfront made morning and evening strolls a delight. We highly recommend this very accommodating cottage."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the place. Perfect for my husband, myself and our 4 legged son, Buck. Your kitchen is nicer than the one in the condo we rent! Thoughtful leaving the snack basket and waters. We went to Georgie's for my husbands 50 birthday dinner. We now have a new favorite restaurant! Thank you so much for sharing your place with us. -Samantha, Scott and Buck."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little spot near the beach. Would definitely recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying in Newport with our dog and opted for a house rather than a hotel this time. Was not disappointed. Neighborhood is as quiet as described. Perfect for our dog who can be easily disturbed. Walk to the beach and store and restaurants. Exactly what was needed. Slept pretty great too!!!Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little place, walking distance to everything. Well stocked kitchen was a huge plus!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a wonderful stay, the cottage had everything we needed and then some. They keep some bowls and treats for the dogs if you end up needing them which is great. Easy to walk down to the beach from the cottage!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i will come back next year if available for sure!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful beach apartment
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place well stocked, comfy bed, convenient location."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here before. Convenient location near the beach and restaurants. Everything is nice, nothing missing. And the only requirement at checkout is to wash the dishes. Would stay here again when in Newport."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this place for a weekend getaway with our dogs and it was fine. The location is great and it was easy to find, walkable to the beach, restaurants, etc. it was pretty clean, though I did find a can of chew on the floor. The communication is a little inhospitable, we were told not to even ask for an early check in or late checkout, and warned to keep our dogs on leashes at all times AND that there was a camera, ostensibly to see if we weren’t. Of course we are more than happy to abide by the rules, keep our dogs leashed, etc. but feeling like we are under surveillance isn’t a great welcome. I guess they must have had problems in the past.
It is affordable, quiet, and has everything you need for a short stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,So close to the beach!! Very perfect for a two person get away.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little stop for a night ☺️

Would stay again."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend, two dogs and I really enjoyed this place. It was so nice to be able to walk to the ocean from here and have a place that was dog friendly. There is a full kitchen which made it nice to save money on going out. The bedroom is pretty small and there is no carpet. I should’ve thought ahead and brought a dog bed. The bed was very comfortable. I hope to stay here again it was pretty much perfect for us."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great affordable place, perfect for our needs, would happily stay there again"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a cute and private little home to stay in. Extremely pet friendly with food bowls, treats and even a dog towel for those sandy paws 😊 very comfortable little place perfect for two and their furry friend.
It was very clean and home-y. I would definitely stay again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little apartment
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It's great to find pet-friendly places on the coast and their space didn't disappoint. The location is set back from the street and quiet. It's ideal if you're looking for a nice home base to park the car and explore on foot or by bike. For two people and a dog, this was more than enough room. We're really glad we found it and even more glad they didn't have a multi-night stay minimum -- which made it perfect for a quick weekend getaway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Leslie and Anthony have a great airbnb. The home was very clean and exactly as described. I would gladly rent it from them again.

loved the easy check in & privacy of the unit, like a small one bed apartment really. Would definitely stay again."

2022-11-01,3,Stayed with a pet,-
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leslie and Anthony's place was beautiful! The parking spot was well-communicated and directly next to the home (good during rain!). The place was clean and well-decorated, with lots of room. Though we only had two people, there would be more than enough room to fit a whole family comfortably. It was a short walk to the beach and many other businesses and restaurants, accessible to a variety! We enjoyed our stay in Newport!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay on our road trip around Oregon! I can’t imagine a better place to stay for an air bnb, it was amazing well stocked for our every need, more than I’ve ever seen in an air bnb! I was more comfortable and felt more accommodated than I’ve ever been! If I ever find myself coming through again I’m going to try and stay here again, amazing! Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Newport. I appreciated the privacy, quietness, and the amenities."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great unit in a good location, walkable to the beach and commercial amenities. Highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was perfect for the two of us (plus our pup) for a few nights away. Great location within close proximity to most everything (and the beach especially) while feeling very safe and secure. I agree with the others who said the listing was better in person. Very cozy with thoughtful touches like dog treats, snacks, waters, plenty of towels and blankets, etc. assigned parking, and designated dog relief areas right outside. We experienced both an unusually hot day and cooler rainy days and everything was well insulated. We would not hesitate to book this or another unit for a future stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! They did so many things to make it comfortable and cozy: quick check in, dog treats and stuff, complimentary snacks and puzzles!

The cottage is well appointed with just about anything you’d need for the kitchen and bath…even a kit for the dog with bowls, towel, treats, a frisbee, and waste clean-up baggies 🫢.) Also easy access to the Coastal Highway for exploring more of the coast.
So glad we found this group of cottages. They will be our new go-to destination for our Oregon Coast adventures!"
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Overall decent space, bed and shower a little too small. Was concerned over a large cut in the screen of bedroom window, looks like someone tried to break in before our stay"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location and perfect sized for 1 person or a couple to stay.
Very easy to find, parking spot is right in front of cottage door making unloading car convenient. Would choose again!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,an awesome hideout in Newport oregon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay!!! (:It is like 2-3 blocks to walk to the beach to see the ocean or eat. We walked all over town. Liked that the parking space was right outside the door too. Leslie is very responsive! The bed creaked a little bit but if you don’t have a baby you are trying to be super quiet for it’s probably no issue. The bathroom was pretty big for the size of the apartment too. Lots to choose from on the TV streaming too. Would absolutely stay there again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simple clean cottage, 2 blocks from the beach. A comfortable respite from a long day of travel. Good kitchen too."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this Airbnb!! We will definitely be staying again next time we go to Oregon! We got to walk to the beach in 5 minutes every single night. It looked even better than the pictures! It was clean, it was comfortable, and the perfect size for the two of us. The door was easy, parking was easy, and finding it was easy. Thank you for making our stay so amazing! We had the best trip!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful little cottage with easy walking to restaurants and the beach. we will definitely be staying again
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our one week stay. It was cute and comfy. Very clean and all the amenities you need. This property is located two blocks from the ocean, local gift shops , and performing arts center. The neighborhood is very quiet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this cottage. It was obvious that the furnishings and remodeling was done very thoughtfully and tastefully. It’s the perfect amount of space for a couple. We don’t own a dog, but we saw no trace of past dogs staying here. The kitchen was well-stocked. The beach and shopping were so close, too - we’d definitely come back if we stay in Newport again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean cottage with everything you need. Ideal location to beach, restaurants and shops. Highly recommended!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our 1-night stay at the Nye Beach Cottage B. This is a super cute property well located to Nye Beach and the small restaurant and shopping strip. The property even has a full kitchen a brand new, huge oven and full size fridge so gourmets can cook up a storm here. Location is quiet too. Would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ideal location, cozy spot with great amenities. Super easy check in and out process and just overall the perfect relaxation after a long day of travel! Would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, cute cottage and super clean and neat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The apartment was perfect for our needs and the needs of our dog. It was especially nice that the apartment was setup with dogs in mind which allowed us to relax without worrying that the dog was getting on the furniture. The little welcome kit for our dog was a nice touch too and she enjoyed the treats.
The apartment is close to plenty of dog friendly restaurants. The beaches are wonderful and not crowded at all."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place in a convenient location. We have stayed at Leslie & Anthony’s properties before and are never disappointed. Always little extra touches to make you feel welcome. We will be back for sure!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really Great place! Location was convenient, quiet even on the 4th of July weekend. Very well stocked kitchen. Would definitely go back and recommend this place to my friends."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"pros: comfortable bed, close to beautiful beach and downtown Nye, all surfaces were clean, plenty of space for 2 people & dog, newer appliances in kitchen.
cons: This unit is less of a ""cabin"" and more of an ""efficiency"". There was a musty smell (mold?) unless we kept windows open (which was not a good option since they open to the parking lot). TBH, the smell bothered me more than my husband, who does not have allergies. This is 1 of 7 units in an area that feels like it should be 1 lot. There is nowhere to sit outside. People parked & walked right in front of the window at all times of day & night. The space does not feel homey/ cozy; it feels like it's run by a company. For a quick visit, I would stay here again if it weren't for the musty smell."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved that the kitchen is stocked with appliances (tea kettle, blender, etc.)
Just a few minute walk to Nye beach and tide-pools.
And the bed has a memory foam topper…. Just saying."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and professionally run place. A bit expensive for the quality, but I’m guessing that is normal for the location. The hosts were very good communicators - professional and responsive - and the unit was exceptionally clean. The parking was convenient and felt secure."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best value, great location, nice and clean, etc. Perfect for our family."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The place is great, except that its been lived in by a smoker and smells strongly of cigarettes. Its a deal breaker for me."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and incredibly convenient! The place was clean, quiet, easy to get to, and very comfortable. I have stayed here before and will definitely book again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a great stay here at Leslie and Anthony's place. We actually stayed in two different cabins during our stay and both were immaculately clean and perfect for our needs. Short walk down to the ocean and walkable to many restaurants. Our original stay was cabin G, but we wanted to extend our stay one extra day so we booked B for the third night. The hosts and cleaning crew were super helpful and accommodating in moving our things from cabin to cabin and even offered to help us move our stuff. Couldn't be happier, definitely will be back!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay in Nye Beach area. We had stayed on this property before and really enjoyed it. This time we stayed in another cottage and it was just as awesome. The cottage is perfect for our getaways - just a few blocks from the beach and the shops. As always, the cottage was very clean and tidy with everything we needed to cook a great breakfast and mainly just relax in-between our outings. We really appreciated the doggy items! This time we arrived later than expected and appreciated the people snacks and bottled water left to welcome us until we were able to get dinner. We can't wait to come back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leslie and Anthony’s place is lovely and in a great location for exploring Nye Beach and all it has to offer! Check in is smooth and easy. I have stayed with them several times. The only thing to note if you have stayed here before is that the fold out style couch in the living room has been replaced with a regular couch and no longer doubles as a bed, which I overlooked in the description as it is no longer listed in the sleeping arrangements. Would definitely stay again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this place! It’s perfect for two people and It’s very clean and cozy!

2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy space and good location. Nearby several delicious restaurants, grocery stores, and beach locations. We thought we had booked it for 2 nights but it was only for 1 night. At night there was no hot water but there was some in the morning. Pet friendly and snacks on arrival. They have everything you might need in the kitchen. Overall, a positive stay."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely a great place to stay during your visit! My husband and I stayed here in Newport with our pup and we enjoyed every bit of it. I was very impressed by the fully stocked kitchen from utensils, plates, cups, even ziplock bags. Pots and pans, oils and seasonings. It was awesome. There’s a heater that warms up the area well. The tv in the living room has Netflix. The designated parking spot was right next to the cottage. It had just enough room to fit our SUV so if you have a small car then you’ll be even better. I would definitely come back again. The best part was that they allowed dogs."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location!
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cute little cottage, close to beach access. The parking area is small and not the easiest to navigate, but it was nice to have a designated spot.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay."

2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage, walking distance to the beach & shops of Nye Beach. It was a great getaway for my husband & I for the weekend.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We first stayed in Cottage B in March 2021 and loved it so much we returned for Christmas! We have three dogs and appreciated the ability to travel with the whole family. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our simple holiday meal and the space was just enough for us two humans and our pups. It is so close to the Nye Beach shopping area and beach access that the location really can't be beat! Leslie and Anthony are super responsive and have a great little spot.

There was an additional fan and space heater for the varying spring temperatures, which was helpful. There was great water pressure and responsive hot water in the shower and the sinks. We had everything we needed to support cooking meals in the kitchenette & Gina even leaves out a snack basket and coffee for guests to have. She was extremely responsive and helpful to a few questions I had. The location is awesome- walkable to parks, the beach, shops and restaurants. Plus the constant sound of the ocean waves and cool breeze coming off the water just added to the peaceful, beachy vibes. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so cute. The neighborhood has so many fun walkable shops/restaurants and the beach is just a short 5 minute walk away. Gina clearly put thought into the space and it was more than expected. The only complaint would be that the pull out couch bed was very uncomfortable but this is true of any pull out couch bed.

Gina shows an great sense of humor, thoughtfulness to travelers' needs, and style matching the location. We truly loved being here, but wished we had booked more than one night. The neighborhood of Nye Beach is something special - friendly, welcoming, and inclusive. I can't share enough positive comments about this host and her airbnb!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay here! The cabin was super clean and very comfy. The location was also amazing — I really enjoyed seeing the beach through the window and hearing the waves. It’s clear that Gina and her husband care a lot about their guests. I hope to come back!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s charming place was cozy and welcoming. I was pleased with the amenities such as a well stocked kitchen with great condition pots and pans, lovely mugs, shampoos and soaps, phone charger etc. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets and towels soft and wonderful.
I didn’t know about the two units in front with ocean views, otherwise I would have booked one of those, but it’s just a stones throw walk down a funky “beachy” path to the cliff that overlooks the ocean. The carpet in the living room has some really large stains and there is a strong deodorizer smell that was bothersome, otherwise I’d have given it 5 stars.
I used to live in Newport so Nye Beach is close to everything I came to see including great friends. The weather was as always a little of everything and gorgeous. Plenty of hiking, eating and shopping for a great few days away from the office.
If you’re looking for a place to stay that’s more fun than a plain wrap hotel or motel, this is a great place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a authentic looking pacific coastal timepiece of a cottage.

Plus, the decor and everything in the bungalow transported us to a magical fisherman’s life."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great location with Nye Beach right there. We literally walked right down the street and around the corner to eat.
Very clean and everything we needed and more.
The sunset was absolutely beautiful, and you could go outside and see it or watch from the kitchen window. It was one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. Great seaside atmosphere."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage was very quaint and comfortable. It had everything we needed. Beach access was super easy and the view from the bluff was fabulous. This was my first time to this section of the Oregon Coast, and the small community right on the beach was very friendly. It was a short stay for us, but perfect!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s bungalow was clean, quiet and close to the ocean and neighborhood shops. She had lots of amenities-beach towels, first aid kit, games, dishes. We also enjoyed the fun ocean decor in our cottage!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very enjoyable, only next time I would book #7 or #8 just for the overall view but still loved #6 very comfy and cozy!!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a really cute, cozy place right near the ocean. We loved the way it was decorated with a nautical theme.

The cottage was adorable and perfect for relaxing and enjoying a day walking anywhere we needed to go! The kitchenette was filled with just about anything we may have forgotten; so convenient! We will
definitely book with Gina when we’re in the area again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my time in Mermaid Manor! Cozy and had everything I needed for a wonderful retreat. Beach walks daily, easy stroll to restaurants, and inside had everything I needed! Would love to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This quaint little bungalow is a hidden gem. Yet among additional bungalows within the same property, it’s quiet, private, and peaceful. It’s location is perfect walking distance to shops, restaurants and the beach. Would highly recommend this place for your stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place close to the ocean. Not very fancy but comfortable and great for couples. Close to the shops and restaurants of Nye Beach.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"There is a lot to recommend this sweet little bungalow. It's clean, well stocked & Gina was very responsive. The location is great, easy walking distance to the beach & half a dozen excellent restaurants, bakeries, coffee cafes. Plus, quick vehicle access to the Bay Front, Coast Hi. & everything the coast has to offer.
Two things made our stay less than five stars:
The metal frame of the pullout couch is quite prominent through the thin mattress. It protrudes uncomfortably against backbone and ribs.
The bungalow has a gas fireplace. We didn't need it in summer, but it's probably wonderful in the winter. The prob is, even in the off position it emits heat; the thermostat was set at 55, but registered 75 as the day went on. When we were present in the afternoon/evening we found ourselves leaving the exterior door open to cool the room down.
The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable; great mattress, quality linens, & a bedroom window that opens to the sounds of the waves."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!! So close to everything we wanted! Lots of personal touches to make the stay memorable
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I spend a weekend at Gina's place after his college orientation. Gina's place worked out perfectly for the two of us: I had the master bed, and he had the pull-out couch, which was very comfortable. Gina's cabin had everything necessary for a comfortable stay, and more. We enjoyed the books about the area, the recommendations in the binder, the coffee available in the kitchen and nice soap/shampoo in the bathroom. It was lovely to walk a few block to go pick up breakfast while my son lounged in bed, and to walk to the beach in 3 min. It was fun to see, perched on the bluff, the fires lit up on the beach when dusk fell. We had a great stay and would stay at Gina's cabin again. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Mermaid Manor was an absolute delight to stay at, with plenty of amenities, clean furnishings, and in a great location near plenty of restaurants and shopping (not to mention being a stones throw from the beach!). Would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation near the beach in beautiful Newport!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved the beach vibe of the property and the beach theme of the bungalow, which was very clean, well decorated, cozy and charming. The extremely comfortable bed along with the sound of the ocean waves provided a great nights sleep.
It's the perfect setting and location as it is a very short walk to the beach, restaurants, shops and activities.
We loved every minute of our stay at Beach Bum Bungalows and we will definitely return.
Thank you Gina and Alan for being great hosts!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"100 year old sea shanty with decor to match. Very kitschy with sea shanty decor to match. If that is not ur thing, you may want another choice. Price was appropriate for summer. Units 7 and 8 have the view of the sea. Number 6 does not have a view but u could hear the sea with windows open. Excellent neighborhood for exploring old town of Newport. Host is very responsive."

The bungalow was clean, quiet and serene. Gina had all the necessities covered from shampoo and conditioner to microwave popcorn and bottled water.

It’s a perfect space for someone who wants a simple and beautiful experience during their beach vacation. There are paths right to the beach all around, and the neighbors in the other bungalows were super nice and respectful. I would definitely come back here again- we (my boyfriend and I) adored it here! Thank you, Gina, for all of your hard work and efforts on running and up-keeping this wonderful space."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay! Thank you
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cool place! So close to the middle of Nye Beach, but still so quiet because it was off the main road, had an easy walk to the Vietnam Memorial walkway down to the beach, and a view of the beach from the kitchen. Gina has to be a thoughtful and organized person to have everything so homey, and my husband and I really enjoyed our stay- comfortable bed and sheets, cute gas stove, nice art touches, little extras. We ended up going out to eat, but really there were all the pots/pans that we would have needed to cook for ourselves. Thank you Gina! Hope we can come back sometime."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gina’s place was the perfect stay for our Newport visit. We were road-tripping up the coast and wanted the Oregon beach experience. Great views, super comfy home, and made us feel more than welcome. Would def recommend."

Beach access is only a 5 minute walk and there are many shops and restaurants in easy walking distance as well. Anything you could possibly need is already stocked in the cottage- cooking utensils, pots and pans, coffee filters, shampoo and conditioner, and more! We were especially impressed by the comfiness of the bed... it was very soft and we slept like the dead! This is a great little spot to stay if you want a lot of beach charm. If we ever make our way back to Newport, we will be staying here again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pure fun from start to finish. This little complex of vintage bungalows was nestled inside a privacy gate that did its job while still appearing friendly to the world. Most charming facade! Location, on the ocean, is in an established and well taken care of neighborhood. We walked to the great restaurant on the corner on our first night. Delicious and even elegant.
Inside our bungalow was everything one can hope for. Windows are all new, tight, easy to open, and spotless. One could not have the blues with the cheerful seaside decor throughout. Gina has gathered darling accessories over the years. We felt so welcomed. And the best part: a truly comfortable bed. Another bonus: our car was safe and just a few steps away! Thank you, Gina and Allen!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, amazing place and we felt like locals during the stay! No other place like it. Book it while you can!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in “Mermaid Manor” was one of my most favorite Airbnb experiences! This little gem of a beach bungalow exceeded my expectations. The comfy bed, well-supplied kitchen, thoughtful amenities, and fantastic entryway, made my coastal exploration even better than I hoped. I loved being able to sit by the fire and watch the sunset from the living room. It’s quiet, yet near everything in Nye Beach. I look forward to getting back to the Beach Bum Bungalows again one day. Thanks Gina!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The bungalow is adorable — both in aesthetic and in size. It’s great for a couple or a family of 3, and good for an overnight. The wood stove easily warmed us up thanks to its compact capacity, and the decor matching the building’s theme made it fun. The couch was actually quite comfortable without being pulled out into a bed. The whole unit was clean and tidy upon arrival. Nye Beach and its several local shops are less than 5 minutes of walking distance (vegan and gluten-free folks will have accessible breakfast & beverages at a nearby cafe!) and beach access was perfect."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay! Thank you Gina
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying in Gina’s place during spring break.

Thank you for sharing your place with us!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gina's home was in a wonderful place in town with immediate beach access! There was a concern with ants, which Gina responded to right away. It would have been ideal to have traps and other supplies on hand to help remedy the issue as the ants covered food left on the counter and on the walls, windows, etc. but they brought supplies over the next morning which was much appreciated!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was fabulous, walking distance to beach and and little shops and restaurants. We had lots of rain but the bungalow was cozy with a warm heater and fun snacks. We enjoyed playing scrabble!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love these bungalows. We'll be back.
Nye Beach is one of the best places on the coast. House is very clean and homey. Had everything we wanted and more.
Thoughtful and appealing decor too.
Quiet and private. Good rate for off-season booking. Can't ask for more.
(watch your head if you are more than 6 feet tall.) We did not mind the 1910
low ceilings, but taller folks might."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"super close to beach, adorable bungalo!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space was so fun! Very pirate sheik! Check in was easy. The bungalow was well appointed and comfortable. The kitchen had the essentials for cooking and a few servings of coffee. The bathroom had really lovely linens and some beach towels, which I've found to be a luxury in most air bnbs. Shower water pressure and warmth was we're both great. The bed has a nice pillow topper which makes it a medium firmness.
All of this is enough to get a great review but the location is WONDERFUL! Overlooking the beach.....like you walk out of your door and see/hear the ocean. A path down to the beach is about 5 minutes walk away. Just wonderful.
I can't wait to rent out the whole compound for a family get away!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We made the reservations at the last minute after some plans changed and were so grateful to find this sweet cottage to stay in. The host was very responsive and helpful with local recommendations. Loved our stay. We felt at home instantly.

The bungalow itself was quite cozy, and we enjoyed hanging out there when it was stormy outside. Gina was a great communicator."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We chased the sunset light for miles before darkness overtook us. We shared a five course meal after following the smell to Pacific Kitchen and giggled at the corner table until people started to stare… delicious even if we did miss the ribeye. We gazed and talked and connected and breathed life into weary bodies. We ‘met’ Gina and learned of her family’s history. We listened to the waves. We listened to each other. We rolled dice and rolled our eyes and rolled on the floor like best friends wrestling on the ground. We spoke of the future and of the past as though the two were connected by us… We chose love. We chose sleep and laughter and longing. We chose fun and familiarity. And now we choose to do it thousands more times. If you can swing it, stay here with someone you adore. You won’t regret it."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An inviting cottage with a short early morning walk to the best view of the ocean. The cottage is cozy, beautifully decorated and has absolutely anything a guest could want or need to make their stay absolutely perfect. We will recommend this host and the cottage to others, too. So convenient to visit the entire Nye Beach area with its quaint shops and delicious foods.
A real delight!"

The house itself was sweet and homey— very clean and a perfect fit for me and my friends. The two bathrooms are also great!
We loved the back porch and the super comfy couch.
I was traveling for work while I stayed there and it felt like I was right at home.
Also, a HUGE plus is that the kitchen is actually stocked with all the basics, so you don’t have to buy every little thing just to stay somewhere for the weekend.
Loved loved loved!

I am glad I did, as she was delightful....and I found out she specializes in deep-tissue massages. I will be making an appointment the next time I am in town! The place is great! A short walk to the beach and downtown. Lots to do. Everything was immaculate and exactly as shown. Communication was fantastic. Well stocked kitchen. I didn't need anything else. I am bummed I didn't get to see her kitty, but I will be back if it is available."

The kitchen area is small in space but has an extensive amount of useful kitchen tools (like spatulas and a hand can opener, etc.) as well as many items directly food related (salt and pepper, organic cooking oil, tea bags, coffee, etc.)
The bed is very comfortable. The windows downstairs and upstairs open to allow the evening light breezes and seaside air inside to refresh and embellish the living spaces.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and looking for a cheaper alternative than the $300 a night hotel that was setup by the bride and groom. I found Dana's place about 8 months in advance and she was really responsive to my brief questions. She also sent directions to the space several months in advance. Once we were in the space, she responded to communication within minutes of a message.
The space itself is great with all the amenities promised and more. It was the perfect accommodation for our brief stay. It is only a few blocks from the beach and a downtown area. We spent every morning walking on the beach before the wedding festivities.
Overall, this was a 5 star space that had a great location, price, and amenities included. It was the perfect spot for our brief trip to the Oregon Coast!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Either forgot since booking or just didn’t realize that the space was a sort of vertical loft, but nonetheless found the space utterly charming. Kind felt like being in a cozy little lighthouse, with windows on all sides of the top floor. Dana was immediately responsive to any questions and also completely respected our privacy during our stay. Would definitely recommend and even stay again if we made our way back to Newport. PS, the tea selection on hand was super clutch!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dana’s place was immaculate, and decorated beautifully. All the appliances and fixtures were top notch. Lots of options for morning tea and coffee (although no cream for coffee). View of ocean, lovely neighborhood and excellent communication.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Dana’s sweet place, just as nice as the first! We lucked out on the weather which made the short walk to Nye Beach (and all it offers) a pleasure each time during our 4 night stay. Being in a quiet area away from the busier beachfront was perfect, and being able to see the ocean from the upstairs space was a bonus. Lots of light, very comfortable, very responsive and warm communication from Dana—wonderful spirit of hospitality—highly recommended!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, convenient place to stay!"

Nye beach shops.and cafes are close also. I found Cypress Cottage to be the perfect place to unwwind and regroup. The kitchen is well equipped and the place spotless.

We booked it because the photos looked like a little treehouse in the sky with lots of windows and it seemed aesthetically pleasing - and it was all of those things! This was a very last minute booking as we decided to try to outrun bad weather a day prior to the start of our holiday weekend, and it worked out perfectly. The location was great, easy to get to and very walkable to the ocean, shops and cafes. We weren't there long enough to use many of the amenities, but everything was exactly as pictured."

Since I was there on one of the warmest days of the season, I was happy to find the fan in the closet to help cool the upstairs. Also, the full length mirror in the closet was helpful. Being a coffee fanatic,I was very pleased to find multiple different coffee makers as well as both ground and whole bean coffee. I also appreciated the little notes throughout the house.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Compact but delightful place. Absolutely LOVED the 360 window lights and elevation in the up-the-stairs bedroom/sitting area. The kitchen below is well appointed, though short on counter space. If you're planning to do massive meal preparations, you may find it a bit too tight, but for most folk it'll do just fine. Overall, for those traveling light, this two-level space is a quiet, peaceful retreat worth the stop."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dana's place was in an amazing location close to the Nye Beach area which I loved. Very comfortable space and loved seeing the ocean/sunset from the bedroom upon arrival. You can tell Dana cares about her guests and their stay and responded promptly and graciously when communicating. 10/10 Would stay with Dana, ANYTIME."

I highly recommend dinner at Local Ocean as the food is delicious and the wait staff are very friendly."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing clean and beautiful little place. Extremely well stocked and prepared for anything anyone may need. Great for short and long trips alike.
Dana had non-slip stickers on the stairs that led up to the bedroom, which was a thoughtful touch to the whole place. She has cute signs to show where to park, where to find the closest beach, and what the wifi password was.
It's a sweet little space, but extremely clean, open, and has a lot of windows that bring in beautiful ocean air. I enjoyed staying at Dana's a lot and she was so kind when I accidentally left my water bottle and helped find a way to return it to me after check out ✨️"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dana’s space was exactly what I was looking for! It was clean, the bed and sheets were extremely comfortable, and I loved waking up to the sound of seagulls.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Dana's place is quiet and in a nice location within easy walking distance to Nye Beach's restaurants and oceanfront. It's pretty small and wouldn't recommend more than two adults staying in the space. In addition, the kitchenette and bathroom area are on a separate floor from the sleeping quarters, which isn't ideal for folks who get up in the middle of the night."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an awesome space to hang out! Dana is a great host, quick to respond and big bonus - Kona the Newfoundland will be your new best friend! I had everything I needed for a quick stay, and I walked to Nye Beach and to the historic bayfront from here.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay while on the coast."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Location is in great walkable proximity to the beach and restaurants.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice view of the ocean, not right on the beach but a short walk to great local restaurants, shops, and beach access. Very comfortable bed. Large windows in the upstairs bedroom to let the ocean breeze flow through. be aware the bedroom access requires navigating stairs. This was an absolutely wonderful place to relax and unwind."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Love this spot for a perfect weekend getaway. Walking distance to the beach and eateries. All supplies necessary if you want to eat in. Bed is super comfy... I slept well! Check in and communication were great. I'll definitely be back.

We loved hearing the ocean as we slept and waking up to it in the morning. Dana is a great host and we were in such good care even when our own trip hit a small snag! We could not have been in better hands and found a better place or host! We hope to come back and visit again! :)
Thanks again!
Emma & Davis"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do it justice. There is a lot of light in the loft & it was a comfortable place to work remotely from.

We walked to the beach and cafes
Like staying in a tree house
Filtered view of the ocean from one of the upstairs windows"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was soooo lovely. I felt immediately at ease, calm, and at home. The windows and artful arrangement upstairs were peaceful and soothing, and the bed was amazingly comfortable— firm overall yet with enough softness to melt into.
I was especially delighted by the use of doterra soaps and oils— they smell so good and feel good to be around. (I frequently struggle with the conventional scents and toxic fragrances that many hotels and Airbnb’s have, so in contrast, this placewas such a relief and joy to enter into!)
Also, Dana was responsive and helpful with all of my questions and requests— a great host!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful! Outstanding! Peaceful! We can’t say enough about Dana’s coastal retreat. The bed was so cozy! The upstairs bedroom was like a place of solitude! Her bed and bath product samples were the icing on the cake! You will LOVE the peace and quiet and location! We fell in love with Newport! You will too!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"When coming to Newport, do stay at Dana’s treetop level retreat! You will be comfortable in immaculate surroundings with many comforts of home to keep you cozy. The view of the Pacific from upstairs is exquisite and proximity to historic Nye Beach perfect! Loved our stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place reminds us again why we book with Airbnb instead of hotels and motels for our travel.
Well thought-out Kitchen, well stocked bathroom, super fast internet, beach closeness. With Immaculately cleanliness.
Highly recommended."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dana’s space was fantastic! It’s cute and convenient in location from the beach and 101. My wife and I had a great time, the space was clean, and Dana was quick to respond to us!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I were in town for the weekend and found Cypress Cottage to be perfect for us. We didn’t need much and the simplicity of our stay was great.

Would definitely stay at Dana’s place again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the cottage. Easy to get in and quiet. Comfortable bedding and quite a few supplies in the kitchen. My wife and I also really appreciated the upgraded shampoo/conditioner, etc. Would book again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely stay at a perfect perch next to the ocean.

Our host, Dana, was communicative, welcoming and lovely from beginning to end. We loved our stay!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Had a peaceful and comfortable overnight stay in this private 2-story unit. Dana is very helpful and responsive, and provided many thoughtful touches. We found the bed very comfortable, and appreciated all the natural light (blackout curtains provided). Other pluses: USB charging ports on each nightstand; selection of teas/coffees, coffeemaker & french press; asstd. small appliances in mini-kitchen; close to beach.
FYIs: no microwave; no dining area (you’ll need to take your beverage/meals up steep stairs to sleeping/sitting area); one needs to navigate same stairs between bathroom and bedroom; heads-up to those with scent-sensitivities."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a sweet home away from home! Dana thought of so many small comforts and the type of items travelers often forget to pack. It was more like staying in a very thoughtful friend's guesthouse than a typical lodging experience. I especially enjoyed the abundance of blankets, pillows, and towels...all soft, thick, and comfortable. No artificial fragrances or or stuffy air here! Filled with natural light, a glimpse of the ocean, and an absolutely magical stroll through a lush path to the beach. Quiet and relaxed location, yet close to downtown. I can hardly wait to return!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot, great location! Dana was a wonderful host, super helpful, friendly, and communication was quick and helpful!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little spot! Super comfy bed.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cool spot with everything you need. It's clean, comfortable, private, lots of natural light, perfect location for exploring Newport."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything promised! It's directly on Nye beach and within easy walk of literally everything that matters. This is a fantastic getaway and I'm very happy to have found it.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful cozy getaway with lots of natural light.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Dana has a spectacular little place. We truly enjoyed it.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, light-filled, peaceful, quiet place within comfortable walking distance to the center of Nye Beach— lovely attention to detail; thoughtful, soothing decor; comfortable furniture; kitchenette set-up just right (we missed having a microwave for a late night popcorn craving, but otherwise we had everything we needed); very responsive communication from Dana. The view over rooftops to the ocean was a nice bonus. Only frustration was being outsmarted by the smart tv (Dana did her gracious best to try to help us find a solution. It’s likely the issue was our unfamiliarity with the system).
We had a couple tasty meals in Nye Beach (Cafe Stephanie and Nye Beach Cafe); our very favorite Newport eatery is Local Ocean—amazing food and beautiful view of the bay from the upstairs seating.
Dana has created a really wonderful place for relaxing and enjoying all that Newport has to offer!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute little spot with lots of windows and an ocean view. We'd definitely love to come back again next time.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Nice and quiet. Easy access to the beach and shopping/restaurants.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as described. Cosy, but very functional. Bed was very comfortable after a long day of driving."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely time staying here - the cottage is clean, perfectly sized for a couple, quiet, and in a great location (can’t beat a 5 minute walk to the beach and several restaurants, taprooms, and cafes). I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay! We were here for two nights at the tail end of spring break, and it was very peaceful and quiet on this forested street. It was the best of both worlds: we were within walking distance of shops and restaurants as well! Dana also offered great tips for restaurants and was super friendly and communicative.
The place itself was very comfortable and just as described/pictured in the listing. Super cozy and felt like a treehouse in the upstairs bedroom! Lots of thoughtful touches throughout, a nice blue/teal color scheme, and a comfortable bed.
The only thing that might be a dealbreaker for some people is the steepness of the stairs in the unit. That may pose an issue for folks with mobility issues. On the plus side, the stairs had good traction!
We’d be glad to visit again and highly recommend this cozy AirBnB!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little get away! Seriously way better than what is expected with the photos. Wonderful communication also. Hope to stay here again! <3

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place rules. It has a really great bell tower feel, with the bedroom on the second floor surrounded by windows. It was also extremely quiet and clean, and had a dozen or so nice little touches (the boutique soaps, the local coffee and French press ready to go, the dishes, the toothpaste, the painless entry and signage).
Definitely coming back.
Thanks again Dana 😊"

2024-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"This place is nice enough and in a beautiful location. It's literally just a single room, plus a bathroom. The floors and lots of surfaces are pretty dirty, having a beach front property requires aggressive cleaning of surfaces. Also be prepared to wash almost anything you want to use in the kitchen, as most stuff appears to be put away dirty."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a really pretty location. Short drives to some great spots in town and a walk to some good restaurants and bars. We also watched the sunset from the porch.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space itself was warm and inviting, with lots of windows looking out toward the ocean. A walkway down the beach is steps outside the back door. From the front door we walked just a block to some great Italian food, but there were at least a half dozen other options that also looked quite good. Richard was kind and communicative and seemed very open to feedback on how to improve the experience further."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at Richards place. It was just the break we needed from the hustle and bustle of the big city.

Everything we wanted to do was in easy walking distance, including the fabulous Newport Beach. Great food options all around us--which we took full advantage of. The space is as described. Nothing fancy, but comfortable, neat, clean, and carefully furnished. As advertised its a smallish studio but it was perfect for our needs (a couple) and met all our expectations. Well done!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We were traveling for Thanksgiving to see my boyfriend’s family in northern Oregon. We decided to find a romantic place near the beach for one night.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was a perfect retreat for 2. The views were breathtaking and every one of the 3 restaurants recommended by our co host had outstanding food and service!!

Really enjoyed the option to either walk down the street to get coffee/pastries or make coffee in - always a great advantage of having a full kitchen.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,A gorgeous spot to stay! You can’t beat the location - right on the beach and a quick walk to the heart of Nye Beach with tons of shopping and eating options. For the price of the stay I did expect having an in-unit washer and dryer and was disappointed to find there was only a community one that was machine operated. Outside of that - I have no complaints and recommend this condo!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The location is definitely unbeatable - right on the beach, with a superior view. Host and property manager were super responsive and kind. Overall amazing and relaxing experience. One thing though - the place was not clean. It was dusty, dirty, hair in the sheets, dirty white towels with visible beige and pink/red marks. Windows were dirty and had no screens. No complaints towards location and the host, but I’m not sure that the cleaning crew is pulling their weight."

It was intimate and nicely laid out. The bed was SO comfy. It’s hard to wake up and get out of bed with the view of the ocean. I recommend checking out the hot tub while your there. It’s a perfect end to the day. And the E-bikes rental just down the street was an AWESOME way to see the area. Richard and Samantha were to accommodating, kind, and helpful and the amenity kit was lovely. When we return to Oregon, I would love to stay here again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked this stay for my daughter and I to spend a day in Newport and for experience of staying on the beach and Richard’s condo did not disappoint. I truly appreciated how the amenities and attention to detail made us feel like it was our home even if it was just for one night.
We were offered an early check in which was awesome! Entering the unit was easy and the first thing that caught our eyes, was the view! We quickly made our way to the beach which was easy. We also enjoyed being able to do dinner and breakfast at the condo as all of the kitchen amenities were available. We loved it so much and hope to visit again in the future."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute beautiful view! Very clean and equipped with all necessities. Very quiet. Fire place was a cozy and romantic feel. Easy written instructions. Direct private beach stair access was steep but well kept. Quiet & private beach for roaming. Bed was comfortable. No stairs to get in was nice for luggage and groceries. Easy parking. Has a pool and hot tub but we did not use. Microwave blew a breaker but we let the owner know. Would definitely stay again. Thanks for sharing your picture perfect place and you amazing hospitality.

2022-08-01,4,Stayed over a week,Superb location and view. Well stocked with almost anything you need to cook while there. Would be a five star but ceiling fan was non-functional and no a/c so room was hot with no good way to cool it. Sink in bath was slow draining.

Thoughtful touches everywhere- from binoculars right by the dining area, to extra bedding and pillows, powerful floor fan for warmer summer nights, to an amazing collection of spices that enhanced our quick dinner.. the list can go on. The bed is super comfortable and it was lovely to see the water from the bed. Great views and we loved being able to walk to the beach from the back door. We didn’t need to clarify anything- the instructions were clear. The apartment is spotless and furnished just right, no clutter anywhere and enough room for us to stay for a longer trip."

You’ll remember this stay for a long time!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect home base for my 10 day work and play adventure on the central coast.

Beyond the stunning view and direct beach access, it is in a perfect location for walking to shops, restaurants, and jumping on the highway for a half day or day trip to other locations up or down the coast.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a perfect stop for the night on way from Portland down the coast.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was amazing! We were very sad to leave because it was such a perfect location as well as clean with a beautiful view! Our stay was amazing and wish we could have stayed longer! Newport is one of our favorite places and would love to come back soon!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and location!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a lovely time in Newport and this place was FANTASTIC! We will definitely be back. It felt like a home away from home- clean, nicely decorated, thoughtful touches and of course an amazing view. All around great experience. (And loved our morning Nespresso on the balcony). Also, the pool and hot tub are small but are better than the photo. We enjoyed taking a soak and warming up after walking the beach. Great location that is super walkable to shops and restaurants. Loved it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I had lots of fun staying here! Felt very homey and had a beautiful view of the beach! And very easy access to the beach. Will be coming back soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this place for my son and his new bride as their mini honeymoon. They loved this place. They described as very clean and beautiful inside and the location was perfect. It was also very easy to communicate with them and very friendly. I would book their place one day for my own vacation. Thank you Brian and Sheryl. Inn be look forward when it’s my turn to go.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay.
The condo is perfect for a couple’s getaway.
Samantha was wonderful and accommodating.
As hosts ourselves, we took few notes to implement at our place - and we are very picky.
Much recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and really quiet!! We loved it!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay! It will be great when the condo community's stairs down to the beach are fixed to make it even easier to enjoy the ocean. Shops and dining are just down the street. Sheryl communicated clearly and it was easy to get in and out with parking and the door's lock code.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location with amazing views. The space was immaculate and had everything we needed for a few relaxing days on the coast. Thank you!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and hosts!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was in a great location less then 10 minutes from Fred Meyer, the aquarium, historic waterfront and a couple minutes walk to nye beach restaurants and cute shops. We had a concern when we got there and Samantha was very quick to respond and resolve everything. The condo was well stocked for cooking and even some fun things you wouldn’t think about like binoculars, usb chargers and other home type needs. The bed, arguably the most important part of staying away from home, was firm enough to be supportive and soft enough it didn’t cause hip and shoulder pain, perfect mid range. The view was absolutely phenomenal and falling asleep to the sound of the waves was just beyond compare. The pool and hot tub were on the smaller side but clean and fun to use. Overall, we definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brian & Sheryl have an incredible and magical space!! This was our 1st time in the Oregon Coast and we definitely plan to come back. Watched the sunset from the deck, this was stunning! We fell asleep and woke up to the constant crashing of waves, absolutely perfect! Took a walk down by the beach as soon as we woke up, can’t think of a better way to start off the AM.
Samantha was awesome and very responsive!
Just a short drive away you have Thor’s Well, Devil’s Churn, Cape Cove Beach & Yaquina Lighthouse- all amazing stops.
Thank you again for sharing Sea Grass with us, we had an unbelievable experience and we hope to come back for another visit!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place to stay for our weekend trip. I have no complaints.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic location! It was so nice to be able to sit on the porch and watch the waves. Then, a very short walk downhill to a nice bakery, coffee shop, restaurants, etc...
Samantha was super helpful and pleasant to deal with. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"The area is walkable and the unit has a great view of the beach. We did have a few issues with the cleanliness of the space. We appreciated that the co-host offered to come clean again after our arrival, but we declined due to the late hour."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay. The ocean waves right off the balcony made for a very peaceful backdrop. ☺️

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to ring in the new year! View cannot be beat. We felt so glad that we chose Brian and Sheryl's place over any hotel in the area just based on the incredible unobstructed view of Nye Beach. We will definitely stay again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful studio with an ocean view. Small pool and hot tub available. Great strong shower and fully stocked kitchen (even some basic spices!). Comfy throws for bundling up outside on the covered patio. We did not find the pillows comfortable unfortunately, but that's such a personal preference. The bed was just ok."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable with an amazing ocean view. Highly recommended!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely and amazing view of the ocean and a very well stocked kitchen to actually be able to cook in it. We found bowls, utensils and all of the extras very well thought out - enough to contribute to our family Thanksgiving by pre-cooking a couple of dishes in the unit!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great view and they have a great kitchen. There’s lots and pans and even some seasonings which makes it easy. I cook every meal with my husband and we always have fun here. I highly recommend this place!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This studio condo has it’s own vibrant soul and was perfect for my wife’s birthday weekend getaway. The location is exceptional; it’s within walking distance to a bunch of amazing shops, restaurants, and markets. The guest book has character—reading through some of the experiences others had can give people new to the area ideas. Although the host does a great job at communicating favorite places nearby in the welcome booklet inside the condo. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you’d need if you were planning on cooking during your stay. The shower was refreshing and had good water pressure, the bed was comfortable, and the view was amazing. Sleeping to the sound of the waves was darn near therapeutic. I would highly recommend this studio condo, and if it’s available next time we visit Newport, we’ll be staying here again. The hosts were great and communicated very well with nearly instant response time. If I could rate the place higher I would. We loved our stay!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to listen to and look at the ocean
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 for sure! Absolutely beautiful! The view from the balcony is awesome! We saw one whale tail as it went under and several whales spouting. The kitchen is stocked with anything you could ever need! We will definitely stay here again!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a good time at Brian and Sheryl’s, a beautiful place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Some people may think this unit is a bit on the small side, but my partner and I felt it was the perfect. Of course we both spend a lot of time in New York City in tiny accommodations, so that may expose our bias.
We loved everything about this unit - beachfront location, clean, well-appointed, super-comfy bed, easy check-in, great balcony views, fairly quiet (except for a number of dog-barking episodes in a nearby unit, which made us wonder why it didn't drive the dog's owner nuts too).
What we really appreciated most was the size and layout. Perfect for two, HUGE kitchen, but the bed is the unit's central feature, great for enjoying the ocean views/sounds and watching TV.
Would stay here again. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was great, and the hosts were flexible when I needed to reschedule the trip from March to August. Thanks!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cutest place with easy check in! Loved the view and sitting out on the deck was wonderful. Sleeping with the window open and hearing the ocean was natures sound machine. Quick response from host on slight internet issue. Well stocked kitchen and super clean!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I hit the jackpot when I walked in Sea Grass condo. The place is exactly described and nice and clean. Fantastic view of the beach. Our stay was very comfortable and the communication with the co-host was very timely and prompt. For people who are worried about beach access, you don't need to use the steep stairs, you can walk two blocks and get to the beach without any steps. Pool nor Spa was closed but we weren't interested in anyway. We'll definitely go back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just returned from 3 nights at Sea Grass Studio and it was the perfect birthday celebration getaway weekend! The location is great - within a few blocks of the cafes, restaurants, and shops in Nye Beach. The views from the condo are fantastic! We slept with the windows open and listened to the waves crashing all night - just lovely! A short walk down the stairs and you are on on the beach and can walk for miles in either direction....perfect for running too! The condo had a fully stocked kitchen with everything you need. Bathroom was nice (great shower!), king bed was comfortable, and they provided throw blankets for curling up on the balcony on cool days (it is the Oregon coast after all!), beach towels, beach chairs...everything you need! We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay during our west coast road trip. The room was comfortable, had a spacious kitchen and a great view of the beach. The location was also in easy walking distance to all the shops a restaurants! Would definitely recommend staying here"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was brief — only one night — but it was very comfortable. Nice bed and bedding, excellent lighting throughout, well stocked kitchen, and a roomy shower with great water pressure. Best of all the Wi-Fi was amazing which was such a relief after being at a resort they had awful Wi-Fi. The balcony was very nice and looks Right out to the ocean which unfortunately super foggy when we stayed. If there was any downside, I would say the pool and spa area which looked a bit sketchy and were closed. Very enjoyable stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing view, great location. The place had everything you’d need. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The ocean view from the studio and the balcony is stunning. The space is immaculate and well apportioned. I appreciated the snacks and Nespresso coffee machine. The beach access was great but this old babe had to go down 144 steps to enjoy the sunset magic.... and then walk up the steps afterward! It's never clear with some rentals if you are on the beach or above the beach. We were also walking distance to a variety of delightful restaurants. It was a very quiet, safe and tranquil stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay for the two of us. It was clean, comfortable and the perfect distance from the ocean. Lots of little shops and eating places just a walk away. Would love to go back. Highly recommend Brian and Sheryl’s place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a place!! Nye Beach is a very cute, walkable area with shops and great restaurants. The stay was so relaxing. Luxurious bed, the sound of the waves.

We were happy to see a fully stocked kitchen, complete with spices, cooking utensils, coffee stuff, cutting boards…perfect to cook and eat at home! Binoculars, games, beach chairs/towels—so many thoughtful things included. Laundry facility onsite is nice just in case. And extra clean! Great location to restaurants and cafes, and the stairs down to the beach aren’t bad if you take it slow. We will definitely stay at this gem again. Thank you!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a DREAM stay! The only thing wrong was that I did not book this place for more than one night. Location was incredible and views (with a Willamette Pinot from down the street and a morning Nespresso) were spectacular! Falling asleep to the live surf instead of my Calm App was exactly what my soul needed!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with amazing views!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I feel like a lot of Airbnbs are falling short on quality lately...but this place does NOT. Everything feels fresh and new and clean. It's a super comfortable space with an incredibly well-appointed kitchen. The shower has some of the most incredible water pressure I've experienced. Very pleased with this place.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best king bed ever. very well stocked. super cozy. so close to everything in Newport. Bayfront is less than a mile and a half walk if you are willing to walk some hills. The view cannot be beat.

You can watch the crashing waves from inside the unit (especially when cold and windy) and see Yaquina Head Lighthouse from the balcony. The unit is furnished very tastefully with high end items. Everything is thought of, to make it comfortable and convenient for the guests - including the Nespresso machine with the pods. The shower and the water pressure is wonderful:) Location-wise is only two minutes to Nye Beach cafes and restaurants and only few minutes drive to the bay front. I truly enjoyed my stay despite it was cut short by one night due to some flight disruptions. Highly recommended and you won’t get disappointed!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great place to stay on the coast! The studio was very clean and we loved how it was fully stocked (pots, pans, dishes, silverware, plenty of towels, detergent, even down to flashlights.) It seemed like they thought of every detail to make a great stay. only recommendations we have are maybe a fan available or an updated AC unit as we had issues adjusting it. it was set on 50 (lowest) but very hot like the heater was on and we couldn't figure out how to adjust it. We also couldn't sign the guest book because we didn't have any pens or pencils to write with and we couldn't find any either! so sad we missed out on that. But overall we had such a great time and I would definitely return and recommend to my friends and family!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,lovely ocean view and very comfortable bed
