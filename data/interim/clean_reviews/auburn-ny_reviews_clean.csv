From being welcomed with local wine (that we did eventually drink, thank you Paul), to the clean and cozy rooms, to quick and responsive communication throughout our stay including local recommendations, Paul is providing exactly the experience you would want from a local airbnb host. We'd definitely stay again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The barn was wonderful, so peaceful and beautiful. It is like this secret sanctuary that you walk into, with a beautiful garden, fire pit and surroundings to look out on. Our kids saw fireflies for the first time!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s barn was such a fun and unique place to stay in during our visit to FLX! Super comfortable for two couples to stay in - can cook, relax, and unwind ! Close to Skaneatles, a bit of a drive to the wineries we selected to visit but still quite convenient! Wish we could have stayed for a couple more days to enjoy the backyard, deck, and fire pit! Paul was extremely flexible with any requests and asks, which makes him a great super host! Thanks for having us!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely house outside of Auburn. Good outdoor space. Can hear a bit of road noise while outside but inside is very quiet. Definitely recommend for a nice getaway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s place was wonderful. It was in a perfect location. You are close enough to everything you would want to do but you are also far enough away for it to be private and peaceful. The place was stocked with everything you would need. Our favorite part was hanging around the pit fire every night and playing cornhole
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the converted barn. It had everything we needed and was very clean. The outdoor space was perfect. Our stay was excellent.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn was a perfect home base for our family’s trip to the Auburn area. It is very spacious and just a fun space!

Overall, we definitely recommend this airbnb and would not hesitate to stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an awesome time here as we came to the area for a family wedding. Paul had some great suggestions for us to do as a family the day after the wedding and we had a blast. My son loved staying ""in the barn"". My wife loved its rustic appearence and feel. Spacious enough for six guests, a nice property with a deck and firepit outback to enjoy your breakfast. In the country but only a 10 minute drive to get essentials and a 20 minute drive to some fun! This was our first time staying at an air bnb and it set the bar high. We look forward to a return to the barn for the next family event."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable barn. Nice landscaping. Great for two couples. Paul is a terrific host and has lots of great suggestions for things to do at his property or close by lakes and towns.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time there. Paul made sure the snow did not impede our comings and goings! He was very attentive and pleasant.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Red Barn was quite cute and cozy! My Artist friends and I were in town for Quilts=Arts=Quilts to see one of my art quilts in the exhibit. Amy & Paul made our stay quite fun with a bottle of wine and a fresh picked pumpkin. Very clean and cozy. This will be on our picks for next year! Thank you for all your hospitality! Deb Berkebile
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Red Barn is a beautiful, historical, and comfortable home. My small family including a kid and service pup, were very comfortable.
Even through a tornado warning and severe lightening storm we were dry, warm, and felt very safe. The barn is 100 years old and surrounded by gorgeous fields, a deck, and garden.
The kitchen is small but stoked with everything. We made several meals and even baked fresh bread and brownies!
The location is excellent for exploring the finger lake region. We visited waterfalls and the Cornell Botanical Gardens. We stretched out on the comfy rugs, played games at the dining room table, and watched the day come and go out the big windows looking out in all directions. Beds were very comfortable, lots of extra linens and towels available.
We felt the love of past generations as we looked through the vast library and diverse book titles. The big dictionary was very fun to flip through! It’s a real mini-library right there in the living room.
We highly recommend the Red Barn and believe it will be one of the more popular AirBnbs in the area once the word gets out.
Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is very clean it doesn’t even look like a barn, and the people are very organized and very helpful even to suggest anything in the Neigbour hood , they even have a printed out bookelet to see what you can get around you with a 10 mile radius,"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!! Absolutely THE best AirBnB we have stayed in. So cozy, inviting, good location to explore the Fingerlakes. So clean, we even used the bathtub, which we don't usually do. Kitchen was well stocked and even had Parchment paper! Paul and Amy were extremely quick, within minutes, in responding to texts and questions. We are sure Paul's parents would be proud of their home, serving travelers. Wish we would have had more time to read some of their books! Fabulous home!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Timothy’s place was fantastic! Very quiet in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful houses. He has private, shaded parking. It’s a very short walk to some great restaurants, and Timothy’s recommendations were spot on!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my favorite Airbnb rentals. A beautiful house on a beautiful street! The apartment was lovely and private. Very clean and comfortable. The spectacular and very old beech tree that you can see from all of the windows was a real treat for me. Timothy was easy to communicate with. I’ll be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim's Airbnb was exactly as pictured and perfect as our home base for the weekend. It was walking distance to restaurants in Auburn, as well as Wegmans.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Every thing was great! the only complaint that I did have was the bath towels. Only 2 very small and thin towels for a 4 night stay with 2 people.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Having stayed in this home before the transformation that Timothy made to this “apartment “ was outstanding. The bed was one of the best I have slept in. Thank you thank you. Amazing

Timothy and his family are very friendly and helpful. All in all it was an excellent stay. Thank you!"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful old house being renovated as separate apartments. Incredible tree out front and good location. My perception of the apartment was influenced by the weather when I was in Auburn. It was cold and rainy and since it was a Sunday and Monday, the few attractions in town were closed. Might be an excellent apartment to come and go from, but not great for hanging out in. Uneven heating, not super comfortable furniture made it less than ideal for our stay. But better weather might have made it perfectly pleasant."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Really nicely decorated and home like. Pleasantly surprised that it’s so walkable to the small city historic sites and a grocery store. Really nice street. Easy to communicate with host. Would stay again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bestie and I do an annual fall weekend trip, always somewhere in NY. Timothy's apartment in Auburn, located in a beautiful old Victorian home, was the perfect place to relax and unwind. We stayed in the apartment called Sintra - it has a lovely balcony to sit with your coffee in the morning when the weather is nice, tall, gorgeous windows that do open, a full bedroom with room-darkening curtains, and a pull-out couch/bed in the main living area. We pulled out the couch and made up the bed for movie nights, and then afterward, we each had a private place to sleep. This home is located in a very nice, walkable neighborhood. We walked everywhere we went while here, and visited a few parks in the area as well as a very nice restaurant roughly a 10-minute walk away. There is a Wegmans, literally a 2 minute walk away, and a small fridge for perishables in the apartment, which was plenty of space for our needs. We LOVED this space. Stay here if you can!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The air bnb was beautiful. It was in an old Victorian home, and didn’t expect much but when you went inside it was beautifully decorated. Very chic. Had all the necessities and had a sharp knife too, generally all air bnbs have dull knives.
The street is peaceful and only a 3 minute walk to the supermarket which was nice since the fridge is small and couldn’t over stock.
I would definitely come stay here again."

Will book again if I get the opportunity."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were pleasantly surprised that Tim's bnb turned out to be our favorite one yet. We explored the Finger Lakes and finished our trip in Auburn.

You are right in the downtown and parking on the street was very easy. Great coffee and bagels on the same block as well as restaurants and a large grocery store Wegman's a minute away. Also very quiet considering where it's located. Two full baths was the best and the hosts were so friendly and accommodating! We came in for a wedding at Skaneateles which was 12 min away.

We even made a whole meal and it felt like cooking at home.
We never had any issues with noise, either from the building or street. The parking was convenient. We used street parking since our need was mostly for overnight, but we would use the parking garage across the street if we needed it during times with more restrictions.
The host and staff were easy to communicate with and even sought me out to ensure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend."

We would stay here again!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the decor of this place and it's ability to sleep our entire party of 4 in separate beds (which were quite comfortable). We experienced a few maintenance issues that were shared with the owner, probably come as part of a reno in an old building, such as neither bathroom door shut tightly and the front door would get stuck on the sloping floor making it open/close quite hard. This condo is located on a busy main street so expect some street level noise but nothing too disruptive. We came for a girls spa weekend and this place was conveniently located to the lots of restaurants in both Auburn and the neighboring Skaneateles and a short drive to the amazing Spa at the Inns of Aurora (would highly recommend)."

The apartment is spacious, tastefully decorated, has great natural light, and is well stocked with everything you need essential-wise (towels, paper products, washer/dryer, etc). The location is great to explore everything the FLX has to offer and felt very safe/secure.
We only stayed 2 people for a few days, but I could easily see the loft being ideal for a group trip with family or friends for a much longer period of time. Thank you, Dawn!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you want a perfect central location in Auburn this is it! Booked for a low key bachelorette night after the day at Mirbeau Spa and was exactly what we needed after exploring Skaneateles. Dawn was very kind enough to let me get in early to be able to set up decorations before everyone arrived later. Everything you need in walking distance and plenty of late night options (definitely check out Swaby’s for a hole in the wall bar with lots of cool prison paraphernalia!)
Also, possibly the best shower experience ever! The fan has a speaker that you can connect to Bluetooth and play music while you are getting ready! Will definitely keep in mind for the next get together!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family recently stayed at two of Dawn's lofts for our son's wedding this past weekend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I lived in Auburn, NY for seven years. Returning for a visit it has been a delight to stay in Richard's wonderful space.

The heating is a bit noisier, but earplugs are available for the more sensitive guests.
Richard is very friendly and we would come back."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for one night for a wedding in town. Overall, was a great experience! Easy to find and easy to check-in. Richard was accomodating and let us know as soon as the place was ready on our check-in date. The space is cozy, beds were comfortable and it was sufficiently clean! Felt like a true Airbnb experience with a origin map and people leaving their uneeded food and tolietries. Sometimes there were loud cars driving by, but Richard had earplugs available to take by the beds. Only other thing I'd note is that it is a second floor unit (as stated) and there are some steep stairs to get up."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The upstairs apartment was just as pictured. Simple and efficient. 2 bedrooms for the price was great. The queen bed was super comfortable. Keep in mind, the stairs may be a bit steep for some. It was chilly when we arrived and the heat came on immediately!
Richards place is well located between Aurora and Skaneateles.
We loved the Prison City Pub , which was walkable in good weather and ate there both nights. I would absolutely stay there again !"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall my stay was great! The place was clean and comfortable. The check-in/check-out process was easy. The only fault there I found (which is to no fault of the host) was that there is a lot of street noise and you can hear music from the bar down the road. The host provided ear plugs which helped slightly, but if you can’t wear ear buds to sleep, bring something else to drown out the noise."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very nice place to stay, clean and comfortable."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Richard’s place was clean, well-appointed and spacious. He was great about notifying me about check-in and rules. The only thing I would add is that there is a steep and narrow staircase — if you’re not fully mobil you couldn’t get inside. Also the shower is quite small."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was very well taken care of and everything was extremely clean.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect spot and convenient place to stay.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Would recommend. Everything you need! Thanks!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard's place was exactly what we needed for just a night while we were traveling. Only 'issues' were that the road was a little bit loud and one of the spring mattresses a bit worn out. I would recommend staying at Richard's place. We didn't use the kitchen but it looked clean and well stocked.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a local wedding!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was just what we needed! The surrounding areas are so cute and easy to navigate to! Richard’s stay was clean, well-lit, charming, and felt safe! Would definitely recommend!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place was clean and Richard was very responsive when we had trouble with the lock box at checkin. He called us right back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cool pad, well equipped, with a dedicated parking space. Richard is very responsive and helpful. The only complaint would be the soundproofing, but Richard provides several earplugs which make the issue almost irrelevant."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A large apartment in a good location to discover the finger lakes region.
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Richard’s apartment was very easy to check in and out of and was a great value for the money. The unit was “tired,” but it certainly had everything we needed for a one night visit. If you have bad knees, know that the stairs leading to the unit are very steep. The road noise was exceptional in the front bedroom. Thank you for providing earplugs…so appreciated! Overall, we were grateful to Richard for offering us a place to stay for our Auburn adventure. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Bathroom is a little tight and stairs to get in are a bit steep. But otherwise, it’s perfect for a quick stay. Place was clean and easily accessible"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The flat was nice and convenient for our stay. The two rooms are spacious and additional furniture which did not appear on the pictures where in the flat (e.g. new sofa, larger table in the kitchen), improving the overall comfort. There is a parking space in the property. The location is probably not the nicest of the town of Auburn but close enough to the centre and to discover the lakes. We definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were visiting to check out the shopping at Weedsport. Just 15 minutes from the track, great value for money!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is a great spot. Great restaurants near by
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy and just what we needed for a night while we travelled.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was a great stay! Easy to locate, clean and had everything you need for a weekend stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean apartment located right in Auburn. Richard was very responsive when communicating. Had some questions and he got back to me very quickly each time. The apartment and the host were great. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment, very clean with everything that you need (bathroom items) and kitchen that had spices and all the items for cooking. Coffee and tea was provided, which was great. The house is older so it has window A/C unit, but ear plugs are provided. We also opened the windows and had a nice breeze going in the living room. Place is very clean, beds are comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard’s place was great, clean and tidy and very inviting. Lots of restaurants and amenities nearby. We had a great stay."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Little noisy and warm but worked out great for what we were there for
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location for the price, if you’re looking for something simple, comfy, and no fuss with all the amenities, this is the place. It was nothing fancy, but the tv was large, the apartment is spacious, and the kitchen was well equipped. Perfect for a couple days stay while visiting family. We were very impressed with how clean and well put together the space was. Rich was very responsive and messaged back within minutes, also had good recommendations for local food (Pavlo’s was a fantastic breakfast diner, we got to meet Pavlo himself even). We had some trouble getting in, there are multiple apartment units in the building, however that was our own mistake because we had misread the instructions to get in. Overall, fantastic value for price, simple but well thought out space. Highly recommend for any sort of short stay!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"For my first time using air bnb Richard was very nice and understanding, very responsive and helpful."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simple, comfortable stay"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice upstairs apartment. Everything was clean. Provided coffee and fixings. Great value for the price.
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Older apartment, not consistent with my expectations for airbnb. instructions were confusing. Apartment lacked AC, we arrived late at night from a long drive to an older, musty, stuffy apartment. The heat was intolerable. Shower/bathroom was tiny. Floor was noticeably pitched throughout the second floor apartment, which was pretty bare. It was too late to switch locations and the owner was not very considerate in his messaging. He announced that he would show up to install the AC, didn't ask, this made me nervous (it was 10pm by this point). I told him not to come. Managed to fall asleep somehow despite the heat and left first thing in the morning. Would not stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy spot in Auburn for short or a ling term stay. Very open and bright short walk or drive into town. Very affordable! Richard Thanks for hosting!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely little place that perfectly suited our needs, I’d definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"For the information of the people with limited mobility: Steep and long staircase with too narrow steps leads to this upstairs apartment.
Loud music from the nearby restaurants until 9 pm. Traffic noise throughout the night. Some loud bypassers.
The apartment could use a deeper cleaning.
The apartment is as on pictures. Easy self-check-in."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place at a great price. Perfect size for two couples. We’ll stay again if I’m the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was exactly what we needed as we hopped from one place to another.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay could not have been better than at Richard's place. Location, accesibility, amenities and other numerous possibilities. Richard's attention to detail and thoughtfulness contributing Auburn's hospitality are hard to match and that's what made our experience so much memorable and deserving of being revisited. AAA+ stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, clean apartment for a short stop in the area :)"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for the Ritz, move along. If you want something simple and exceptionally priced, this is the place.
Richard was mostly responsive. He assured me that there was no cleaning fee unless I really messed things up. I really appreciate that.
I struggled to get onto the internet because he didn't include the first half of the network name. I think it might be a regional thing to not put the first few letters in because there are lots of networks that begin with that extension. Anyway, I finally figured it out.
I struggled with the TV interface but that's a personal problem, I think."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay while I was up visiting family. Being close to town and the surrounding areas, I did not have to waste time driving back and forth. Very clean and cozy, right on one of the main roads, which made it easy to find."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lots of stairs to get into the unit, just putting this here for visibility in case someone has trouble with that sort of thing! Clean space, great host, good value."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was in town for a wedding and this place exceeded all expectations!! Everything was very clean and Richard was very accommodating to our request for an early check in. We only stayed one night, but if we end up taking another trip here we’d definitely book again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Rich for my wonderful stay in Auburn! Loved the place! Nice and cozy. Had everything I needed especially in the kitchen! I work night shifts so the blackout curtains in one of the rooms really helped when I was sleeping during day time. Kitchen had everything I needed to cook too. Well maintained and nice place. Affordable, neat, and clean! Will definitely come back!😃"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent deal for what we got, apartment was clean and comfortable, surrounding area felt safe and we had a great weekend. Richard was super fast at responding to my questions prior to arrival."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little upstairs apartment. Close to a decent amount of restaurants and stores. Offstreet parking definitely a plus. Great instructions for easy self check-in/checkout. Our fav part was the little chalkboard with local recommendations - very nice touch!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a very cute place loved it!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Well worth the price. Fit my needs and would stay again.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome value ! Clean.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was comfortable for a quick stay. I had to kill a few bugs but that’s par for the course with an apartment. Unfortunately coffee grounds from the previous tenant had been left in the coffee maker, so it had gone moldy and grossed me out to use. Bathroom shower is very small. It was a fine place, just not the most relaxing in some small ways. Richard was very communicative and helpful during my stay. Easy check in and check out process."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard's place was so cozy and well-maintained. It was cool to see a map where guests can put a pin and show where they came from. Overall it was a nice stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,our second stay in Richard's bnb! it's our go to when we are in the area. He's very easy to work with and provides great accommodations. Hopefully will return again soon.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great spot for the price and located near anything you’d need!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a nice, welcoming gem convenient to everything in the area. Visiting in autumn was a wonderful idea as the local foliage made for a picturesque visit. The place has a historic, cozy, homelike feeling but is fashionably decorated too. Easy to check in and check out on my timeline helped, too."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Richard's accommodation is very good, clean and has the best kitchen equipped to prepare your meals. In addition, we have some cooking ingredients that although they are simple, one is not worth buying. 2 houses there is a 7 eleven and 2 blocks away there is to buy cold beer. I really have a great time."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and great place and the and a great location in the Finger Lakes Area.

very cozy
great set up thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this place was very nice for my boyfriend and i for day/night. the area was interesting however the waterloo outlets were a short drive away, and the place itself was good! loved the book for guests to sign too :)"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Richard’s place two separate days—at the beginning and end of a longer trip. He is very thoughtful with the amenities offered, definitley great value and good-sized space. Quick heads up though—the staircase to get up to the apartment is very narrow and steep. Otherwise no complaints and we had everything we needed!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect space for the stopover from Niagara Falls to New York! The place was super cute and decorated with a lot of love. It's a real shame that we only slept there one night.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay, everything was just as described. Attention to details were above and beyond. Ac was running when we arrived which felt great. The place was very spacious."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, a comfortable apartment with large rooms and a delightful living room. Great wi-fi and TV services. Very convenient location. In a humble neighborhood, but you get the downtown proximity. Note the shower is small and stairs are steep, if you are not so nimble. Would stay there again, but no plans to return to Auburn. Enjoy the history Auburn has to offer. So many places to see."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! Everything was just right, very cozy and inviting and comfortable and spacious. I highly recommend Rich and his upstairs apartment ♥️"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard is an amazing host and made the place extremely comfortable
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved This Air BnB. The “take a book/leave a book” on was a great idea! Local to fingerlakes area and a great stopping point between Ithica and Niagra falls.
There are a lot of food options near by. 2 bed rooms and a kitchen/bathroom for this rate is unbeatable. Host was extremely polite and super accommodating. Highly reccomend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard's place is the perfect size. It's in a quiet neighborhood not very far from Auburn's center. Had everything we needed and more. Comfortable and safe. Couldn't ask for more.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly appreciated our stay at Richard's. Everything was as described. Especially pleasant were the thoughtful details such as blow dryer, shower products, air conditioner plus bedroom fans. It was also an easy walk down State Street to some restaurants. Richard's communication is prompt and excellent."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's apartment was just as described, and it was perfect for our stay in Auburn.
We appreciated the blow dryer and hygiene products, the coffee, the large screen tv and comfortable couch, comfortable beds, and the air conditioners as well as fans. We were very comfortable. Also a plus is that we could walk right down State street to find some fun restaurants and pubs. We had a short drive to the Merry-Go-Round theatre by a lake, and the show was Broadway quality.
Although the neighborhood is humble, we felt safe and enjoyed our pleasant rooms. I'd definitely stay here again! Thanks, Richard, for a lovely stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stop and crash on a long drive! Appreciated all the cozy touches.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,In my small amount of time I was in the Auburn area this was a wonderful place to rest my head. It was close to the highway and close to the center of town. The amenities were very nice and it made for an easy stay. You also cannot beat the price for what you get. I would definitely recommend if you are on your way through.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Clean, convenient and welcoming. Would stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect apartment for a small family or vacationing pals or 2 couples bc the bedrooms are spacious and separate.

The living room and kitchen are also very spacious and comfy.
The added touches this host put in really make it homey."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place very cozzy
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a charming and unique place with lots of space considering it is an urban location. It is welcoming and you feel like you are in a HOME. We really loved it and the price was so reasonable.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is well put together and has everything you’d need. We aren’t used to the city noise and it ended up being too far away from where we needed to be. But I’d still recommend! It’s clean, stocked up, and communication is good."

Great recommendations and amenities are included. Highly recommend!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard”s place is just so perfect: big, clean, comfy, welcoming, equipped with all essentials. We drove from NYC looking for some relax, then we fall in love with Finger Lakes surroundings. You would enjoy many trails and great food around there. Three days were not enough for us. We will definitely come back soon.
Local people is so kind and calm, you would forget your stress for sure!!!
Very recommended!!!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Richards place is clean, well kept, and reasonably priced. Just what we needed for the night."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just in town passing through for one night. Cute place, met my needs perfectly!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice set up and off street parking. The space was comfortable tho the neighborhood was a bit noisy for me.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to stay for all things upstate NY. Easy access to all attractions. Fantastic price, apartment was very clean, had everything we needed for cooking. Rooms were comfortable, bed was a little soft for my liking, but still very nice."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Richard is a great host. Communication was fast and easy. One can easily see that a lot of detailed thought were put in to make one's stay in his place smooth and comfortable. However, the noise level from the street and neighbours was a bit too much to our liking."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable and spacious apartment. Steep stairs may be more tricky for some to carry luggage into the space. Apartment does get quite hot and no ability to open windows.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I highly recommend this place!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Auburn. We'd stay again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an excellent value and great launching point to visit Auburn and other nearby Finger Lake towns. We visited Skaneateles, Seneca Falls, Aurora and Auburn — visiting Harriett Tubman sites and her grave, the NP Women’s Right Museum, beautiful lake front sites, the Montezuma Wildlife Refuge, a wine tasting,shops and more. We used our savings to splurge on a nice restaurant.
The place was large and we liked the touches. We had a nice weekend, but I think this is a great place for an extended stay with the nice, full kitchen.
We enjoyed the large screen TV, good WiFi, and comfortable bed.
The breakfast suggestions were perfect for us — but next time we plan to stay in and cook.
My wife & I will have fond memories of Auburn celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little place...works well and is convenient for downtown Auburn and nearby Skaneateles.... and reasonably priced. ""Tight/steep stairs"" for anyone who may have trouble getting to a second floor...otherwise, it's a great place for a layover/short stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice basic accommodation at a great price. Coffee and a beautiful selection of tea bags provides along with bathroom essentials. Neighborhood was a bit noisy (people shouting and revving motorcycles late at night). Anyone with mobility challenges should be aware that the stairs up to the unit are small and steep. Thanks for a hassle free Airbnb experience.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard’s place was even more cozy and comfy than pictured! I hope he updates his photos, cuz he’s added some great comfort to it.
Perfectly clean and the check in was super easy. Loved trekking up stairs for the final reveal of the space up top. Both bedrooms looked so cozy, though I had to just pick one haha.
Great amenities in the bathroom and a fridge with a few condiments from I’m assuming past guests, or even Richard.
Great Wi-Fi signal. Took my tired brain a second to realize where his was on my computers dropdown menu, so don’t be discouraged if this happens to you as well!
Such a great place to hang my hat for a night. Super recommend."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"No AC, no cable TV, so no live sports, only Amazon Firestick TV. 2 blocks from strip club and very close to loud music rock bar"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! Very well kept and welcoming. Loved the suggestions left by Richard for places to go. Richard was kind and extremely communicative. Great experience here - was in town for a wedding.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice host and very nice apartment. Richard always messaged promptly and was really helpful. Its very clean and put together. The recommendations of places to eat and things to do was a nice plus.
One note that i think folks should know before booking-the host tells you after booking that each guest is responsible for cleaning the apartment for the next guest. So, this doesnt seem to adhere to the airbnb covid cleaning guidelines. Maybe some people are ok with this, but I think its unfair not to advertise this publicly so folks can make an informed decision when booking."

Adam was available and willing to answer all our questions in preparation for our stay. (Thank you!)
We had an amazing experience!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Adam's house was perfect for our group of 6. We appreciated the large kitchen which was well stocked with the basics for cooking most of our meals, as well as a grill with plenty of propane. The dining table was big enough for us to gather for meals as well as evening card games. The deck along the water was the place to be for some afternoon sun and we enjoyed paddling the kayaks and paddle boat to the lake. Although we didn't use the firepit, there was plenty of wood stacked and ready to go and another gas fire pit on the riverside deck. The lake is a short walk away and once you get off the main road in front of the house, the surrounding neighborhoods are also good for walking...and this has to be one of the friendliest towns as we were greeted by almost everyone we passed. Adam is very quick to respond and we appreciated being able to get access a little bit early. Definitely recommend this house for an enjoyable stay in Auburn."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam is a truly wonderful host.
He had ensured that the house was well equipped, right from providing basics for cooking food to condiments, from clean linens to a well maintained house. Everything was just perfect.

Our party included 2 over 60's, 2 young adults and 1 year old and a few visiting relatives who came for day visits. It's a charming house, very clean, close to town, and a good walk through the backyard to the riverfront with a nice deck with a gas fire pit, and there were cleats for our son's boat. We loved the location and the house had plenty of room for our family. We like to cook and we were pleased to have a gas range in the spacious kitchen as well as a gas grill in the garage. The cookware, dishes, and flatware were a bit basic but sufficient for our purposes. Both bathrooms appeared to have been recently renovated and we also appreciated having wifi throughout the house. The kids appreciated having the Spectrum TV options. Oh, and our host Adam was very quick to respond to our questions. Thanks Adam!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was large, clean, and well air conditioned. The two bathrooms had clearly been updated recently and the showers had great water pressure. The house style is a little dated, which you can see from the pictures, but not really any issue. The screened porch was nice to enjoy. It's not clear from the pictures, but the backyard and very long and the river is a fair distance from the house."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Adam was very pleasant to work with. Very fast to respond. His house is amazing. We stayed there for my Daughter's wedding and we had a lot of friends and family visit us.

We particularly enjoyed the screen porch and the river deck. Watch for wood ducks on the river just to the north!"

The shower is great, and it's a beautiful place to come ""home"" to at the end of a long day. Highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay the only thing we can suggest us to have more chairs in the dining room, there were only 2 and there was 3 of us. It would also be nice to have more seats in the living room. The kitchen could use a dishwasher as well as more counter space for preparing our meals. Overall we loved our stay!! Thank you"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Nice stay in lower level of a home with private entry. Plenty of parking in rear. Kitchen could use more counter space or a separate table for food prep. Host is kind and responsive.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my go-to place for the Cayuga Lake area! I've stayed here multiple times, and walking through Jeanne's front door feels like coming home.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my third booking with Jeanne, and it always feels like coming to a home away from home when I need to be in the Aurora area for work. Her location is an excellent leaping off point for tourism in the Finger Lakes, too. I appreciate the little touches she provides, like: the Keurig with its well stocked selection of coffee, tea, and cocoa, chocolates on the dresser, upscale linens and toiletries, personal fridge, toaster oven and microwave. It's a charming old farmhouse, not a generic hotel, and that's one of this stay's appeal for me. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was good.
For us, the bed was a bit soft, but that's in taste.
Comfortable room and very concerned hostess because everything was perfect. Very nice."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was perfect! Just the right location for my Fall vacation in the Finger Lakes area. Jeanne was the perfect host as well. I will definitely be going back there to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed at several Airbnb listings, but had never been a guest in someone's home. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive, but this turned out to be a marvelous experience. There were amenities that were not there in other places I had stayed. Jeanne had a mirror in the bathroom that adjusted so that I could put on make-up easily; I carry one with me when I travel because I cannot see with a regular mirror. Nice touch! Also, there was a dresser in the room where I could unload my suitcase and not have to live out of it. Another touch which pleased me. Despite a family living in the home, I found my room to be quiet. I was very comfortable in this room; I lacked for nothing.
On my return flight, I had a cancelation. I contacted Jeanne of the situation and she was very willing to keep me on and refresh my linens, towels, and anything else that I might need. I was very satisfied with my room and plan to stay with Jeanne the next time I am up visiting. Great place to stay!"

It was a great place to curl up with a book and relax for the day. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My niece and her husband really enjoyed their stay. The people they delt with were helpful and very nice.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Love the quiet cozy atmosphere and having a private bath is a plus! Will stay anytime I'm in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In town for HS reunion and visiting friends and family. The location was convenient for everywhere I wanted to go in and around Auburn. Jeanne has thought of everything! And although I didn’t take advantage of them, having a microwave & toaster oven, plus dishes, cups, glasses, etc would be a plus for many. A super comfy bed and a mini fridge with a freezer that was cold enough to create ice (for my morning iced coffee!) were 5 star worthy in their own right."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect, close to my family and friends. Room was exactly as described and bed was very comfortable. Nice patio in back yard, with nice view. Jeanne answered questions in a timely manner. Enjoyed the room! Stay was very relaxing."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific stay! It has everything you need, plus a country charm. I especially appreciated the table, coffee, microwave and mini fridge in the room.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Jeanne's place! It had everything I needed for my stay, while taking a workshop at the Schweinfurth Art Center. Jeanne has a beautiful property.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeanne was very helpful and the stay was exactly as advertised!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeanne's comfortable, well-appointed and peaceful room with spacious attached bath proved to be the perfect place for me to stay while visiting with 2 sets of long-term friends in the area. The location could not have been better, both for ease of access to my friends and for proximity to Owasco Lake (where one couple lived). Emerson Park at the northern tip of the lake was an excellent place to walk and relax with one friend living further north and a great spot for my morning walk before heading to a family celebration at the home of my friends with a house on the lake. My full, active weekend schedule did not allow for overlap with Jeanne, so we worked out all details in advance via messages which she answered promptly and completely. I felt welcomed and completely at home based on our communications and had a wonderful stay in her lovely, rural setting! Great shower and large bathroom sink appealing, too."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeanne is the perfect hostess. The room is cozy and comfortable and only a few minutes from town and other sites in the area.

I've been there twice already and will return again for my next visit.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Jeanne’s place and I still can’t say enough how wonderful it is. She is so accommodating and certainly makes you feel like family. And Honey is an added bonus. Such a sweet dog.

The bathrooms in particular have fairly new fixtures as of the time of this writing, and were spacious for a cabin such as this, clean and comfortable.

It was easy to find, and a great location for anyone visiting family near Auburn or Skaneateles, or just vacationing in the Fingerlakes with an interest in exploring the area, cycling, hiking, and that sort of thing. Be aware that there is no lake access. But there is a wonderful view of the lake."

Location is quiet and has a great view of the lake. You do have to drive to get to anything - stores, restaurants, movies, grocery store, etc. Very relaxing and private. Beds were comfy.

We used the fireplace both nights, which was nice and toasty. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cookware. Washer and dryer were convenient (although we didn't use them). The wifi worked awesome even with all four of us on it at the same time.

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All 5 of us really enjoyed our stay at Joe & Christina's cabin. There was a view of Owasco Lake. Along the lake are lovely homes. The cabin is across the street but set back for complete privacy. The rustic cabin was clean and neat and included a washer/dryer and a dish washer! There is a full bedroom on the main floor with a bathroom, nice sized living room, dining area and then a kitchen. Upstairs is a darling attic style room where the wooden roof sloped to the floor (very cozy and homey!) divided into 2 bedrooms by a wall and curtains for privacy. There is a couch that folds flat up there AND another bathroom! Both bathrooms have showers which was another great perk. They even included some basic staples for our first breakfast! We were very happy in this cabin which also has a nice big yard. Thank you so much to Joe and Crystina! We thoroughly enjoyed your cabin, thank you for sharing it! When we come again we will definitely be looking up your cabin!"
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Crystina were great with giving us lots of suggestions of places to check out, including restaurants, breweries, wineries, and shopping. We tried several of them out and they were as good as they said.
We had an issue with wifi, but Joe handled it swiftly and it was working in no time.
Their place is in a very quiet and relaxing area with friendly neighbors near by, but not close enough to detract from the peacefulness."

2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe & Crystina's cabin was exactly as described. It was really cosy sat by the fire playing board games and making s'mores. The place was also really clean and they provided basics for breakfast. We even saw a little fox prancing around outside in the snow. Would recommend this as place to crash for hikes in the area, or for summer activities on the nearby lakes (winery tours nearby too). The view of the lake from the cabin was also nice, although we couldn't go right to the lake from the cabin."

2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was behind words perfect for our weekend trip to the finger lakes. Rooms were huge, beds and sheets soooo comfortable (I'm seriously looking to buy the same sheets), and pictures were true to life. There were toiletries available in the restrooms in case a guest forgot or needs additional. Condiments and coffee supplies were available in the kitchen.
Joe was very communicative prior to the trip, throughout as needed, and afterwards.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time at the log cabin! The space was adorable and full of charm - just like the pictures. It was spotless and we we were very happy there.
2016-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We unfortunately got to arrive only late at night and leave early next day.. But it was a comfortable stay.. Joe and Crystina had the place clean and stocked with basic provisions for a quick breakfast.. The water heater was off by mistake and it was just a matter of finding the mains and turning it on.. Otherwise it was very smooth and we'd love to comeback and stay for a longer time. Loved the view of the lake from the living room was great early in the morning..
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. Very accurate to the pictures. The host was extremely nice and tried to accommodate every request. Staples were provided in case we got in late at night, and everything was so clean. And the house, with the view of the lake, was exactly what I want in a vacation home. Loved this stay!"

2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great overnight stay while traveling through Syracuse for a story. Highly recommend!
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place and great hosts! Not only were my questions answered almost immediately but they provided me with so much info I barely had to ask anything. Bread milk and eggs in the fridge and everything you could want was provided for us. The pics of the cabin are great but do no justice. If u have the opportunity you will not be disappointed at all!!
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay so much the first time that we came back the next weekend! Everything was great again! Joe met us upon arrival, already had a fire going inside, and left a note welcoming us back. I highly recommend this listing for anyone looking to get away."
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joe and Crystina have a great cabin by Owasco Lake! Everything was as described in the listing with little touches here and there to make you feel at home. A fire was already built, the bathroom was stocked with commonly forgotten items (shampoo, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.), the kitchen was well stocked and even had breakfast necessities (bread, eggs, butter, pancake mix, etc.), and the wifi was seamless - a BIG plus for me.

We enjoyed sitting by the fire to watch the sunset over the lake from the comfort of the living room. The town of Auburn is only 5-10 minutes away with a Wegmans and some choices for restaurants and bars. The town of Skaneateles is about 10-15 minutes away with more choices for restaurants.

All in all, we had a great stay, and we will definitely be back!"
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great experience!

My girlfriend and I wanted a romantic valentines day retreat, and this cabin on Owasco Lake was the perfect destination! Joe & Crystina were an absolute pleasure to work with. They provided all the info and amenities we needed to have a perfect stay!

The cabin was in a beautiful location, and is certainly cozy, but not small at all. Everything was so comfortable, the fireplace was great, and the view of the lake was breathtaking against the snowy backdrop.

The cabin itself has everything one would need for a multi-night stay! We cooked a several course meal in the fully-appointed kitchen, and enjoyed it at the beautiful dining room table while watching the fire.

J&C are obviously experienced hosts, and were able to provide one of the smoothest AirBnb experiences I have ever had! I HIGHLY recommend this cabin for anyone looking for a delightful time in the perfect winter/summer destination."
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay at Joe and Crystina's beautiful log cabin for a weekend retreat. The place is so warm and cozy. We could not have been more impressed with how communicative and welcoming Joe and Crystina were for us. If you're looking for a great lake-side cabin with all the comforts of home and more, this is your place. We hope everyone can enjoy this little slice of cabin heaven like we did!"
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We REALLY loved our stay at this Beautiful Cottage by the lake. Our hosts were considerate and thoughtful. The Cottage was much more than we expected, and I don't think the listing pictures do it justice. More than a cabin, with completely modern Kitchen and baths, so well equipped, nothing was needed but the clothes you wear. From eggs and milk and coffee and Butter in the stocked kitchen, to new toothbrushes and soaps and shampoos and lotions in the baths, no need has been overlooked. Air mattresses and plenty of blankets and pillows would make this the PERFECT destination for large families and groups. The hosts called us 3 or 4 times to offer service or inquire if we needed anything at all, but other than that, we enjoyed COMPLETE privacy. The Fire was prepared and there was a large stack of firewood, kindling and paper next to the hearth to make it easy to enjoy nights by the fire. There is individual electric heat in almost every room, making it a cozy winter stay.. What a GREAT value, and so much better than a Hotel room for 2 couples (or more). We will DEFINITELY return, and recommend this place to our friends."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house!! Very easy to find and detailed instructions on how to get in!! Loved the breakfast nook and back patio!! Very clean all throughout the house!!

Everything was better than expected!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have stayed twice before, always a wonderful experience and it just feels like home (away from home).

We have been in Auburn for a nice dinner @ Balloons Restaurant with our friends, this space provides a wonderful chance to relax together. A real Super Host place..."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Comfy cozy beds. Plenty of heat for a cold Thanksgiving week. We had fun playing the family-friendly games available in the house.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Before we even checked in, Jennie allowed us the flexibility to check-in early, which was welcome after over 24hrs of travelling. The house was super cozy with everything you will need for your stay. The location was perfect with only a 10 minute drive to Skaneateles and the beautiful lakes. The beds were super comfortable and the street very quiet. We would highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jennie's house was perfect for discovering the Finger Lakes region. We very much appreciated the pasta and tomato sauce welcome package as well as Jennie's clear instructions to get in the house. It made it easy for us to settle in after a long drive from Boston! The house looks like in the pictures and was spacious enough for the 6 of us. Bonus: there is plenty of entertainment options if you have kids!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was in a nice residential area and easy to find. Outdoor space was nice for morning coffee. Inside had room for all. I enjoyed the chairs by the front windows reading. Was a quiet location. Very convenient to Syracuse and Skaneateles.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at Jennie's place in Auburn, location is just a few minutes from downtown in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The house is very charming, nicely laid out, well stocked in the kitchen (we appreciated the coffee, almond milk, syrup, and spices) and communications with the owner were prompt and easy. The house has a lot of old charm and character and is well put together and homey. We would definitely come back here, great find! Thanks for the service to Jennie!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The restored retreat worked well for our family vacation with our adult children. We were able to explore Auburn and many state parks in the Finger lake area. The house was very welcoming and comfortable.

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have stayed here before with the same experience, very nice! I did ask for a latter check out time but (since I am not a phone person) didn't find out we could check out later till I was home. All was very comfortable and easy to enjoy. It was especially cold but we were warm and no issues!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very pleasant stay! The few issues we had come up were minor and Jennie was incredibly responsive too and offered to fix right away.
We would recommend this place for someone looking for a cozy place to stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the house in Auburn. The house is very comfortable, clean and felt like home. Auburn was a good location fairly close to fun tourist destinations as well as to the Thruway, airport and train station, and the house is on a pleasant, quiet street."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute! Comfy beds, clean, just what we needed!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Jennie’s home was perfect for us to visit and welcome our new nephew into this world! We would definitely stay again!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute house, kitchen was super well stocked! We were very happy"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely and cozy house..so very clean and bright. Quiet location with friendly neighbor, and so close to wegmans and the heart of town. Quick 20min walk to the restaurants and bars, we loved our stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family stay at this charming retreat was really smooth. The Location is amazing . It’s on a Charming street near a lovely Park, Coffee shops groceries and History ( Harriet Tubman Residential / women civil right) all within a 5-10 min car ride. 20 min from Skaneateles village and the Lake/ boating. An old fashioned drive-in theater at the town limit.
Jennie was extremely accommodating and responded quickly to questions . The house comes with a fully loaded kitchen making staying in for dinner after a long day of exploring a breeze. We really took advantage of the gas grill. We especially enjoyed the board games, DVD’s and the Lego bucket for the kids."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was lovely! The space was well appointed and cozy. Great location. Minor thing: The AC didn’t seem to work upstairs which made sleeping quite hot on some nights. Downstairs the AC was very effective. We really enjoyed our stay overall.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Convenient location in Auburn. Close to grocery stores and a quick drive to the lake!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were able to book last minute for a great long weekend family getaway in May to the Finger Lakes. The restored retreat was old in a good way and nice and neat. Looks small outside but plenty of room inside. My lady loved it. We stayed in the rooms with the queen beds and they were comfy! The tower fans in the bedrooms were very much appreciated and the living room has nice chairs and Netflix— what more do you need? Auburn is a cute little town (the restaurants close early like 8pm) which we weren’t used to in the five boroughs so we found ourselves at Prison City Brewery (really good) twice! We enjoyed seeing all the pretty houses, some great exhibits at the Schweinfurth Art Center and loved our visit to New Hope Mills Cafe (delicious). Not to mention we spent an entire day eating, shopping, and sightseeing at beautiful Skaneateles Lake which is just a short drive away. Tip: Don’t be too far back in the line for the boat tour otherwise you’ll end up sitting out of earshot of the captain’s voice and you will learn no Skaneateles facts… A wonderful weekend nonetheless. We were very grateful for Auburn and the restored retreat, thanks Jennie!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was perfect for my sisters winery themed bachelorette weekend! It was very clean, nicely updated, and overall perfect! We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"What an adorable home! We rented this home for family as we celebrated our daughter's college graduation.

Loved the space in kitchen and dining area! Thank you for sharing this restored retreat!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great experience at Jennie’s house! Everything was very clean and well stocked giving us everything we needed and more! She even provided us with a few kid friendly features for our son. Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice quiet neighborhood, house was nice and clean"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Her house was beautiful. The beds were like clouds. I have always loved the Victorian style houses. The dining room was amazing. Over all it was home. Thank you so much for letting us grieve there. Couldn’t have been more at home.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is bigger than it looks in photos. Very clean, comfortable, and set up for a cozy weekend with family or friends. Everything was easy and accessible to getting in and out. Close to town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was as advertised; very comfortable with all the things you need to feel at home while away. Very easy to check in and check out with good comunication and nice roomy spaces to relax and enjoy. It was very very cold while we stayed but the fireplace gave us a warm feel and we stayed cozy and warm.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I had a nice girls' weekend at Jennie's place. The house was clean, quiet, and had plenty of space for us. Check-in was super easy and Jennie was helpful and accomodating when our plans changed because of a blizzard. My favorite things about the house were the comfy couch by the sunny windows (be sure to open the blinds to get maximum light) and the stained glass window in the front room. If you are visiting in the winter time, a couple things to know are that the fireplace is electric (I didn't look at the photos closely enough to realize that), and the dining room area can get very cold because it's surrounded by windows and there's not a heating vent right by it. We had planned to do a puzzle at the table but it was too chilly to sit there for an extended time. (We were there on a particularly frigid weekend so probably not an issue most of the year.) On the plus side, there is a nice heat lamp in the bathroom upstairs and we had plenty of hot water for showers."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect accommodations. This was our second time staying at Jennie's and it was just as wonderful as the first. The home is exactly as described and more. It was warm and inviting with holiday touches added throughout for the winter season. Very thoughtful! We truly enjoyed our stay and hope to back again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly restored Victorian charmer! Clean, well-equipped and cozy. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely look to stay at this location again."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Restored Retreat was perfect. It was a chilly weekend so we immediately warmed up with the fireplace! The overall vibe of the house was perfect for a weekend get away. It could easily accommodate a couple or a full family. The house was super clean, with all the amenities for a short or long stay. Large kitchen area, nice fenced back yard and quiet neighborhood. Upstairs was clean and the bedrooms were a good size. The house is super cozy with little quotes tucked all around to keep you positive throughout your stay. The location is central to main roads needed to get to downtown Auburn, Skaneateles or any other surrounding towns you may be looking to visit. Highly recommend!!! We look forward to coming back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Very nicely decorated and beautiful touches like a welcoming card and some food to eat. If you are in auburn for a wedding or a over night it’s a great place to stay! Very close to Wegmans and Emerson park.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennie’s place is great. It’s close to downtown Auburn and just a short drive to Skaneateles. Our reason for the trip was to attend a wedding in Skaneateles. Jennie’s Airbnb was only 10 minutes from the wedding venue. The house was VERY clean and cozy. We brought our two kids with us. The house was kid friendly. Jennie had books, toys, and a cute little balloon for our son! Such a nice touch! I would highly recommend Jennie’s Airbnb!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Jennie was a wonderful host and the house was great! The other guests kept commenting on how cute the house was. Lots to do around the area as well! I will definitely stay here again if I’m back in the area :)

Close to any type of convenience you may need. The house is very clean and comfortable and has a large amount of amenities anyone could need. My family and I had a wonderful stay and loved enjoying breakfast together in the lovely sun breakfast nook. Jennie is super quick to respond and lovely to chat with on any questions I had. I highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The definition of hospitality and warmth!
This retreat will make you feel at home from the moment you walk through the front door! When my family walked in we immediately wanted to walk into each room to see all the little details! From the food recommendations and gift cards in the kitchen to the comfort that each individual room brought, topped off with the yummy ice cream sandwiches that were waiting for us in the freezer from a local creamery! The love and care that Jennie pours out into her home will have you sharing this retreat with everyone you know and planning your next visit back!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Jennie’s place and we loved it just as much as the first! In fact, we have already booked our third stay.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy home is perfect for a getaway in the cutest neighborhood! Clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed for our stay. Perfect location to explore the finger lakes. We had a great girls weekend in this space and would highly recommend! Thanks Jeannie!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable and cozy renovated house. Kids loved the bunk bed (although it was a little squeaky when they wiggled around). Just 10mins from Skaneateles, 2mins from Wegman’s and a great base to explore the Finger Lakes, see the fall colors or even hit Niagara (which we did). Jennie was very responsive and courteous (we had a town-wide blackout while we were there and Jennie was able to point me at where she stored a lantern for just such an occasion). The little touch of all the ingredients for a pasta meal on arrival (after long drive) was also a nice thoughtful surprise."
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved staying here! Great space! Very comfortable beds and bedding! Local to the town and close to everything. Very clean. Will definitely come back to this house again.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a large family gathering, and needed a place to house 3 toddlers and 4 adults. Traveling with small children can be stressful, especially in the winter, but the house was completely comfortable and had amazing touches of hospitality. We felt welcomed from the first time we expressed interest (the hostess was incredibly responsive the entire stay) to walking in the door. The house was clean, warm, inviting and had everything we needed while in town. We felt blessed and fortunate to find such a gem right where we needed it!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! Check in was super easy (love smart locks), the house was spotless, and great space for adults and kids. The gift cards for local eateries was an awesome touch! My wife and son have some severe food allergies and based on the healthy options at the house (which included a just Incase dinner section- awesome) we knew the local restaurant suggestions would be up our alley. 100% accurate on that one :) Highly recommended, if we’re ever back in Auburn this is the only place we’ll stay!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennie's place was exactly what we needed for our family, including young children. It was very comfortable, well stocked, and had many thoughtful touches.

2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,By far one of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed at!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous home. The extra touches (coffee nook, local instructions, gift cards etc) really make this home stand out. The location is perfect with easy access to downtown and local attractions. Great spots within the house to sit and relax and have your morning coffee or tea from the well supplied coffee nook. The hostess has sweetly provided complimentary gift cards to some local establishments, although we didn't get to use them, the gesture was appreciated. The house is well equipped and very clean. A pleasure to stay in this welcoming home. Jennie was very responsive with any questions I had."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"You will expect a beautiful, cleaned, organized, renovated , spacious and quiet location. A lot of useful information about where to get things and eat. The location is central to all the major lakes to go wine tasting . Also expect fresh cleaned towels and bedding. Also a brand new French door fridge that you can put all groceries. Love it. Going back next year! ♥️"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was perfect. We often stay with family when visiting the area but decided we wanted our own place, and we loved it! The house is spacious and decorated nicely, we enjoyed having friends come over and had the ability to entertain. The amenities of the house were so helpful for our stay in upstate NY, we had the ability to dine out at the local eateries or grill in the backyard. The coffee nook was my wife's first stop every morning and favorite corner of the house. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Audrey was a terrific host! We had a stumble or two our first day--couldn't figure out TV access and our car got stuck in the mud--and for both Audrey was quick to respond, talking us through TV access on the phone and coming over to see the car situation and then to help us find someone to tow us out. She even offered to bring us back something for dinner! The accommodations were reasonably priced and were beyond our expectations--clean, well-lit, and spacious. We went to Auburn because it was a great location for the Eclipse, and it was an excellent choice--near several places where groups could gather to watch the eclipse, and otherwise a pleasant location for hikes, restaurants, shopping and the fabulous Suffragist museum in nearby Seneca Falls. We hadn't been to the Finger Lakes area, but we're glad we went...great cheesemaking and good New York wineries! Who Knew?"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is great! Nice part of town and in the middle of everything I needed. Very peaceful and comfortable stay. Thank you Audrey!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"we arrived at midnight and it was difficult to find as the address on the house says ""333"" and only 1 number on the mailbox can be seen at night. we looked for the water but only saw a pond at the next door neighbors property.
other than those, this place was great! my wife and I both work from home and had no issues with the wifi.
truly loved the place and will be back."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Audrey was wonderfully responsive every time we had a question. The place was roomy and very comfortable. Slow down as you approach the place if you’re coming from “downtown” Auburn- the number on one side of the mailbox is tough to see.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very peaceful and quiet. Location was great, 15 minutes from so much"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Audrey's place was amazing. Felt right at home and was able to relax before my big competition (placed 1st).
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place in a safe location. I grew up in Auburn and was visiting from California so when booking I was determined to find something in a safe part of town and this area is one of the best. The place was clean and Audrey was very responsive. The only downside was hearing every step made upstairs which wouldn’t have been much of a bother except for the fact that my internal clock in 3 hrs behind and still wanted to be sleeping at 8am. The place stays very toasty and has a very homey feel to it. I’d stay again the next time I’m in town.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Just like the pictures! Great price! Audrey very responsive and attentive! Had a great time!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding. Location was close to Downtown. Apt was very clean, comfortable and quiet. Appreciated that coffee was available.

Thank you Audrey."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We recommend this place to anyone!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really loved Audrey’s place. It was exactly as described. Definitely was a very centralized location with everything no more than 10 minutes away.

I had a minor hiccup with my dates and she was really flexible with it. Overall 10/10 experience. Thank you again Audrey!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Apartment was very spacious and comfortable. Very well equiped kitchen. Very quiet at back of house. River was at end of long back yard with no seating to make the most of the location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful time
Everything was clean and comfortable. Audrey was more than accommodating when we made an error on our checkout date. It was our fault and she was very understanding and considerate. Would certainly stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, quiet, and comfortable place to stay. Great communication from Audrey, the check-in and check-out process was easy and flexible.

Our favorite part was waking up and having coffee in the beautiful sunroom and out on the dock. The décor is lovely and we loved the touches he included of his personal life and local area. On top of all of that, he was extremely prompt, helpful, and clear in his communications. We only wish we could have stayed longer. Definitely one of the best AirBnb experiences we've had!"

There were so many little touches that made for an excellent stay: comfortable bed and furniture; quality linens; well-appointed kitchen; wonderful stove/oven; local information; reading materials; chairs and a fire pit down by the river…I could go on and on! Plus, Tony was warm and welcoming, a great communicator and eager to share local recommendations.
Auburn is a wonderful town, too. Close to many, many sights and attractions - Finger Lakes, wine tasting, waterfalls and hikes, Erie Canal exploration and historical parks and museums. We also enjoyed the great farmers market on Wednesday afternoon - don’t miss it if you are in town on that day!
Just a couple of things to note, but don’t let these deter you from booking: the apartment is small, but very comfortable for one or two people and the fire department across the street calls its volunteers with a loud siren, which seems to go off once or twice a day. Again, these things did not take away from our five star experience at Tony’s, but future guests may want to be aware.
We’ve stayed at dozens of Airbnbs this year while on a cross-country road trip and Tony’s place is one of our favorites! Strongly recommend - book now if it’s available!"

It was easy to park and access the place; Tony provided detailed instructions before we arrived and then the welcome note and visitor's guides were readily available. The kitchen was well stocked and the bed was comfortable.
We loved the back yard and the sunporch and enjoyed both in the evening after all the wineries in the area closed. We were glad to not find a TV in the space, but rather a computer with a large monitor so we could stream a movie we had meaning to watch.
It was a great place and when we're back in the area, we'll definitely stay here again."

Tony was very responsive in providing information that we needed. I wish we could have spent more time at this great location. Thanks again Tony for your hospitality.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Tony’s place was excellent. My wife, daughter and I decided to get away for a long weekend in the Finger Lakes. It rained the first night so my wife and I stayed in and enjoyed listening to the storm in the sunroom with a nice bottle of wine. The next morning, we headed down to the lake which is right in the backyard to enjoy the view with a hot cup of coffee. We attempted to fish off of the dock with no luck. Although we did see giant trout hanging out nearby. The place is immaculate. The bed is very comfortable and the shower feels like you are in a hot thunderstorm. Tony and Lisa are very attentive. We highly recommend this place."

I was traveling for business long-term, and wanted somewhere to stay that would be more comfortable than a hotel. The driveway was shoveled early even during a large storm, allowing me to get on the road and to work with no trouble. The home was very nice and I enjoyed my stay. Would recommend to anyone in the area!"

Cleanest we have ever experienced, every amenity you could want for a short or long term stay, beautiful backyard view and very accessible.

Tony offered great suggestions for local food and drink that definitely didn't disappoint. We will stay there again, hopefully in the much nearer future!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony and Lisa must have taken the Ritz Carlton hospitality training course. They went over and above to make sure we were well taken care of. Their communication was top notch and they provided us with quick answers to every question we had.
We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary in Athens attending a museum opening. While Lisa and Tony were not in command of the weather, we were able to spend a wet rainy day hanging out in our cute comfortable apartment overlooking the river. The autumn colors and light were beautiful and very private. The apartment was so well appointed that we could have stayed there very comfortably for weeks- the kitchen was well decked out and big enough to cook meals. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay at this airbnb. They have truly earned their superhost commendation."

The apartment was a delight...beautifully furnished, tasteful and stylish. Everything was spanking clean and well appointed. The bed was so comfortable with lovely linens. There was even fresh half 'n half in the frig for our morning coffee! The setting was so nice and very convenient to restaurants, a park and to the wedding venue we were in town for.

Comfortable, clean and felt very private. Great parking.
Communicated
with the host and his niece Lisa Via text and their response time was quick! Lisa (Via text) was attentative asking if all was well and let us know what was going on that weekend locally.
They left a list of suggestions of places to eat (we went to 2 for dinner, it was only a weekend) and they were wonderful! Also they had borchures for places to see in the Fingerlakes.
I like that they had a couple of pillows to pick from for sleep and the bed was very comfortable.
Next time we go we plan to bring our kayaks to launch from the backyard!
Definitely would recommend Tony's place!!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful drive through rolling pastures and farms to arrive at this charming cottage apartment. A beautiful view from the unique sun room down the expansive yard to the canal. We dropped our kayaks in and had a lovely paddle each day down the gently flowing waterway with lily pads and a gorgeous heron out to Lake Owasco. The location allows for convenient travel to downtown Auburn and the charming adjacent Skaneateles Lake. We were also close enough to make a quick visit to Ithaca. Make sure you visit the Auburn Diner for an abundant meal and share the local morning gathering spot.

The setting is an attractive spot on an inlet and includes a back yard. All of the amenities are provided and access to Auburn is easy. The host was very attentive. He provided advance information on activities and also advice on restaurants and local events. He communicated with us to assure easy arrival and checked on our comfort while we were there. This is a particularly good choice of lodging when visiting the finger lakes.

We'd definitely stay here again!"

We enjoyed the special features such as the gourmet coffee and tea choices, great kitchen cooking space, and stylish decor. The space has beautiful and unique decor pieces that make this place stand out from your typical home. The sunroom is such a great space to enjoy day and night. We made a fire in the firepit down by the river (firewood provided by Tony) and observed the local wildlife. We would absolutely come back, even for a longer period of time."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony’s apartment was just lovely! Sparkling clean with nice touches such as coffee, tea and cream. The location was perfect for exploring the Finger Lakes region.

Also the neighborhood around the house is very quaint and conveniently close to charming Auburn."

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great spot - my partner and I booked it as a home base for a Finger Lakes getaway week, and couldn't have been happier. Riverfront property, a waterside firepit that was thoughtfully pre-stacked with tinder, full kitchen with every kind of cookware you need, a beautiful sunroom...the list goes on. It was the kind of Airbnb rental you really wanted to spend time relaxing in. Lisa and Tony are an excellent host team, very clear with communication and I know they would have been there to help out quickly with any issues - of course, there were none, due to their extremely thoughtful planning! And thanks Lisa for the tip about Treman park! High recommend and will return to if we are back in the area."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely decor and great sheets on bed.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location that offers private spaces with nice views. The hosts are exceptional communicators that make sure you have everything you need. Multiple units are on the property, so families can stay together, but have separate places to retreat too also."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony's places was so wonderful. We really enjoyed the fact that we were right by the water with a fire pit.
Everything you need is already at the house and if you need anything else it's a very quick trip to get any thing.
Tony was very thoughtful and quick to respond to any of our needs.
Highly recommend staying here and I will absolutely be returning in the future"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not a long winded writer so don’t take this short note as a knock against Tony. Clean house, amazing location, quick responses and in-Home iPhone charger. Which is hilarious bc both my girlfriend and I forgot ours.
5 stars - would definitely recommend."

The kitchen was great for cooking breakfast and a larger scale dinner of Beef Bourguignon, the bed was incredibly comfortable and clean, and the cozy, well decorated home made our stay at the finger lakes all the more fantastic. Would highly recommend Tony's place to anyone looking for a finger lakes trip and a weekend getaway."
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is verynice private apartment in a quiet residential neighborhood. Easy access to and from the property to routes outside the city. Communication with Tony and Lisa was excellent. When we had some minor issues, they responded promptly, and were helpful. We recommend this airbnb property."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tony's place went so far beyond my expectations I was blown away. The pictures on Airbnb don't do it justice--the place is impeccable furnished and appointed. The furnishings are beautiful without being gaudy and fit the cozy space perfectly. Everything looks relatively new but has a ton of character and is clearly picked out with love and attention to detail. The layout, bed linens, hotel linens, soaps, lotions, etc, are all high-end hotel-quality and made up and folded by someone who is very good at housekeeping :) The kitchen has an awesome stove and even copper-plated pots! All the plates and silverware match (this is something I think more Airbnb hosts should pay attention to) and the kitchen is stocked with everything you could need to cook a fabulous meal (spices, tongs, butter, sprays, etc) except for the main dish of course.
The solarium/sun room is especially lovely and clean and must be fabulous during a storm (though we didn't get to experience that during our stay). The weather was great for us and we got to instead enjoy the outdoor brick grill which was stocked with charcoal and lighter fluid, then got to enjoy a perfect bonfire only feet from the water and the private dock. We even got to feed the duckies :)
Tony and Lisa were extremely prompt and thorough in their communication too!
I really can't think of anything Tony and Lisa could have done better and hope to have the time to take off and spend there again soon!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony's place stood out in the listings and was every bit as wonderful in person. From the colorful, mid-century modern design to the delightful combination of vintage charm with modern conveniences, the cottage is a place with real soul that we felt privileged to spend some time in. Communication was a breeze and Tony provided excellent guidance on things to do (and eat!) in the area. A real highlight though was a simple one: spending lazy morning time on the beautiful enclosed porch. Overall a highlight among our airbnb travels to date. We look forward to returning in the future!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony's place was a much more comfortable option for my husband's and my recent wedding weekend than a hotel would have been. We had plenty of space, a very comfortable bed, great music on the iMac that was available for our use, privacy, a pretty view to the water....I could go on and on. Our stay was problem free and Tony had restaurant suggestions, plenty of informative on the area, coffee, half & half, kitchen basics, etc. Great place to stay!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as pictured and described. Host and cohost very communicative and check in/out was a breeze. Property size was perfect for a single traveler. Will stay there again!
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a quiet weekend near the Finger Lakes. The place was nicely appointed and well-stocked.

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures online don't do the apartment justice...it is beyond expectations!!! The apartment was very clean, quaint and comfortable. I wished we had more time to sit near the water and build a small campfire. But we did make time to sit in the enclosed porch to drink our morning coffee and read the news. Both Tony and Lisa (co-host) made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The promptly answered our questions in a timely manner. I highly recommend this place without hesitation!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tony's place was clean & homey. His communication was excellent and he provided thorough details about the home, neighborhood and other amenities available to us.

Thanks for a great stay!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tony's place is totally dreamy! We had an amazing stay in Auburn at his place. His kitchen is fully stocked, so we decided to stay in and cook at the apartment. The sun room is especially lovely. We saw two deer while we were enjoying our coffee. Lisa helped us with check in and check out and she was really easy to communicate with. The Finger Lakes are a beautiful region in upstate NY and I highly recommend you stay at Tony's place when you visit!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location in a quiet neighborhood, very convenient to the Merry Go Round Theater. Tony is very responsive in communicating and an excellent host, the house was immaculate and rooms in good order with fully equipped kitchen and bath.

My husband and I were in town for a wedding and while we did not spend too much time at the apartment, I wish we could have as it was adorable and well appointed! The photos don't actually do it justice. The bed was amazingly comfortable and where most Airbnbs fail me, this one won with flying colors.... good sheets, down pillows and comforters and plush towels for the win!!!! We did not arrive until almost 1 am but Lisa was available by text to make sure we made it in okay. We slept like rocks thanks to the comforts of Tony's apartment. Thanks so much!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is unbelievable! The pictures don't do it justice. The apartment is large, decorated beautifully, and very clean. The backyard was amazing!

Communication with Tony about check in and check out was excellent. Everything is as described. It's definitely a good value.
2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Tony's place was quiet, private, clean, and beautifully decorated.

2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. It was hard to tear us away from the beautiful view on the porch, and when we did we were conveniently close to town.

2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An Airbnb gem!
Gorgeous setting, great kitchen. Stellar job all around.
Great renovation of the cottage, I appreciated the attention to detail, the wonderful fixtures and sumptuous linens. Also, adequate lighting is often a shortcoming, but that was also done well. Can't say enough good things."
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is perfect for every season. I am nestled on the couch looking over the water with snow in the trees and can imagine myself enjoying coffee in the morning on the enclosed porch in the summer. Exceptional communication and fantastic attention to detail!

We were only disappointed that we didn't know about his place earlier in the summer season."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I never actually met the host, however the communication was excellent. The place was exactly as described, nestled on a lightly wooded lot with a river at the far end. It was clean and smelled fresh, with well thought out necessities."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at Tony's fabulous apartment! It was cozy and clean, and we loved how close we were to the water, which was right in the back yard. We used the kitchen, which was very well-stocked, and also enjoyed lounging in the sun-room when it was a bit too cold to go outside, but too nice to stay inside. The apartment was a great base to explore wineries, nearby towns, and hiking trails. Although we never met Tony or Lisa, they were both very accessible by phone, and Lisa suggested that we visit a State Park that we really enjoyed. Check-in and out were both a breeze. We hope to be back!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience trying out Airbnb and it was absolutely perfect! We made our trip a mini getaway after our wedding day and it fully succeeded our expectations. It was in a great location with the village 5 mins away, the lake 5 mins away and close to other neat places like Skaneatlas. It's located in a tranquil location, and very relaxing with the river in the backyard, and far from the street (no traffic noise :-)). We will definitely be back!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tony was a great host and attentive to everything. Place was beautifully decorated with some great art. Compact apartment is perfect for two people. Nice bike ride around Owasco Lake right out the door
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, private apartment semi-attached to a larger home. Right near the lake and the wine tasting region. We enjoyed the history of the region more than expected, especially the Seward House. Nice touches and details in the place. Suitable for a couple looking for lower prices than a hotel and a larger space."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Derek’s. He was responsive and friendly. The room was clean and had all the amenities we needed.
We highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Stay. I'm from the area originally and had easy access to Auburn, Skaneateles, Fillmore Glen State Park and other locales I like to visit. The studio was comfortable and provided all I needed in a quiet, restful setting. Would book again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great! So glad to be surprised in a good way by and Air bnb. The mattress was divine! The whole place was quirky and cute and clean.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for having us! We enjoyed staying here. It’s worked great for our 1 night stay with our family.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Derek’s spot was so cozy and perfect for a night stay. Loved spending the night with my family and will definitely book again if I’m back in the area!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,No dedicated path with safe surface from parking area to unit door. Must walk on grass up a hill. Inconvenient or even dangerous if grass is wet (which it was) carrying heavy bags. I wouldn't want to do this if the grass was snowy or frosty.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great resting spot while exploring Auburn for the weekend! Super easy to find, and very comfortable after a long day of travel."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and comfy

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Auburn with a very private apartment right above the garage. The place was clean and accessible, just watch your head if, like me or my friend, are over 6 ft tall as the ceiling is low in some places. However, we had a great time here and would stay here again"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great little place to stay for a few nights! Would return!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It was such a peaceful and quiet place, with everything we needed. It felt like home! The view was beautiful and the bedside window provided a wonderful breeze; it was so lovely to have a yard to sit in with coffee in the mornings. The privacy was really nice. Derek and Luga were very responsive and friendly, and we'd love to return to this AirBnb next time we are in the area. There were plenty of linens and towels, as well as coffee and cutlery - they even provided paper plates for easy cleanup. Plenty of books and an easy SmartTV with wifi. We looked forward to coming back here after days visiting with family. Thank you for a relaxing and easy stay!!! It was exactly as pictured, and clean as a whistle."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for the night! Used it as a place to stay during our vacation/road trip. Lots to do in the surrounding areas and a pretty view from the room. While we didn’t use the fire pit, it was in a very peaceful yard and would have been a great place to sit out at night."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This air bnb was a perfect find for a one night stay for my boyfriend and I. We had a wedding to attend at Emerson Park Pavilion, and Derek’s place was only 5 minutes away. The space was clean and just the right size for 2 people. Derek was friendly and offered any help if we needed it. After check-out on the way home we stopped at a winery. Overall a great stay for us!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at Prison City Lofts! We were greeted by a quaint little Christmas tree and cheerful gnome.
The Loft was beautifully decorated with all of the amenities you could ask for. We walked to dinner and then made a quick trip to Wegmans, the greatest grocery store in the world 😉
Thank you, Dawn! We will be back!"

Loved it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft is a nice and cozy place. The host is very responsible.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked dawn's loft 1 while staying overnight for a wedding. Parking was available onstreet. All the lofts are up a flight stairs or 2 (not really handicap friendly). The space is exactly like pictures, just BEAUTIFUL! Checkin was easy via keypad. We had a restful sleep and enjoyed coffee via keurig in the morning next to the fireplace. Wegmans is up the road for any last minute items you need. Some dining options in auburn but not a ton to do. Venture 10min to nearby skaneateles for a bit more to do. This was probably the nicest airbnb we have stayed in."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft 1 was an absolutely perfect place to stay in Auburn. It was clean, comfortable, and had the perfect level of decor and amenities to feel a sense of home away from home. Host was proactive with instructions and responsive to questions. Overall, a great stay and I definitely recommend it if you are staying in Auburn."

Dawn and her staff were so helpful with any issue that we had."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Everything was just as described, super comfortable, and surprisingly quiet given the location."

100% would stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at the Prison City Lofts for two nights and it was a great stay. It was easy to find and parking was convenient and as described in the listing. Inside, everything was very clean and accurate from the photos provided. Check in and check out instructions were clear and Dawn responded promptly when I reached out with a question on the self check in process. We felt right at home at Loft #1 and would not hesitate to recommend to others looking for a place to stay in Auburn. We would certainly stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had - the unit was beautiful, spacious, clean and exactly as pictured. Dawn also gave clear and easy instructions on how to enter the unit, as well as where to park. Highly recommend for anyone looking to spend time in the Auburn area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect getaway for the two of us. Plenty of room, comfortable, and interesting places to eat right nearby (highly recommend the Buffalo chicken pierogis at Prison City Brewery)."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dawn’s location was perfect for our visit to Auburn for a Friday night wedding. So impressed with the decor and comfort of the bed. Had a comfortable night sleep. Air conditioned throughout. Everything needed for a great stay away from home. We wish we could have spent more time at Dawn’s Prison City Lofts. Thank you Dawn for accommodating out early arrival we greatly appreciated that!! When in Auburn this a is must stay with lots to do in area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, well appointed , like photos. Only stayed one night for quick trip to Syracuse but wanted to be close to Skaneateles to spend the day walking around and enjoying the shops. Very close proximity. Auburn cute as well! As a solo traveler, felt safe and enjoyed the accommodations and location."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice loft in a central location. Checking was smooth and easy. A wasn't working, but most likely due to the filters dealing with Canadian Wildfires."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We did not stay here long but it was very nice and the bed was comfortable. It was our wedding night and we will definitely stay here again for sure. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable apartment in a great location with many restaurants and amenities within walking distance. Because it’s on the second floor, mobility is a must."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great Place in Downtown Auburn . Close walk to bars , restaurants , theaters and breweries."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay! Right in the middle of downtown! No noise and very peaceful! Having an ice cream shop steps away was epic! We will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very clean, exactly what we needed for the weekend. great location right downtown."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great spot to explore the Finger Lakes and access great breweries and restaurants on foot.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly this is a great place to stay and so worth the price. Like a lot of other reviews stated, the loft was clean. I am a stickler for this and always bring my own everything from cleaning products to linens, wash clothes and towels. Barely had to use my cleaning products. The place wasn't even dusty! I also like the location too, right near Wegmans and restaurants and bars. Loved that! Literally the only complaint was that I texted the host before leaving NC to let her know I would be arriving to the property in the evening and to get more instructions. She never replied to my email. However, she did send a very detailed email to me with instructions, so I'm assming she got my text and that was my reply. Anyway, I highly recommend this place. Comfy, cozy and lots of apps on the TV! Enjoy!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place to stay in downtown Auburn. Walkable to many restaurants and bars. Place was very spacious.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dawn was super flexible with our check in time as we were arriving in after a long drive. This place is identical to what you see in the photos! Quiet and very clean! If we go back to Auburn we will definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at the lofts before and both of the spaces are great! Clean, convenient and close to everything you need. Dawn does a great job with the lofts. I will for sure be staying again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dawn’s place is great! Very clean and comfortable with lots of thoughtful touches. We had a very cozy stay and will definitely book again on our next trip to Auburn!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dawns place was absolutely perfect! I stayed there for my wedding weekend, and used the space for my bridal party to get ready the day of the wedding. It was the perfect layout. Very open and spacious, plus decorated so nicely! The location is perfect. Walkable to wegmans and plenty of restaurants. There was an issue with the heat, but Dawn and her husband responded right away. Before I knew it, Dawns husband was at the door to fix the issue! I can’t recommend this space enough."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and will come back .
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little stay in an adorable town! It was great dang everything was waking distance and the loft was super cozy!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was great! Very clean and comfortable. Good location. Would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was great! The Loft was clean, comfortable with a modern vibe. There are plenty of places within walking distance to grab a bite and a beer. There is also a Wegmans at the end of the block. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an Airbnb in Auburn."
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place to stay DT with easy access to food and amenities. The apartment was cute, simple, spacious and had all the amenities you need to be comfortable. I was frustrated to pay a cleaning fee in addition to an already expensive stay to show up to dirty bed sheets which is why my rating dropped to a 3 star. I did address this with host who apologized and would recommend this stay otherwise."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place! Clean, comfy, and communication with the host was great. Easy parking, check in and out. Would recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Extremely spacious, clean, and modern loft apartment directly in the center of all that downtown Auburn has to offer! The theater is visible right across the street and coffee shops, restaurants, historic sites, and supermarket is within a quick walking distance. Really felt at home and wish I had more time to spend here!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to tour the Finger Lakes and rest at the end of your day. Photos are accurate and the space is clean. The entrance is above a shop which was never a problem, but the entrance staircase is steep, so be aware if you have mobility issues."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect home base during my stay in the area. Great location, clean, comfortable and beautiful property. Thanks Dawn!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful! Check in was smooth, and Dawn was easily reachable with questions. We truly enjoyed our stay!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, right in the heart of Auburn. Loft is super cute, very comfy and spacious! Dawn was an outstanding host."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was just what we needed while we were in town for a friend’s wedding. Dawn was very flexible with some unforeseen hiccups and needs on our end. We had requested a change in our check-in day a few months ahead but unfortunately, it didn’t reach Dawn in time for that change to be granted. Given our need for some last minute changes (traveling for out of town weddings sometimes leads to these), faster communication would’ve made the trip a little less stressful. In the end though, it all worked out— thanks to Dawn’s flexibility and openness to the changes. The space is absolutely gorgeous. We were very comfortable and enjoyed our time there. It was quiet and private. We will definitely stay again if we’re back in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rented this loft to get ready for my vow renewal and it was absolutely beautiful. Very spacious!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! The apartment is super cute and in a great location. Parking is a little tough. If you plan on exploring more than just downtown Auburn and you don’t have a car it’s hard to get a Lyft/Uber.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in Dawn’s Auburn loft! The space is very chic and felt more like an upscale hotel. It’s also much more spacious than we realized and is very well decorated and extremely comfortable. The location can’t be beat—right on Genesee St. aka the Main Street of Auburn, so it’s very close to restaurants, bars, and attractions. We arrived late on a Sunday, so not much was open, but luckily the Airbnb is located right next to a great Chinese restaurant! Overall a great stay as we were passing through!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice airbnb dawn was a great host
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, and just as advertised! Great place to stay"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place in an excellent location!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I'm not even sure where to begin. It's been my experience over the years that most places don't exactly live up to their posted photos. That is certainly NOT the case here. This rental is as amazing as the pictures. It's this simple - this was the best location we have ever stayed at. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Everything was spot-on (cleanliness, interior decor, location, etc). Even the mattress was comfortable... which was a welcome surprise because most rentals 'cheap out' when it comes to using a quality mattress."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a MUST if you are wanting to stay in Auburn or stay just outside Skaneateles! The place was spotless, well appointed with tons of space to spread out. The fireplace was a nice touch and the bathroom was quite nice. I agree that it is even better than the pictures. The location is right downtown, which includes all the sounds, conversations and characters one might expect in an urban environment. However, it is perfectly quiet in the back bedroom for sleeping.
One thing to be aware of is that the entrance door is on stairs and does not have a landing so if you have any physical limitations, you will face an issue of accessibility."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place! The entrance up to the lofts is snuggled right between a little shop and ice cream parlor - super cute and fun! Parking is right outside on the street. The loft is clean, airy, and cozy. We enjoyed the modern amenities in the bathroom and kitchen. The bed/bedding and couch are both very comfortable. Even the bath towels were very soft. The tv in the bedroom and living room were both great for late-night shows. It was a hot weekend outside and the loft stayed perfectly cool thanks to the built-in LG ac system. Nice view of the little town out the tall front windows. A great location!!! There are things to do in Auburn, but we went to Skaneateles for a wedding and to swim in the lake and have dinner. Syracuse is not super far either if you want to check out the college town."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone has already said it! Dawn's place is amazing. super cozy, spacious, easy parking, check-in. We will be coming back for sure in the winter."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous apartments that are stunning and so comfortable. Everything you could wish for in an Airbnb. Centrally located within Auburn and surrounded by some great bars, restaurants, supermarkets & shops. Looking forward to coming again in October for my grandson’s 2nd birthday so hopefully there’ll have availability, ‘cos I’ll definitely be back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place smack dab in the middle of Auburn! Very clean loft, that came with a lot of amenities! Definitely will come back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Prison City Lofts in Auburn was a fantastic place. Not only was it very clean, but it was also very comfortable. Dawn was easy to reach if there were any questions or concerns."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We ended up having to cancel last minute due to an emergency with a friend and Dawn was very understanding and communicative which was appreciated.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked the one bedroom for our wedding weekend. The unit is absolutely beautiful!! It is spacious and has everything you could need. We had five of us getting ready and there was plenty of room. It was the perfect setting for pictures of us getting ready. I would highly recommend this if you are looking to stay somewhere in Auburn. The location is great and the host was great as well. She responded quickly to a question we had and was very accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft exceeded expectations! We love that it felt like a little home away from home. The place was super clean and decorated so nicely. The lofts are also super close to the restaurants in town and we really enjoyed being steps away from Prison City Brewery! We’ll definitely be back again to enjoy this cozy and beautiful AirBnb!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dawn was great easy to work with and very accommodating, had friends staying at the Hilton Inn and Lofts were superior to them in all ways size, atmosphere, and location you walk out the door and everything is a fingertip away. Thank You"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Dawn’s place! We were in town for a wedding and spent two nights. It was even better than the photos - immaculately clean and very updated. The air conditioners made it extremely comfortable. We had all of the necessities, and it was only a couple blocks walk from Wegmans to grab any groceries etc. Dawn noted that the parking garage was being renovated, so we parked on the street and had no issue (it looks as though it may be paid parking but we didn’t pay and did not get a ticket all weekend). The stairs are steep for carrying up luggage (we managed, but just something to keep in mind if stairs are difficult for you). Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was impeccably clean and comfortable. We had a great stay and would come again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is walking distance to many things, including Wegman's grocery store (smaller delivery charge ^-^ yay). Super cozy and comfortable. Fresh feel to the decor/design. The kitchen is great, made all my meals and enjoyed the natural light streaming in from the street facing windows. The lighting was something I really enjoyed-warm and dimmable. If you really don't like the people above you walking, it is a notable possibility. The floors were a little creaky, but at least you'll know if someone is coming for you! AAh! Just kidding ( that was joke). But seriously, I'd for sure stay here again. Thumbs up. COOL SPOT! (out of the bedroom windows you could (if permissible) go onto the roof and enjoy the color changes of sunrise/sunset, also good info in case you're a super hero and need a place to change into disguise before flying off) ^-^"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Loft #1 is a wonderful place located in the heart of downtown and the finger lakes region. This place is very spacious open and updated excellent for short or long term stays. Place is very clean, has everything included all you need to do is fill the fridge.
Great job Dawn 🙏🏼
Thanks

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute cozy place to stay! So close to many little breweries and shops. 10 minutes to Skaneateles which was perfect for our weekend. Would highly recommend Dawns place to family and friends
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"the entire place was a very beautiful spot. if you're a chef like myself and needed a big kitchen/island to cook or prep, this is a place I recommend, even if you're just in town looking to stay. there are plenty of things to do in the area"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and clean! You have everything you would need and then some. We stayed here to be close to Skaneateles and the Seneca wine trail. Dawn gave clear check in instructions and was available at any time if need be. We had a great stay! Definitely consider staying here if you plan to visit the finger lake region."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place was adorable and in the perfect location. I love the decor and the kitchen was great. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the water in the bathroom sink wasn't working so we had to use the kitchen sink and the heat wasn't on at all when we arrived so it was really cold for a bit. It warmed up pretty fast and we overall really loved out stay. Thank you Dawn!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Super clean & modern. Highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really loved my stay here! The place is HUGE and modern and very clean. The photos don’t do the place justice.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful spot and a great location!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely and restful spot on a long road trip - thank you!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dawn’s place was just as advertised: clean, up-to-date amenities, and in a prime location. We’ll definitely consider staying here again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space to stay in. Open, stylish, very clean, quiet and cozy... even with an open design. The bedroom is at the back of the loft, so it was easy to sleep in and get away from someone else who might want to watch TV in the open loft space. Great location with Prison City Brewing around the corner (a must stop if you're in Auburn.) Dawn was excellent with communication as well. Will be staying here again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place with great amenities. Awesome location and incredible aesthetic. Clearly newly renovated, so everything is pristine. Super comfortable, and a lot of space! The host was considerate and had great communication."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was absolutely my favorite Airbnb stay I’ve ever had. Dawn was great: had very clear communication and was very helpful. The place was so beautiful and clean, and exactly what we expected. Location was perfect! We will definitely be returning."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-appointed, stylish, comfortable space with a downtown vibe for couples or singles looking to visit the Finger Lakes region. Dawn was a responsive and thoughtful host and the apartment had everything I needed for a quiet retreat. The kitchen is amazing- perfect for assembling farmers market finds. Loved the electric fireplace after a day out in the chilly November air. Auburn is a great jumping off point for day trips to Skeneateles, Aurora and Seneca Falls. Things to note: the apartment is on a main street so overnight parking is a block away in a parking garage. Also, steepish staircase is a tad tricky for large suitcases. Overall, great place to stay, though!"
,,,We never stayed after we saw the place. Tried to call landlord… voice mail never answered. I asked for a refund… no reply.
,,,"Good afternoon, when I first got there I was there for maybe about 15 minutes and left . The next day I came back I walked around and looked I seen the host couldn’t keep his word with the cleaning products after I asked multiple times and he said that it was provided. Secondly, the host left dirty towels out along with the last guest food in the drawer didn’t even check to see if he got rid of everything. Third, I walked into the kitchen and by the microwave and the kitchen sink there were bugs , bugs in the cleaning supplies I had to buy bugs on the counter tops and I felt that was really nasty had to ask Entomologists what they were . The sheets were washed properly had stuff on the side of it . The stove barley works . The host communication. Sucks he responds on his time and if it isn’t urgently he doesn’t respond at all . The area is decent not to much traffic or commotion going on . Honestly I feel the host needs to do better and trying to keep the customers happy"
,,,"Richard responded quickly to our calls. As I told Richard this apt is best for younger people and he needs more information in his description. The apt is in a sketchy neighborhood, It is located in the back of the building, which is very dark. The stairs to reach the apartment is very steep and narrow and hard to climb for older people. The beds are in poor shape one you can feel the springs. The other one is very hard. The sheets are old. The comforters are very thin and old. I called Richard to say the apt was cold and the beds were hard for us to sleep on & requested a refund. He said he couldn’t give us a refund
b/c we didn’t like the beds 😳. He was annoyed that we didn’t read the information about the lock box online. And that my husband called on my behave. We are not computer savvy. But I wasn’t going to argue with him. Of course we left and went to a hotel. I feel he should give us the refund. If we knew more about this place we would not have rented it. Thank you"

,,,"If you value privacy and peace this is not the place for you! Before I booked I asked Tony if I could Bring my 12 lb service dog, he said yes! I flew in late Thursday night, could not even find the place in the dark, no clear numbers on the mailbox. Once inside it was a little worn, old area rugs, old mattress, loud dog next door. The next day I was on a work call & my dog was on the sunporch where there is an old rug by the door with tassels on the end, she put the tassels in her mouth for a 2 seconds and I went in there and picked her up, I noticed Tony looking through the window with a dirty look. A few minutes later I received a text from him about Ellie and the rug. It made me very uncomfortable that he was looking in the windows, creeped me out! Then later that day when I get back he proceeded to stand on the roof with a leaf blower, very loud, doing yard work, could not walk my dog there. I then booked a flight home a day early, he obviously didn't want a dog there but took my $"
