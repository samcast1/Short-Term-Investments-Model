We spent time around the island playing card games and laughed our butts off. We went outside and took in the view of the lake. We cooked a hearty breakfast in the gorgeous and heavily supplied kitchen. We ate dinner at ‚ÄúWings and Rings‚Äù where we also enjoyed a delicious birthday cake they happily allowed us to bring in.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome house, everything was very clean and well appointed. Nothing missing from the kitchen to the living room to the bedrooms.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I took his parents for a long weekend getaway beside the water at Casey's lovely home. We had a fantastic time sitting in the gazebo enjoying the view and playing games at the big, well-lit table in the sunroom. Everything was exactly as pictured with an updated living room and kitchen, fabulous walk-in shower, big smart tvs in the living room and each bedroom, and extremely comfortable bedding. The check-in process was seamless. We did some light cooking for breakfasts and found everything we needed to prepare our meals. There was no shortage of fluffy towels and kitchen towels. Casey was responsive and so good to work with us when we asked for a late checkout. The property itself was attractive with trees and blooming roses in the yard. The location itself was wonderful in that, while it was off the beaten path, it was close enough to town for take-out or a quick trip to the store for anything we might have forgotten. The layout of the house was ideal for anyone with mobility issues. There were only two steps into the house and a gentle slope along a path with pavers to the picnic table and gazebo seating in the back yard. The fact that everything inside is located on one level made things so much easier for the older people in our party. We had an amazing stay at Casey's place and hope to be able to visit again in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is a wonderful place to stay. So peaceful and very comfortable beds. We have been here before and will definitely be back.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blackbeard's Bungalow was the perfect Airbnb for our needs. It was spotlessly clean, really spacious, and had everything we could possibly need. We really loved the outdoor space, and, as nature-lovers, seeing the birds in the garden and around the lake was a particular highlight. We weren't blessed with the best weather but we really enjoyed a visit to Cumberland Falls. Casey responded immediately when I had a question, and kindly checked-in with us when she heard there'd been a tornado in the area. We'd happily stay again. Thank you!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time at Casey's home. It's in a beautiful location and is a luxury high-end home. The home is located on a dead end street so there was very little traffic. The neighbors are super friendly and welcomed us to the neighborhood. The screened in porch was our favorite part of the house and we sent a lot of time enjoying the views. There is a train that is close by and runs every 20 minutes but we didn't really noticed it that much. The home is located only few minutes from US 27 where almost everything is located. The town of Somerset is really nice and people are SUPER friendly and will make you feel welcome. You can order Doordash and most pizza places will deliver to the house. There is a great indoor/outdoor flea market only a few minutes away and is worth a look. Make sure to check out Cumberland Falls State Park for some breathtaking views.

-All three rooms are spacious and well equipped with tvs and furniture.
-DoorDash delivers about anything from
Town and we even had Walmart deliver a pack and play for our daughter. So the cities close enough to get what you want and need.

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This beautifully appointed vacation home offers the perfect get-away, especially is you want one-level with few stairs. It's location is so close to so much fun and nature, but you may want to just cozy up and relax in it's comfort. The host is very welcoming and makes it easy to access.

There is a washer and dryer - and that was a huge ‚Äúwin‚Äù for us! We traveled from AZ & have been gone 8 days - the laundry room made it simple to stay on top of our clothes and not overpack!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. The house was clean and comfortable and just as described. The driveway was a little tight, as we had a boat, but it was do-able. Also, the back yard has a very steep drop off to the water. Not a big deal, but we had to be extra careful with our 1 year old. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house and decor. Great location for the lake. If you are bringing a boat with you, try to plan on leaving it in a slip at the lake or parking out of the driveway or another location‚Ä¶. The driveway is pretty steep to pull a boat in and out of."

Casey was very quick to respond to any question or need we had! Definitely could have stayed longer and hope to return!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Casey was a great host. We especially Enjoyed the well stock kitchen. We left a Rooster Omelette Pan to keep the great d√©cor going! We had a little trouble working the TVs. Couldn't play Play station so we just ended up watching a DVD. But overall good experience.

This is an amazing place. Super clean, great amenities, great host, and beautiful views. We loved having this as our HQ for a week whilst exploring KY. You def want to stay here! Note to boaters, We have a full 4 door cab truck and 20' boat and the driveway is a little tight for anything really long and on a hill so if you have a big setup be prepared. Really close to anything you need and overall an amazing place."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was my first time renting airbnb and it was a little difficult for me and i was expecting to be disappointed honestly but the home was amazing. instantly felt at home and it was perfect for the reunion i had with my childhood best friend and my brother and sister who drove all the way from South Carolina just to spend the weekend with me for my birthday. the accommodations were perfect, the showers were heaven sent, and the keurig was a life saver. unfortunately we weren‚Äôt able to go visit local places due to the weather, but we stayed up till 2-3 AM doing art crafts and watching Survivor and reminiscing on our childhood and the second day we played ‚ÄúAmong Us‚Äù in real life. (10/10 would recommend)
also, i didn‚Äôt use it, but there was a cute little dispenser for body was and shampoo/conditioner in the showers and i didn‚Äôt know so i brought my own stuff but i just thought that was super neat and nifty and convenient!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is absolutely beautiful with a spacious open concept. Three separate bed rooms for all of us to have our own space.
My only negative to note and really was only a negative for our group is the parking. We had 3 trucks with 3 watercrafts and parking became challenging. Plus the drive is about a 45* grade so we had to use extra caution with the boat props.
But overall this is a fantastic place and I would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed the lake house! When we come back, this will be the staying place if available.

Our family wouldn't hesitate to return again and would recommend it to anyone interested."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The lakehouse is an amazing place to be and unwind your life worries.. Simply stay at the porch and enjoy the lake or sunbathe swinging at the hammocks and relax your mind.
Thank you Justin for sharing this treasure with us"

It was very cozy and relaxing. The cabin had a pretty private feel (even though there were neighbors on both sides) while being just minutes away from stores and restaurants, and only minutes away from various activities that we also took advantage of. We loved our stay and made lovely family memories. We cant wait to visit again soon! Would definitely recommend to others!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little cabin for our family of 5. Beautiful view of the lake. Wish you could jump in the water but that does not seem to be a Lake Cumberland thing. This was our first trip to the area. We rented a boat at Lee‚Äôs Ford, which is super close to the cabin. We also checked out hiking and the ‚Äúbeach‚Äù at Pulaski County Park, which was great with the kids. Kitchen is very well stocked for cooking meals. Altogether a great relaxing spot."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, comfy and fantastic view/location. Would highly recommend! Food options in the area are pretty basic - next time we would plan to cook more of our meals and enjoy the lovely porch and view of the lake from the comfort of ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Overall, a lovely stay!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay in the lake cottage! check in was easy, the cottage was very clean, fully equipped, and had beautiful view! We were close to area outdoor activities, as well as restaurants and lake access/marinas. The only negative is the slope and height of stairs to backyard. I'm 5'3"" with knee problems and had difficulty maneuvering them. There is a path to the side that you can access the yard by without using the stairs which was helpful. We took the hammacks for a nice swing. My husband is 6'2"" and they were too close together to be able to lay down.
With that being said, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway! Close enough to restaurants, shopping, and other activities, and far enough away for peace and quiet. Lovely!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. This was the first time we rented a place for Thanksgiving and I think we've discovered a new tradition for our family. We ordered dinner from the local Bob Evans and that ended up working out great. This place has a fantastic view of the lake; we watched people fishing - mostly during the morning hours. The kitchen is well stocked and has everything we needed. The hosts were excellent communicators and the place was clean. Easy rules for checking in / out, I'd recommend this for your stay. We also spent a day going to/from Cumberland Falls for viewing the falls and doing some hiking along the Sheltowee Trace trail."

Worth a mention - the bed was super comfortable! All in all, we had a very relaxing stay and loved checking out all of the local recommendations that were provided to us. Would recommend and stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice small cabin with a great view of the lake. Private, peaceful, and safe. We loved the location and we were able to take a day trip to Cumberland Falls and hike. So worth it! We hope to rent a pontoon boat next time, just had chilly temps and some rain this trip. Great cabin for a couple or a small family. We were able to make a fire in the fire pit at night, so nice!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great find! Cozy cottage with everything you need for a comfortable and peaceful stay. Close enough to town that getting groceries, etc was very convenient!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and charming place! My family and I really enjoyed our time here. The view is stunning and we loved looking out at the lake and star gazing at night. Very private - you are in a neighborhood but the trees make it feel really secluded. The house is well taken card of and you can tell they think a lot about the comfort if their guests. Beds were super nice!! And the chairs in the living room were the perfect place for reading or watching g a movie!
Kitchen is really fun to cook in - pretty well stocked with gear and spices. Town is a short drive for groceries. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! Beautiful views and wonderful house.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for us and the kids! Beautiful view! We especially enjoyed our time around the fire pit in the yard making smores and hotdogs.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lake house is a gem. It has everything you need for a trip that feels like home. It was extremely cleaned, decorated well and the view of the lake and land was everything. We sat out on the deck many times and enjoyed the outside fire pit a lot. I cooked a lot - the kitchen had everything we needed for meals. The beds were super comfortable. It was great to be able to watch TV when we wanted and to have WIFI. We went to a couple suggested places for coffee and donuts and were not disappointed. There is a Kroger Marketplace not far that has about everything you need if you want to stay in and cook. Sunrise and sunset views were perfect. I have never reviewed this ""amenity"" but the temperature was always perfect inside the lake house - even in the sun room. You could really tell they thought of about everything to make you comfortable. Will definitely be back."

Comfortable beds and dark rooms for sleeping in or morning coffee on the balcony watching the fog rise from the water with unobstructed views. We loved it!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing home!! Perfect location and better than described. The communication was a breeze and we walked into a wonderfully decorated (and super clean) lake house with stunning views of the lake. They have everything you need for a great visit.

Too many things to list - trust me you won‚Äôt be disappointed in staying here.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! Location is convenient and the view is beautiful. The house is exactly as pictured and we enjoyed its coziness. We loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit in the backyard. We rented a boat from Burnside Marina (10-15 minute drive). As a family of five renting for the week, we found it helpful to bring extra toilet paper and a roll of paper towels. Kroger (10 minute drive) online order/curbside pickup made it easy to stock up on groceries and start relaxing right away."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the cabin! My husband and I came down for a weekend getaway and it was exactly what we were looking for.

We enjoyed the outdoor space, as well. We will definitely be returning!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house and view was perfect. I visited for a week for a change of scenery after a few months of quarantine. I planned for a balance of work time and relaxing time - the house was suited perfect for this! I was able to set up my office in the sunroom - the WiFi signal was perfect and the view of the lake was wonderful. The yard was perfect for a relaxing afternoon of reading. Sitting on the deck each night watching the sunset was so nice. The kitchen was well stocked - I cooked daily. I slept well - the bed was comfortable. Communication was very prompt and easy. Check-in was simple. Thanks for the Lee‚Äôs Marina Restaurant recommendation - the grouper sandwich was amazing! I would definitely consider this lake house for a future getaway!

Overall, highly recommend"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Lake House was wonderful. We came down for a long weekend get away to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 40th Birthday. The place was exactly what we needed to unwind, relax, and spend time with friends while enjoying the great view of the lake! Lots of extras that made the stay even better like suggestions for local places to eat. There is a plenty of space to enjoy meals together. Best view I‚Äôve had while grilling out in some time!! We spent time in the sunroom in the evening play cards before sitting out at the fire pit. The house is clean. It was cozy and inviting. We will absolutely be back!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The host and cabin were amazing! After a day sightseeing, it was so great knowing that we had a beautiful and comfortable place to relax and unwind from the day. The view of the lake is one of the best aspects of this cabin. Mornings spent with a cup of coffee enjoying the view, was a great way to start each day.
If you're looking for a place to stay on Lake Cumberland or in Somerset, this cabin should be number one on your list.
We will definitely be back."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect spot to get away to and relax.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little piece of heaven. We stayed with our two young children (both under 3) and felt right at home. We cooked every meal together and watched the sunset on the lake from the back porch each evening. The sunsets were incredible, the sun sets directly over the back porch through the trees, shining down on the lake. The sun room was so peaceful to watch our children play. We had everything we needed and more from pots and pans to towels and extra household supplies. Communication was easy and local tips were great. All in all a fantastic stay. We will be back!"

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Justin‚Äôs place was just as advertised, a cute, quaint little cottage with a beautiful view of Lake Cumberland. Unfortunately for us it was freezing outside so we spent more time inside than planned. Luckily, the cottage had most everything we needed from a baking dish to a tea pot. We had one question while there, and the property manager was quick to reply. My only suggestion is to bring soap, paper towel, etc, as there was only enough to get us through one meal. Overall, I would definitely recommend Justin‚Äôs place if you‚Äôre looking in the Lake Cumberland area."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place...Will definitely book it again the next time I‚Äôm up that wayüôÇ

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly as pictured - adorable. It was cozy, clean, and relaxing. Communication from the hosts was great.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this place. Stayed the week of the 4th. Didn't spend much time sitting there but it was a beautiful little house with a great view and even better view come sunset. Picked this place because it was a Central location to all the things we wanted to do. Like the caves and national forests. We did hang around a little in Somerset. And went to the marina for the blob so the kids could swim. Lots of little hidden treasures for shopping and eating. Definitely would stay here again.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a lovely time at your lake house thank you for opening your home to us. We enjoyed rented a pontoon boat from Lee's Ford Harbour and loved laying in the hammock enjoying the beautiful views. Thank you!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing getaway home! I would absolutely recommend to anyone
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a cozy home with everything we were looking for. The driveway is shared and not suited for parking larger vehicles but additional side parking is just a very short walk away at the end of the road. The house was well accommodated & amply furnished. Walk to the cute little downtown was quick with good eateries. Short drive to Cumberland Falls, the home is a great staging point to visit the beauty of the surrounding area."

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little home for the price. I just wish parking was better. If I'd driven my full size pickup I wouldn't have been able to park anywhere near the property. single parking pad in shared drive is very precarious to get into and front curb is yellow zoned.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The inside of the home was very clean!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Deana‚Äôs home was a wonderful home away from home for our visit.

Numerous restaurants and bars/ pubs are just a couple blocks away. Extremely clean, comfortable, and Deana even had some snacks waiting to make visitors feel welcome.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super comfortable- clear instructions and easy to communicate with. I wish there was coffee! But all amenities were as stated. Driveway is steep but it‚Äôs not the only parking option. Lovely house- exactly like the pictures.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was great! We enjoyed our stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house was super cute and Tommy was flexible and always responsive. Our house was in the middle of being renovated and we had to change our length of stay a couple of times and he was always quick to respond. The house is in the middle of town so it‚Äôs easy to get to places and the house itself is charming!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is very convenient, very close to the Center for Rural Development. It was very clean and well-stocked with things that we needed. There is lots of parking behind the garage, which is nice for our dance group because not many of us can ride together. The road behind the house is not busy and is great for walking dogs. We hope to stay again in the future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, comfy, and clean!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tommy‚Äôs place was great! The location was perfect and everything was clean!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this home!! We settled right in and so did our mini Aussiedoodle!

Lots of cool mid century vibes throughout with a very relaxing and comfortable master bedroom and bath. Everything was spotless!! We couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place with a great host
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed a couple nights to visit with my parents who live near by. The house is only a couple blocks from baxter‚Äôs coffee shop which is an excellent local coffee shop. We walked downtown from the unit and it is a close and easy jaunt. Kroger is just a mile away or so. There are a number of walking trails at state parks near by for a hike.
We appreciate a dog friendly place. It was nice to have a fenced in yard for our dog. I would recommend fixing the latch on the gate. The home is older, spacious and had a number of upgrades. It was clean. The beds were new and comfortable. Laundry was convenient."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic communication! Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tommy‚Äôs place is so adorable. My husband and I love older homes and this one didn‚Äôt disappoint. We had plenty of room for parking our 2 cars and work trailers. The beds were comfy and we felt right at home. They have the best blankets to snuggle with while watching TV. We loved that we could walk right to the downtown restaurants. Tommy was very accommodating and very responsive. Would definitely recommend his home on your visit to Somerset.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tommy's home was a last minute find when I realized the hotel in the area where I usually stay had raised their rates. Tommy was great and very active with instructions.
The house was very clean and awesomely comfortable. Way more room than I needed. Couch and bed was comfortable.
This is an older home with lots of character. Which leads to everything is not perfect. It has some patina that is to be expected with an older home. Clean, thoughtful and well organized.
When in the area I will stay again if available. Way more comfortable than a hotel."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our needs! Three of my co-workers and I were attending a 3-day training at the Health Department in Somerset and enjoyed the opportunity to share time in the house in the evenings. Each of us had a private bedroom but also had plenty of room to spend together in the living room, dining room, porch and patio. The house was clean, easy to find and within walking distance of the Health Department and restaurants on the square. Tommy was extremely responsive. He made it to the house in just 5 minutes after I called him because we managed to lock ourselves out of the house (totally our mistake). I would highly recommend staying at this Somerset house, and hope I have an opportunity to return. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean. The fenced in back yard was nice for the dogs. The road behind the house was a great place to walk the dogs as it was not very busy. The house served our purpose for preparing and having meals, and relaxing after dancing all day."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this beautiful home! It is full of charm. Clean, spacious. Easy to find. Awesome beds and linens. Fully stocked. Plenty of comfortable seating. Thoughtful touches like the towels already in each room. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved the place and location! I was playing at the Master Musicians Festival, and it was convenient to the location‚Ä¶.also very convenient to local restaurants! We‚Äôre planning on staying there next year for the festival!! Thank you!!!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for a few days over the 4th of July and had a great time. The home is cozy, but large enough that everyone had their own space to chill after activities. We visited the local splash park and roller rink, had easy access to a grocery store, and took day trips to Lexington for historical tours. The kitchen was also fully stocked with cooking utensils and plates, etc., which made preparing meals easy. With it being an older home, there are a few quirks - the dryer and some the bathroom faucet taps take a little getting used to. Overall though, would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent host! Quick response and very flexible.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Cool place had everything we needed :)

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful remodeled home. Perfect spot for the Somernites cruise-in on the square. A few amenities that we appreciated: bedside lamps with charging ports, luggage racks in bedrooms, comfortable mattresses, plenty of extra throw blankets, great assortment of pots, pans, etc. several board games, fenced backyard. Definitely recommend using the back driveway on Janlyn Ave, much easier to navigate than the front. Nice neighborhood."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great downtown home. Awesome for pets and kids!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tommy as a host was easy to communicate with and very accommodating! The home was lovely and we felt right at home. It's right next to downtown, coffee, and food spots - such a great location. Highly recommend for a stayover in Somerset!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"the Oakwood Cottage was really great. only minor glitches with the washer and not so good cleaning crew kept it from being the perfect stay. Amy is a wonderful host and took care of everything right away. I would recommend this property to anyone. Thank you Amy, for a beautiful home away from home."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,very peaceful home in a nice neighborhood

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a great place to stay as we needed a place close to Lake Cumberland Hospital. Amy quickly responded to all my messages and was always so kind! Oh and my brother said she had the BEST bathroom towels!!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was fantastic, exactly what we were looking for. The place was very well laid out, very nice furniture and beds, kitchen was spotless. The fire pit was nice on a cold night and my daughter loved the welcome candy left by the host. The driveway is a little tricky to get into with a boat but once you get in off the street there is plenty of room for parking. The coffee maker is a single-serve Keurig, not a full coffee pot, but the cups were included so it worked out great. Overall, it was a wonderful stay. Would come again and would definitely recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, 5 mins from everything you‚Äôd need."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect. The location was close to everything we needed or wanted to do. The host was FANTASTIC! We hosted our family for dinner and had everything we needed to host 9 people for a meal. The surrounding countryside was peaceful. We weren‚Äôt able to use the fireplace, which would have made the place a 10+. We will definitely stay there again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great and the welcome basket with wine was a great touch. The only thing was there was no cable tv, which during football season is desired. The check in of 4 pm and check out of 10 am is a little short. Most places allow a checkin of 3 pm and checkout of 11. Other than that, the place was great and would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was an amazing place and she was sweet
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay, the owner was very responsive. The added touches were a real pleasure; wine, candy, nutrigrain bars and cold water in the fridge was awesome. The home was nicely decorated and very clean. We will definitely stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This rental exceeded our expectations! It is so cute and the perfect amount of space for the four of us. Our host Brenda, did not miss a single little detail. We felt so catered to with all the little touches such as cold water bottles in the fridge, available coffee, microwave popcorn, nutrigrain bars, just to name a few! If we're ever in the area we will definitely stay here again! Beautiful place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Very clean only thing I would change is the beds are not very comfortable but definitely not the worst I‚Äôve slept on!

A clean and comfortable stay over all, I would greatly recommend it"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great. Just what my family needed. Kids loved the fence in yard. Everything was clean, neat, and just right.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. It was so clean & perfect. The furniture inside and out were all comfortable. The view was breathtaking. Sara's home would be ideal for a large family. So much space to spread out. The kitchen was very well stocked. Extra-large bathroom in the master area. Really nice area to sit and get ready with makeup mirror. We'll be visiting the area again and would happily stay again, if it's available. Sara is a great communicator. I received prompt replies to my questions. A most excellent host. We truly appreciate the rest and relaxation we had. Thank you, Sara!
K. Colley"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was awesome! Great view of the lake. I spent most nights with a beverage just looking at the lake from the huge porch. The house was very clean and homey. We felt right at home.
Sara was hands down one of the BEST hosts I‚Äôve ever had. Beyond the cute extras like the soaps and toothbrush, she also had the things you really needed like plenty of toilet paper and an extra roll of paper towels. There were plenty of outdoor games and board games (the kids had a 2 day long game of Somerset-opoly.)
We went during spring break and we didn‚Äôt have a boat so things to do around were a little limited. The hiking trails in Pulaski were ok. The suspension bridge was worth seeing. The weather (April) was cold, raining, and we even had hail, so we ended up driving to Mammoth cave (1.5hrs) Cumberland Falls was definitely worth the drive as well but it was also close to an hour drive.
But if you‚Äôre just looking to relax and the weather is good, this is the place!!
But with good weather"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love staying here, it always feels like home.
The house and back deck and view are phenomenal. Sara is a great host with a great welcoming manner and the house is always clean, neat and very homey. We love it here !!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara‚Äôs house was just as described in the listing but even better! The views of the lake are gorgeous and I can only imagine what it‚Äôs like in the summer. Her house is spotless and she has everything that you could possibly need. There were a couple hiccups, that were NOT Sara‚Äôs fault at all, yet she responded almost immediately to my message and we worked the kinks out quickly. Extremely comfortable beds and quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend and would stay here again if ever in the area."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Sara's lakehouse. There are few properties that are better than the photos - but they didn't do this place justice. We stayed here for a quiet family weekend, and the house had everything we needed. The view from the back deck was amazing, we spent a lot of our trip just sitting enjoying the water. The host was transparent, easy to access for issues, and incredibly kind. The sunset view here was amazing. The place was incredibly clean (we looked through the cleaners to try and find out how it smelled so good). Its a TON of space, you could easily have multiple families stay here comfortably. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (just a heads up, all the cookware was Teflon/non-stick so if this is an issue for you, byop)...like, pretty sure it was better stocked than my home kitchen. There were beach umbrellas, chairs, fire pit, grill, huge bathtub, cornhole, another fire pit... just everything you could need and more to enjoy your stay. 1000/10."

We would definitely go back to the peace and tranquility of his place. Thank you Grant it was a pleasure and your hospitality was over the top."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Grant‚Äôs place worked out great for me. The back screened in porch was very nice. I enjoyed many evening listening to the crickets. Also just want to thank you for the coffee and all the supplies that were available. I felt quite at home.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Lakeside home was peaceful and private. It was a perfect place to bring our dog. We really enjoyed the screened porch. Lake Cumberland is beautiful & Guthrie‚Äôs on the River was great for Sunday brunch!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great experience.. Super location and wonderful stay...
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I recently stayed at over a month at Grant's lovely mobile home ,and I have to say, it was a truly fantastic experience. The mobile home itself was cozy, clean, and well-appointed, with all the amenities you could possibly need for a comfortable stay. The real standout feature, though, was the screened-in porch, which was the perfect spot to relax and enjoy the beautiful wooded surroundings.
One of the things I appreciated most about this Airbnb was the location. It was nestled right in the heart of the woods, so you really felt like you were getting away from it all. At the same time, though, it was convniently located near Lake Cumberland, which meant that there was plenty to do in the area if you wanted to get out and explore. Whether you enjoy fishing, boating, hiking, or just soaking up the natural beauty of the area, there was something for everyone.
l highly recommend staying at Grant's place üïäÔ∏è"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"we stayed here for a month and it was so relaxing and beautiful. Grant was very helpful with local recommendations. this place is close enough to anything you might need, but far enough away to where you get some peace. would definitely stay here again"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Grant was super easy to communicate with. The place is located in peaceful surroundings outside of town but close enough to all the amenities. I had an extended stay and cooked a lot in that kitchen. The appliances are fantastic and I enjoyed being in the living area while preparing food.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Grant's place is in a great area, clean, neat, and had everything we needed. We would definitely rent this unit again if in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So beautiful there. Nice spot love the deck out back woke up every morning and sat out back and enjoyed the beautiful morning and grilled almost every night. Best week I've had in a long time. I really didn't want to leave wish I lived there.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was one of my favorite Airbnbs. It was very peaceful and relaxing. We are on the road a lot so this was big for me. Absolutely loved the screened in porch. All my questions were answered promptly as well. Definitely would stay again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great place out in the country we did have no electricity for half the day Turn it off at 10am didn't go back on until after 6pm. Bryan was nice enough to refund us 2 nites we didn't stay not because of electricity but we had to leave earlier then expected thanks Bryan
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Bryan was awesome! Super friendly and always answered when I called or got back to me. Saw a few deer and the best was how peaceful and serene it is! Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a comfortable, secure, private setting in natural surroundings. Perfect as a home base for exploring the local area, which has amazing rock formations, flowers, birds, trees. It is also a great place just to chill. It is not right in town, but close enough to make quick trips there. There likely are interesting historical stories about this farmstead. The amenities, though not the newest and fanciest, suited our needs perfectly. The owner was very pleasant, responsive and available. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and quiet place to stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy, cozy and restful. Beautiful surroundings. A great base for our trip to the Daniel Boone National Forest and Cumberland Falls.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location was beautiful, the view from the den was outstanding. The furniture and beds were very comfortable and met our needs perfectly. I wasn't able to get out and explore but my husband enjoyed walking around the property. Our biggest concern was being close to our daughter and her family. We were 10 minutes away - and they are very close to downtown and lots of shopping on highway 27!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay! Great, peaceful location."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean,cozy home very conveniently located from town with all the privacy anyone could ask for and you cannot forget the convenience of being able to have your FUR BABIES with you"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a peaceful home , had absolutely no problems at all with anything. Everything was perfect. Bryan was a great host. The land , scenery and southern hospitality blew us away."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were very pleased with the farm house and one thing that popped up that needed attention was addressed promptly . Bryan was very friendly ,responsive and accommodating whenever we had a question or needed advise .
If we are ever in the area again we would diffidently book again as the house was secluded and peaceful and the drive to the house was just what we were looking for in a wooded area away from the hustle and bustle of the city life back home .
Thank you Brian"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful home in a nice private area.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Beautiful property out of the city but close enough to the city in a few minutes drive. House well decorated with fresh paint and nice layout. Property is not private as you would think from the description if thats what you are looking for as hunting friends are coming through to check cameras or hunt. The water is a cistern system which is fine until its the dry season and the water runs out and then they have to manually bring water up every few days to get it full again. We did have issues with trespassers twice once in the morning on a 4 wheeler and once in the middle of the night pounding on the door which broke the back screen door. so we're supplied with a combo lock for the driveway gate which was great until the hunters or other people come by unannounced to us and they all have the gate code so made it pointless. Bryan was very responsive to the issues we had but we were looking for privacy. If it weren't for so many people coming and going it would have been perfect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful scenery and secluded. Love the deer and rabbits! Bryan was very responsive and also helped with my questions about WiFi for work. Note: Very firm beds and the water is cistern water but Prismo Water Cooler is a nice convenience that he provided in the kitchen! We loved the easy checkin and also the family Apple business store!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We came in to town for a baseball tournament and stayed at Bryan‚Äôs place. I had messaged him beforehand asking a few questions about the location. He was very quick to respond. The house is in the country with a beautiful drive up to the house. We were able to see a turtle in the driveway and there was a rabbit out back that visited every morning. The place was spacious and we felt safe the whole time. Check in and check out was super simple. We were gone at games most of our stay so we didn‚Äôt get to use the detached clubhouse. For us this was a better alternative than a cramped hotel room. The only downfall was the water was from a cistern and had a slight odor to it. I read all the reviews before booking and didn‚Äôt see this mentioned at all. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the norm for this area but was just surprised I didn‚Äôt see this mentioned anywhere. Fresh drinking water was provided via the filtered water dispenser. We would recommend this place for anyone in the area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was one of the nicest Air BnBs that we‚Äôve stay at. Very quiet setting and the house was clean with all the amenities we needed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,... Loved staying at this peaceful place surrounded by beautiful greenery and gorgeous trees. Such a quiet getaway - we heard only birds. Very clean with lots of soft thick towels. The screened in porch was a relaxing addition when we weren't watching tv. Everything we needed was there. Bryan was the most responsive host - answered our questions immediately. Great place for our little dog to explore without being on her leash. Highly recommend this bright cozy home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I found this wonderful air bnb on very short notice. We had booked a different place further north, but upon arrival, there were issues with place. So, after 1 night there, I started to look for a different location. I am SO glad I did! This farmhouse was PERFECT for us and our dogs! We had so much privacy and a large area for the dogs to play. Bryan was so accommodating and checked in to see if we needed anything. The home was very comfortable, clean, and you can tell that it had been updated with paint, flooring, and decorative touches. It was also affordable and charming! Each morning, we enjoyed coffee on the front porch, watching butterflies in the yard. So peaceful, quiet, and just beautiful!

The fire pit in the back is nice and there is tons of woods around to collect your own firewood. The screened in porch was a great place to enjoy dinner after a long day of hiking. Bryan was willing to accommodate us when we were unable to check in the date we had planned for personal reasons. He did not ask any questions and extended our stay so our trip would be the same number of days. We did not have any issues we needed tended to, but I am sure if we needed anything he would have promptly helped us. Always messaged back quickly. We defiantly will be back to explore the area, thanks again Bryan!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anita & Duffy extended a level of hospitality that made me feel like family. The pictures of the cottage don't do it justice. Stepping inside felt like entering a scene from a movie set in Toronto, Canada. The scenery, the accommodations, the comfort, and the history of how the cottage came to be is just top tier. Every detail that went into bringing the cottage into fruition can be felt on every level.
I live and work in the Chicagoland area, and the peace and quiet I experienced at the cottage were amazing. Waking up to the beautiful trees, sitting on the deck taking in the creek, and enjoying the swing in the enclosure on the ground level were all incredible experiences.
Anita & Duffy's place is perfect for resetting, writing, meditating, resting, painting... hell, pick something! It's a place where you can truly breathe. I've done a fair amount of traveling, but this cottage is in my top 3 places I have ever visited.
Thank you, Anita and Duffy, for a remarkable experience!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was not what you think of when you hear cottage. It was very modern; maybe a Southern Living or Martha‚Äôs Vineyard cottage, but not what I expected to find in Somerset KY. We felt right at home from the beginning. We were only in town for a wedding, but I wish we had time to stay longer and just relax. The cottage is in the homeowner‚Äôs backyard, but I never once felt like it was. It was very private and serene. We will definitely stay again when we find ourselves in Somerset. Thank you for having us!"

It was large, clean, and modern in all the right places such as the kitchen and refrigerator. The home still had some of the original features like doors and hardwood floors that really created the feel of an old farm house. The decorations were beautiful and amenities such as towels and linens were clean and well stocked!
Jason was able to accommodate hosting tour around the farm one morning, which our kids thoroughly enjoyed. We met their chickens, cows, pigs, and guinea hen!
Our family of 9 spent a weekend playing yard games, sitting by the fire, making s‚Äômores (ingredients kindly provided by our hosts) talking to the baby calf right in our back yard, eating, and fishing! It was just what we needed. We were very blessed by Jason and Christy‚Äôs home."

The first floor rooms were perfect for grandparents and great-aunt and uncle and the college kids enjoyed bunking together in the ""kids"" room. The living areas were all spacious and well stocked. We found everything we needed and enjoyed some things we wouldn't have thought of! We tried a couple local places, but mostly cooked at the house and we had all the cooking supplies we needed (even an air fryer and a crock pot!) The outdoor games provided were fun and kept us busy. Besides spending quality time with our family, the highlight of our stay was getting to know Mandy (the cow)! Highly recommend!"

They even left items to make smores in the fire pit and fresh donuts and cookies from a local bakery. The only thing that was tough for several of us were the harder beds as we are used to softer ones. But even so we would not hesitate to rent this beautiful place again if we are ever in the area. Ps. The kids LOVED the farm animals right out the back door.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Farmhouse vibes, well stocked and perfectly located for a family thanksgiving. This house fit our family of 11 and gave each group privacy. The outside game and fire pit setting is amazing and there is even a surprise coming. üòâ

The back yard was private & off the road, also big enough to kick a soccer ball. The fire pit was nice & all of the supplies were provided. The owner even let our kids help feed a baby cow & showed them their other animals. He was super nice, shared his knowledge with them & checked in if there was anything we need. Our families enjoyed our stay here."

I would definitely recommend it to others.

We even got to talk to one of the hosts when he came to feed the baby cows they had just gotten delievered!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is simply unbelievable. So cozy and romantic, the perfect space for any special occasion! Courtney went the extra mile, from putting rose petals up the stairs into the bedroom (we were celebrating our anniversary) and stocking our favorite beverages, she truly made this place feel like home. We only spent a weekend and we we‚Äôre so sad we had to leave, as this place was one of the most beautiful places we‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of staying. There was lots to do in the area & Courtney left lots of recommendations for just about any thing you could think of from restaurants to hiking trails. We enjoyed her recommendation of Charred Oak Grille! Their nachos with their house made chips were phenomenal! While there‚Äôs lots to do we mainly relaxed in the beautiful hot tub on the patio and watched our favorite series on the TV. All in all I would give this place 100 stars if I could, this place truly is a gem."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"*** LUXURY & AMBIENCE ***
I‚Äôve been booking Airbnb stays for years and I have never walked into a space and experienced anything as exquisite as this slice of heaven that Courtney designed. The jazz music playing, the intoxicating smells, the stunning decor‚Ä¶ it all envelops you and almost leaves you speechless. I was the first to arrive and had to video my family‚Äôs reactions when they walked in because the space is one to legit stop you in your tracks.
We were there for a weekend birthday celebration and only left once for a delicious dinner in downtown Somerset ‚Ä¶ other than that we stayed put and soaked in as much time there as possible.
Courtney is truly a talented designer and also extremely kind, responsive, and friendly. We did not have one issue and we‚Äôre already planning future staycations in this exact unit - as well as other gorgeous places we have found that she owns.
Endless thanks for our wonderful experience‚Ä¶ see you again very soon! :)"

I can‚Äôt adequately describe how gorgeous the place is, but even more impressively, it is so relaxing. I felt like I got to live in a spa for the weekend. I also can‚Äôt say enough good things about the host. She was so, so responsive each time I reached out (which was mainly just to fangirl over her decorating skills). I can‚Äôt wait to come back. I would literally buy this place if Courtney would sell it to me. üòÇ"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute little place with thoughtful personal touches. We had a very comfortable, enjoyable stay."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at this cute little house. It looks small from the road, but it is quite long having two sitting rooms, two queen bedrooms, and two full baths.
This was the most equipped place we have stayed, especially for my kiddos (ages 3 and 6). Here are just a few things: fruit basket, snack jar, coffee, cold waters, dishes for kids and adults, pots and pans, toys and coloring books, extra blankets, extra towels, shampoo, laundry detergent, toothbrushes, etc, etc.
The kitchen is a bit small for cooking with more than 1 person, but everything you need is there. The kitchen appliances looked new. There is no dishwasher as the kitchen doesn't have room for one.
Everything was clean and well-kept. But there was some feeling of the house's finishing touches being a little low-end such as thin wall-paper and exposed un-treated wood. This didn't bother us at all, but I figure some folks care about that kind of thing.
Overall happy with the stay and we are likely to stay again!"

You can definitely see that they go above and beyond to make sure that guest at Allie‚Äôs have everything they need to feel at home while away from home.

Thankfully Julie excepted immediately!ü§óü•∞ We stayed on the boat most of our two day trip. Cabin was a nice relaxing spot to come to after all day on the lake. Julie did take the time to think of everything a person would need or might have forgotten when packing. & also added sweet lil personal guest touches. She knew we were a couple on a quick lil weekend bday getaway & left us out a delicious bottle of wine & basket of snacks! So sweet & thoughtful!ü§ó The cabin is on a 2 home property but is off set & back enough that you forget about the other house until your going out the front door. So still very private! Would definitely stay again & for certain recommending!

Bathroom and kitchen were spacious and living room couch and bed were both comfortable. Plenty of towels, stocked kitchen and information about the area. Very close to restaurants and some shopping. One of our reasons for visiting was to hike Natural Arch and a local waterfall and both were a short drive away and so beautiful! The place itself was tucked back against the lake and was quiet and peaceful. Some bad storms came through and knocked power out/downed some trees at the home during our last day. Julie communicated well to make sure we were up to date since we were not there when it happened. Overall a great experience and would stay again if we are in the area. Thanks again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect get away spot for me and my sister. We felt right at home the moment we got there, everything was spotless and the house was set up with the cutest decor. Very homey! It also had all the supplies we needed for the weekend and more. The loft was fun and the view from the back deck was stunning! If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet getaway that‚Äôs private yet a close drive to town, this is it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Julie's was excellent! I wish would would have been able to utilize the huge porch with amazing views but the rain got in the way of that unfortunately. The location was close to town but also plenty of amazing views just within driving distance. Would definitely stay again!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, and peaceful place! I loved sitting on the back porch and listening to the water! Beautiful place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay with at Bugg‚Äôs Cabin. The kitchen was full of windows that overlooked the water. We had games to play with our kids. She had provided lots of snacks, tea and coffee. The space was clean and beautifully decorated. We would love to visit again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice. I was very sad to leave as we felt right at home. The windows in the kitchen/dining area provided an amazing view while I prepared and cooked our meals. We hung out in the back deck and had a small fire (be careful there are a LOT of leaves). Made s‚Äômores and played uno and other board games. Loved the beautiful, white linens and bedding in the main room. It really was great. Julie helped us with a technology issue upon arrival. She also was quick to come to my rescue when I forgot an ingredient for a meal. This is about 12 mins from Walmart. And your just around the corner from restaurants, shopping and grocery. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!! Thanks Mrs. Julie!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house on Pittman creek
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a beautiful, peaceful, relaxing stay at this cabin. Such a beautiful area. Julie was a wonderful host! I highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place was exactly as described. Cabin was cozy, internet was great, and I had everything I needed. Decent boat parking as well. Thanks Julie and I'll be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, it was even better then described. We would totally go back and would highly recommend.
Things to note:
This is an older home so it's not gonna be perfectly pristine, it's older and well used but also well loved. It's been well taken care of and is very comfortable.
Plenty of parking, bed was comfortable, plenty of linens. We didn't cook so no comment on that.
Truly worth the price."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay and recommend it to those looking to get away. The cabin was very nice, but I could not say my stay was always tranquil. I went there to write, but the Army Corps of Engineers next door used a leaf blower on their property for 5-6 hours a day, every day, including Sunday starting at 8:30 am! (I know that was not Julie's fault, but it did impact my stay.) Other than that, I loved my stay. I have difficulty walking and I was able to easily access everywhere except the loft. The back deck is private. Watching the sunrise over the mountains was beautiful! The view out the kitchen windows was lovely. The colors of the Autumn trees were gorgeous. It was fascinating to watch the birds flit through the trees and then perch on the deck to sing. Other then the leaf blower, the neighborhood was quiet and even walking along the road was pleasant. I would suggest packing light because space to unpack is very limited (one small closet with a few hangers and no drawer space)."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Bugg's Cabin was a very pleasant surprise! The cabin is rustic, well furnished and very comfortable but with all of the modern conveniences. Beautiful paneling in the main living room, a large sunroom overlooking a full sized deck and a view of the waterway and valley! You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, but restaurants and shopping are only a mile or two away. Time slowed down while we were there and we enjoyed our stay very much. The location is perfect for Lake Cumberland access without all of the traffic, but the cabin is perfect for quiet retreats or romantic getaways as well. While there, I could feel my mind relax and now I want to go back to do some writing. We will be back, and that's saying something since we live in Washington State. Hey aspiring writers, check this out in the wintertime!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was close to restaurants but it was still remote. We enjoyed the snacks and the special Halloween decorations. We definitely will be returning in the near future!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie was great! She was so responsive and friendly! The house was cozy and we felt right at home üíï

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Took our family for the Memorial Day holiday to go boating and sight seeing! The cottage was pristine, kitchen has all you need to cook! Grill and a small fire pit outside! Looking forward to fall for another beautiful visit!
Julie and her husband are truly wonderful host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bugg's Lake Cottage Retreat was a perfect kayaking getaway for me and my girlfriend. The interior is quaint, and looks like the original structure in most ways. The original retracting stairs to the bunk are nice. The cottage sleeps four with the bed up there. The kitchen looks out towards the lake through the trees and onto the deck. You are close to the town and the water, but the entire house feels private, though you have to go behind the neighboring house to descend the stairs to Pitman Creek. The stairs are steep and long, but once we had our kayaks in the water below, we just tied them down and used the stairs to get to the water. There is a boat club close by, and they were fine with us taking our kayaks in and out. If you paddle beyond the club it is very isolated and peaceful. Just 100 yards from the base of the steps is a small cove that was perfect for swimming. The backyard is small, but there are trees for a hammock and a fire pit with wood."
