2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is all remodel, the TV room can be bedroom.
All was super clean and the comunication was excellent. I'll stay again without hesitation."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Arthhouse was in a great location, right near everything. The beds were comfortable and the listing was as described. The hosts reached out multiple times to make sure we had what we needed. All in all, we had a good stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As I said there were storms in the area and he communicated tips to stay safe and protect our property.
If I had to nitpick, there is plenty of seating at the kitchen table and dining area table, but only 2 chairs in the living area to watch tv."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Good home-base for Knox College events. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this 1895 Victorian style home. The rooms were clean and amenities were as listed. We enjoyed the character of the home and the surrounding community. We enjoyed a walk around the neighborhood and met a local woman who lives a few doors down founded the non profit Community Glo. She is converting her lawn to a community garden. Very cool!
Thank you for providing a relaxing space for families who prefer not to stay in a cramped hotel room. -Julie B."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Galesburg Isa friendly town. The hosts were great.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, easy check in, great communication! Would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable stay for our family of 4!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best decisions I have made. We needed a place for guest to stay and also have my daughter’s baby shower. Boudewijn was very accommodating and helpful. My two daughters, granddaughter and two of her friends stayed on site so we didn’t have to get a hotel. The baby shower was great and the BNB was the perfect venue. It was a win/win situation."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Boudewijn & Cecilia Arthouse was more than I expected ! A great stay for me to come visit my girlfriend since we live in two different states.The place was very clean ,felt like home.I only used the first floor level .The first floor level bed was firm and comfortable and clean.Shower was hot and clean.Thermostat was a little confusing at first but both hosts assisted and answered any questions not only about the Thermostat but any questions I had in a timely fashion ,I appreciate both hosts because this place housed a first time meeting between two people who love each other! Thank you so much ,more than words can express. Excellent home for any occasion!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Serene! Thanks for the quiet getaway!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful!!!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful relaxing time. The scenery was beautiful with all the wildlife.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to relax and has many food supplies so you don’t have to bring every thing in your kitchen with you. It is always clean, has a nice grill, has nice little lake for fishing, and has a small boat with trolling motor to use. All fish you catch must be returned to the lake or a small lake like this will be quickly fished out. Craig and Neneth make your visit very enjoyable and that is why we return every year."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about this place. Pictures don't do it justice. The lake, the kayak, the john boat, the view, the wildlife, all such an amazing trip. The house was spotless and had everything we needed for adventuring. We are already talking about when we can come back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful place to escape for a few days to reconnect to nature .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The best thing I can say about Craig & Nineth’s home is this was our 3rd visit and we can’t wait for our next visit. The beauty of the property, the peace and quiet, the comfort and cleanliness of the home and the amazing hospitality of the owners make this our favorite home away from home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend escape from the craziness of life. Was a great place to disconnect and just enjoy nature. Loved waking up and going outside on the screened deck to hear the birds in the morning. The property is lovely. Felt very private despite close proximity to main house. Loved all of the amenities in the house, had everything needed to cook a few meals. Would love to stay again some day, would love to see property in later spring or summer when everything is green and it's warmer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig is a great host with a beautiful property. This was our 3rd visit, and it was just as lovely as the last two. check-in and check-out are easy and convenient. the house is always impeccably clean with good amenities like appliances, basic condiments, and bottled water. We will book with Craig again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed with Craig several times. It was great again and is always absolutely perfect. We are planning our next stay already.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed with Craig several time and it has never disappointed us in any way. Super quite and clean. The internet is great if you need to work or play. They always have basic items to use to get you started. We already have our next stay scheduled. Thanks for being such a great host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful cabin with gorgeous views. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The views and privacy was really nice. We were there to visit with our son so we didn’t get to enjoy all the amenities offered but could easily spend a long weekend just hanging around the house and enjoying them. Great place and hosts!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been to this location several times over the years. it is a great, peaceful getaway for me and my wife. The hosts are very accommodating and friendly. They continue to make updates to the cabin and the property. The place is well kept and has everything we need to enjoy your time. The fishing was fantastic, and the hiking trails are well maintained. There is plenty of wildlife to go around and enjoy. If you are interested in getting away to relax this location is ideal."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here several times because it fits exactly what at we are looking for in a resort. It has beautiful peaceful surroundings with a well kept house and friendly hosts to work with. We enjoy fishing and the lake usually cooperative for that. We only have to bring our own food as the kitchen is fully stocked with everything we need. It is just a wonderful places to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful piece of paradise! The guesthouse was beautiful, clean & very well stocked. Craig was very responsive. We had a wonderful time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was just what we were looking for. Craig and Neneth have thought about all the things a visitor might need. The rooms were well-appointed and, it looks, recently updated. The property was well taken care of, which is difficult with so many acres. We took a morning walk and were able to see a doe with her fawn and a raccoon headed to its den for the day. I was so pleased with our stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about my stay! Craig and Naneth were wonderful. They greeted me when I arrived, treated me to some delightful garden produce and a nice tour of the home.
From that point on I did not see them again. They were very respectful of my stay and aside from them telling me they would be there and to let them know if I needed anything, I felt as if I were alone on the property. It was wonderful, peaceful, and very relaxing! I highly recommend if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy the quiet of the country!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very charming and peaceful location. The place was VERY clean. Kitchen was well stocked with essentials. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about our stay was great! The house were wonderful. The cabin and surrounding area was wonderful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you just need to get to a quiet place and enjoy peace of mind in a tranquil setting this place is perfect my wife particilarly loved the sounds of nature at night ... The screened in patio area was perfection.. A wonderful little slice of country heaven
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay with Craig and Neneth! It was a beautiful, quiet property- perfect for a break from the city. They were available for anything needed but also also ensured we had privacy. We hope to return sometime soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig and Neneth's place was incredible! It was a gorgeous place to spend two relaxing nights.
Our GPS was a little wonky getting there, it actually took us past the place, but Craig was so responsive that we were able to figure it out quickly, with no time lost.
We cooked a lot and the kitchen was great! It had basic spices and anything else you may need, although you may want to bring a sharp knife with you.
They provided flower guides and posters with local birds to recognize. They also had bug spray which we used for our walk around the property.
It was a fantastic visit and we hope to go back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Craig was helpful and accommodating. The place is very clean and organized.
We recommend this place for those looking for a great and relaxing retreat. We will definitely come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our short summer stay at this tranquil getaway. Highly recommend staying here; Craig was lovely and so helpful and attentive, ensuring ease of check-in and if I had any questions. Gorgeous lake and a magical night walk through the forest trails.
And we would definitely come back in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far the cleanest and most well appointed Airbnb I’ve stayed at. They have everything you could want or need stocked up, from olive oil to bug spray. Craig and Neneth were super nice. Craig gave us a tour of the place when we got there, and that was the last we saw of him lol. You’d never know they lived next door. The lake house is definitely secluded and quiet. We went there for the 4th of July to get away from the fireworks and it was perfect for that. The Jon boat with electric motor was great and we caught plenty of fish. I walked through the woods around the property almost everyday, which was relaxing. T-mobile service is 50% non-existent and 50% 1 bar. They do have wi-fi but it is slow, and you’ll have to bring a device if you want to stream anything on tv because they only have satellite tv service. The only thing I’d change is the mattress was a bit firm for me. I can definitely see why people stay here over and over again. I probably will too!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magical. Stay here!! You won’t regret it.
Inside is immaculately clean.
Outside is spiritual. Enjoy the sounds of nature and the hiking trails. Perfect."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a lovely, peaceful retreat! The house was the best stocked of all vacation rentals I have ever been in. Criag thinks of everything - lots of cold water bottles in the frig, picnic supplies for our group dinner - you name it, they either have it or will lend it to you from their home next door. We felt very welcomed while they also gave us privacy - the perfect combo. The only downside were the gnats (we were the in early June). They we pretty prolific and made the idea of enjoying the lake and the walking trails less appealing. But I understand they don't stay long. I highly recommend Craig's place."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craigs and Neneth have a gorgeous place. Very quiet and peaceful. We will be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig and Neneth are wonderful hosts and their cooking facilities in the cabin are always very clean and well kept. Sitting on the deck and looking out over the lake and beautiful flowered grounds is so relaxing. They even provide paths to take walks through the woods. The boats and docks on the lake are in good working order and easy to use. There were gnats this week for the first time but they had spray available or even head covers available. Everything in the house that you will need is available and well planned. You only need to bring your own food.and drink. We always enjoy our stay and always look forward to coming again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here multiple times and always worth it. Love the view and only hearing nature all day and night.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and it was every bit as homey and comfortable as the previous year. The hosts are very thoughtful about providing kitchen accessories, bathroom necessities, and plenty of clean towels and blankets."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The third time we have stayed with Craig. Everything was great and Craig responded within minutes via the Air BNB app. It is a touch remote but still only 12 minutes to Abingdon. We had great breakfasts at Caroline's and a fun time bowling at Abbey Lanes. We will be back if Craig will have us.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, as always!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay every time. Such a gracious host and an amazing place.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the only AirBnB we have ever been to but it is clean and comfortable and the host and his wife are terrific people to work with. This is our third visit and I couldn’t ask for a nicer place to visit. We are coming back again next year.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome quiet, clean and comfortable. Enjoyed a walk around the pond. Spotted deer, wood ducks and enjoyed beautiful landscaping and wild plants. Home decorated with wildlife ID pictures and books."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"A+ stay. 6 of us stayed comfortably with so much room for cooking, board games, walks, kayaking etc. The guest home has it all! Bring all your food and booze before you get there. C- grocer is 15min away and the A+ grocer is 30min away. Take advantage of all the amenities. The grounds are gorgeous and a great getaway from the city life."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is amazing and the host Craig is very nice as well. He gave us a personal tour of the property and they had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The kids had a blast playing in the swing, hiking through the forest seeing deer and playing near the lake. However, the best hit was kayaking and boating in the private lake. It was peaceful and refreshing to stay in such a beautifuland peaceful place! Definitely want to go back there again with more time to spend there."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Only great things to say about staying at Craig and Neneth’s guest house. It’s a perfect location for a true. We spent time enjoying the screened in porch, getting lost in the trails, and enjoying the boats. The kitchen had everything we needed. We hope to come back to see the property in different seasons!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"“Nature At Its Finest!” Unbelievable Flower Garden’s… Natures Trails…. Private Lake!!! Such a Beautiful & Spiritual Awakening…. “It was an A’Maz’ing “Mother-Daughter-Granddaughter Retreat Weekend!” This was the Perfect Place to reflect on all of Our Life’s Blessings…. Swimming, Fishing, Kayaking, Boating, Hiking, Wildlife “&” more!!! The house was perfect! Everything for us & more. The screened in porch was sooo picturesque! We “Will” be back!!! What a Great Find “&” EASY to get to👍🎉"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! We enjoyed beathtaking views, private walking trails, sounds of nature, all while restoring peace of mind.
Everything one could need was available. All we had to bring was food to cook and anything we wanted to drink. Next time, and there will be a next time, we will plan for a longer stay.
Thanks so much, Craig, for listing this hidden gem.
Deb & Jon"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was very nice and quiet. Everything was clean and tidy and the host was very welcoming.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great as it always is.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love Craig’s guest house. It is the perfect location for a relaxing weekend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great 2 bedroom cabin. Bey clean and accommodating. They views and property are beautiful. It is a great place to get away from it all.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. Home was very clean and organized. They hosts are very accommodating and quick to help if there were any questions. The pond is nice, I caught Bass, Crappie and Bluegill. Highly recommend a stay here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful experience for the whole family. Bullfrog catching, fishing, took out the Jon boat, walked the trails, and enjoyed the wildlife book provided. Definitely recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! What an amazing experience! My family (myself, wife, 2 year old daughter) had the best time here. Craig is an amazing host and has the best set up. We felt like we were in our own private island. The space is beautiful and it was a perfect getaway. You’ve got to stay here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig’s guest house is beautiful. The grounds are immaculately kept and it feels like you’re staying in a park. The guest house is next to the main house, connected by a deck walkway, but it really felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The screened in porch overlooking the lake was our favorite spot—perfect for morning coffee. We saw deer every day, as well as so many birds—including hummingbirds and orioles. We also fished in the pond quite a bit and caught a fair amount of fun-sized largemouth bass (which is what we were fishing for) as well as a couple black crappie (all catch and release). Craig even had a jon boat with a trolling motor ready for us to use. We went to the other side of the pond one evening and caught a bunch of bass. So fun! We also hiked the trail around the pond and through the woods—again, maintained as well as most city parts. The house is pretty remote though, with limited cell signal. It’s about 15-20 to a nearby small town via gravel roads. But it was a nice getaway with lots to do. I will mention we struggled to get my wife in her wheelchair up the three stairs to the deck, to get in the house. We brought a portable ramp, but it was more steep than I anticipated. Not Craig’s fault though. This house didn’t claim to be ADA compliant, but I figured it would work well enough for our needs. And once inside, it did. I’m just not sure I’d be able to return here with my wife and her wheelchair. Still a 5-star stay. Such a peaceful and serene setting."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most peaceful getaway. This was our second time and we will definitely be back again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peace, beautiful flora and fauna are exquisite at this place. An immaculate home with every detail provided. Loved our stay--it was perfect and wonderful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a peaceful experience to decompress from life’s demands.
As it turned out, I couldn’t have chosen a more ideal experience with that end in mind.
My daughter and son-in-law stayed there and highly recommended it. Glad I took their advice.
The hosts were warm and friendly.
Craig walked me through everything.
The house was incredibly well stocked and just immaculately kept as was the entire property.
There’s a walk-out sliding glass door on the lower level directly below the screened-in porch facing the lake.
The property was beyond belief in that I felt such a tranquil vibe. It’s a large property that’s landscaped to perfection. The wildlife is abundant and the fishing was incredible.
I had exclusive access to two small boats; one with an electric trolling motor.
The pond/lake has an abundant supply of nice fish.
I caught easily over 50 fish; mostly large mouth bass.
The property is literally a very secluded oasis in the middle of nowhere.
The screened-in porch is like a wildlife show with a crescendo of soothing wildlife sounds that increase as day turns into night. It’s a second-floor elevation that’s difficult for the animals to see you because of the screen. There were constant visits by deer walking past the porch and they weren’t skittish in the least.
I was able to park a few feet from the front door, which was very convenient.
I will definitely book another stay this year."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location, the property, and the home are all amazing!! This is our second stay on this property and we look forward to visiting again for many years to come. The home is spotlessly clean and extremely well equipped. All the furniture and the beds are all very comfortable. The property is a slice of heaven and the view from the screened in porch is stunning. It’s a joy to wake up and enjoy our coffee while watching deer with babies walking through the yard along with squirrels, raccoons and a myriad of birds. The catch and release fishing in the pond is excellent and the use of the skiff or kayak gives you an even more intimate experience of the environment. Craig is very responsive to any questions or needs and provided necessary information due to storms and weather concerns. During our stay it felt like we had the entire property to ourselves as we rarely saw our host even though the main home is just next door. If you are looking for comfort with peace and quiet you will find it here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second visit to Craig’s resort and it certainly won’t be our last. The facilities are great and the grounds are well kept. You can totally relax, hike around the woods , fish, or birdwatch. Everything is at your own pace. Craig always makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. Highly recommended."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We caught 52 fish! Such a beautiful scenery! What more can you ask for! Great relaxation and very accommodating with the guest house!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the guest house for a long weekend. Craig was a great host, met me for check-in and showed me the very well stocked house.
The location is beautiful- we enjoyed the lake, the trails through the woods, the porch and the well equipped kitchen. Everything was comfortable and clean. A great way to get away from it all."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a peaceful location. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best place for anyone that want peace, quiet, and serenity! Excellent fishing! Caught 24 fish in 2 days, including a 7 pound bass! Guesthouse was immaculate! Hosts very friendly! Nature sounds in the morning while having coffee n the screen porch! Beautiful view! Will return for sure!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig and Neneth were very friendly and quick to provide any help we needed. The guest house was clean and fully stocked. Couldn't have asked for more. Would love to be back to spend some more time around the lake.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Craig was helpful right away in giving a tour of the place. He was quick to respond to messages. The place was very clean and fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. The atmosphere was serene and so peaceful. Trails are cleared and easy to walk and follow. We will definitely be back.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is gorgeous, and Craig is a wonderful host. The guest house is right next to the main house, but the hosts respect the privacy of their guests. We stayed for a book lover's weekend, and we appreciated the stocked, clean, and beautiful accommodations."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, and well stocked! We enjoyed our time there. It is quiet and away from noise. The only thing that surprised us was that the owners are literally next door. We knew they would be on the same property, but didn't know they would be so close. They were great though and left us alone but were willing to talk if we initiated it. We were able to enjoy a couple days of quiet away from city noise and take walks in the woods. It gave us the break we were looking for."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig is a great host. He communicated with us leading up to our stay and was flexible with our arrival time, as we were visiting family nearby for Christmas. The property is beautiful, clean and peaceful. Lots of wildlife around the lake and plenty of space to explore and enjoy. Would love to return in the summer to do some fishing and boating. My family lives in Roseville, the next town over, and they were so excited to learn about Craig's place for future visits or family get togethers. We hope to return in the future."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place, view, people. So worth staying here!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has become our home away from home. We could not ask for better hosts or a more peaceful retreat for us! ❤️🙏🏼
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Third time staying here. Able to get out on the lake this time on the boat - great time! So nice and relaxing inside and out.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you arrive you will marvel at how well everything is kept up and how welcome you are made to feel. Craig is truly a super host! All of the amenities are supplied so you only need to bring food and drink. There are walking paths, a lake and two small boats, flowers, and often deer and turkeys. You can be active or just sit and read. We are coming again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 3rd or 4th time (I can’t keep track) staying at the property and I know we will be back again and again! It’s the perfect distance from the QC and they have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and memorable. The kitchen and bathroom is stocked with must haves and I love the extra touches such ice cube trays filled, bottled water cold in the fridge, bathroom stocked with extra toothbrushes etc. The beds are comfortable and the house is always spotless.
We love this property because it has a private pond which has a lot of fish (bluegill, bass and crappy) and you are almost guaranteed to catch at least 1 fish! This trip we caught at least 30 fish (I’m talking 1 to 2 lb bass). We had use of the boat with a trolling motor and kayak along with 2 piers to fish off of. In addition to fishing, they have a beautiful gardens on their property and a walking path that is a must. It took us 30 min to walk on the path so it’s great to get your steps in!
Craig is very quick to respond to messages and questions. His property is a family favorite and a place we plan on returning soon. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect host, perfect accommodations, perfect surroundings. I’m already planning a return trip."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig and the location, absolutely amazing. I wished I booked til instead of Sunday."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I now know what a Super Host means! The bar is high. Craig's place is amazing. Clean, inviting, tasteful, thoughtful, peaceful, comfortable. My family and I wanted for nothing during our visit. The grounds are spectacular and the house it too. Thank you Craig and Neneth we truly appreciated all the care and thoughfulness you put into being hosts."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig is a fantastic host with a lovely place!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb experience we've had yet, and we've had plenty. Craig and Neneth met us upon our arrival. They showed us the guesthouse and then left us to enjoy our stay. The place was clean, more well-stocked than any other rental, and the private lake was so great. We fished and made use of the boat and trolling motor that the hosts graciously allowed us to use. The patio was also very relaxing. Communication was top-notch, and they clearly cared about our happiness and enjoyment of nature."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is by far the best airbnb we've ever rented. The property is magnificent—even more beautiful than the photos suggest. Craig maintains the land and home in perfect condition. There's an amazing garden right outside the guest house door and the calming lake is just steps away. If you're looking for peace and quiet and a respite from the energy of everyday life, this is your ideal place."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was great. The house was really nice. Although it’s a drive to town, the flower gardens, lake and house were well worth it. I would love to go back again for a longer stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Great host.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig was awesome to work with!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful, relaxing stay and we had a wonderful time. The home was incredibly clean. Craig was very helpful, responsive and accommodating. We loved the private lake and were able to use the boat and kayak. We watched the sunset out on the lake and loved the screen patio at night. We saw deer, baby fawns, raccoons, hawks, cardinals, chipmunks and more. We caught lots of fish for catch and release the next morning. There is also a beautiful hiking trail. Thank you for our stay. We had a wonderful time."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible stay!! Screened in porch allows for the incredible sounds of nature!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As advertised and overall excellent quality, beautiful property, peaceful surroundings and great provisions. The owners live nearby but are discreet and not obtrusive. Rather they are hospitable and helpful when needed and are careful to give you your space so you can relax and enjoy your time. They allowed us to use all their lake equipment (and kept charging the boat battery for my son), they keep their property very well maintained, the house so comfortable and peaceful and the walks through the timber were relaxing. We saw lots of wildlife and made lots of new family memories. Highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I loved this guest house. Craig was very nice, he showed us around and even set up the boat so we could use it during our stay. The place was very clean and we felt very comfortable the whole time we were there. This is definitely an Aribnb we'll be returning to in the future."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely spectacular! The cabin is comfortable and very clean. Craig was an attentive and friendly host. And the property is spectacular. We enjoyed vibrant night sounds and a gorgeous sunrise hike along mowed trails. The woods were in full bloom and so lovely! We will be back for sure!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Craig is a wonderful host very accommodating. The property is well maintained and well stocked. Craig has thought of everything and has gone to great lengths to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible. It is great to see all of the wildlife in the area as well. The lake is one of the best parts. Walmart and Target are about 30 min away so I would suggest getting what you need first. Craig’s place is great for anyone that enjoys nature and wants to get away from the sometime stressful “city life”
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place is AMAZING! It was my second time staying here and I hope not my last. The house was thoughtfully designed, with everything you would need conveniently there for you. Ice cold water bottles, tooth brushes and toothpaste, Starbucks coffee, and lots of fresh towels and linens! The property is also beautiful. Overall amazing."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The peace and quiet of this country setting is perfect! The guest house has a wonderful screened porch with beautiful views of the lovely yard and a small private lake. We enjoyed reading there in the sun, observing several different kinds of birds, and listening to the bird calls. There are trails in the meadow and adjoining woods for relaxing walks. We could also have used the rowboat or the kayak, but we chose to just relax and take long walks. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked and the beds were very comfortable. We appreciated the bottled water in the refrigerator and the good coffee in the cabinet. We brought in our own food for our evening meal and our morning breakfast, so we wouldn’t have to leave and miss any of the peace and quiet."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here - and that is consistent with all of the great reviews! Well maintained inside and out. Walking around the lake and in the woods was so pleasant and relaxing. Red winged blackbirds, geese and a heron all there by the lake. All good, all good."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig’s guest house is the perfect retreat for a quiet, relaxing weekend. It was exceptionally clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The actual guest house was better than the pictures!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best getaway spot! It's secluded right on a lake. It's so quiet you can think out there. All the wild life is amazing. We sat in the screen porch at night just listening to all the different animals. Nice trails, and we found a great spot on the other side of the lake to just hang out and have a picnic. Absolutely breathtaking."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place with a private lake. We watched Canada geese land and takeoff and honk. All sorts of animal sounds at dusk - very cool. I definitely recommend a stay here.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was hands down the best rental I've ever had. Craig and Neneth put in so much thought into making our stay comfortable. The house was spotless and had all the things you need to feel at home away from home. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked. They had games and a useful book about birds. They equipped the home with nice things, so we felt like we were really at home...not at a rental. The home is situated in front of a beautiful lake, next to amazing woods. We used the kayak and row boat, hiked, used the fire pit. Craig took us out for a tour of the woods and we had a great connection with him about nature and all the animals and plants on the property. He showed amazing hospitality and kindness. We encountered all kinds of wildlife, including deer, all kinds of birds, and even coyotes. We really felt like we had a little piece of heaven all to ourselves. Through our encounters with Craig and his family, and with the nature surrounding us 24/7, we left better people than we arrived as. Thank you, Craig and Neneth for a truly memorable stay."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved it here. Great place to unwind and get away from city life.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will definitly love this place. It is off the beaten path but it is soooo worth the trip ! You will get a chance to unplug & plug back into yourself or family ! This is life changing experience one worth your time & money !
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for seclusion and catching wild life in action if your patient enough, also loved the property size it was lot to look at"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The guest house is as good as advertised. The place was very clean and quiet, and the trails around the lake are beautiful. We really enjoyed our time here."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third time staying here and as always everything is perfect! Thanks again guys! Hope to see you next year!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just what we needed; places to what and explore in the woods and prairie, comfortable home with everything we needed, great hospitality. We will be coming back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely thoughtful, clean, well stocked place to stay on beautiful grounds."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently returned from Craig's BEAUTIFUL guest house after a 4 night stay. Upon arrival Craig was there to greet us and take us inside to show us EVERYTHING necessary for our stay. We could not believe how wonderfully decorated and CLEAN this home was. The setting and view of the stunning yard and lake was picture perfect. It was also so peaceful. We enjoyed walking on the trails around the lake and in the woods every evening and seeing all the deer. We also made a fire in the fire pit provided each evening. Craig made sure it would be easy to start the fire with DRY kindling and logs. We enjoyed watching the Presidential recaps on the satellite TV. Don't worry about forgetting anything as they provide anything you could think of. The bed was so comfortable as were the sheets, blankets and pillows. We have stayed at many home rentals and this was one of the BEST. This trip was wonderful and we could not have picked a more perfect place to stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and stylish!! Beautiful view of the lake. Hosts are soooo kind and accommodating. It was a very nice place to stay. Only complaint was weird furnace noises - even so the space is beautiful and well worth the money, especially for more than 2 people (there are multiple nice bedrooms and lots of space). Every corner of the house is cared for, cleaned, and stylish. Very nice place to stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent three nights at Craig and Neneth's place in western Illinois. Surrounded by a forest with wonderful hiking trails and a lake right in front of the guest house, this made for a fantastic experience. Our hosts have thought of everything and I almost wish that I had forgotten something just to be amazed that they had anticipated this! It is an exceptionally comfortable and pristinely clean rental and the communication with Craig is prompt, pleasant, and always helpful. If you are looking for a place to escape where you can hike, swim, fish, boat, study nature, or simply sit on the fantastic screened-in porch reading or gazing at the lake, this is without doubt the place. We are so pleased that we visited Craig and Neneth's place and recommend it without hesitation. We sincerely hope we get the opportunity to visit again. Thank you!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The view is very pretty. The walking trails around the property were very nice. The house is very nice. All in all a very relaxing time!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our third stay at this property and it was perfect as usual. An absolutely fantastic getaway.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig and Nedeth have a great place! They kept it well prepared for anything you might need or forgot on your trip. The walk through the woods was amazing and we hope to return!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little bit of heaven tucked away in the farmlands exceeded our expectations. So private and relaxing. The view from the front room and screened in porch of the little lake is wonderful. Sometimes we just sat and read and watched the birds. But there's a great oak and chestnut woods to wander around in for hours, if you wish. Craig was very helpful, and available but left us to be on our own, which is what we wanted. Perfection."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place exceeds every expectation. The location is gorgeous and the paths around the property are perfect for some light exploring. The screened in porch quickly became our favorite place to hang out and listen to the sounds of nature around us. Craig was a wonderful host and truly made us feel right at home. We would absolutely stay here again!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing and the perfect retreat to get away from the city for a few days. Our hosts were super accommodating, friendly, and very helpful. The house had everything we needed and we spent many enjoyable hours out on the screened in porch or outside in front of the fire. The landscaping and private trails on the property are beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed hiking them. I hope to come back one day soon."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! This sparkling clean getaway guest house had the most incredible views, was wonderfully comfortable, and equipped with everything I needed (and more besides). The perfect space for a retreat; exactly what I had hoped for. I loved it."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our time at Craig’s place. Our 9 year old boy loved swimming and fishing in the lake as well as exploring the grounds. The house was spacious, comfortable and Craig provided pretty much everything we needed. It’s the perfect city escape and we will definitely be coming back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful space with great view, great outdoor, privacy, nature sounds, amenities, and relaxing."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay! The property is beautiful, nice trails to walk and a lovely home. Craig was very communicative and helpful. Highly recommended!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to go for a quiet, peaceful vacation. A beautiful guest house that will exceed your expectations both inside and out. We were sad when our trip was over and will plan for a longer return visit in the near future."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great trip. Nice walking trails, lots of blackberries to pick, and we enjoyed fishing on the pond."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig’s guest house was the perfect secluded and peaceful getaway we were looking for!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this beautiful home. Gorgeous scenery, clean, great amenities, beautifully decorated. Craig was a great host. I will definitely return and recommend to anyone."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is beautiful. It has everything you need for. Comfortable stay. The kids loved the swings and picking wild berries. My husband loved the fishing and I enjoyed the peace in this place. I would definitely go back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. The trails and lake are beautiful. Saw a wild turkey, a snapping turtle, frogs and fish. The house was so clean and they had everything you could need. I overpacked and ended up not needing half the stuff I brought. Craig and his wife were so kind and flexible. I will definitely be coming back in the fall."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Craig’s place was the absolutely perfect pandemic getaway from city life. It had everything we were craving for a summer escape to nature. The home was perfectly clean and had all the kitchen and bath amenities of home allowing us to cook all our meals seamlessly including access to a grill. We’d recommend a stay here and can’t wait to come back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great space! The hospitality was wonderful and they were very welcoming and showed us around. The screened in porch was such an amazing aspect to sit out in the morning and drink coffee. So many extra touches that you don’t usually see in other Airbnbs. I can’t wait to go back and explore the area more!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very private and beautiful area to stay in. The check in and check out was easy. Didn’t see the home owners again after check in so it felt very secluded. Beautiful pond with tons of wildlife in the area. Not a ton of place to eat unless you drive 15-25 minutes so it is easier to just bring your own food. The hiking is fun. It’s in the country so bring bug spray (in summer). Would definitely stay here again!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This really is a magical place. This was our second stay, and we will be back. If you are looking to slow down and drink in quiet in a gorgeous setting, this is a wonderful choice."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked this guest house based on reviews saying it was a ""hidden gem"" and they were not wrong! This guest house has the most beautiful view of a private lake, a large yard (with a great swing out back which was a happy surprise for my toddler who has been missing the playgrounds!), and our stay was outstanding. The house is very well kept and cozy, and has the most amazing views from the screened in porch. We loved eating meals while listening to the birds and watching the deer. The property has beautifully mowed walking trails and acres of woods to explore. The private dock was also a great place to sit and watch the water, along with a sea kayak and the floats we brought. The water wasn't great for swimming, but the cool breeze from the water along with all the other great things the property has to offer, it wasn't missed! We brought a kiddie pool anyways and had a blast in the yard. Craig was always quick with responses and tips for exploring. We look forward to returning for another trip soon, we all had a blast!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Third time and will be visiting again, lots of new additions to the property. Overall excellent!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hosts are accommodating and friendly. The lake and surrounding areas are lovely. Great spot for fishing and hiking.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a magical time. Truly relaxing.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful property. It was a very relaxing escape from today's environment. They provide most anything that you may have forgotten to bring with. If you love nature as I do this is the place for you. Many different types of plants and wild life also trails to explore around the property. Please note that the owners share the property which was not a problem for us as they were accommodating.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The pictures just do not do this property justice. We spent 12 beautiful days enjoying the amazing views, sounds and all the animals. The home is very clean, well decorated, very comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen and bathrooms....Craig and Naneth have thought of every convenience to make our stay carefree. The pictures just do not do justice to the actual beauty of the property! Every corner of the property has a surprise waiting for you if you are just willing to get out and explore.....sometimes the surprises come to the house! We loved seeing, hearing and experiencing all the wildlife. We look forward to staying here for years to come."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and just as expected!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, very nice grounds, clean great tv channels comfortable beds"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Craig's place was our first Airbnb experience. We were amazed when we arrived because the pictures don't do this place as much justice as it deserves! Our stay was immaculate in all ways! The guest house was clean, stocked with ALL the essentials, and the perfect getaway for our family! We will definitely be returning in the future!!!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a pleasure to stay here.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! We keep coming back because it is relaxing and secluded. A place to escape.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd time staying and this time we brought the kids. Craig had the boat ready for us and we had a great time fishing. We grilled and had a nice family dinner, enjoyed walking on the grounds and exploring. We were allowed to stay later to extend our fishing and on the way out Craig have us a dozen farm fresh eggs! They are very nice and accommodating, respond quickly and take pride in their property. We can’t wait to return!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you want to just get away to some quiet....and be right on the water....this is it. Very private and hosts are awesome. They supply anything you could want (including a washer and dryer).
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Craig's place to stay as a quick get-away before our daughter went back to college. We were not disappointed. Craig met us as soon as we pulled in and gave us a quick tour. The house was spotless and comfortable. Completely stocked with everything we needed. Mornings were spent on the screened in porch, enjoying the view of the lake and the sounds of nature. We brought our own recreational kayaks but spent more time in Craig's rowboat, trolling around the lake. Fishing was incredible. We could have spent another day just exploring the property. Nature at it's best. It was the perfect weekend to just unwind. We will definitely return."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular setting offered a serene retreat for our visit with family. Craig and his wife were gracious, thoughtful and all around nice. Private Pond/Lake views are beautiful!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful area, clean, comfortable space where you can just relax and take in the scenery. The house is well appointed with amenities like shampoo and lotion, coffee, bottled water and bug spray for walks. The hosts are kind and welcoming and everything was a breeze. It's really a lovely escape to the middle of feels like nowhere - but you only here bees and birds and the wind, which is a welcome respite."
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous property inside and out, wonderful amenities and quiet hosts.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Craig's place is amazing! The property is beautiful and so well maintained. The views and landscaping will have you in awe. We recently stayed with our children who loved the lake! They fished non stop. We brought our inflatable kayaks and paddled around the lake. It is the perfect size for kids or beginners! Craig and Neneth were very friendly and gracious hosts. Neneth even helped the kids with some fishing tips! We were so surprised by all the extras this house was stocked with! Farm fresh eggs, water bottles, coffee, spices, papers goods, shampoo/conditioner, soap, bandaids (and more)….pretty much anything you might forget, Craig had it there in the home. He even had life jackets and mosquito netting!!
The nature trails were a nice touch...not too long or buggy. I walked them with my 4 year old. Everything about this property was perfect. If you are looking for a secluded get away to relax, this is the perfect place!!!!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time at the lake house but this time I brought my kids. Craig & his wife made sure to provide everything the kids may have needed & they also took the time to teach us how to fish. My kids haven’t stopped talking about the lake house yet lol. This is definitely one of our favorite Airbnb. Thanks, Craig."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a gem of a find. A place to relax in the tranquility that nature has to provide. Craig is an excellent host. We will return when we have more time. You will not be disappointed.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just left after our second stay in this sparkling clean and very well-kept guest house. We're already feeling a bit homesick for this private and special spot. This guest house has the most magical porch overlooking the lake. We brought all sorts of food and planned these intricate meals in the very well-stocked kitchen. The porch beckoned and many of our culinary ambitions dissolved into just enjoying all the beauty around us, which is just what we needed. No photo could do it justice - you simply need to be there yourself. Excellent spot for painters, birders, hikers, and those who love fishing. My husband caught a truly astonishing number of fish. Cozy beds await you after a hard day of relaxing. Craig and Neneth are such kind and helpful hosts. Can't wait to plan our next trip away."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig is an amazing host with his quick responses and lots of perfect details. The property is absolutely gorgeous and made for a great get away.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was gorgeous! We felt like we had our own little bit of paradise for a couple days. Amazing views, walking path, plant and wildlife, etc."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely fabulous place to stay! Exceptionally clean and wonderful extra touches throughout! We only wish we could have stayed longer! This is amazingly quiet and beautiful! You will definitely enjoy your stay!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don't hesitate to book this place, quickly! It was a phenomenal experience and property with amazing hosts.
I was visiting for my daughter's graduation from WIU and this was the perfect location, only 35 minutes from campus, and like a private retreat. The house was very comfortable, had so many thoughtful amenities throughout the house, not to mention the view. You definitely don't find a gorgeous view like that often, especially when paired with a great place to stay with gracious hosts. It's off the beaten path and so worth it. I felt at home during my brief stay and would highly recommend it to others. Don't give it a second thought, book it today as I feel my stay was worth 6 stars. Thanks Craig for the awesome experience."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! Craig and his wife met us personally for check in, showing us around the guest house and property. We just adored the property, so green, lush and quiet. We enjoyed the farm fresh eggs, and the kitchen was very well stocked to prepare meals. We were impressed with all of the gadgets offered! Coffee on the screened-in porch was absolutely divine, with plenty of extra blankets to keep us warm on the cool May mornings. All of the space was sparkling clean, and plenty of extra linens for a long stay (we only got to enjoy two nights, but wished for more!). Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we’ve stayed at Craig’s place. Second time was just as positive of an experience as the first.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Our short stay in this guest house was simply AMAZING. Craig & his wife are great hosts & provided more amenities than than we expected. The guest house is spacious & the views are beautiful. The sounds of nature were overwhelming & calming. This was a much needed break from the hustle & bustle of city life! We will definitely be returning before the year ends. Thank you for your hospitality!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,We spent a week at Craig's house while visiting our son who attends Monmouth College. What a great week! While out of the way the location is still easy enough to get to and convenient enough to several of the smaller towns in the area that travel was easy. The fishing in the lake and the hiking in the nearby woods was a great way to spend time with family and friends. Will definitely be back!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is amazing. It was even better than we thought it was going to be!! Really hope to be back again soon.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can not say enough great things about Craig, his wife and their home! The setting is so peaceful and picturesque! The trails were well maintained and fairly flat-- perfect for our jogging stroller. The guest house was meticulously clean and had anything you could ever think of!
We enjoyed hiking on the property, visiting Camp's Orchard down the road, and stopping at the Amish grocery store outside of town for the BEST homemade donuts!! Would stay again in a heartbeat!
Thanks, again!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing and peaceful weekend. The photos are extremely accurate, the surroundings are spectacular and this is a great location to unwind and let go of stress. Craig and Neneth have thought of everything you could possibly need."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This beautiful property was a great, relaxing family getaway from our crazy lives. We enjoyed hiking and sitting on the screened in porch overlooking the lake.

Our daughter was so excited to see a river otter during our stay. It was just what my family needed!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Craig’s place was awesome! The property itself was so stunning. They have their own property away from all the hustle and bustle. On the property, there are trails, a lake, and they even have benches throughout to sit and take in all the beauty. The guest house has a great screened in porch with a view. The beds were comfortable and towels were very soft. Craig was always available if we needed him and responded very fast. They are such great people! Before we left, we talked to them for a while and had such a great time. If we didn’t live out of state we would be back as soon as possible. Next time were in the area, we will be sure to stay with Craig! Thank you for everything!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Going to Craig's home was a beautiful getaway. We enjoyed the hiking and quiet, and Craig was able to give us some tips on places to eat around the area. He was kind and thoughtful, plus the house was exceptionally clean and had everything we needed. We'll be coming back, for sure!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this place. We loved sitting on the screened in porch and watching the wildlife and enjoying the peace and quiet. Everything was so clean and you can tell by their little touches that they care about their guests. Craig and his wife are wonderful hosts, and will give you all the privacy you want. Such a sweet country gem!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location! Hidden home where you really know you cannot be found! There will be another vacation spent here for sure! Friendly owner ready to help with your stay!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! The definition of ""hidden gem."" If you're a city dweller, this property will feel very far off the beaten path but it is worth the drive! Sparkling clean and comfortable home. Loved the screened in porch with beautiful views. Quiet and peaceful setting with great wildlife watching. Craig and Nenneth are gracious and lovely hosts!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Imagine you need detox from a stressful few months, and you just want to be in nature to relax, fish, hike, or maybe do a bit of birding. This is the place - you can do it all on one property and ignore the rest of the world. That is exactly what we did this past weekend. We brought groceries to cook and grill so we didn't need to leave this slice of heaven. The fishing was so wonderful that my husband doesn't want me to tell you just HOW good. :) Let's just say it exceeded all expectations. Craig and his wife were so helpful, but also were careful to give us privacy. The house is spotless and thoughtfully stocked with necessities in both kitchen and bathrooms. Though there is no WiFi, we easily were able to access the 4G cellular network. There is DirectTV and a large television, though we didn't use it. This well-built house has a huge screened in porch overlooking the lake with a beautiful view. It was our favorite place to eat breakfast and sip coffee. Bedrooms are cozy and well-appointed with fluffy linens and plenty of storage space for luggage. We had asked Craig if he would recommend a nearby corn stand on our way in, but he surprised with fresh and local corn and tomatoes to enjoy with our dinners. We will definitely be back!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house is a great place to enjoy nature, loved watching the hummingbirds and deer as well as fishing. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for cooking and I loved the huge screened in porch!!!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A truly indescribable place hosted by great people. The entire place was a majestic and peaceful experience shared with my loved one. The hosts thought of all details from big to small and even had more to offer! They were extremely accommodating and were very thoughtful. The hiking trail was amazing and sitting by the like was like no other. They are truly great people with an amazing place. We cannot wait to go back again and spend another unique weekend together.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Craig's home is amazing. We enjoyed the quiet beauty of our surroundings. It was a great place to go to relax in peace.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is beautiful! Wonderful if you’d like to be surrounded by nature. There was a lot to do including hiking the trails, fishing, and simply relaxing looking at the wonderful views! The hosts are absolutely amazing!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked this property at the last min...at 9pm the night before our arrival date. We wanted to go on a quick weekend getaway and found the perfect place to get away and unwind. Craig was very responsive, even that late at night and answered all of my questions quickly. From the moment we arrived Craig and his wife were very accommodating. When we arrived they gave us a quick tour of the house which had everything we needed and then some. They had paper plates, disposable cups, napkins, coffee, water bottles and pop in the fridge. There is a gas grill to use and the kitchen has everything you would need to make a meal. The house was very clean and had enough towels, extra blankets and sheets which was nice if you have more people stay.
The property is absolutely serene and beautiful. I can tell that they take great care of their landscaping and gardens. They have a good size pond right on their property with a dock along with hiking trails. My husband and I love to fish so I was pleasantly happy that they let us use their canoe for the weekend. We caught many large bass, crappe and blue gill using lures and bait. It's a great pond to fish in!
One thing to note is that their house is right next door and connected through a deck/walkway. This did not bother us at all since they are very lovely people and gave us our privacy while we were there. We would love to return again soon with our kids...or just another getaway just the two of us! Thank you for letting us stay at your guest house!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was great - hosts are friendly and very hospitable - orienting us what's around towns nearby and of their property. House was very clean! Great place to stay for outdoor lovers!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this place for our first wedding anniv. Grateful to our outstanding hosts. They were very thoughtful about me and my wife who’s pregnant at the moment. It’s very thoughtful of them to even bring my wife some mangoes. They are also very hospitable to show us around their huge property. They made sure that we are comfortable and have everything that we may need. Perfect getaway place to refresh from busy work schedule. It’s so quiet that my wife and I were able to talk about us and spend time with each other. There’s a lot of things to do too like fishing, grilling, hiking. Wife and i are planning to bring our bow and arrow next time. Highlight for us is the over-looking lake view from the living area. That satisfied us to just stay on the couch and watch the view outside or occasionally watch a movie. Will definitely book this place again with our family."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an oasis in the middle of corn country! Unfortunately we really were only staying the night to attend our son's graduation a d then go back to Chicago. We didn't get anytime to enjoy the lovely screened in porch overlooking the lake or any of the hiking trails. The stars overhead were beautiful though! I can't recommend staying here enough, especially if you want a respite from the city. It's completely isolated and quiet in beautiful pastoral countryside. Just don't forget to go grocery shopping before you head towards it as there isn't a store for miles. If we ever find ourselves in the area again, we will absolutely stay again!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay, the host was very accommodating and genuinely wanted to make our stay enjoyable, they are really great people. The house was very clean and had everything we needed, including great climate control. I used the nature trails on the property (saw an abundance of wildlife). I didn't get a chance to go fishing on the pond, but I will next time. The TV setup was great, one of the best I've seen at an Air B&B. Beds were very comfortable. Outstanding value, highly recommended."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place for staying while visiting kid at Knox! close to stores. Cozy
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Owners are friendly & communicative. Small cute & clean rental home for 2-4 people. Convenient coffee/tea/oatmeal accommodations. The living room is smaller than expected. Had to sit on the floor around the coffee table to play cards/games (as the small dining table is in the kitchen). This is a reminder that most older homes do not have open concept areas for larger crowds over 4 people. I had 6 people one night & we could not fit in the living room together to play board/card/video games, so the next night, we went over to another bigger AirB&B home to hang out. I would recommend owners making use of the empty basement to create into a game room with a pool table, a dart board on the wall, or even a projector screen with a larger couch/reclyners for a movie room. The neighbor's home to the left looked sketchy & I truly didn't feel safe. Even my guests felt uneasy about the neighbor home next door. However, having cameras on the front door & the back door made us feel a bit better."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay. Very clean, great location, fantastic hosts."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for the three of us. My husband and I both had small tables by the king size bed for our cpaps. My brother had a single bed in the other bedroom.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was short so we didn’t make use of the kitchen but it was very clean and seemed well supplied. I appreciated that there were folding stands for suitcases and clear instructions for the thermostat. It happened to be quite hot during our late July stay so we were thankful for the A/C, which worked like a champ. I would definitely recommend Matt and Stephanie’s place if your travels take you to Galesburg, an interesting city with a cool old downtown."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Railroad House was exactly as described. It has a warm and welcoming feeling to the home. Everything was clean and cute. We really enjoyed our stay.

Communication was excellent
Enjoyed our stay"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family stayed at the Farmhouse for 5 days and 4 nights. Our oldest child goes to Knox College. We were in Galesburg to visit. The Farmhouse met our expectations and in some ways exceeded them. The house has a lot of charm. I loved the wooden floors and slightly crooked stairs. I am a fan of older style homes. With that being said, all of the amenities met my expectations. We cooked meals, did a few loads of laundry, and I even worked remotely with good wifi (while on vacation). The neighborhood is peaceful. Both my wife and I went for morning jogs before setting out on our day in Galesburg. The Farmhouse is a short drive to Knox College and main street (maybe 3-4 minutes). I would assume, about a 15-20 minute walk to the campus. Boudewijn was quick to respond if I had a question. When we were in Galesburg again, we will definitely stay at the Farmhouse."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve already booked our next stay. Great place and just as described. We broke a drinking glass while washing dishes and when reached out about it they quickly replied not to worry about it. Great place, great communication.

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Glad to see rentals in the Galesburg area. Nice safe area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is older but that’s what I loved about it. It reminded me of my grandmothers house in Massachusetts. The stairs were steep so be careful. Neighbors were friendly. Quiet neighborhood with stores around the corner. Shower could use a detachable head. We really enjoyed our stay and were much more comfortable than a hotel for the same price. The bedrooms were pretty big for an older house. One bedroom has slanted roofs, we used that for our 1&1/2 yr old. ￼over all we loved our stay and will be back to visit family again. We will check out the other home listed by Boudewijn’s for our future stays."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Super close to Knox College, restaurants and grocery shopping.
The host communicates everything you need to know beforehand to make the stay seamless."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a family gathering and needed a space to accommodate us and our 3 kids. It was perfect! Our 3 and 4 year old loved the little room with the pitched ceiling. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans and spices and the beds and pillows were on the soft side but very comfy. There was a box fan in one bedroom, extra blankets throughout. Towels were high quality. Bathroom was stocked with shampoo/conditioner/body wash & the laundry room had laundry detergent. This is a very old home that has been redone and was very nicely decorated with modern/midcentury touches & everything felt clean.
The area is beautiful, quiet, & great for a wintry stroll down nearby cobblestone streets. We look forward to staying here again next time we visit Galesburg."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough good things about the entire experience. Boudewijn was extremely responsive and the Farmhouse was wonderful. There were plenty of towels and kitchen items. I would highly recommend staying here and if I ever require an AirBnB for myself or guests in the Galesburg area, I will definitely book with Boudewijn again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brothers and I were staying in the area for an extended family reunion. The house and amenities were very satisfactory. I accidentally left something at the house and later, Boudewijn stopped by and mailed the item to me. If we return to Galesburg, I will consider coming back to this Airbnb. Thank you.
-John"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,With few choices for homes it was a pleasure to find this home. It is a little inconvenient to have the bedrooms upstairs and bathroom down but that is how these older homes were made. Kitchen was well equipped. Plenty of towels and dishes. Some plugs were hard to find and lighting could be better in upstairs bedrooms. Window air conditioners upstairs did well when doors were closed.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a small town
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was good place to share the time. Remark: The farm should have at least an additional bathroom.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very stylish farmhouse. It is old but quaint and unique. The home was spotless except for just a few spider webs, (saw no spiders) which can develop in a short period of time. The stairs to the bedrooms are narrow, steep and a tad unlevel. There is a railing and they should be fine for people without mobility issues. Comfortable and well stocked with items you might need. The beds are low to the floor but comfortable. Child loved the ""dormed"" room. Spacious throughout, with a great dining table for 6. The only drawback is the bathroom is downstairs, which in combination with the steep stairs makes going to the bathroom at night more challenging. There are motion lights on the stair steps which help significantly. Nice backyard. Enjoyed our stay there. Really easy access to stores in the community. Was very quiet friendly neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,the host was very helpful and the house was great. everything clean. for sure we would book it again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this property, which has natural “old house” charm but has been thoughtfully renovated in a way that makes it a great rental. I grew up in Galesburg and know the area well. This is a very safe area on a quiet street. It’s easy to get anywhere. Check-in and out was easy and the host was very responsive. The amenities were plentiful - coffee, extra toilet paper, plenty of laundry and dishwasher detergent, etc. Appliances worked as described. Beds were comfortable and the space to work remotely was fantastic (Wi-Fi very fast with no issues). The only things to note for people considering this property is that the stairs to the upstairs that house the bedrooms are old and narrow (which might be hard or precarious for kids and older people), the window units upstairs make the temperature inconsistent when it’s really hot and the only bathroom is on the main level. None of these are dealbreakers, just helpful to know. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at the Farmhouse.
Entrance directions easy, WiFi worked really well and the location is excellent. Nice quiet neighborhood with sidewalks and a convenience store just up the street. The kitchen was lovely, bathroom very clean, plenty of towels and beds were comfortable. Just a note they are low to the ground . Boudewijn was extremely responsive.
Will look forward to a return stay at The Farmhouse."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and accommodating. It was awkward not having a bathroom upstairs with the bedrooms, especially because the stairs were quite steep. Other than that, it was a nice place to be; the kitchen was nice and the living room was comfortable."

The house had everything we needed to feel at home and was close to restaurants and shopping making it easy to eat in our out. We were there to see my son play basketball at Knox. The house was just a mile away from the college but in a super quiet neighborhood. This was my first time using an Airbnb and was such a great experience with our host. Look forward to next year's season.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a great Airbnb!! I would recommend it to anyone in the area who needed a place to stay. The modern updates, ample stock on supplies, and the added comfort items make this house a diamond in the rough. My only complaint is that one of the upstairs' rooms doesn't have AC. Staying in the middle of summer where it's a 100 degrees outside makes the night rough. Owner did provide a box fan which helped. Everything else great! I would stay again for sure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved staying here. Would recommend staying here. Perfect location for the town. Quite neighborhood
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Grandma's Bungalow. It was as awesome as the first stay!
We will always stay at Kelly's place when we visit Galesburg if it's available!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming and very comfortable place to stay. Instructions were extremely clear, and given in a timely manner so we could plan our arrival. Well stocked, with lots of dishes, flatware, pots and pans, and even snacks! The place was spotlessly clean. Lovely plants, interesting books and a good number of towels. Curtains in the bedroom are light, and you might want to bring a sleep mask. Other than that, it was a totally comfy place to stay! Kelly was helpful in answering questions, and even offered to send back an item I forgot. We'll be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"For a host just starting out Kelly knocked it out of the park. The home was incredible, a perfect blend of older craftsmanship with modern conveniences. The porch and swing out front were so peaceful at night to sip a beverage and just relax away the days stresses. We couldn’t have asked for a nicer stay in the Galesburg area. Exceeded our expectations and was a nicer alternative to the hotel game. Well done young lady! We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandma's Bungalow was perfect! It is so charming, like home away from home. Easy check in, comfortable bed, and lots of wonderful amenities. Very reasonably priced.

It was easy to get around town yet we had the beautiful privacy and peaceful surroundings of the farm. The house was clean, comfortable and the kitchen was very well equipped to cook. This was the best equipped kitchen I have ever had in an airbnb. Ruth was helpful with recommendations and easy to communicate with. Great house, great property and great host!

We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Roseville!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay and again Ruth was awesome. Her properties have been spotless, simple in and out, and she goes over and above. She even dropped off a little scooter for my grandson to play with which he loved."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruth was a wonderful host who communicated well with her clients. She was very communicative, friendly, and caring. She exemplified this in multiple ways, the most notable being the offer to go shopping for us in order that we may have groceries at the farmhouse, due to the fact that our plane was delayed nearly 4 hours flying into Moline.
Ruth keeps a very clean house who has thought of pretty much everthing you may need while you stay on the farm. If you had forgotten a few basic essentials in your packing, there is a really good chance she has some on hand for you to use.
The farmhouse is clean, comfortable, and peaceful. We stayed there for 5 days. We enjoyed the mornings with the birds chirping in the trees and the opportunity to just relax in the clean, secure, and comfortable surroundings.
I would highly recommend the Farmhouse as a place to stay if you are visiting the surrounding communities and are looking for a clean and comfortable place to call ""home"" for the time away."

I will definitely be back!"

Stay here - i promise you wont regret it!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though the homes were not our own, we all felt cozy, comfortable, and welcome. We will be staying here again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,we've stayed in Ruth Harlow's Airbnb more than once. we've always had an exceptional stay with an exceptional host. would highly recommend the homestead or the Little House in the country.

We will definitely try to stay there again on future college trips."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best AirBnB we’ve ever stayed in!! The Homestead is where you want to be. This old (beautifully renovated) home is rich with the love of generations who have lived there, and Ruth is the perfect host. She has tastefully and thoroughly stocked the home with everything you might need. I love to bake and packed all of my baking supplies (past experience tells me most airbnbs only have bare minimum of salt and maybe some oil) but there was no need here! She even has first aid supplies, and extra toiletries if you’ve forgotten yours. The beds and sheets were high quality, soft and so comfy, and there were plenty of towels for our family of 5. Every room was peaceful and very clean. The outdoor spaces were great too and our kids loved the chickens. There’s something special about this place. We will definitely be back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! A beautiful house and grounds. Filled with family photos, very homey and interesting. We enjoyed having the chickens around, and the beautiful starry skies. The kitchen is FULLY stocked. Food and equipment. Thank you Ruth!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruth has the nicest home to stay in a country setting! I have to mention how clean the house is!! Also the beds are very comfortable!! This was our second stay and hope to return again when we are back to visit!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Helpful host.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything as described. Kitchen was great and all of the seating was comfortable. There’s just the one bathroom and it’s up the stairs - so you have to contend with that, but the description was clear about it so we weren’t surprised. We will certainly consider staying here again if we need to be in this area of the country!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Homestead is a beautiful, quiet home that is an easy drive into town. It is probably one of the most well appointed AirBNBs that we have stayed in. Ruth was very responsive and helpful, even giving us fresh vegetables from her garden."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Perfect place to stay
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had an extended stay here and chose this house in particular due to the location. If you want to be out in the quiet countryside but only a few minutes away from Monmouth, this is just the right balance. The house looks to have a long history and if you pay attention you'll catch those little tidbits of the past just like I did. It's been well maintained, and many of the spaces have been cohesively remodeled and feature modern appliances. The grounds are well kept and have plenty of outdoor space available. It's definitely worth looking into if you're in the area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Homestead is a true gem. The spotless house offers everything you could need in a very serene setting. Ruth is a fantastic host.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful countryside home, perfect for our weekend stay with baby. Updated kitchen had everything you could wish for. You could tell Ruth had thought of everything!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I have stayed at Carla’s place a few times while visiting my daughter at Knox. The apartment is very unique in a cool historic building. The convenience and Carla’s friendly hosting make Apt 8 a wonderful home away from home.

Everything was as described and we had a very nice stay in Galesburg."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla was very friendly and responsive. The apartment was ready early and everything was very clean, homey, and as described. For those not used to living in a downtown area like us, it was a little noisy at night at first. But once you turn on the a/c unit in the bedroom, we couldn’t hear a thing. Yummy coffee in the morning and very helpful instructions. Would definitely stay here again when in town!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place

Highly recommend Carla’s!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we could give six stars, we would! Beautiful place, close to everything, but the host’s attention to detail was the best! There was coffee and tea and even some cold drinks in the kitchen, and … coins for the washer and dryer!!! So thoughtful! We also really appreciated the historic photos and all the information about the history of the town and the building. These people clearly love their house and town!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly as described and pictured. We were just there overnight and had no problem finding the location, getting in, and finding everything we needed. Carla reached out to make sure we arrived and had we needed anything, I know I could have asked. The location near Knox College and downtown Galesburg was just what we were looking for.
Overall, it was great and I'd stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We took our son to your Knox College - this was the perfect place to stay ! Basically across the street from the college - and so easy to access! Carla was super kind and helpful … if traveling to Galesburg - this is the place to stay !

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is located downtown, close to many restaurants and with a coffee shop in the same building.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here over the holiday visiting family and it was a perfect space for us for 6 days. We were close to everything we needed. Carla was very responsive and even came to change the smoke detector that started to beep very quickly which was very appreciated! The mattress was Very firm so took a little adjustment to get used to based on preference but not uncomfortable. I would recommend this place and stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Carla’s place was perfect for our short stay in Galesburg. My teen and I visited Knox College which is only a few blocks away. We loved learning about the history of the building from all the framed pictures and articles hung on the walls. We also enjoyed perusing the books on the shelf and the very high ceilings.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I so appreciate maintained historical structures. Even with the changes that happened to this 1895 building it felt inviting while retaining it's history. If you are tired of cookie cutter places with no character, I would recommend this."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a very cool old building, with lots of information about its history provided in the apartment. The downtown area has nice restaurants and businesses to visit—highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Funky and cool! Lots of art, books, great magazines. Bed was very comfy and loved the roominess."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a slightly worn but very clean apartment right in downtown Galesburg. The building where it is located was a business college in the 19th-early 20th century and now houses businesses on the ground, apartments above. Two local breweries within a block. Not for someone who can't climb stairs but a good value in a very convenient location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Convenient, historic location. Great for my short stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Carla’s apartment is extremely comfortable. The history of the building and architecture make it a very unique and fun place to be. I worked remotely while sitting in the big windows and at times had to remind myself that I was at work. Carla provides a just right amount of directions regarding her property so that I felt like I was at home. It was nice to not have instructions attached to all the walls. I will be back many times while visiting my daughter who is a student at Knox.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Charming, cozy apartment in a historic building. Very convenient to downtown Galesburg and Knox College. Carla is very friendly and accommodating. Note that this does have a lot of stairs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The downtown location was wonderful -- quiet enough and accessible to everything. We parked our car on arrival and didn't use it again before leaving. Communication with hosts was just right in all respects. The apartment is simple yer quite comfortable. We hope to visit again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We've stayed here multiple times over the last several years. It's our go to spot on our twice yearly visits to see family. Central location close to numerous restaurants and a great coffee shop and breakfast spot just around the corner!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a charming place and a wonderful location. Everything we needed was within walking distance: coffee, bakery, grocery store, antiques, dinner. We loved staying in the former business school. Great light from the oversized windows. A sweet spot in Galesburg!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We always stay at Carla's place if it's available when we make the drive through Galesburg. Great location....central to the best spots in town and everything is walkable from the room. Best coffee shop anywhere is right downstairs around the corner! The room is clean and quaint...beautifully old fashioned but with everything you need for a wonderful stay. We love it here!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in town for a night for work and dependent on Amtrak and my two feet to get around. Uber is non-existent and taxi service is a maybe, and all the hotels are miles away and require a car to be accessible. Carla’s place is a clean, cozy spot in town walkable to the train station and Knox College. Got a good night’s sleep and was able to make myself a good cup of coffee in the morning."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second stay at Carla's place. Very cool historic building, great communication, and pretty quiet considering it's downtown. Can't beat being able to walk around the corner to The Beanhive and Iron Spike and a short walk to Knox. Will definitely return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed my stay.
Loved the decor very clean with great easy instructions.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was absolutely perfect! There were all kinds of bars and restaurants within a very short walk. (Less than a block) We were in Galesburg for the ""Taste of Galesburg"". Couldn't have had a better location as the apt was 1 block from the event. Free parking in lot across the street! Wish we would have planned for more nights! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is THE cutest historical apartment I’ve ever stayed in. Huge windows, lots of memorabilia, cute shabby chic decor."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay - close to many downtown restaurants and attractions. It's fun to be within walking distance of most everything anyone would need from downtown. Carla is a wonderful host - very responsive and helpful!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for visiting Knox College!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla was extremely helpful from the beginning all the way until we checked out. From recommendations of local restaurants, detailed communications on the check-in process, and information on local transportation options. The property itself was centrally located, close to amenities and the Amtrak station. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Carla's was trouble free and conveniently located for our weekend family reunion. An excellent place to stay while visiting Galesburg and Knox College.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique space in a really cool old building. Highly recommend! Just blocks from Knox and everything downtown. If you take the train to town you won't need a car.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,The apartment is centrally located. Walking distance from the college and restaurants. The apartment is a good size. I would say the bed is closer to a full than a queen and it was lumpy. Not a big deal depending on how important the mattress is to you but putting it out there in case the mattress is a consideration. Communication was helpful and clear.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla has a perfect location for everything Galesburg has to offer! From Railroad Days to Knox weekends to a relaxing antiquing foray…this place is perfect. Super high ceilings (could they be 12’?, she should paint CLOUDS up there!) make the feel of the apartment so open and relaxed. Easy to bounce in and out of with two convenient exits in different directions from the building. Loved it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla’s Cherry St. apartment was perfect for my stay. My daughter went to Knox, then lived in Galesburg after for 2 years. This was the pick up and move trip, and the apartment was a perfect “home base” for that. Central to everything, easy parking across the street (leave the car there…everything is walkable). Carla was quick to respond to communication and appointed the apartment with everything needed for a lovely stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was perfect for my 2 day stay. Located downtown and within walking distance of everything I had planned.
The building where the apartment is located is older and has a lot of character.
I enjoyed my stay and Carla always responded to my messages quickly.
If I travel to Galesburg again, I will definitely look to reserve this again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This apt was exactly as described and very convenient for a visit to Knox College. Carla’s instructions arrived well ahead of time and she even adjusted the AC once she knew our estimated arrival so we would arrive to a cool apt on a hot day. The local coffee shop around the corner made this a great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carla is an amazing host and the apartments in her building are comfortable and clean. We highly recommend it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The rental was very nice and clean. It is spacious and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay here anytime I come to Galesburg. Great historic building, location and Carla is the best. I feel like I'm home when I stay. Very vintage and cozy."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location if visiting Knox College. Walkable to campus and downtown eateries. Cool historical building. Very comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little apartment in a beautiful historic building, located in the historic downtown area and two blocks from Knox College. It had everything I needed, including sufficient AC to handle 90-degree weather."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic place to stay! Thank you for everything. We will be back so sure!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was exactly as described and I had a great stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carla was amazing as a host. This is my second time staying here and I will definitely continue to stay here every time I visit.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"It is a great space for a couple. Not knowing the area, I didnt know if it was safe to go out in the evening alone as a female. I did love how spacious it was and the big windows and great natural light!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place! Great location with such lovely Galesburg touches. We loved the high ceilings and peaceful ambiance. We never saw anyone else living in the building so everything feels really private. Laundry is right outside the door. Just about everything you need is within walking distance. The mattress is on the more firm side (for those who it is important for).
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Carla and her husband were great hosts. They made sure we had everything we needed and were very flexible with check in time with our crazy schedule after our wedding. The place was historic and fun with plenty of small downtown businesses and antique shops to walk to. Have already recommended to friends and family for a quick getaway. they even went out of their way to help us with a problem we had of our own making.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location that is walkable to Amtrak, downtown shopping, restaurants, and Knox College. Parking is free and convenient. The rooms are located in an older building that has interesting history, and Carla has incorporated that history into the rooms with books, pictures and newspaper articles. There are tall windows, high ceilings, a stocked kitchen, and clear information about how to use the building and rooms. Carla was quick to respond and checked on us to make sure all was well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great space. Our daughter is a student at Knox, and of all of the hotels and other AirBnB's in Galesburg, it is the only one within a short walk of the Knox campus, restaurants, and bars. We did so many things within a few blocks of Carla's place. The space is also really cool, not just from our perspective but even our daughter's college friends think so! It's an old building that used to be a business college. Big windows and a really nice vibe. Carla is super-responsive and such a nice person. Our daughter is an art major and had an opening in downtown Galesburg. Carla and her husband came to the opening, which was so nice!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I make regular trips through Galesburg on our way to visit her parents. Carla's place is our regular spot. We've been staying here since 2018 and always look forward to our time there. Some of our AirBnb spots have come and gone over the years but this place is a keeper for us. Located in the center of town with convenient parking just across the street with the best coffee shop in the world (The Beanhive) located just downstairs and a great restaurant almost next door (Iron Spike). The room has great old-fashioned ambiance that no hotel can provide. So....convenient, comfortable, clean AND affordable!!!!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting Knox without a car so it was perfect. Short walk from the train station and then to the College. It’s an old building so fairly basic, but clean and warm and welcoming."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I used to live in downtown Galesburg, just across the street from Carla's place. This apartment reminded me of everything I loved about it. It embraces Galesburg's history, creatively finds life in well-made, older things, and puts residents in the heart of the action while still feeling peaceful. Walkable to everything, super clean, and very cozy, I'd recommend this space very highly!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely stay! As someone who’s lived in Galesburg in the past, it was wonderful to just step right into life downtown and see all the ways the town has flourished. Carla’s place is perfect walking distance to almost everything and a short drive to the rest, plus clean and comfortable."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice little apartment in the middle of town within walking distance of several great restaurants and bars, antique stores, parks, and Knox College. Galesburg is beautiful and full of history, and this place put us in the middle of it all. It's the perfect place if you're visiting Knox and I hope we can stay there again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time at Carla's place, and it was just as clean and ready as before. Carla is a great host. Would definitely recommend it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful stay. A beautiful view to the downtown, modest decor but so much character in this neat old building. Huge windows, coffee shop downstairs, walkable to charming shops/restaurants. Carla was so kind even though I booked last minute!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved staying at #8!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little apartment in beautiful historic building! Right in the center of downtown near all my favorite places!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Carla is a wonderful host! Such a cute place stocked with everything we needed!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very clean, quiet and private apartment. Close to everything with clear instructions."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla’s place is clean, cozy, comfortable, creative, quiet, quaint, and felt very special and authentic. Carla cares. She had extra, thoughtful touches in every room! We will be back, for sure! This sweet, charming, historical treasure is a must stay! Thanks, Carla. You are managing a special gem✨"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I have been staying here on Galesburg visits for 5 years now. This apartment has everything you need to have a home away from home
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would stay there again for sure. This was such a treat compared to a hotel. Downtown, close to Packing House and Landmark. It was really perfect and my stay was way too short. Carla was great, very responsive. Instructions were exact and easy to follow."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much more enjoyable than a hotel. We loved the spaciousness, decor and character. We hope to stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just want to say that my girlfriend and I absolutely loved staying here. We had never stayed at an Airbnb before and didn't really know what to expect. Carla was wonderful at communicating with us. She left detailed instructions on entry and exit. The apartment was beyond cozy and adorable. The cabinets were stocked with anything we would need. The bathroom was well stocked with towels, shower supplies, and more. The layout of the apartment was amazing. The large windows overlooked the city. It was a pleasure to just look out the windows. The fridge had menus from local restaurants. There were even books/newspaper articles about the town. The location is what sold us. We took the train in for a quick overnight adventure. The apartment was a short walk from the train station, and was centrally located and within short walking distance of many restaurants and pubs. If you are looking for a fun, clean, well stocked, and organized place to stay...I highly recommend this one"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I stay here almost every month and each visit is great. Carla is the best host I’ve ever stayed with!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy place."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. We were in town visiting family over the holidays. Great location. Easy to get to. Lots of places to eat within walking distance.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla and Tom go above and beyond. My visit was during some cold weather, and they had flannel sheets on the bed and plenty of heat in the unit. she had both decaf and regular coffee and there was a little dessert in the fridge - not required, but a nice extra. The building is historical and with that comes a few quirks, like an unusual light/fan switch in the bathroom. Carla leaves notes on operating these things. Easy to follow."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very easy check in process and Carla was extremely nice and helpful! The home was so cozy! All in all we had a great experience!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was very cozy. The host was very friendly.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication throughout. Perfect location to easily park and walk to numerous restaurants and bars. Neat historic building with all sorts of history/photos/books of the location and town inside the apartment. If you forgot something (toiletries, etc...) It's there to use."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was really clean and stocked with coffee essentials. Thanks
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this cute and comfortable apartment! The old school style appealed to us as it reminded us of our early elementary school days! The kitchen had everything we needed, the open area felt spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the curtains in the bedroom provided almost blackout coverage for late sleeping. The only issue was that the steam heat didn’t kick on until late morning, but we pulled out the electric heater and it did a great job of heating the apartment. Communication with our hosts was easy and we had no problems. We’ll absolutely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Have stayed multiple times. We love the area and that it is walkable. Not fancy but very cozy.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Very generous and accommodating host!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay many things to do very close
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay in a conveniently, lovely apartment!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a stay that will perfectly encapsulate the eclectic, history-rich, and artsy small town that is Galesburg, I would highly recommend Carla's airbnb right in the heart of the intimate downtown streets. We felt right at home thanks to all the wholesome details of the apartment--like the local food menus posted on the fridge, to the historic radiators emitting the coziest heat on cool nights, and original local artwork framed all over the gorgeously tall walls. The apartment will smell wonderful due to the Beanhive situated right below the apartment (HIGHLY recommend for authentic Galesburg experience); the apartment itself is clean and inviting, and the high windows give you an excellent view of those famous Midwestern skies. This stay is quintessentially Galesburg!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location - close to the college, with lots of good food choices nearby, and in a historic building. Carla's place was very comfortable and she was a responsive and gracious host. Would highly recommend this apartment!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla's place was comfortable & very centrally located. Super easy access to the Amtrak/California Zephr. Easy to get around and close to all the best places in town (Coffee/breakfast/) Easy walking distance to all the best places that where the locals hang out. Gotta say the Indian food buffet lunch at the Cornucopia was the BEST Indian food I've ever had! I'd go back just for that ! Highly recommend Carla's place, easy check in & Carla was always just a text away... TY Carla"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla is a Great host, good communication throughout the entire process! Great apartment, very clean and conveniently located to everything downtown. We will definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location in the historic downtown area. Apartment was even better in person than online. Highly recommend it!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable space and the location is everything. Anything you want to do downtown is within walking distance.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"#8 Downtown Galesburg is a most CHARMING place to stay. The location is just 2 blocks from Main Street, so if you are looking for a place to stay where you could walk to Galesburg High School Reunion events. I'm also a Knox College Alum & the location is perfect for Knox events.
#8 is SPOTLESS, has loads of CHARM, Brown's Business College memorabilia & books on the history of Galesburg to keep anyone entertained & knowledgable. One could not have a better location withing walking distance of everything in the Downtown area.
Just bring a good pair of earplugs for the occasional bar noise in the area to get a great night's sleep!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is great. Spacious one bedroom apartment on 2nd floor of historic building right in the middle of downtown Galesburg. Carla was kind enough to accommodate an early check in request. The space was clean, tidy, and has lots of cool local history on the walls. If I'm ever back in Galesburg I would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely downtown ’pied-à-terror’ and so convenient to Knox
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the second time that I stayed at Carla’s place. It was fantastic - everything that I was looking for in an Airbnb. The location can’t be beat. The history of the building is also so cool!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always my go-to place when visiting Knox College. Walking distance to campus & restaurants , easy parking & a great apartment with easy check in. Thanks again Carla."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment is beautiful and very clean. Location is excellent.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, clean, fun little apartment. Bathroom fan is a little startling (maybe a loose fan bearing) and the bed is quite uncomfortable."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a delightful place to stay with plenty of charm! Conveniently located next to restaurants, bars, local shops, and the local historic theatre. Carla was responsive and attentive. Can’t wait to go back!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location , comfort, cleanliness and details to spend a few great days. Carla was a very good host every question I had answered me quickly. Highly recommended!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great apartment! Very clean and conveniently located right downtown near local shops and restaurants. Short walk from Amtrak station and Knox College"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm from Galesburg and it's the only place I stay when traveling back to Galesburg to see my dad and lifetime friends. The history of the building, neighborhood and downtown shops is worth exploring. Also a great value."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment breathes the history of Galesburg and the love for it from the owners. It's a little artistic, not too strict and so wonderfully relaxed. Everything is there. Here you feel at home, the building is inhabited by Knox students (the campus is within walking distance and really beautiful), but you don't notice it. A top place, especially if you travel by train (7 minutes walk to Amtrak train station)."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for hanging out around Downtown Galesburg and Knox! Carla gave clear communications and the space was super cute.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay at a great location for a great value!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with a very attentive host. I’ll be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay in Galesburg. Central location and surrounded by downtown eat and entertainment.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you appreciate the charm of an historic building, whose location feels like the center of everything, this is a perfect Airbnb! I have twice booked it because I enjoyed it so thoroughly!
Carla was incredibly communicative and I love the attention to history with the framed photos and articles she has on the walls! My only regret is that since my daughter just graduated from Knox College in Galesburg, and has plans to travel, it is unlikely we’ll return any time soon! ☺️"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a great location, very clean, and Carla is awesome!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This experience holds a lot of personal nostalgia for me. It was great to be able to stay in a building I once rented in while at Knox. Love the location qnd love this building. Thanks Carla and Tom!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect location for a visit to knox college!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ve been staying here on our yearly road trip to visit with my wife’s family for several years now. It makes such a difference in the overall quality of our trip. It’s in such a perfect location downtown with convenient parking and within walking distance of numerous restaurants and taverns of all varieties. Very quaint and comfortable lodging in an older building with tons of character (the good kind) with a small kitchen included. Best of all is the affordable rate…not so easy on AirBnb anymore!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for a visit to Knox College! We walked everywhere, which was awesome for us! The apartment is so cute and full of charm, though it is an old building. The only thing I wish I had considered is the noise level outside. This apartment is half a block from the liveliest bars in town - I had to run the AC unit to drown out the shouts and laughter on a Friday night. All things considered, we would absolutely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, would love to stay there anytime I visit"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Clean and great location. We were able to walk to several excellent restaurants. host went the extra mile and installed the air conditioners when the weather abruptly changed. Very friendly small town.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location that makes it easy to walk anywhere downtown. The place itself is super quiet. I'll stay here again if my travels ever take me back to Galesburg.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carla was great! The apartment was amazing and she was so attentive. Our stay was everything we could have wished for.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent walkable location downtown Galesburg in a comfortable, clean and very functional apartment. We will definitely go back again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can expect a very clean apartment in the heart of Galesburg! It's walking distance from Knox College, and most of the rest of the town as well."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I just love staying at Carla’s place. This is the 3rd apt that I’ve rented in her building and each one is unique and wonderful. I appreciate the location and walkability. I also appreciate that she does not use scented detergents for the linens. This is a huge plus for me.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My stay was great! The place was super cool and clean.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place. It has a great location in downtown Galesburg and is cozy and comfortable. The hosts are cheerful, helpful and responsive. You’re sure to enjoy your stay."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! It gives you the ability to walk around downtown & see the sites. Huge windows, vintage hardwood floors, and comfortability are what will make your visit memorable."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Carla's place was just as we expected. It was very cool staying in such a historic building and learning the history of the building. Carla was very quick to respond when we needed assistance. I'd stay at Carla's apartment again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to Knox college comfortable and cozy.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, awesome location. There is even a really good coffee shop in the same building! Would definitely stay again"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla's place is in an historic downtown Galesburg building that used to be a business college. It comes with all the character and quirks that a place with such a past has to offer. There are gorgeous high ceilings and tall windows that let in loads of natural light, and charming old fixtures. There are a few stairs to climb to access the apartment, which was no big deal for us, but I would travel light so you don't have much to lug up and down. But of course you're traveling light because the apartment is stocked with kitchen staples, ample bedding, toiletries, and you have unbelievably convenient access to all of the coffee shop and dining options downtown. Furnishings are well loved, but very comfy, befitting an affordable option in a prime space. Carla's communication was super helpful and welcoming, and I truly felt that if I had needed anything at all she wouldn't have minded my reaching out during the stay. Check in and out was a breeze, and speaking of breeze I would also love to point out that the apartment was not drafty at all even in the middle of a snowy cold snap thanks to the updated windows. So great! Thank you for making our stay in Galesburg a lovely one."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean, very nice play to stay, I highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"ADORABLE AirBNB right in downtown. Easy walking to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Limited cooking space (tiny oven!) but perfect for breakfast and snacks. There is no TV, so we enjoyed an unplugged weekend. Carla was very communicative and kind. We plan to come back to enjoy summer in Galesburg as well!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Good location downtown and Carla was a great host.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Fun place downtown, full of interesting things for history nuts like myself. The unit was decorated very nice and Carla made everything clear and easy for me to call the place home for a few days. Only thing the place was missing was a proper desk for me to work, and the internet seemed to have a bit of trouble at times (speed was slow occasionally)."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great apartment and great host! Highly recommend!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heart of Downtown Galesburg location, terrific setup for a couple or small family. Quirky, comfy apartment with enormous windows, loads of character, and great light. Surprisingly historical-- if local history is your thing, you'll find a tremendous amount here."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our second time staying at Apt 8. Great location and close to so many good places to eat and drink. We very much appreciate everything they do to make staying there comfortable. Looking forward to staying there again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla’s place was great! It is located in a charming and historic building in an incredibly convenient location (near bars, restaurants, antique shops, etc.). The place itself has a really cool boho style to it, which I really liked. Looking forward to staying again in the future!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place! Conveniently located downtown and near a whole bunch of restaurants and nightlife. We will ALWAYS be picking this as our Galesburg Airbnb from now on.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just gorgeous. The windows are amazing. Super-cozy with great art and plenty to read. Full-size fridge, stove, and microwave so I was able to cook like I was at home. Coffee and restaurants just downstairs, a library across the street, and bookstores within walking distance. And I could hear the churchbells playing Christmas carols, which was magnificent. Can't wait to come back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large one bedroom apartment in beautiful historic building. Great downtown location. Close enough to train station that you could walk.
Comfy and roomy.
Carla very quick to message back, always a plus."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Interesting apartment in a neat old building. Was surprisingly quiet in there.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property! Such a beautiful town and so much rich history within this property. Hoping we get a chance to come back and stay in the future. Carla was extremely kind and a fantastic host.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Very clean and nice! Has a great view!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Super convenient for downtown Galesburg and visiting Knox College. Quirky old building. The stairs are not for the faint of heart.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Location was fantastic. Perfect easy location for a Knox parent like me. I felt like I was staying with an artist friend in a New York burrow.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying in Apartment 8. It's great to be so close to the campus and the bars (for me, anyhow). The apartment and the entire building is just so unique and cool. I hope to come back some day."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If there is such a thing as “luxury historic” housing, that’s what I’d call this. Location perfect for our visit to Knox College and our host went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome apartment! Loved the high ceilings and big windows!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This adorable apartment is located in downtown Galesburg. It is within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, movie theaters, bars, and Knox College. Carla is very helpful and accommodating. I 100% recommend staying here!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place in a rustic building over 100 years old. The room is themed with Brown's Business School memorabilia which makes a fun entertaining read. Adjacent to Iron Spike Brewing and other restaurants this place is centrally located. No TV, but that's what ipads and laptops are for. As someone who was raised in an old house, I really appreciated the high ceilings, wood floors and huge windows."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla’s eclectic apartment in the old Brown College building is comfortable and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. It is in walking distance of the train station, Knox College, and pubs and restaurants. Carla has thought of the little things that travelers find helpful and is quick to respond to communication. Will definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location & decor!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Super clean and excellent location!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lots of charm and history! I study old buildings for a living, so I was presently surprised to find this clean, quiet and quirky apartment on the second floor of a 130-year-old Romanesque Revival brownstone in downtown Galesburg. The interior of the unit is covered with memorobilia about the history of both Galesburg and the building itself, which was once home to one of the first for-profit business school franchises in the country, and also the launching pad for nearby Carl Sandburg College. Super easy access on foot to downtown and Knox College. Definitely recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's place is ideally located in central Galesburg---perfect place for a Knox-related event, and right over the Beanhive coffee house. The apartment has great windows overlooking downtown and is a spacious and cozy place. We will definitely be back for the next trip to Knox!"
2021-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was cozy and very convenient. However, the host forgot that we had arranged for a late checkout when booking and simply dumped all personal items and luggage in the hallway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am a sucker for historic buildings. I love this place! The tall tall windows, the downtown historic ambiance, the fascinating reading material. I could stay here and have a wonderful personal retreat for a few days. I felt like I was a young college student again, very intellectually stimulating surroundings. We stopped over on a road trip, I hoe to return.
Carla was very responsive and even dropped off a sewing kit for an emergency repair."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a taste of real art and eclectic decor. Cozy, every comfort. Stroll Knox College Campus, great dining/pubs and do the downtown walk. Great stay"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! The apartment is very neat, clean and very comfortable. There are articles and pictures displayed in the apartment telling the history of the building. There is lots of entertainment and restaurants within walking distance. The host is very helpful and communcated clearly what to expect. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay when exploring Galesburg! We loved that we could walk everywhere. The apartment itself was also very cool, with amazing high ceilings, and tons of artistic details. Being right in the heart of downtown is a lot of fun, but does get pretty noisy with all of the nightlife. Just a heads up to those staying over the weekend. Thank you, Carla for your hospitality!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carla is the best! I went to Galesburg to drop off my sister at Knox College. I wanted a place close by. Carla’s apartment was just what I was looking for. She was such an amazing host. She always checked in to make sure everything was going okay and answered any questions I had. If I ever come back to Galesburg I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Carla!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great location to cute downtown Galesburg and Knox College! Carla's space is thoughtful, creative, shabby-chic with antiques and homemade touches. Love the high ceilings. Kitchen is well stocked with basic supplies. Easy communication and check in."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here just a few days ago on our trip to Minnesota. Once again, we enjoyed our stay very much and looked forward to this stay on our return trip home. It’s always been a comfortable, warm, convenient place to stay with a great downtown location close to several excellent restaurants."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really great experience! Beautiful historic home and rooms. Fun to explore the downstairs as well. Easy check in, walkable from the Galesburg Amtrak station. Great value for the money!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place but a few issues. No actual contact with the innkeeper, paper products ran out and had to scavenge for them in downstairs bathroom. There is a very active bee hive right outside our window."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved this beautiful bed and breakfast. Linda was equally awesome. looking forward to staying here in future trips.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very brief stay at this location—arrived after dark in the evening and left at 8am. It was really nice and welcoming though—lovely space.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will be back
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Keep in mind this is a beautiful Classic & very old mansion with tons of history.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for our couples getaway. We had the whole house to ourselves as it was a weekday. The Executive room was a King-suite, comfy bed, fireplace, bath and a room with lots of sunshine. The house is large with many rooms to explore. Books on presidents and local historical pictures and information. Large yard, large parking area. We were able to have complete use of the kitchen during our stay. Continental breakfast items for our use anytime day or night, wow! First rate, grand amenities. Local breweries and Innkeeper coffee shop are a must do. We will be coming back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing house! Not only has the room and house been beautifully restored and maintained, but all the needed modern amenities are there.
lots of space, easy to find, and so much to explore in the house. I can't wait to stay again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,beautiful historic home
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks, Linda for a great stay - wish we could have stayed longer to explore the house and the community!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"It's a lovely old house, with tons of character. The stairs are very, very steep but the room was nice. The bed was absolutely wonderful--best pillows at an Airbnb ever!! The workspace is quite small but I appreciated the extension cord with a USB adapter as I left mine at home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, stately home. I rented the “executive room” - it was a large room w a comfortable chair and nice bathroom. I also appreciated the coffee / tea station in the hallway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treat to visit a house so rich in history. Make sure to set aside time to explore everywhere, including the basement!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"remote for our room tv did not work; loved the freedom to explore the house, loved the history, loved being able to accommodate our guests for birthday dinner. thanks for mailing chargers!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I can’t imagine visiting Galesburg and not staying at the Great House. It is very close to everything in town and the house itself is beautiful and relaxing. Linda was a very proactive host and really made sure the house had everything you need for your stay! I would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect, couldn’t have asked for a better stay. Thank you, Linda!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful treat to stay at the Great House. We enjoyed all the history and stories in this home. The experience was like going back in time to the 1800s. The Executive room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. We strolled thru the neighborhood and enjoyed the beautiful private homes that have been restored. We would love come back and bring more of our family and friends to this unique Historic home. Pastor Rick & Deanne
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very safe and quiet place to stay. Beautiful rooms and easy instructions!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Silas Willard house is a beautiful, historic house that has been modernized with central air and a newer kitchen, but also has many antiques and a lot of charm. I was able to get a code for the house and did not have any issues getting into my room. The room was clean and spacious with nice antiques and like all the rooms had a private bath. I was happy that they seem to vet their guests and I didn't hear the other guests while I was in my room. I'm a very light sleeper and didn't wake up from guest noise once during a four night stay. There is ample off-street parking in the back. It was fun inviting Galesburg relatives over to tour a historic home they have been driving by for years. There are plenty of spaces on the first floor to entertain a couple guests and hang out. I would definitely book a room again when I return to Galesburg next year."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Great House is absolutely GREAT! From the moment you walk in you feel like you’re surrounded in history and transported to another time and place.
All of the literature throughout the house telling the story of the Great House through time is truly fascinating.
We reserved 2 rooms and held our daughter’s college graduation party here and every single guest through the door was impressed!
Linda is thoroughly easy to work with and accommodating.
This is a MUST STAY if you’re looking for something unique that doesn’t break the bank.
It’s very reminiscent of the Bed and Breakfasts of old. Charming and grand! And if you stay here you’ve got to eat at the Landmark downtown and tell them Jody sent you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Linda was an amazing host! She was incredibly communicative and made sure that we were very comfortable in the Great House. The home itself was wonderful and full of so much history which they were sure to highlight. We eve spent an evening in the parlor with some new friends (other guests). It was a perfect getaway weekend! Thank you Linda!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool history - loved it
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda’s house was beautiful and the room was very comfortable. Linda was kind enough to give us a ride from the train station, show us around town, and make a great restaurant recommendation. The house felt like a hone away from home"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful historic house. Make sure you walk around all the downstairs rooms. Linda has restored this mid-18th century mansion and added all the modern amenities you would want.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I secured a room for a guest who was in the area for business. Linda was really wonderful to work with and she helped me navigate the airbnb site, too. The guest needed to arrive earlier than she had anticipated and Linda was able to accomodate that need. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most charming and incredible AirBnbs we’ve ever stayed in. It has all of the charm you would imagine a house like this in Galesburg should have. The house feels like home right away and the room was incredibly comfortable. I wish we had more time just to relax in the house and enjoy everything there was to explore. Quite a gem. Galesburg is super lucky to have a place like this. You can walk everywhere and the kitchen is fully stocked.
Linda was incredibly welcoming and even let us plug in our electric car. She said the house is going solar soon in the future and will even have an EV hookup. Anyway, I can’t say enough about this place, it made our stay in Galesburg better than any other time we’ve visited. Thank you Linda!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,There is so much history of of Galesburg in this space. There are things to read and look at in every room. There is an adventurous story in each room. Wonderful space to take a break from life and enjoy a night in. I want to come back and stay in each of the rooms at the Great House.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at The Great House. We have been traveling to Galesburg for a few years and I am sad to say that we only just discovered this bed and breakfast. The good news is that we would be more than happy to stay again. The house is both beautiful and comfortable.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable stay at The Great House. Everything was exactly as my husband expected and Linda went out of her way to help him pull off this surprise visit for me. We would definitely recommend this as a place to stay. Loved the history of The Great House!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had for sure. My teenage son and I stayed to check out Knox college. Linda was kind, helpful, so informative about the history of the town, the house…and she even gave us some rides as we took the train and didn’t have a car… (we had some bad weather when we visited). Super friendly and accommodating. We will be back for sure.
The rooms are very clean and spacious, and the kitchen and dining room are huge (so you don’t feel cramped). If you are a history buff you will love this place…feels a bit like a museum. Tons of books, and historic local photos. There’s also a beautiful piano if you play. Lastly, if you can get a tour of the basement, don’t miss it. They believe it was a station in the Underground Railroad and wow, can you feel it down there. Amazing find! Thank you, Linda!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Great House is really that, a Great House. Full of interesting books and historical artifacts. Our room was clean and inviting, very relaxed, and very comfortable. Our host Linda was easy to work with and communications were prompt and clear. We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable room in a clean and interesting old building. Nice location with a lot of other cool old homes nearby and walkable to downtown and the college. Will stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we stayed at Linda's place, and it was great! Linda was super communicative prior to arrival and offered her contact information even on Christmas if there was anything we needed help with. The suite was very clean and represented accurately on the listing. Highly recommend staying here if you are in the area. We will definitely be staying here again next time we come to visit family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic property rooted in the history of the area. We will absolutely stay again when we return to the area!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in one of the most prominent, and historic homes not only in Galesburg, but in central Illinois. The home is beautifully restored and the furnishings are both historic and comfortable. Linda and staff were very accommodating and made us feel welcome. Another benefit of the location is looking at other beautiful, historic homes within close walking distance. We definitely would stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time returning to my hometown to celebrate a family birthday. Linda and Niels were brand new owners, with a lot on their plates, and we were well taken care of."

I loved the antique touches of the furniture that reflected the time period of when the house was built.
The house was clean and clutter free.
Diem-Trinh was very friendly and quick to respond.
This house was perfect for my pups and me! Will definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is old, which i both expected and liked. It was comfortable and quiet."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed two nights at Diem's place while visiting Knox College. The house is a bit run down and not sparkling clean, but it was perfectly serviceable for what we needed. Diem was very easy to communicate with and the neighborhood is great."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time visiting Knox College. House was about a mile or so away from the center of town. House had all the amenities needed. Diem-Trinh was very nice and communicative. Would stay there again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’d never visited Galesburg and Diem-Trinh was very responsive to all of my questions!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Was a nice stay! Host was very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Diem-Trinh was quick to respond to any questions !! Excellent service .
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Main beds were very comfy, but the twin beds were still loose and squeaked when ever you moved. So not conducive for sleeping.
House was clean with basic equipment. The entry key pad was not the double code that had been presented and the door knob was loose.
A little pricy compared to other Airbnb in town.
Diem- Trinh was very responsive"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location we were visiting family and need extra space and the house was clean and inviting just like staying at home.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We’ve stayed here before. It was perfect for our family over the holiday. Great location and we were able to cook breakfast before setting out each day. Diem-Trinh is always responsive when asked for anything. This house is a great value.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Diem is very kind and a great communicator. Nice stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cute older home in quiet neighborhood. clean and easy to access. close to Knox and downtown shops. great value for the price.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is wonderful when you come to visit your child at Knox College! It is a few blocks away from Knox. The house has nice beds, fully equipped kitchen and all things you need to feel at home. Maybe it is not super new but that gives it its charm!!
Located at a typical US street with grass lawns around the houses.
We had wunderfull evenings with our family in the house.
Groceries and all is nearby.
Host is super friendly !!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"It was perfect for our group we all felt relaxed, we also enjoyed Knox Campus and the old Historic grave yard. The only thing was the proximity to neighbors where you enter. It would be much more friendly to be able to incorporate the front as an entrance."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a great value for several of us visiting family in Galesburg. The house was clean and the beds were very comfortable. It had been rainy when we arrived and the house smelled a bit musty but we got it aired out. It was nice having 2 bathrooms, but the upstairs bathroom only has a tub and not a shower, so we all showered downstairs. We did not use the kitchen on this trip but it looked like it was well stocked. Diem was very responsive each time I contacted her. We will be back. Thanks."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,good value..was what our group needed!!

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There was a problem with the keypad instructions, but the host responded quickly and helped us get in. The house is very cute. Could use some more comfortable furniture in the living and dining areas, but the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe. Overall, we felt that the price was right for this house and Diem-Trinh was responsive and friendly."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Diem-Trinh was very communicative and the inside looked like the pictures. The lawn had not been mowed for awhile and there were a lot of weeds, so the kids didn't play outside in the yard. The twin beds and the kitchen/dining room table had loose screws and they wouldn't stay tightened. The floors were dirty so my granddaughter could not crawl around on them. Her clothes and/or skin would get dirty. The bathrooms were clean which is always a plus."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,great house for the price. stairs are steep but the bedroom and bathroom downstairs make it easy for people who don't or can not do the stairs
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lots of space for family
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Quiet neighborhood. Needed bedding for the couch and could have used more towels (we did not ask for more). Easy to get to other places in town. Don’t forget to bring your own toiletries. Beds were comfortable. Upstairs got warm, but fans were provided. AC downstairs was nice and cold, which was great with the high temps in town. Didn’t really use the kitchen."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was so comfortable and clean and on a quiet street! The host was so amazing for us asking for a huge request. Loved how close it is to Knox College and restaurants and shopping! Towels smelled soooo good! Beds are nice and soft with extra pillows and blankets! Air conditioner worked fabulously too! A few antique “eggs” if you look closely! We will definitely stay here again when we go back to see our daughter who has her Senior year at Knox College starting this Fall!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family enjoyed their stay and said they would stay there again. Close to grocery store and restaurants.

Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect Airbnb with a fabulous host! Lisa put a lot of thought into this property. It was spotless, comfortable, has everything you need and then some. Lisa is an excellent communicator and responds quickly.
Smart touches included USB ports on all the table lamps - I wish every Airbnb had those! Our girls loved the board games and books. Nice big dinner table for family meals (we had a 4-generation family dinner with my in-laws). We slept really well on the cozy beds, had a great time, and hope to return soon!"

It was a great fit for our family of five; thanks to the arrangement of doors on the first floor, we were able to create a safe space for our 1 year old to play in, i.e., away from the stairs. We also enjoyed walking over to the Seminary Street shops (about 20min on foot) and watching the long freight trains go by. Highly recommended!"
