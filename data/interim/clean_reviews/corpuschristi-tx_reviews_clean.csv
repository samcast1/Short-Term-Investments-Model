2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute place that was clean and felt really cozy. Plus there was ice cold AC! We didn’t use the kitchenette but there were tons of cookware to use. The bathroom was big and had plenty of towels. Melissa’s place is dog friendly as well and our puppy loved it here!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa’s cottage was just like she showed, except the fenced yard was even better than we expected for our dog. She was very communicative and responsive.
We particularly appreciated her flexibility on arrival and departure.
She’s close to the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Reserve and the price is a great value.
We heartily recommend her cottage!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This guest house is absolutely beautiful, impeccably clean, and had everything we needed. The bathroom and shower is more than adequate with plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The bed and pillows were very comfortable so we slept quite well. Additionally, it seemed like a tranquil neighborhood so we felt safe. Melissa gave us great recommendations so we were able to enjoy nearby McGee Park and walk the boardwalk to enjoy all of those sights and sounds. This location is close to many sights and restaurants. When in Corpus, we will definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had already wrote in her book about a review, but again the guesthome & Melissa were welcoming and, her dog Rowdy was a very good boy.
Melissa was responsive and quick with questions I had.
(:"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I truly enjoyed my stay at Cozy Cottage. I was very comfortable and clean!! It was very homelike with all you needed available. Melissa provided great communication and was very nice and caring. If I have the opportunity and if it is available I will be staying there again. It was very reasonably priced and SO MUCH Better then a hotel room. There were no surprises as everything was as she had listed.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was good generally
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly Melissa’s place helped save something that I thought to be lost. She was very sweet, but I am sad I didn’t get to meet her doggy because im a big animal lover. Over all would 10/10 recommend. It’s very cute and has a good home feel on the inside and the picnic table outside for a nice little outside dinner is absolutely perfect. Couldn’t have asked for a better host to invite us into their home."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place makes you feel at home. Comfortable and cozy with a great responsive host. Enjoyed my stay.

Everything was just as described and spotless! definitely will be booking soon!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little spot for a couple or a single dog mom like myself. My dog and I appreciated the fenced yard and walking about a mile to a little beach park. There’s a cute coffee shop down the street. Neighborhood is quiet and full of mid century homes - easy street parking. For restaurants and touristy stuff, you’ll need to drive or cab."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed Melissa's guest home for the one night I was there. It was as described, had everything I needed, in a great location, and she was easy/friendly to communicate with. I'd love to go back someday!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After looking through many overpriced listings with exorbitant fees, it was a relief to find this place being offered at an extremely fair rate without hidden fees.

The living area was cleand and very well designed with everything we needed. no complaints, would definitely stay here again."

The unit is clean and updated. Value for money was outstanding. Little touches like a throw blanket for watching tv were appreciated.
We would happily stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little gem. Well worth the price. Clean and welcoming!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was a great place within reach of the water and Melissa was a great host with a wonderful place

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Melissa's cottage. Felt very at home in the quiet neighborhood, but close to everything. She had everything you needed to make a meal. The bed and couch were comfortable! The roomy shower had plenty of hot water and the shower head was at the right height. Extra little touches, if you forgot something.
Melissa communication was friendly and promptly, with easy to follow instructions. We hope next time we can meet her and her dog. We will be back!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect and I will definitely be back! Very sweet to be greeted in the morning by Melissa’s lab Rowdy.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and great stay! I would re-book with Melissa next time in corpus!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was in a bind and needed a place to stay because my plans fell through at the last minute. Melissa was super responsive and had the place ready in no time. Her place is cozy, super clean, well appointed and perfect for one person or a couple. AND AS AN ADDED BONUS, dogs are allowed! I will definitely try to stay with her next time I am down in Corpus."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was pleasantly surprised at how the host made this place so accommodating. Even though there isn’t a kitchen technically there are more than enough appliances to make up for it. An induction burner with 2 burners was exactly what I needed and if you were staying here for a week or more you wouldn’t be forced to eat out every night. The bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure and stayed hot the whole time. You definitely need a car for this location though.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Melissa's guest house has everything you can ask for in an AirBnB, great for a night or two with your significant other. She's a great communicator and knows what a guest would need, both amenity-wise and with spaciousness."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was pristine and exactly as listed. Felt right at home the second we walked in the door. From the snacks to the well stocked coffee and tea bar, we felt appreciated. Lots of towels and kitchen utensils and supplies for cooking. We forgot a fan for white noise and there are two in the closet which saved a trip to the store. The backyard is peaceful and well maintained and our two pups had a great time out there too! Neighbors are quiet as well as the neighborhood. Monica is a quick text away and is very responsive. We will definitely be back when in town again! Try the Blue Clove for fresh seafood; you will love it!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quaint home in a quiet, older neighborhood. Everything is a short drive away with a grocery store within a few blocks.

Monica is a fantastic host. She is friendly and quick to respond.
We look forward to booking this home again!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Did not want to leave my car in the driveway at night. The one car garage is too tight. Difficult to get out of the car. The place was very clean and adequate for the price. Very attentive host. Took care of a plumbing problem right away.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"First this was not a pleasure trip and instead a stressful one. It was nice to come to this clean and happy home to escape it all. The lighting was very bright inside which was a nice surprise. The home was clean and very simple, no clutter. The backyard was large for the city. Everything that was needed like H.E.B was close. The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe. I had one issue with batteries and Monica responded within seconds and resolved the issue which to me was not a really an issue but still I was very pleased at the fast response and proactive that was taken for batteries for the remote. My noise machine broke and I was pleasantly surprised to find box fans! I was able to cook and unwind everyday of my stay. The home made this stressful trip a place of peace for me. Thank you Monica."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay. It was very clean, and looked just like the photos. The bed was comfortable, and it was nice to have a backyard for our pups. Monica was very proactive and communicative. We’d definitely book here again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was a great cozy place. Very Clean. Host was very responsive. Great for pets.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying here and we’ll keep coming back every time we’re in Corpus Christi. The fenced in back yard is perfect if you’re traveling with pups. They’ve also added a fire pit and chairs to the back yard since the last time we stayed. The beds are very comfortable, so is the couch. Even though it’s an older house, they’ve renovated it to be really pretty inside and it was spotless when we arrived."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Monica's place was great. Nice size back yard for the pup and her place was quiet and very clean. Thank you for allowing us to celebrate Christmas in your home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Monica's place was immaculate. She literally thought of everything. It was nicely decorated and felt like home. The appliances were also nice. The backyard was great for a dog with a seating area.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Monica was an incredible host! We were in Corpus for the birth of our first child and Monica had left a gift basket with baby cloths/essentials for us right when we walked in. She’s very responsive and a thoughtful host! Highly recommended her place

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,nice cozy place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Most all of the airbnb rentals I've stayed in are smaller than they look in the pictures. This is the first time an airbnb was larger than it looked in the pictures. It felt spacious and comfortable. It's not huge but the space is laid out so well. This is also one of the cleanest airbnb rentals I've had the pleasure of staying at. For a pet friendly house on the coast, it was miraculously clean! I didn't see a grain of sand anywhere. The backyard was also much larger than I expected. Between the tall privacy fence, the picnic table, hammock, and a few trees-- it felt tranquil and inviting. We were two adults and two pups and we all loved the accommodations. I was ready to move in! It's the epitome of why I prefer homes over hotels--a kitchen with a fridge and dishwasher, washer and dryer, private backyard, closet space, and cold AC. Monica added the special touches with coffee and snacks! <3"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easy check in and Monica was quick to communicate.
I was in town on business, and would happily stay there again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family is from Corpus so I hardly ever stay at hotels or airbnbs but when i found this location it was in the perfect spot. Less than 5 minutes to my family’s houses and was exactly like the photos. Very pet friendly and was the perfect place for them to run around. I loved everything about the house, especially the hammock! Would recommend to my other family members who travel to corpus often."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most comfortable stay at Monica's place. Monica went above and beyond to make us feel at home, from the initial communication to the thoughtful, generous details throughout the home. The location is perfect, in a quiet setting and close to everything. A very relaxing way to enjoy Corpus Christi."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little house in an older more rundown neighborhood. Easy entrance with clear instructions. The house is newly renovated and very clean inside.
Entrance: Keypad with code
Parking: Driveway, garage, and or street
Note, the access door to the backyard is in the bedroom with the queen bed (not the king)."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Monica’s place was fantastic! Felt right at home. The area nearby was great and super close to the local beaches. Neighbors were quiet and we all felt extremely comfortable in the area. Great food all around the area as well!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Monica and her listing are both amazing! I highly recommend it if you’re going to Corpus for anything. It’s well priced and it’s so much better than any hotel! ❤️

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, was perfect for us. Was able to fit my truck in garage at night to keep it cool in this 100 degree heat. House was beautiful inside and out. Neighbors were quite through out the stay. Nice back yard . Will stay there if we come back to Corpus next time. Monica was great also!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,House was nice but definitely smaller than it seemed in pictures. The hammock is torn pretty bad so not usable. Would definitely just be super cautious of any and every thing or they will try to charge you. Not in a horrible area but not what we were expecting. Did let us check in a couple hours early due to being in town earlier which was nice after a 6 hour drive. Make sure you read the rules very closely.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,House had everything we needed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Monica! We had a great time and we LOOOVVVEEEDDD your backyard. We would love to visit again sometime!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is quite nice, lovely and in great condition! Monica very considerately left several hangers in both closets, and several varieties of coffee and tea for our use, as well as some snacks.
It was also quite nice to be able for our family of five spread out over the two bedrooms and the main room, instead of all being crammed into a single hotel room.
One more additional thing was the flexible check-in. We were traveling from a great distance, and adding in time every time we stopped. Being allowed to check in when we got there without having to endure a hotel reception desk was fantastic! Using a code instead of a key was super-helpful, too!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,cozy little house perfect to explore CC
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Monica is very responsive and have a nice clean home. Has a great back yard and everything you need for your stay.

Check in was easy and Monica gave a very detail description on how to get in. The house was very clean, and everything had its place. The house looked exactly like all the pictures. We definitely enjoyed our family vacation. We will definitely be a returning guest. I would also be referring Mrs. Monica to any of my family that would be traveling to Corpus. We had an amazing time. We would definitely be back. If I could give 10 stars I would. Thank you, Monica, for the wonderful hospitality."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Monica’s casita to anyone who visits Corpus Christie. It’s extremely clean, comfortable and you’ll feel right at home. We’ll definitely stay again in the near future."

The backyard is beautifully manicured for those breezy Corpus Christi nights. My husband and daughter enjoyed hanging out in the backyard. The beds are comfortable! The entire house has been remodeled, and it was done PERFECTLY. The neighborhood is peaceful and we felt safe the entire time. We will definitely book if we visit Corpus again. It will be so hard to find another place like Monica’s! 💙"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Monica’s place was very nice and homey! We couldn’t ask for a better spot. My boys loved it and said they felt safe there and want to stay there again when I come back to corpus. The house was very clean and the AC works well. The couch was super comfy to just have a relaxed day and watch movies. Also great touch on the snacks and coffee. Above all Monica is a great host and always responsive and a quick responder at that. Very professional and sweet lady.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with our little family for the week. Having a fenced in backyard was exactly what we needed to help get some energy out.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful little home, very close to attractions in Corpus. Very responsive host. I highly recommend Monica and her ""casita"". My grandson loved the treat and popcorn; my wife and I enjoyed the coffee. A couple of things that really enhanced the stay: the modern appliances and utensils. Sounds minor but some of the places we've stayed, it looks as if they took all the good utensils & left the old stuff to the guests to use."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Monica was an excellent host and we absolutely enjoyed our stay. We had to make some reservation changes, and Monica walked me through how to do that.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay was great. They provide you with a binder of local restaurants (with menus), things to do, bars, stuff like that. It was over the moon helpful and we ended up getting pizza from a place in the binder and spent the night fishing off the back docks. It is a good price in my opinion. The hosts were responsive and on top of their sh*t. Great place, I would book with them again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was a great one, David was really helpful with our stay. He was accommodating when it came to bringing our boat. Our kids loved that there was a pool to swim in since it’s right on the bay. We frequent the coast often and I’m definitely keeping this one as a favorites for our next visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"place was great, will be contacting David on my next trip."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Condo was super clean. Overall, it was a decent stay for the short time I was there.
Kitchen was very well stocked with cutlery and other needed items for eating and cooking.
Lots of storage/closet space so very good for longer stays or business traveling like I was doing. I was able to hang up what I needed to.
AC doesn't cool very quickly and it was over 80 degrees when I arrived late Saturday afternoon. It took quite a long time to cool down so I could relax and sleep.
Be sure you bring your own bath towels! The ones provided are super small and a size 2 can use them but no one larger.
No covered parking and lots of construction going on in the complex so there was limited parking available...especially with no reserved space for the unit. Coming and going was definitely difficult and construction isn't something I would've chosen to deal with, had I known ahead of time."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet & peaceful setting. Condo was just the right size with ample space for our birding equipment. Great location and accessible to many nearby birding hotspots. Highly recommended.

The condo was clean and exactly what I saw in his pics. The restroom was also clean and provied with toiletries and plenty of paper goods. The multiple messages from the host made me feel like they cared and wanted to make sure I had a comfortable stay, Thank you for that! Great place, great atmosphere, great area and a comfortable bed to suit. I will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our quick getaway. David’s property was situated perfectly- lots of surrounding beaches, fishing and restaurants.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the house and location!! Will definitely want to book this Airbnb again!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place will come back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a serene and scenic getaway not too far from home and some friends of ours recommended Colleen's condo. We really feel like both the listing and our friends undersold us on this place. It was peaceful, beautiful, and just the right size for four adults and two (very) little kids to enjoy the scenery at the coast. We hadn't even left yet and were thinking of days we could sneak away from real life to come back to this place. Thanks for a rejuvenating weekend full of sea air and crashing waves!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This unit was at a great location. We were able to walk right out the door and be directly on the beach. Colleen was a great host and was very responsive with any questions we had.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Whether it’s just adults or adults with children, there’s something for everyone. (Sushi, pizza, ice cream, grocery store, golf cart rental etc)
You can relax on the beach, fish, go to the pool, play games outside or inside or go to the National Seashore 8 miles away.
The condo is equipped with SO many extras, Colleen has it all covered!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location on the TX Gulf Coast! It was great to be able to walk out the door and be on the beach — for a walk, a dip in the water, or an afternoon. We loved the big windows, waking up to see the sunrise over the water, and the well appointed, comfortable spaces. We had friends over for supper and shared our wonderful welcome charcuterie board. The kitchen had everything we needed for a festive evening and stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful location where you can walk right out to the boardwalk that runs along the beach. Gorgeous views of the water with no railing to block your view. Liked the fact that because it is a corner unit if it was too sunny or windy on one side of the building I could switch sides. Comfortable patio furniture, I spent hours reading and watching the waves. The waves were pretty big so we didn’t go swimming in the Gulf, but the heated pool was nice to swim in."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Place to stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful beach vacation suited for families. loved the bedrooms and access to the beach was so easy and convenient. Hosts were very hospitable and kind.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Colleen’s place is lovely and wonderful. It is in front on the beach, so it is very convenient plus it has all the things you would need for a picnic at the beach with a baby. You have all the kitchen utensils you would need and condiments so even if you dont get out for a lazy day it is perfect. The house smells good and we appreciate the fresh flowers and wine. We really enjoyed my birthday get-way with family there. It is a memory for keeps and we hope to come back next time. Thank you Colleen!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Grandmother, 2 daughters and 4 kids 6 and under. PERFECT location for these aged children, house has everything you could want and more. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This condo is full of windows so you can see the ocean from the great room and the main bedroom. I love how it takes me two minutes to walk straight to the beach. It is a taste of what living on the beach would feel like—- a total escape to paradise. Really beautiful decor and so clean. Literally the cleanest place I have ever stayed in on Airbnb.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! We only stayed for 2 nights, but wish it could’ve been longer. The beach toys/equipment/towels were a HUGE plus. Waking up early to see the sunrise over the ocean was incredible. Colleen has really made this a special place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Colleen's place was great!! Genuinely we thought it was a house, at first. But this condo was a great spot to stay if you love the beach. Amazing views, just like the pictures and far enough away from any city noise, you can hear the ocean throughout the night. Perfect place to relax and melt away stress. Even in overcast weather we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfect. Host is very responsive and helpful. Location and views can't be beat. The beach is right out the patio door. A few steps down the concrete water barrier and you are in the sand. The walkway right out the patio is nice to walk in the morning or at sunset as well. We had a bonfire on the beach one night which was great. Condo has a shared pool and hot tub as well. Kitchen has everything needed. Rooms and beds were clean and very comfortable beds. Our toddler loved the toys and fort building couch. Turntable with a good selection of vinyls is a nice touch too! we had a great time. I don't think you could find a much better place to stay on Padre Island than here. We would definitely come back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The water views are spectacular and looked exactly like the pictures. The place was cute and cozy with everything you could possibly need for your stay. It was a tranquil time of year, and the privacy was great for a peaceful stay. The only unexpected adventure was the mosquitos. They were out in full force as my morning run as I got bombarded, and they were so bad in the evening that we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the view. Of course, this is mother nature, and by no means controllable by the host, it was just bad timing for us. Overall, it was a great experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I told my husband what I imagine spending our anniversary/birthdays together and he found it. The view was just what I described to him. It was so amazing and beautiful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, had everything we needed and more! Very warm welcoming, great location, right at the beach and the roller skates won my kids hearts. Made our first experience at the gulf coast very memorable. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place. Right on the beach, heated pool for the colder days, and the house has enough activities for inside too. We enjoyed all the extras, a treat to welcome us, beach toys, games, oyster shells to paint etc). We liked that all the kids could sleep together as well."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love love LOVED our stay at the adorable DreamWeaver! It totally met and exceeded expectations! Our favorite was being able to find the beach right outside the room :) It is private in the way there is not car traffic, so made it a great place to play frisbee and do yoga! Our daughter had a blast with the Polaroid camera. Colleen had great recommendations for our staycation, and the Island House itself is adorable. Staff at the front office are very friendly, with things you may need if you forget something. We also enjoyed the warm salty pool. The dark sky made it great for watching the meteor shower."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you need to get away from everything , this condo is the best one ! You literally walk right out and the beach is there ! Watching the sunrise from bed was so peaceful . We will definitely book this exact condo again . Colleen was very helpful with all the instructions to check in , and any other questions we had . Best vacation ever !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fabulous! Amazing! The best of the best! Can I say more?!? Lol. This is the crème de la crème. This is the 5 star European resort for a 10th of the price. What a wonderful host and what a wonderful condo.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This corner condo location to beach and view was amazing. Home was clean and spacious. We spent most of our time enjoying the back patio facing the beach and it was a perfect weekend rental. Colleen’s book of instructions were all as stated and we had no issues at all. Very peaceful trip with family and a lot of good memories . I highly recommend!!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful visit! Loved being so close to the beach and all the little touches to help make our trip a memorable one. Our kids loved their spacious room and the views were incredible. Can’t get any closer to the beach and we had it pretty much to ourselves. Can’t wait to go back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful condo. Perfect location if you want to walk to the beach.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the condo for a few days with our toddler. It has absolutely everything you could need for the beach - a canopy, chairs, sand toys, cooler, blankets, speaker and more. It was so easy to walk to the beach to setup and spend the day. There aren't a lot of people in that area of the beach because cars cannot drive onto the beach. There are a lot of people walking around on the path outside the condo and on the beach.
Colleen was always very responsive and provided a really wonderful wine and charcuterie gift upon our arrival. The polaroid was fun and made us want to get our own. There were also plenty of games and puzzles to play inside.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this place for your visit to the beach."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Colleen’s place was just what we needed!
It was such a special condo and we made wonderful memories there.
We wished we didn’t have to leave!
From the moment we arrived we felt right at home.
The view and location to the beach was perfect!
The charcuterie gift waiting for us was a special touch and also really really good.
The decor and ambiance was amazing!
The beds were so comfy and all the extras that were there for us in the condo made our trip!
We can’t wait for next time 🖤"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a special place. There is a clear, wide open view of the water and we so enjoyed the easy access to the beach during the day and the peaceful patio to enjoy the cool evening shade with a glass of wine. The condo is cute, quirky, and very comfortable. The beach directly in front is not accessible for cars so it’s very peaceful and not crowded or loud."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect family beach stay. The host was so gracious with her welcoming gifts and was always available to answer any questions. House is full of anything you could possibly need. We will be booking again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As soon as we walked in we were impressed. The extra welcoming touches were so sweet. The kids were more than entertained with coloring and games. Easy access to beach and watched the Sunrise each morning. Beds were very comfortable and it had everything we needed. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Colleen was wonderful to work with and was very responsive to messages. She was very proactive and had a welcome guide with everything we needed to know. The place was very clean and had exceptional views. We will definitely return in the future.

In addition, Coleen was always available for any questions I might have!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What we wanted was something close to the beach. What we got was close to the beach AND a very luxurious place to stay. All the amenities and comfort you’d need for a relaxing getaway. Nice patio for morning coffee and sunrise or evening cocktails and people watching. Super comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen and pantry. As well as beach toys. Do yourself a favor and rent the cabanas from Island House office. Well worth it. Hope this place is available next time we head to the coast.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing. Location can’t be beat with young children . The beach along the sea wall was clean and not crowded ( even during 4th of July!!) always clean , stocked with thoughtful toys for the kids, books, art materials , beach toys, floats . The view is spectacular and having a yard is great. We normally always had to have a upper level with balcony for the view but this place has the best of both worlds !!! Seaside gem!! Literally the only place we stay when we come to the beach now. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at Dreamweaver! It is clean and comfortable. The location-right next to the beach-is the best! The condo is full of fun toys, fun games, and entertaining activities. We hope to make it back soon!"

Master bedroom has a white noise machine that I loved so much, I had to buy one on Amazon.
Fantastic stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location. Will be returning !
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is fantastic! The location is great and the view from the living room... I couldn't have asked for more! Colleen was super responsive every time I had a question and was flexible with both our arrival and departure times, which was very much appreciated. Vehicles aren't allowed on the stretch of beach in front of the condo, which made for a more peaceful visit than it otherwise would have been. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was more than I could ever imagine! The pictures do not even come close to how beautiful this place was! Im speechless! The beachfront view made this trip so special. Waking up and seeing the sunrise over the water will be something I can never forget. Everything you could possibly need was handy at the Dreamweaver. I mean there was chairs and umbrellas, to kites and firewood. The kitchen was stocked along with the bathrooms. This made our trip so much less stressful! My daughters and I where so grateful to have such a wonderful host on top of the beautiful place. Colleen even dropped off extra film for the Polaroid my daughter enjoyed using. She communicated immediately any time I reached out or had questions. Colleen's welcoming gift contained a tasty and beautiful assembled charcuterie along with a bottle of wine. I couldn't have asked for a better host or a better place to stay for a well needed get away. The kids always had something to do and that gave me time to relax."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and quaint complex. Great location too!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just what we wanted: a quiet, clean, unique place right on the beach!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Colleen’s condo is truly such a gem. Wonderful views, beautiful decorated and well stocked with everything we needed to keep the kids entertained inside and out. The beach itself was a little disappointing, which is certainly no fault of Colleen’s. There is a steep concrete “stair”/barrier to get down to the actual water, and the water often crashed right up against it so it wasn’t easy to walk on the beach with toes in the sand. Also, I’ve never been to such a trashed up beach. It was depressing. Again, none of this is Colleen’s fault, but I think it should be known that there is a steep, difficult concrete stair barrier between the condo and the water."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay so much! The condo was exactly as described. Everything was very carefully thought out. We lacked for absolutely nothing. Spacious, clean, luxurious bathroom towels. Just perfect!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our quick stay was great! Loved how close to the ocean/beach this place is. Laying in bed with undistorted view was awesome! Very nice welcome upon our arrival. Will stay here again. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough good things about our stay at this Condo. Even though it’s in an older building, everything in the unit is beautiful and well maintained. Colleen put together so many thoughtful touches, we felt very welcome and at home for the long weekend. The beach is beautiful, the pool was warm and we will definitely go back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen is a super host! Her place is lovely, exactly like the photos with a super cool vibe. Colleen has thought of everything you will need for your stay and provides so many little extra on arrival. Colleen is extremely friendly and replies to questions promptly, no matter how big or small. Love love loved the apartment and will definitely be back for a beach weekend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The location is fantastic for walks on the beach and total relaxing in the sun chairs on the porch. We loved that you can order groceries delivered before you arrive. Colleen will put everything in the fridge for you. Colleen was very responsive and the place was very cozy and well equipped. Place was very quiet when we were there. Will love to come back. Sunrise are worth the early wake up.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,There are no words for how amazing this stay was!! Came down from Fort Worth to visit my son who lives here and brought down some of the grandkids. Beautiful weather so got to enjoy the heated pool and roller skate on the boulevard. Will definitely book again!! The “little” extras Colleen provides just put this visit over the top!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and a very accommodating host.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place had everything you would need for a great little getaway. We were very impressed, but what stood out the most was the easy communication and the little surprises/welcoming gifts. These little touches make the trip so much more special. We loved it here. Thank you, Colleen!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay! We even extended one night. Great location, every thing you could think of is provided! Such a beautiful little place, would stay again for sure!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you very much! Everything was great!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great end to 2022 and start to 2023 at this beautiful Oceanside rental! Hostess was very helpful and responsive and flexible on checkin and checkout to meet our crazy flight schedule! We will be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place with great views from the living room and bedroom. The beach is accessible from the apartment. We loved our stay and would love to come back in future!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's perfect location with the best view you can get. The place was clean, nice and cozy with the record player to make your vacation just perfect. would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay with the best view in the morning with a cup of coffee."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dreamweaver was such a special place. Our hostess Colleen thought of everything! From games and crafts for the kids to a Polaroid camera to s’mores kits, robes, & popcorn we couldn’t ask for a more welcoming space.
The ocean (gulf) view for the morning
sunrise was a peaceful way to start each day with a cup of tea and the salt air. The record player with Bluetooth speaker set the perfect island vibe. And Colleen even let us know about an endangered turtle release event during our stay. Truly magical!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely stay, just as pictured! Colleen was a wonderful/communicative host and I found the property to have lovely family-friendly touches - Polaroid camera, toys for the kids, and kid friendly snacks left on the counter for us. We are already talking about our return trip! Thank you, Colleen!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place for families. This was our first trip as a family and it was great. My seven year old loved the bunk beds. Colleen is an excellent host and went above and beyond to make our stay feel like home. Surprised us with gifts for our little one.
The property was immaculately clean when we arrived for check-in. All of the amenities are fantastic and such nice touches. Beautiful view of sunrise and sea right from the property rooms. Throughly enjoyed our stay and will be back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location right on the beach! We really enjoyed our time.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great beach spot! Cute place! Had so much fun.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Colleen thought of everything and had a couple of cool surprises, including a toddler Lego set as a gift for my 3 year old daughter, and a Polaroid camera to capture some fun memories! The condo has the most ideal view, and it walks straight out on to the beach. For after hours water play, the swimming pool is warm and heated, and stocked with plenty of toys for the kids. It was a really fun stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"They've thought of absolutely everything at this location! Communication was top notch from the start, we felt extra welcomed and made many memories. It was the PERFECT place to relax and have fun in the sun. Thank you thank you thank you! Do not sleep on this location and go have a great time with family and/or friends."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property is absolutely wonderful. The host is very communicative. The property was immaculately clean when we arrived for check-in. All of the amenities are fantastic and such nice touches. We loved the personality of the building. The beach is steps away from the patio. We particularly liked that the beachfront is a stretch of beach where cars are not allowed to drive. We will definitely return!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Traveling with small kids can be stressful, but this beautifully decorated condo on the perfect stretch of beach, not far from big city amenities, run by an incredible host, made our mini-getaway so much better. We’re sure to come back again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This may be one of my all time favorite Airbnb stays! The location can’t be beat and Colleen thought of everything you need to have a comfortable and relaxing stay. Would absolutely come back here!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Caring and accommodating host! Not only were we greeted with remarkable views, personalized snacks and drinks, and literally anything we could possibly need, but also Colleen was very gracious and allowed for us to push back our reservation a couple of weeks due to unforeseen circumstances. Our best family vacation and memories to date. Bring bug spray!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s right on the beach. Location cannot get any better. Colleen was a great host - she called heb and prefetched our online order and put it away for us before we arrived. The home had everything we needed. The condo complex is a bit old but this unit is great!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a wonderful place for families. This was our first trip as a family of four and it was great. My three year old loved the bunk beds. The on-site travel crib for my 6 month old was great because it was one less thing we needed to pack. It’s so refreshing to have a place catered to families. I love the attention to details such as having a nice bottle of wine chilling when we arrived, the gift of baby lotions, and the little candies that my toddler loved. Being so close to the beach was biggest plus. We will definitely be back."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location with a wonderful view. The restricted access beach made for a very peaceful and relaxing escape. I will definitely visit again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! It's clean, the location is absolutely stunning, and it was set up with everything we needed. If you are looking for a beach getaway place this is perfect!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great, the view, the access to the beach was perfect. The location was great for getting to Corpus or Port Aransas , or just some of the local restaurants."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Enjoyed our stay very much! Location, location,location!! Appreciated all the extras she provided if something was needed or forgotten! Fun retro beach vibe and loved the polaroids. Very comfortable beds, family friendly!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome location and condo!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great time! 10 out of 10!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great girls trip weekend at Colleen’s place. You cannot ask for a better location to the beach. The house was very clean and everything and more we could have possibly needed. Love looking around and seeing all the extras that gave the place that extra touch. Thanks again Colleen! We had a great time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is definitely the place to go to be at the beach it was right out the patio door! We had 5 kids with us and everyone of them had somewhere to sleep and they enjoyed themselves with all the games and books! 10/10 recommend and we will definitely be going back sometime!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely amazing! You cannot get closer to the beach than this location. Colleen was very responsive whenever I had any questions. Do not overthink it and book this condo!! You will not regret it! :-)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dreamweaver is the place! You are sure to love & never want to leave! Everything was perfect & the memories will last forever.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome views! Has everything you need! Nicely put together house booklet (local info, instructions, etc) Record player was a nice bonus for me! Our family of 5 enjoyed our beach time every day and it was so great to be able to walk across the grass and sidewalk and step down the sea wall to the beach. Also allows for easy retrieval of chairs, canopy, games, etc from the condo. Great location and the beach is borderline private for the Island House community since vehicles cannot park in the section behind the building and that stretches down to the left (north) for a good bit. And you can just take a short walk that direction and set up camp there if you want to be by yourself on the beach. We also grill some nights on vacation and the Island House has a nice setup with 5 grills close to the pool that were recently updated and cleaned daily by the staff. Lastly, great communication from Colleen! Thanks for everything!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolute Perfection! Colleen really took into consideration all of her occupants needs and was a FANTASTIC hostess. Her place is immaculate, beautiful and perfect for a little beach getaway. I’m in love and will absolutely be returning.
Thank you so much for an incredible time 😊"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,5/5 would highly recommend. My family and myself were very happy we chose this booking. Not only was the location very spacious but it was very well decorated. Anything you could possibly need was made available. We thank Colleen for allowing our family to make a memory in her home.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this property! We loved spending time here. Everything was so clean and cozy. My kids enjoyed all the games and fun little touches like the roller skates and Polaroid camera. We can’t wait to go back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pack your swimsuit & this condo has everything else you need! Seriously, everything! We’ve stayed at 3 different condos in padre over the last 7 years & we found the perfect spot! I can’t say enough about Colleen going the extra mile to make sure you feel welcome & comfortable. The vibe is so relaxing & the decor fresh, clean & cozy! You can’t beat the view, I seriously could sit there all day if the beach wasn’t calling! Don’t worry about any noise from neighbors, cause sounds machines are provided if you are a light sleeper. Lots of fun games, records & we enjoyed the binoculars too! It was hard to pack up & head home, can’t wait to stay again! 💕"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I can't say enough good things about Colleen and the condo. All of the amenities combined with the perfect location -- what more could you ask for? We've stayed at many places along the Texas coast and this was by far our favorite. We did not want to leave. A perfect getaway for our family of three and our son's friend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best air bnb beach stay we have had! I most appreciated that Colleen had anything you could need for an amazing beach day right there at the condo. She left clear instructions both through an email, and also on a clipboard at the condo, including great local recommendations. The view from the living room was stunning, the decor was lovely and the whole place was very clean. I could not recommend this boho haven more. I hope we can return for another stay in the future!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My husband and I rented Colleen’s place for our anniversary and had the best time. The view from the living area of the condo is beautiful and the beach is just steps away. Colleen made us feel so welcome in her home. There were small touches that made it feel like home. We had our one year old daughter with us and it couldn’t have been a greater rental with her. We enjoyed the beach and the pool during our stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here sitting outside with the ocean and watching the bird in action. The unit was very clean and just over all a first-class experience. Highly recommended.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A truly 5-star experience. Colleen is so thoughtful from her communication to the touches and amenities throughout the condo. My guests were all happy. I’d stay here every time I went to the beach if possible!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a nice slice of heaven. Our family had a great time at the beach and the beds were comfortable for us and the kids. We definitely will come again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is amazing! You are a few steps from what is basically a private beach since only the condominium guests use it. The condo itself is charming and fully stocked with anything and everything you can imagine for family fun. We look forward to returning to this gem.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trip-changing stay!!! You MUST stay here! The space is so serene, clean, and teeming with thoughftul detail. Colleen, your host, is so wonderfully attentive and easy to commumicate with. You seriously couldn't go wrong with a stay at Colleen's!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of a kind experience! When you're there you quickly realize you have the best spot on the beach. The heated pool was also really nice and it stays open until 11pm. But my personal favorite experience was waking up early to watch the sunrise over the ocean.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Oceanfront Dreamweaver is a wonderful place to stay. We would absolutely stay there again. It is super clean, the beds and bedding are very comfortable. It is very spacious with a tremendous view. Being a corner unit gives you and enormous view and 4 patio chairs gave you plenty of places to just sit and relax. The papasan chair look so cute and are very comfortable for reading or napping. The beach is right outside the slider doors. The kitchen and bathrooms are supplied with everything you need. My daughters loved the record player and the snacks and movies available from the front desk. The swimming pool is wonderfully warm and clean. The condominium staff are very friendly and helpful."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Colleen’s Dreamweaver was sublime. Family friendly, ultra comfortable, a beautiful location. Thank you for a lovely vacation. We will definitely be back!l"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Colleen's condo was perfection. It doesn't get any better for a family vacation. The location and view was spectacular. The corner condo unit is on a small section of beach closed to traffic. So great for our family getaway. We could just slide open the door and the kids could run outside! Plus there was a lovely heated pool in the complex which we used daily as well. Colleen also supplied everything you needed to make the most of the beach, chairs, umbrella, plenty of towels, etc. There's super comfy patio furniture and hose for cleaning off before coming inside which was very convenient. So many thoughtful touches inside the apartment, from s'mores ingredients, extra toiletries, welcome snacks, games, vinyl records, and of course plush towels and linens. We literally didn't leave our condo for 5 days it was so wonderful."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So I am not writing long reviews because I don't want to read long reviews. This is a great place to stay with the family, directly on the beach with all the tools you need for time full of fun and fun and fun. Try the taccos vs burritos game, it's a blast."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is as good as it gets — every single detail inside the house, the local
recommendations from the owner,
the view from the corner unit, the location and private access to the beach. We never wanted to leave and can’t wait to return. Thank you for creating such a memorable experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this location very much. The unit was as advertised and the host, Colleen, couldn’t have been more accommodating. She checked in often on preparation for our arrival, provided extensive details about the area sites and restaurants. Asked us what we wanted for our arrival and provided a bottle of wine and appetizers for our stay. The unit is oceanfront and had tremendous views. The beach right in front of the building is protected from traffic and parking so very private for the guests of the building. The building had a nice communal feel and the other people in the building were friendly."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views. The beach is a jump away. Located close to an IGA grocery store and lots of restaurants. Rooms are Light bright and airy! Amazing sunsets from super comfy bed. Every amenity you will need and then some. White noise machines were such an unexpected surprise. Lots of extra towels. The pool is super warm. Very clean! The record player was just FUN. We’d stay here again and again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We spent three nights here with our family of 5. It's a beautiful place and Colleen has really thought of everything! So welcoming and cozy and the views...holy cow! Truly a waterfront property! We will be back again for sure!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Oceanfront Dreamweaver is a great family escape. this property has all the essentials and more for a family... comfortable sleeping arrangements, hotel quality linens and very functional kitchen. The location is fantastic with ocean and sandy beach steps away. The view from the property is mezmorizing. don't be fooled by the dated exterior of the building as the living space has been tastefully updated. Grocery and other amenities are close by but stock up or get groceries delivered as you won't want to leave this cozy and fun retreat."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Comfy beds and space to spread out. Clean. Low water pressure. Neighborhood didn’t look the best driving in but no issues.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute little modern home with private driveway in a quiet neighborhood. 3 bedrooms with 3 comfortable king beds. Location was convenient to Highway and getting to downtown. Only complaint is I wish they had extra toilet paper stocked in the house lol

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great...nice peaceful little place for a couple to get a piece of mind. I brought my boat w/me and needed to park my boat outside on the street, because it's to long to turn inside the driveway. But felt very safe especially feeling secured in a good neighbor hood w/good surveillance cameras and much lighting, and also was advised by our host Karl it's a very safe peaceful place w/good neighbors. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at karls airbnb it was very well maintained and was always available The home is very cute and had everything we needed The view is amazing and very peaceful
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and very nice host! Was better then what the pictures showed! Very peaceful property and Karl was so nice to me and my gf!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could write all day about how beautiful Karl’s Air B&B is. From the very beginning, he and his co-host Corey were extremely responsive. Upon arrival, Karl greeted my husband and I with his lovely pet Cha-Cha who is a delight to meet. They both made us feel right at home. The view is incredible. Everything was nearby (Walmart around the corner) so it was easy for us to purchase groceries and cook in the Casita. Although we had to take work with us, we had an amazing time working with that incredible view. We laid on the hammock quite a bit and just enjoyed the view. We had such a relaxing weekend, and we definitely correlate it to Karl’s Casita. Thank you for allowing us to stay. We will most definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful space.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Casita is even better than the photos! Nice relaxing setting, with a remote feel, but close to a lot things to do. Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Real relaxing and peaceful atmosphere, enjoyed the stay amenities, recommend to anyone who is interested to stay in the surrounding area 👍🏼"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karl's Casita and it's surroundings was absolutely gorgeous. Our visit was a short one so we weren't able to enjoy all of the amenities that were there, but we'll definitely be back for a longer stay so we can do so!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Karl's place was a great place to stay for our short visit. Karl let us know we could come by early and check in if needed and check out anytime we wanted. Karl was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best place if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life at this tranquil retreat. The sunset alone is a captivating spectacle, making it a perfect sanctuary for those seeking solitude and serenity in a private setting."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my 10-day stay. The guesthouse is private and one of the nicer Airbnbs I've stayed in. It's very comfortable and clean with a wonderful view of the bay. I didn't have a car and could easily walk to many places, from fishing spots to restaurants to convenience stores to Walmart. A car would make getting around even easier. The host is very nice and responsive and respected my privacy. Recommended!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a Hidden Gem Karl's Place is, the place is even better than what the pictures show. Super clean, furnished very well and Karl goes out of his way to make sure that you have everything you need for your stay. Will definitely be staying here again soon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita is absolutely beautiful and has everything you need. Karl was very welcoming and showed us around the property himself. Cha-cha is his super sweet little pup who was happy to greet us when we arrived. I wish we had had more time to just stay at the casita and relax. Next time we are in Corpus, we would absolutely love to stay here, it was top notch."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karl was just awesome! Super friendly and very accommodating. Karl just went above and beyond at every turn. The facilities were very private and the inside of the casita had hand crafted cypress cabinets and terracotta tile throughout. The whole compound was surrounded by a mid-height stucco wall and the grounds were beyond elegant.
We were in corpus to fish and towed a double jetski trailer. Karl let us flush our skis daily. We felt completely safe leaving our gear on our crafts overnight. The last morning we fished right of the backyard and caught 3 reds and 3 trout. One trout was 27 inches!!
To those potential renters you will absolutely love this place. Please, as a word of caution, take care of how you treat this place. Clean up after yourself. Don’t abuse this beautiful place. This is Karl’s home and he intentionally and willfully goes out of his way to make it feel like it is yours as well. God bless you Karl and thanks for your hospitality and friendship. God speed brother."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Karl, and his little sidekick, Cha-Cha, made us feel very welcome and the location is simply beautiful. Karl thought of everything a guest might need and ensured we had a great time. The location is close to everything you could want, but we enjoyed just hanging out at the casita. We hope to come back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a great getaway for our family. The bed was very comfortable! There were plenty of linens and towels for use. Lots of bathroom items in case you forgot something. Kitchen had lots of cooking utensils. We appreciated having a washer and dryer handy. The patio area was great, my husband loves fishing and really enjoyed being able to cast right off the back porch. The only drawback is that it is located right next to a bar and grille that plays live music. We enjoyed the music actually we just were hoping for a little more privacy. We did bring a sound machine for our 2 year old son and did not notice the noise once we went to bed but I’m sure without the sound machine we would have heard the music. Lisa was very responsive with any questions we had. I felt it was a good value for the area. There was a beach right by the airbnb but we opted to drive a little further out and enjoy padre island national seashore which was much less crowded. We had a great time!"

Extras like bottled water and creamers in the fridge. Many quality towels, toilet paper, body wash, shampoo/conditioner. Drip coffee & decaf. And my favourite: a soft closing toilet.

A little bungalow behind their home.
Perfect for what I needed.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was incredibly peaceful. The only thing I would classify as not so great was the temperature in the bungalow. It was very hot outside all week (which didn’t help) but we moved the mattress to the floor directly in front of the window unit AC (we kept it on the lowest available, 60 to all stay, and it did not seem to cool the place down too much. Other than the heat inside it was nice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Clean and perfect location.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is located in a pretty neighborhood featuring lovely early 20th century mansions, about an equal drive to the beaches and the downtown area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful Bungalow!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friend and I had a lovely stay at the bungalow! It was cozy and inviting and made my first stay in Corpus Christi so cozy. By far, what I enjoyed the most about this home was its location. The neighborhood is wonderful and you can easily walk to the pier which we did.
This location is filled with charm.
As a believer, it was also wonderful to see that they had left a Bible for us to take.
In the evening, you’ll want to make sure the AC fan is on cool and set where the air flow is the highest. We did wake up feeling a bit stuffy in the bedroom (as it felt the air didn’t reach there) but as soon as we adjusted the air con we were able to sleep better.
Otherwise the bed itself was very comfortable.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The bungalow was perfect for what we needed, and Larry and Beth were very friendly and accommodating!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated their accommodation of my asthma and sensitivity to fragranced products. It helps that there is hardwood floors and no carpet. Also the bedding was not fragranced which really really helped me get a good night's sleep. It was a quiet, peaceful place to stay during my conference at a reasonable price.
Thanks so much."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a musician I travel a lot and tend to keep odd hours. This trip was a two day stay. I got in at 3am and departed at midnight. Area was very well lit, quite. safe and secure. The bungalow has a great vibe. Everything you might need or want was provided. This stay surpasses quite a few of those I've stayed at. Frankly, this is why I stay at airbnbs with the hopes of a personal stay and not what you find at the chain hotels. Larry & Beth have a wonderful place and I will return!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very peaceful stay, and Beth and Larry were very friendly!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect for a quick one-night stay for my husband and I! I had planned a beach trip but it was super cold outside - we ended up just staying inside the bungalow most of the time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Very cozy and we happened to see the hosts when we arrived, and they greeted us but left us to our space as well. We did get awakened by the chickens at about 8:30, but that in itself has a charm to it! We loved our stay and would totally go back."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a comfortable stay in the cute bungalow.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Basically, this is exactly what I hope for when I travel. Tiny. Quiet. Private. Tucked away. But still near everything I needed to do while in town.
Loved this place... would definitely stay here again.
Nathan Brown"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a nice comfortable setting to come home to at day's end. And the fact that there was no large screen tv hanging off the wall running interference on our lives, made our stay all the more enjoyable."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cozy, quiet little place. Bed was comfortable. Nice shower with hot water. Didn’t miss not having a TV. Good WiFi. Coffee was nice addition. The only thing is, be careful opening your car door when you park on the side of the street if you have a low car, as you could damage your door on impact with the higher curbs! Thankfully, we noticed that before it was too late. Definitely not a deal breaker, just a warning."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoying this beautiful cozy cottage here in Corpus Christi Tx.
Walk to Cole park and see the pier for relaxation by the sea.
Regards Vivian"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Close to Del Mar College, Incarnate Word Academy, and W. B. Ray high school. Close to Seaside Cemetery where I went to honor my husband. Great place to stay for a quick trip. Quiet and peaceful. I do not like to walk on the grass beside the driveway to get to the bungalow. Two vehicles and an RV in driveway. Other than that, I recommend staying at By the Bay Bungalow."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a few days. Very friendly hosts. Safe place to park my motorcycle was really appreciated. Great water pressure. Bed was very comfortable. Ticked all my boxes.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was adorable and the perfect size! Great location, felt very safe. We wish there was an easier way to get back to it though, we had to walk through the neighboors soggy grass. Also, it was a little surprising that we were sharing a wall with chickens. They weren't noisy, just caught us off-guard."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this little piece of cozy comfort. From the fruit and oatmeal to the hosts, making sure our place was nice and warm when we arrived. They communicate and pretty much answered every question we might have had before we even arrived. Larry and Beth are amazing. We look forward to staying with them again soon!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very conveniently located a few blocks from the beach and park. The place is beautifully decorated and furnished. The bibles were a nice comforting touch. The hosts were very friendly and helpful with local recommendations. A nice getaway. :)
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Larry and Beth were accommodating and friendly. They opened their home with love and good tidings. Their home was beautifully decorated, nice and clean, and in a good area, minutes away from the beach. I was fortunate to eat at Hester’s diner, which was delicious and offered a healthy variety of meals.
Their garden and animals helped create an atmosphere that was safe and inviting. It was inspiring to see the past diary log of each persons stay and to include my own. Would recommend this beach bungalow to anyone!
I loved how Larry and Beth gave me a cute note with a Bible to share the good news about the gospel. It is wonderful to see fellow Christian’s sharing the love.
Jesus said…
“My command is this: love each other as I have loved you.""
John 15:12

2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful location, and the bungalow looks just like the pictures. However the hosts are very religious and made my friend and I very uncomfortable. Not everyone is a Christian and you shouldn’t push beliefs on others. VERY Unprofessional."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Quaint little bungalow in a great location.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place for 1-2 people visiting town, very cozy."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so happy my friend and I chose to stay at Larry & Beth’s bungalow. We’ve always stayed at hotels and although they are very nice, we loved the comfy vibe of staying at the bungalow. It was peaceful and just a few blocks from the water.
We appreciated receiving a bible as a gift and thought it was no coincidence we chose the bungalow, because one of our purposes for our trip was to pray over the city of Corpus Christi.
When I return here I’d definitely stay at the bungalow again. I loved the water pressure too! I have very thick hair and that can make or break my trip… especially if it involves the beach!
The bungalow was the perfect size for me and my friend and I did bring an air mattress for me which fit perfectly in the living area.
I love how close the bungalow was to everything and that McGee Beach was right there because that’s the only beach cars aren’t driven on and that was very important to me.
When I text Beth she was quick to respond and she has a great sense of humor! Thanks for being amazing hosts Larry & Beth!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place would definitely book again if I'm in the area.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay. Thank you so much Larry and Beth.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think this place meets the value paid. We were in town for the Beach to Bay relay and this was cheaper than a hotel, included a mini kitchen, and was only a mile from the beach. Well decorated and very clean. Bed was a little small for two people and bathroom smelled (seemed like more of a plumbing thing than a cleanliness issue though - the space was well-kept and cleaned). Wasn't able to turn bedroom fan on at night while light was off. Overall, minor inconveniences in a great space for the price."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend getaway. Property was clean and homey. Walking distance to the beach and food spots around town. Great stay !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,this place was adorable and in a great location. the bungalow was located in the owners backyard but we still had our privacy. we were on a couples getaway so coming home later at night we had to tiptoe and try not to bother them but we made it work! it did get a little warm in the room at night but nothing that made it uncomfortable. it was a great stay for a great price thank you for opening your bungalow to us
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was a clean but small space with inconvenient parking. The shower could have been cleaner but didn’t feel the need for shower shoes. Really good water pressure though.
I will return to Corpus Christi again and again but I do not believe that I myself would seek this place for a future stay"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and Clean with amazing views, will be returning again :)"

The pool is very comfortable and beautiful. We use the grill area without a problem.
The apartment has the essentials to have a pleasant stay and the right tools for cooking.
The only detail we had was that there was a lot of noise in the apartment that was upstairs and it was heard, however it is understood that it cannot be controlled by the host.
Outside of that detail, it's perfect to relax and unwind.
This place is perfect, like and clean, we would definitely come back again. Thank you so much for everything!"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Check-in and out was quite easy and Amanda was very communicative. The unit was super clean and tidy and also looked just like the pictures.
The only downside is that the unit was quite bare bones. We ended up eating out way more than we anticipated because the kitchen didn't really have enough accessories to cook much at all. This might be fine for most folks, but my wife and I like to cook thus we choose to stay in Airbnb's often instead of hotels.
Overall though it was a positive experience!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Views are crazy great. Better than staying in a complex and looking at other buildings, you are looking at an intersection of a canal with homes, boats, piers and green lights in the

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo is beautiful. Very spacious. I love the view and it is perfectly clean. I really like the pathway to the sea. So closed to the beach! Scott is very responsive and friendly and I appreciate him giving recommendation where to go especially on Friday night to chill out. He is very flexible on our check in and out. I highly recommend this condo!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to go and enjoy a few days away on Padre Island. The beach was within easy walking distance which was nice. The area wasn’t overly crowded so it felt peaceful. Great views of the sunset from the balcony.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was great and I felt at home! Really close to the beach - wish I could have stayed longer. Animal decor was so cute too.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and host! Makes vacationing less stressful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful beach vacation! Great location and our we had everything we needed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a fantastic stay in Scott's condo! Everything was very clean, there were plenty of towels, linens, etc. kitchen was very well stocked with tools; beautiful view; nice quiet family environment; walk to the beach was great; there is an XBox which my kids loved; 3rd floor was nice because there was nobody above us to make noise and the view was nice. Closet stocked with Sand toys, boogie boards, beach chairs, canopy - everything you need for a day at the beach. We had a fantastic time - Scott is a wonderful host - very responsive and helpful - we can't wait for our next visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Our kids did surf camp and were able to walk to the beach every day (it has a private walkway to the beach). The pool was great too and never overly crowded. It had a lot more amenities than we were expecting (beach chairs, towels, canopy, boogie boards) and we loved having a washer/dryer. It was comfortable for our family of 6, but I would recommend more for 5 people as the pull out couch took up quite a bit of the living room. Scott was extremely responsive and also checked in regularly just to make sure we were doing good. Beautiful sunsets as well! Really enjoyed our time!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved the beach chairs, toys, and wagon that was available to use."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The Airbnb is in a great location. Close to the beach but also very quite and peaceful (during the days we visited). Scott was very helpful and provided all the necessary information we needed for our stay. My family and I had a great time and will definitely consider on coming back soon!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband & I along with our 3 children had a great experience staying here.
The condo exceeded our expectations. It was beautiful, clean & very close to the pool. We felt right at home. Scott & Autumn even provide beach chairs, toys, & 2 boogie boards so less items you have to pack. It’s very close to multiple restaurants & convenient stores. (HardKnocks Sports Bar & Grill was our favorite.)
It’s walking distance to the beach, but since driving/parking on the beach is allowed with a beach permit we chose to do that instead. This beach is probably the nicest beach that we have been to in Texas. It was very clean and has lifeguards on duty most of the day.
We highly recommend Scott & Autumn’s condo.
Thanks so much for helping us make a lot of fun memories!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very nice place, great location. me and and my family really enjoyed it"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place with lots of room. Loved all the extra amenities that were included.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were checking out going in June. That didn't work out. Scotty posted a special for this week. We were able to take advantage of the special. Just a quick 3 day getaway!
Wow! The location was perfect. Could see the Gulf and bay. Walk to the beach. Beautiful pool. Condo was amazing. Everything we needed. Highly recommend. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit was even better than described. Scott had beach equipment to make a trip to the beach convenient for us. The kitchen was over the top - best equipped kitchen!!!!
All in all I think this was my favorite of the many airbnb I have stayed at."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and within walking distance of the beach. Great experience.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay. Is very clean, the rooms are big and the bathroom very clean. The kitchen was excellent, great space for cooking, and the living room is great to relax and enjoy a peaceful time. Excellent washer and dryer. It is only 10-12 minutes walk from the rental to Chistus Spohn Hospital. So if you have family or friends that are in the hospital and you plan on spending a few days visiting them. The home is a perfect place to stay.
The only two things that I would suggest to Christopher (Host) would be to update the bed frames or the beds.
The second thing would be to add a place in The bathroom to hang the towels and a place to put the toiletries. There is not enough around the sink.
Excellent house, I would stay there again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The propery was newly remodeled. beautiful and clean. The view was nice, and condo is just across the street from the beach. Host was helpful and quick response as we needed to add to our reservation. Great property, great host. We have family in the area so we will rent again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Christopher and Mindy’s place! It’s spotless, perfectly located right across from the bay, and comfortable as can be. They were the best hosts too - friendly, accommodating, and responsive whenever we reached out to them. We look forward to our next stay. Can’t recommend this place highly enough!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome stay!! My family and I felt super comfortable like we were at home. The location is perfect its literally across the beach walking distance. Place was so clean and fancy. Willl visit again. Hostess was so nice!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here and would highly recommend it! The area is gorgeous and walking distance to a small public beach on the bay. I spoke with Christopher before our trip and Mindy during our trip. They both took the time to pick up the phone and call me when I had questions. They are lovely people and very friendly. We plan to stay there again on our next trip.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! The photos don't do it justice it's just beautiful! We felt right at home, host was amazing and responsive. We had EVERYTHING we needed. There were pots, pans, utensils, cookie sheets, everything. He even left some pods for use to wash clothes which came in handy after the beach. It was clean, clutter free, I honestly didn't want to leave. This will be my go to place next time I go back to Corpus Christi. I HIGHLY recommend this place. It's perfect and the views are beautiful. It's also a quick walk to the beach. Area was peaceful, quiet and safe."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice place close to downtown.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice and when we had requested air to be programmed lower Christopher took care of it. Egg toilet was different, but everything was nice and clean."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for everything!!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was traveling internationally during my stay so wasn’t much of a help. My biggest concern was the lack of bathroom supplies (body wash, only one toilet roll for a 4 night stay of 2 people, no shampoo/ conditioner, no hair dryer, etc).
Other than that, everything was good.
Suggestion to add a microwave and coffee maker. :)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very easy, comfortable and clean stay. The bed was even a Sleep Number bed! The privacy of the room was perfect. Our host was so very sweet and kind and came out to meet us and even offered to help carry things for us, which of course was unnecessary but very kind. We needed a place to stay kind of on the fly when our first accommodations didn’t work out for that night so we were so thankful to have found Kladji’s place. Easy to find and check in."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I first thanked them for accepting me on such a short notice. Setting aside my stay at their home for the moment, I never met the nicest and friendliest couple in my lifetime and I've been around for some time. Honest and true hospitality . My bedroom and bathroom were immaculate. They also provided a parking spot in their driveway for my rental, a tiled surface table/stool for outdoor use . My stay there was not 5 stars, more like ten. I felt more at home there then at my own apartment. Incidently , along with the furnishing were a large screen tv and small refrig. my stay there was the best. I thanked them with great gratitude and told them how fortunate I was to have met them."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.

Highly recommend!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved it! We will be back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Maria’s place seriously deserves ten stars. First, she reached out before our stay and was very friendly and welcoming. When we arrived, we got confused as there is a similar-style building nearby with the same address number and similar looking pool area. When we reached out to Maria, she contacted us right away and made sure we got in (to the right place :)). The place itself was very clean and welcoming, with lots of space. Our kids loved the bunk beds and the pool area. We went to the pool probably 3-4 times during our two-day stay. The rental and the pool area are very kid-friendly. The beach is only a few minutes walk away. The area was very quiet. Over the course of our stay, it felt like everything was very well thought out - this place has everything you might need. There are some great restaurants within minutes away. There are countless places to stay in this area and I’m so happy I came across Maria’s listing. We would definitely stay again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and very comfortable. We really enjoyed sitting on the deck in the evening with a drink and enjoying the breeze. The bed was very comfortable and the soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in shower was appreciated. Definitely a good place for a get away.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful right on the water. Very cute and clean and we had availability of the garage which was nice for freezing our fresh caught fish. Nate is a quick host to respond to questions and a battery issue with a door had it fixed quickly. The way the condo is set up you can have total privacy in either room you choose to stay in. We enjoyed having coffee on the deck and on the balcony off the master bedroom. We loved the place, we would love to stay here again if available next time we go to the island."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an AMAZING time here! The house had everything we needed and more! We enjoyed the deck, listening to music, and fishing!

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We went on business and the host and The location is great but I wouldn’t want to stay again due to the front door keypad having a camera on it and when the front door, which opens inside to the home can absolutely record in the home, which should not be allowed at all. There are more cameras on the WiFi than the host lists. One in the tree by the front area, one on the front door keypad , one on the front walkway and another keypad with camera on the garage door and maybe one facing the parking. If the host is so worried about security when they live locally then I wouldn’t feel safe returning. We have been visiting the island for 18 years and I’ve never seen so many cameras on one front entry way!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice , private, quiet"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. The condo was clean, comfortable, and very stylish. We loved fishing off the dock. Such a great experience all the way around.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"our whole goal for this trip was so that my husband could fish the whole entire time. so this Airbnb was perfect for us. when we weren't at the beach or the pier, he was on the balcony fishing, having a wonderful time. the hosts were very helpful and very kind, they responded to every question very quickly and their check out requirements were very simple. took a lot of stress off of our trip. the location was beautiful and very peaceful. we would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can not say enough about our host, Nate. This has been the second time staying here and each time, it never disappoints. I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Corpus as Nates place has everything you need! Not only is Nate very responsive, but he's very attentive as well. My wife loved this place and has already requested to come back. Not only did they accommodate us, but our pups as well! Thank you Nate, hope to be back soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Communication was outstanding. Nate's place has a covered boat slip and lift which was one of the reasons I selected his condo. I had several questions about the use of the lift and where to store the trailer during our stay. Nate answered emails within minutes. I wanted to make sure we were great temporary neighbors and Nate was great at helping me with that goal. The condo was perfect for our family - including our two 4-legged kiddos. Nate even has a welcome basket for the pets!! First class...we really appreciated that.

The master bed was heavenly to sleep in. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and the grill right out the back door was a plus to cook our fresh seafood and steaks. The Kayak and paddle boards were a great bonus to toddle around the bay and take in the scenery. Great location close to shops, grocery, and the beach. Easy to find and entry was a breeze.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My trip was work related. It was a perfect studio type cottage. Very clean and welcoming decorations. Loved all the plants. It gave me the ability to plan my meals during the week rather than staying in a hotel and eating out every day. Very roomy as well since my son and husband were able to join me later in the week. It is a great place in a great location just blocks from the ocean for a great ocean view evening or morning ocean view walk.

Overall, this was an amazing stay for my birthday. It was well worth the money and the scenery alone was immaculate. We were able to park in driveway and go directly into the guesthouse privately. It was like we were in our little serene world. Even the neighborhood Cats were friendly. We listed this as our favorite and will be returning soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay a couple nights if you want to go to the beach. This Spanish cottage is super cozy and comfortable but what really makes it stand out is the host leticia’s attitude and her willingness to help.

The location is convenient to good grocery stores, restaurants and freeways. There is a huge backyard that would be great for kids. The house was clean and complete with all the basic needs for anyone visiting. We highly recommend it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Definitely a place I would stay in again! She makes sure the house has everything you need from emergency supplies to just about anything you can think of! Only thing I would say is to be careful driving on the st where house is the potholes are bad!

The location itself is in a safe/clean neighborhood. You have great neighbors and everyone one was respectful through out my 3 month visit. The place was spotless, clean, and had every appliance / necessities that one could ask for. The internet was blazing fast and completing work was a hassle free. The beds were comfortable, spacious and relaxing. The house itself is newly remodeled and looks brand new. The backyard is beautiful and you can easily spend hours outside grilling or soaking up some sun. Amanda was a great host. Anything you need, she was always a message away and responded in amazing time. All in all I wish I could review this place a 6/5. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Staying with Julia was the right choice for my trip.

The location gave me a good opportunity to look around and see where I would like to call home and Julia was ready to connect me to a realtor when I arrived.
Thank you for the calm and relaxing evenings after my first days at a new job. She's responsive and will do what she can to make your stay enjoyable."

The dining table was a clever solution for a small space. Loved it! We’d definitely stay again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The studio is very clean and cutely furnished. Heads up for people under 5’2: be careful stepping out of the tub/shower. If you have shorter legs you might trip with the height of the tub so just be mindful when stepping out. 5 stars and would absolutely recommend to others. Julia was kind and a great host!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time staying at Ms. Julia’s Airbnb! Her instructions of the key location was on point! After walking inside to the studio, it was elegant. The bed was super cozy, I passed out for a couple of hours. My boyfriend had to wake me up a few times. I didn’t want to get out of the bed 🥹. The kitchen had a full size refrigerator and microwave. They do have an electric stovetop that you can use. There are utensils, i.e forks, spoons and cookware, also plates and mugs if you want some coffee. Ms. Julia also provided some snacks on the counters. The bathroom was pretty nice. The tub was deep and roomy for those who has long legs. My boyfriend did take a bath and enjoyed it for his back. There’s a stripe gas station about a mile out and there’s a bridge where you can see the sunrise and it is amazing.
Ms. Julia does provide an instruction and guidelines, not only to the studio, but where is the nearest restaurant, stores, etc . I do recommend this place! Mahalo"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is my second stay here and, to say the least, it’s what i was looking for. somewhere private, cozy, close to the water, clean and secure. i loved my stay here yet again and definitely plan on returning. the hostess was very helpful and promptly. i had a scheduling issue the first time which they worked through with me. on my second trip, i asked for some local recommendations in which i was given some awesome options. thanks again, julia! :)"

The view from the deck is great. I would definitely return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julia’s place was perfect for our week in Corpus! I was really grateful to find a place that allowed us to bring our dog. I appreciated the beach towels, coffee, and the toaster oven and hot plate since I make breakfast every day. I also liked having a mini vacuum so I could clean up any dirt or dog hair. Julia was helpful in so many ways throughout the week from a vet recommendation to places to eat and everything in between. If we ever make it back to Corpus Christi again I will be sure to look their place up!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great Cozy home, the host lives upstairs and this is kind of like a separated Studio on the bottom floor. ran into the host a few times while there, but she was pleasant to be around. for future fishermen the doc is private if you see it from the picture so that was a little bit of a downside but I fished the water to the left of it early in the morning and it was quite shallow and I didn't have any luck. my actual Airbnb itself had basically everything you could need for a short stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay has everything you need for a get-away. it was neat and clean, it was very comfortable, and not far from any place you need to get to. I would definitely book again for future trips."

Great place, ready on time, super clean. 5 stars"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely baby moon! I'm back in Houston now already missing our vacation. Fireworks on the USS Lexington, Escape Room, Hurricane Alley, Republic of Texas, Andy's Kitchen, Island Joe's, Hester's Cafe, Lively Beach, Whitecap Beach (both with chairs, umbrella and cooler provided by host), State Aquarium, feeding the fish and being able to come back to clean cozy Airbnb with our puppy Benji there was worth every penny.
Thank you, Julia and Teresa, for giving us an experience we will remember forever."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julia and her place was perfect. It was centrally located and in a quiet neighborhood away from the busy city.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Julia's ground floor studio. It was just right for our 3 night stay & a great deal. We were mostly interested in Padre beaches & it was easy to get over to the island. It's also close to an HEB Plus for all the daily essentials & forgotten items. The studio is charming, fresh & comfortable. Julia had thoughtful snacks, water and even a small vacuum to help deal with the inevitable sand. You park right in front of the door. A breezeway at the other end provides a place to lay out wet suits and towels. We would definitely stay there again for another beach holiday for the two of us."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, Clean & Beautiful. What more do you need? exactly as described/pictured. Fantastic experience!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"He was very friendly, the place is super impeccable and not to mention the bed was super comfortable and I like it.
Sleeping, quiet and very rich food in the restaurants. He was on the lookout so that my stay was very satisfying, that gives it extra points."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Julia's place 10 stars, I would! Exactly as the photos, immaculately clean, bed is like heaven. I didn't do any cooking, but there's adequate supplies if you want to. I had one small need which was addressed immediately and rectified before I was back for the day. The area is quiet, easy to find, and (for me) only about a mile from my daughter's house! It was a wonderful, peaceful place to come back to after a long day. Snacks were a very nice bonus as well! And the soaking tub...pure relaxation!
They have thoughtfully places a dehumidifier in the bathroom, since the location is right on the laguna. If you would like to have a less humid environment inside, it's a good idea to empty the water out daily. It shuts off when it's full. I didn't mind at all, as it was a nice feature.
Everything about this studio emanates thought and intention. I will definitely be back!"

On our final morning, we couldn’t enjoy our breakfast in the stay because we found 2 cockroaches crawling about in the place.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! We checked in and found cold sodas and water in the fridge and the biggest TV that we've ever had the pleasure to watch! The linens were wonderful and soft and the little extras were exceptional. I loved the makeup remover wipes and the spa supplies in the bath. My husband appreciated the coffee and small things like the spices and salt and pepper. Lots of things were there that we forgot to pack, so it made our stay so easy. Also, we enjoyed the snack basket that Julia left us!
The neighborhood is super quiet, on a dead end and very close to a launch if you have a boat.
We visited Mustang Island State Park (about 10 minutes or so) and it was perfect for us. There were very few people there and our dog was welcome too! Not many shells, but soft white sand and porta potties galore! They had covered picnic tables and trash cans all along the beach. The best part was, we could drive our car and park almost next to the waves!
We would recommend this sweet place to anyone who is looking for a wonderful vacay at the beach. ⛱️🐾🏖️"

The Dawg House is very cozy, and perfect for a weekend getaway. The building was so rustic that it almost makes you forget you are right next to the beach. From the decorations to how perfectly the doors open, it is obvious a lot of care was put into the Dawg House. We will absolutley make sure to come back when the weather is warmer and we would be able to use the pool and firepit. Unfortunately the werent able to use the firepit or pool due to the freezing winds of nature."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay on the bay!
,,,"They left the door unlocked for us, which made me feel very uncomfortable because someone could have been in there since we were planning to arrive very late. It was raining and there was nothing to pick up water with. The first night we all had to sleep uncomfortably on a small bed because I wasn't told until the next day where the air mattress was. Honestly the listing is more comfortable for 2 people but not more than that in my opinion, its very small. The host does not allow smoking, which is fine, we didnt smoke anywhere near the property.
Other than that the location is pretty good and the unit was clean."
