Outstanding!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Judy’s studio. It was quiet and comfortable. The shower was lovely and there were small details that made it feel homey and cozy- like the blankets on the comfy chairs and the fresh eggs. We enjoyed walking in town for food and drinks. The bed was comfy too!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the BEST stay at Judy's place as we were in between medical appointments and did not want to travel home and right back. The room is beautiful, comfortable, has everything we needed and more, and best of all - it was squeeky clean everywhere. If you need a place to stay in LaGrande for one night or more, THIS is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"So adorable! Very comfortable and homey. Absolutely LOVED the many little touches such as yummy coffee, hot cocoa, breakfast cookies, holiday decor, fresh cream and eggs in the fridge, water bottles, comfy linens, etc. It made the place feel comfortable and extra special! She even had a fresh pot of gorgeous orchids in the kitchen window (my favorite)! I come to the area once or twice a month for work, and love to try new places, but I will definitely be coming back to Judy’s place! Cute, quaint, comfortable, cozy, and perfect in town location!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband was recovering from a knee replacement and this was the perfect place! We chose it because there were no stairs like we have at home. Judy and Jack even provided a more comfortable lounger for my husband to enjoy. There were also thoughtful items in the fridge and the kitchen was just right for our needs.
All in all great space and great location.
Would stay again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time stay in this unit. It was just as wonderful as her other unit. Super clean and is located close to EOU and all the great restaurants we like to visit. The bed was super comfortable and the upgraded linens really make a difference. We will stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, super cute and comfortable. Well supplied with necessities.
I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a perfect place to stay if you have kids at EOU or traveling through! Far enough from the train tracks that we didn't hear a thing.
The layout doesn't feel like a studio - there are defined separate areas for the kitchen, living, and sleeping. For example, the king-size bed is partially walled off from the living/kitchen & there is plenty of room between the well-equipped kitchen and living room. The kitchen even has full-size appliances. The washing machine/dryer combo was very cool. I now want one at my house :-)
The place is adorable and the bedding is AMAZING!
One thing of note - if you have a longer vehicle, park on the street (there were plenty of spaces). If you have a smaller car you will do fine in the assigned parking spot."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent two night's at Heather's listing and it exceeded our expectations. The unit was very clean and we appreciated the modern amenities. The kitchen was fully stocked and allowed us to prepare meals. Even though we encountered noise from the unit above the comfortable bed provided a good night's rest. Overall, Heather's place represents an excellent value and we look forward to staying in it again when we revisit La Grande."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I usually take the photos with a grain of salt, but I was very pleased that the reality far exceeded the photos. Also, I arrived in town earlier than anticipated and was allowed in early. And, of course, I forgot something there and Heather is helping it get back to me. Great experience that I will do again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. I’m staying at another of Heathers places. 😁
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place exactly as pictured and described. I travel to La Grande often and would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a nice short stay here. There’s plenty of room and I liked being a short walk to the ‘city center’ of La Grande. My only complaint would be that the walls of the building are super thin and you’ll hear various things throughout the day, but it was never loud enough to bother me."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Have stayed in the observer apartments several times and always find it to be perfect for my needs.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Bed was comfy and surroundings were quiet. Super close to the university and easy access! I’ve stayed here the last two times I was in La Grande and will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay on my recent trip to La Grande. Recent construction and furnishings in a quiet neighborhood made for a comfortable place to relax at the end of the day. Will definitely look into staying in one of the Observer Apartments on my next trip to the Grande Ronde Valley.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this was a very good value. Rates in La Grande are very high this time of year (August), since the area around La Grande provides for summer recreation. Compared to other options, this one was the best value for the money, offering a very clean, fairly new studio unit with plenty of room for two. It's located in an older neighborhood on some low traffic streets. I would stay here again. Mark from Kent, WA"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather and place were awesome. 2nd time I have stayed and will stay any time there is vacancy and I am in the area. Place is clean, secure, and well priced. Giant pillows were super comfortable and may attempt to get them at my house.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, was very clean, no issues with check in, was in town for a visit to EOU, location was very convenient, great communication from host prior to check in. Only downside, we stayed a week, had a washer but no dryer. Definitely would recommend."

Brian Hanley"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this late in the day and Sarah was very responsive and provided clear instructions about the Airbnb. It is located in a neighborhood at the end of a road , providing privacy and lovely surroundings- pasture and mountains can be seen. It is cozy, comfortable for 2 people, and very nicely appointed as Sarah has thought of “extras” one might need when traveling. High quality bedding and towels a bonus. And clean! I wish more were as clean and tidy as this stay. We will definitely book again when we have the need to stop in the La Grande area. Thank you Sarah!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What I loved the most was that the host had thought of everything that usually isn’t included, for instance a Bluetooth speaker! I don’t know why, but that was so impressive to me! Love the room!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Surprisingly comfortable and cozy place to stay, with EXCELLENT wifi (which is always important to me). And this place had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. I also enjoyed that the place is all the way down at the end of a dead-end street, with just fields beyond. I found this a quiet, peaceful stay. Bonus - it rained just a little, and I could hear the rain hitting the roof. I always find that relaxing."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place was clean, well appointed, with soft towels, a comfortable bed, and all the amenities that make travelling easier (washer/dryer, a kitchen and full fridge, hair dryer, etc.).

2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The space is very clean and comfortable, we stayed one night. However, pictures do not show that it is on the upper level of an auto or engine repair shop. We found the location not great for walking and strange to have shop noises, trucks and garage work happening in the same building."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah was extremely accommodating of my requests. She's very kind and is a quick responder. The property was great and just as described. It had everything I expected and more. This was my first booking with air bnb and I can't imagine anything better than this. Highly recommend booking with Sarah, and we would absolutely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This airbnb is a lovely little slice of La Grande. I’ll definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd time we've stayed at Sarah's place. It's private and a very cozy place to settle in for the weekend. I love having a full kitchen and a great coffee maker to use. Thanks for having it available! We will sure to be staying again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute little Airbnb. Had so many amenities…coffee and spices and detergent and all the things other Airbnb expect you to buy! Very cozy. Also very quiet and very private.
We arrived in the dark, took us a minute to figure out to go to the back of the shop. She may have had instructions somewhere I missed, might be good to include that when you send the lockbox code.
We would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This studio apartment over the garage was very safe, comfortable and cheerfully decorated. The location was convenient to city center. The furnishings and appliances were new and everything was very clean. Sitting out on the deck was especially pleasant. Sarah answered my questions via email quickly. I will happily return when I visit La Grande next time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this cozy place on such a private street. We will definitely plan to stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying there and it was just as pleasant as the first. Everything you need in one well laid out space. Would recommend Long Branch bar for breakfast, excellent hash browns and they make their own gravy!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah has spent some time figuring out what guests need and want. The location was private and quiet. The amenities were were spot on. We only stayed one night but wished we were staying more days. We've used AirBnB at least a dozen plus times and Sarah's place rates very high on our list of some of the better places we've stayed at.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the stay! Wish we could've stayed longer. Everything was well designed and very nicely stocked and decorated. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the bikes were a nice way to stretch our legs after the drive, and the place was just great for the 2 of us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Sarah’s place. I stayed for a week to take classes at EOU. It was perfect to get all my work done and relax. Sarah responded to texts very quickly.
One tip: you may find your self stuck for AGES at the train crossing where H and Adams/30. If you see a train on the tracks turn around and take Island Ave to Albany St (by the Wendy’s). You can then take 21st street all the way to H and it’ll avoid the long waits on the train."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place. Nice to have a quiet area to sit outside.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed my stay here. Lots of privacy. Clean space.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s was a great host and her place provided everything that we needed for our road trip. Space and bed was comfortable and nicely decorated with a cheerful turquoise theme. We enjoyed drinking our morning coffee on the sunny, peaceful deck."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a lovely stay! Sarah’s place was cute, extremely clean and comfortable. She has thought of all the details…phone chargers, chap stick/makeup wipes, extra blankets and oh my…the bed was so comfortable! I would highly recommend staying here. We will definitely be back!! Thank you, Sarah!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I felt very comfortable for one night at Sarah’s place. The balcony was peaceful and private but I didn’t feel like I was so secluded that I felt nervous as a solo female guest. The walk to the grocery store was short and easy, the place looked exactly like the pictures and is cozy and comfortable. I would recommend others stay here too!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay there! Homey and inviting. This will be our go-to place from now on when we come visit family.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a pretty place to stay, from the welcoming deck surrounded by trees, to the cheerful interior. The kitchen decor is colorful, while the bed and bathroom decor is soothing. Mornings were special with a full assortment of coffee and creamers to choose from. The kitchen is really well stocked with everything you need to cook and serve. We especially appreciated the filtered water pitcher in the fridge and the good supply of ice and ice cube trays. What a treat to have access to two bicycles and a lock. We enjoyed our ride around town. Sarah has set the bar high for other hosts with her beautiful accommodations, great communications and thoughtful extras. So glad we discovered Sarah's Couples Getaway. It was far superior to the basic hotel stay we would have normally done and a much better value for the price."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful and cozy space. Sarah has thought of every little detail - and then some - to make guests feel comfortable and at home. We will absolutely stay again if we come through the area again. This was a bargain and significantly better than what we would have paid for a mediocre hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love staying here, it’s immaculately clean and so cute. Very quiet, extremely quiet neighborhood. Sarah is awesome, great communication, very nice person. I will stay again and highly recommend it. Hope to have time to enjoy the deck next time."

It was aesthetically simple, cozy and adorable!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, very quiet, the bed was incredibly comfortable, everything was spotless clean, loved the selection of coffees and teas and coffee creamers. Awesome soft towels, loved the option of a washer and dryer. Very well stocked kitchen, wished the weather had been nicer so I could have enjoyed the deck. Owner was responsive and super nice. Love it and definitely recommend for a small place to stay. ❤️"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed at Sarah’s place a couple of times and it’s always a great stay. For the same price as a hotel room, Sarah provides a lovely, hospitable suite with a full kitchen, laundry, and lots of lovely touches that make this place a great value. I would absolutely stay here again. Thank you, Sarah!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"In my opinion, a property like this is why Airbnb started in the first place. We were looking for respite on our cross country road trip to Seattle and this place was a wonderful oasis. The property is super comfortable and cozy and everything is practically brand new inside. It was wonderful having a washer and dryer available as well. We only stayed one night, but in our short time there we found two fantastic restaurants close to this property. Thanks!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time here and we absolutely love staying here. It’s so cute, quiet, and has everything you need for a relaxing and fun stay. Thank you Sarah and we appreciate all the detail and care you give for your guests."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet, beautiful spot to stay while in La Grande! The view is really peaceful, and the property even has a little ditch running through for a nice water feature. There were thoughtful touches all throughout the space: farm fresh eggs in the fridge, travel size toiletries in case you forgot any, a well-stocked pantry. The home feels cozy with nice finishes and good lighting. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway, very accommodating stay. Definitely would visit again"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful and relaxing little get away in La Grande this is it. We absolutely loved our stay and wished we had more time to stay longer. The bed is super comfy, the sitting area on the porch is prefect and you can watch a beautiful sun rise or sunset and see some deer if you are lucky. It's tucked away perfectly and very private. If we ever find ourselves in La Grande again, we would love to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a well thought out travel space, it basically had everything I could want or need, clear information on the fridge, actual cotton sheets that were comfy, a fully functional kitchen, and it was convenient and clean. I would definitely stay here again. Plus cute chickens and fresh eggs."

Next time we’re in La Grande we are staying here!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah's place was relaxing, welcoming, and we would definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect! The bed was very comfortable-soft on top but moderately firm so you don't sink into the bed. The homey feel was just what we were looking for and it made our quick stay (in and out in 10 hours) relaxing. This lovely space was clean and had everything we needed. Even though we didn't use the kitchen, I loved that there was a full stove and oven, great for a take and bake pizza (maybe next time). Homemade touches like place mats and curtains really brighten the place up and the flower accents made me smile. The air conditioner was quiet and did not wake me up when it came on like in some hotels I've stayed at. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you for hosting such an amazing stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Better than expected. Perfect place & very clean. We will be back!

The attention to detail was incredible - from the decor to the mini toiletries. The cleanliness was top notch and the bed was surprisingly comfortable. If we ever come through La Grande again, we will definitely be staying here!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable, and quiet unit suitable for one or two people, located just a few minutes from downtown La Grande, on a quiet cul de sac. There is a large off street parking spot and deck with comfortable chairs. There is a flight of stairs to the front of the unit if that's an issue. The host, Sarah, is very attentive and made sure the unit was well stocked with amenities."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cute practical place very conveniently located
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little studio apartment, perfect for a cozy couple's getaway! The AC worked beautifully, even with the loft area. Super comfortable mattress, nice pillows and blankets too. Probably the best-furnished kitchen of any bnb I've stayed at, just enough to make some good meals without too much hassle. Definitely feels smaller than the pictures, but still plenty of room for a couple to stay a handful of nights. Nice, quiet back corner of a no-horn neighborhood, which was perfect for sleeping peacefully."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just loved to stay here!
Everything in the right place! And very clean! We used the washer/dryer. That was very useful!
Very nice balcony to relax!
Good work Sarah!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I come to La Grande a few times a year for work. I'm surprised how many air bnbs there are in the area!
However, the stay at Sarah's guest house was one for the books.
The moment I pulled up to the drive way, it felt like home.
Once I got inside, I was so excited for my stay. Cute, cozy and absolutely perfect for one person or a couple.
The bed was AMAZING. The kitchen had everything I could possibly need (I was even gifted some organic fresh eggs that were absolutely delicious).
The only thing I would changed is how long I stay next time because I could have easily enjoyed another day or two!
Thank you so much Sarah for such a comfortable stay and your hospitality."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place is perfect for two people, with a bit of loft space for a third person (child) in a pinch. The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom and kitchen are spotless and modern.
The bathroom was stocked with any toiletry that you could need. The back deck is charming, with plenty of birds and other animals to watch, including a few chickens in back (who must have provided the fresh eggs in the fridge). The location is convenient and super quiet. Overall, this was a perfect base for exploring this part of northeastern Oregon, and we'd love to come back for another stay."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were SO lucky that we found Sarah’s place last minute! It is absolutely adorable and perfect in every way. Sarah has put so much thought and care into every detail! I would honestly pay more that I did to stay here, and I have paid a lot more money for air bnbs in the past that provide so much less.
The fresh chicken eggs Sarah provided (from the chickens roaming the backyard) were the icing on the cake for our lovely stay. Everything here was comfy and cozy as can be. We didn’t want to leave and would come back to LeGrande just to stay here again! Thank so much, Sarah!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great gem in La Grande this was! From the peaceful patio balcony to the adorable interior this Airbnb was so wonderful. We moved our daughter into her dorms at Eastern Oregon and the location was within minutes to her college and downtown. The bed was so comfy and the breeze at night through the windows made our sleep so restful. This Airbnb was so tastefully decorated. Hostess Sarah definitely puts thought and detail into her home for you, from the farm fresh eggs in the fridge to every toiletry you can think of. We will definitely make this our spot to stay when we come to visit and you should too, you will not be disappointed!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Excellent spot for a sleep-over. We were on our way to Minam River Lodge and found this a great place to get to the trail quickly. Sarah has everything you need too! The kitchenette is well-equipped and the eggs from her chickens were an added treat and surprise. There was a scent in the unit though (air freshener or dryer sheets?) so if you are sensitive you may want to check in with Sarah about that first. Also, the bed is a bit soft but otherwise a fantastic spot and I highly recommend it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is easily the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The space is so efficiently designed—so thoughtfully laid out, decorated, and stocked. You could walk right in with just some clothes and live comfortably for days! There was even flour, sugar, oil, spices and all sorts of necessities in the kitchen. Same story for the bath/laundry room—everything you need and then some! Check this place out if you’re going to or through La Grande."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! Sarah thought of every detail and added special touches that made our stay perfect. Close to Eastern Oregon State University yet in a quiet and private location. Very clean and the bed was really comfortable.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little getaway spot, was perfect size for two people came with everything we needed including a washer/dryer and a full kitchen with all utilities and to ourselves, everything was easy to find but we did have slight trouble finding the place but we just had to punch the right address into apple maps… other than that it was perfect!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This darling place was perfect. It had everything we needed and was the perfect size for two. The deck is so refreshing to sit out on in the morning with a hot drink. Farm-fresh eggs in the fridge, melaleuca products(!), and an abundance of spices for cooking were great bonuses! Sarah was so welcoming, helpful, and communicative. We loved our stay here and hope to stay again when passing through on another trip."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stop on our road trip. Appreciated all of the details and coziness. Super easy check in, light was on and AC when we arrived. The farm fresh eggs were delicious! Would highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed here for just one quick night while passing through Oregon on a road trip. Super comfortable and cute with lots of nice details/extras and a great kitchen! Fun to see chickens in the backyard and there were a few of their eggs in the fridge for us. We would stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely space with thoughtful touches including easy access bedside outlets. And…farm fresh eggs from the resident hens. We thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so charming and cozy, with really thoughtful amenities (even had fresh eggs in the fridge from the residential flock!). The space is spotless and crisp, has a great mattress, and is quiet and safe. There's also a porch with a beautiful view. I will definitely go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very esthetically pleasing space. It’s comfortable and exceedingly clean. Lots of special touches; make up remover wipes, coffee of many flavors and types, a water filter and the softest fluffiest towels. The deck is spacious and relaxing too. Check in is super simple."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This truly is what a super host looks like in our eyes. The attention to detail, the modern, warmth in decor and yet so clean and comfortable. This place can’t be beat for a relaxing, cozy night."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was super clean, cute, and affordable!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the room. It’s in a great location, it was very clean, check-in was super easy, and communication prompt. We cooked many of our meals and found the kitchen well appointed… they even had cupcake making supplies! We had some organic eggs from the hosts’ chickens waiting for us in the fridge. Over the top awesome!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sarah is such a gracious and generous host! My son and I stayed there and she and her family we're very welcoming and even took a little time to show us around her property. The fresh eggs from her hen house were a deliciously unexpected treat. The space is very clean and comfortable. We will certainly stay there again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is so sweet. It’s practical, organized ( I loved that) and I could tell the host really tried to present a warm welcome. We enjoyed our time."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is even better than advertised. The chickens are so fun to watch. Inside was spotless and had everything you need for a perfect get away. I would easily stay at Sarah's place again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This accommodation is a treasure! Welcomed by the beautiful views from the balcony and comforted by the many details including specially selected products in the bath and fresh eggs! This made us feel so welcomed. We will not forget such a lovely stay and hope to return again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place Sarah was very accommodating
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am PICKY and particular, and I honestly cannot say enough positive things about this place!!! It is SO CUTE, SO CLEAN, SO THOUGHTFUL!! It is inviting, smells wonderful, and honestly I would live here! My partner & I were supposed to stay in another Airbnb and it didn’t work out. I was able to book this last minute, and as someone that has spent a lot of nights away from home, this is SUPERIOR to other places. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought we were the first people to stay in this Airbnb (that’s how clean it was). It’s in a great location away from others, there’s a stream that goes on the side of the building, and chickens! So cute! Also close to places to get a late bite as well as gas stations for quick necessities, and close to the highway. The check in process was easy breezy and owner communication was quick and so nice! The washer and dryer is EXCELLENT! The AC is wonderful and kept the place super cool. There was sweet little touches all around. Do not hesitate to book this place! We will be back :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place very thoughtfully arranged and well-equipped. Highly recommend staying here.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for the wedding we were attending! Was clean, quiet, and a great experience"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really nice and comfortable. As clean as it gets, even the outdoor area was sparkling. Easy check-in instructions and communication. Thanks Sarah, you thought of everything with this place. Couldn’t be happier with our stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved everything! The unit was super clean, decorated really cute and the owners thought about everything that you would need for your stay. Thoughtful details throughout. Coffee, chocolates, fresh eggs, and small toiletries. We highly recommend if you are traveling through or stopping for a visit in La Grande."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful accommodations! Beautifully furnished and so comfortable!! Sarah is a great host.
Don't be discouraged by the fact that the studio apartment is above a working garage.. it is so very quiet and has everything you could possibly want. (Including a back yard full of chickens.. if you are a city person, like me, you will get a kick out of them)!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Designed like a tiny house, but more. Ample kitchen and bathroom, comfy bed (so important), . I loved the color in the dishware, the fat chickens in the yard below, cherries on the tree at the edge of the deck and the little creek running below, sitting in the sun on that deck, and later stretching out on the bed to watch a movie. I also appreciated how quickly Sarah responded to my messages, and how she stayed on the phone to get me there when I got turned around. It was a good rest on the last night of a long journey."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a lovely stay. I especially appreciated the deck and all of the thoughtful touches provided by the host. I would stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best places we have stayed! Everything from cleanliness to comfort! Small touches like extra toothbrush and fresh eggs. If I could give this ten stars I would. Perfect!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place is a such a cute relaxing place. It was perfect for a pit stop on our road trip! She is an amazing host. Her kindness, attention to detail and accommodations does not go unnoticed. Highly recommended"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I hate to write a raving review as I fear Sarah's place may not be available when we travel to La Grande next. This place checks all the boxes. Super clean. Super quiet. Amazing bed and quality sheets. Walkable to town (1.5 miles). A nearby Safeway for your shopping needs. Lovely safe location with parking in the shade. Tasteful accommodation and well appointed with all the extras one might find handy. What is not to like? Will definitely stay here again. Thanks Sarah. AAA+++
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah’s home was stunning. There were so many thoughtful touches from fresh eggs from her chickens in the fridge to all the toiletries and kitchen basics you could need. We had such a pleasant stay here and would certainly return!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great apartment with everything one needs. Total bonus having a wash/dryer. There is a great deck for relaxing. This is a great spot and so much nicer than a hotel stay near a highway if you are just passing through. Our stay was flawless. After a long day of driving it was nice to be able to walk a short distance to a large grocery store for food, return to a well equipped kitchen, and have a home cooked meal."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing and cozy space during our one-night stay in La Grande. My husband and I had everything we needed. I don’t think that there was one detail that Sarah didn’t think about. Incredibly clean and comfortable. So many thoughtful touches. Definitely recommend!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! Perfect cute little getaway. Super cozy and clean! Absolutely would book again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely place to stay. Everything was extremely clean and the suite had everything that I needed, plus more. Communication and check-in were so easy. I would absolutely stay in this place again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is beautiful! It’s hard not to be beautiful when it’s Oregon though. Situated like a cute little loft it’s cozy, comfortable, clean, and have everything you could need even if you didn’t think you were going to need it! So nice and peaceful too. Wonderful crossbreed everything with the windows open, AC in case it’s a hot day, excellent personal touches. Definitely stay here!! I don’t know when I’ll be back around La Grande but this is a definite favorite of all the Airbnb I had to stay at on my drive up from South Carolina! Thanks Sarah!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place was really great. Sarah obviously tries to make sure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay. TIt was exceptionally nice to have some condiments in the pantry and fresh eggs in the refrigerator!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable! It’s decorated so cute! We loved staying here. I really appreciated that there was shampoo and conditioner and other bathroom items. The owner has almost everything there you could possibly need...wine opener, lots of USB ports, fresh eggs in the fridge and chocolates too. It was comfortable temperature and quiet. We could not hear any train noise from inside. We really enjoyed sitting on the deck. I’ll be recommending this to friends and family."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Super clean and had everything we needed. Comfortable bed. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommend.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stop on a road trip of mostly camping. Very homey, well-stocked kitchen and fresh eggs from the chickens in the backyard made for an amazing dinner. The apartment was clean with lots of little amenities. Loved this place!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful place! There were a lot of little touches, like a few Lindt truffles and plenty of decorations. Plus, there was Hulu and Netflix! It's in a quiet location, only a couple minutes away by car from restaurants and stores. The price may be cheap, but it definitely didn't feel like it."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so adorable! It’s so quiet and private. The bed is so comfortable! We loved the ambiance of the fireplace as we watched TV at night. There was a nice variety of kurieg coffees and hot chocolate, microwave popcorn and even some organic eggs in the fridge from their own chickens! We scrambled those up for breakfast! The place was sparkling clean and decorated so neatly! There’s a cute loft with a twin size mattress and a tv, perfect for an older child. We highly recommend this place!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little tiny home style space is awesome! It’s so cute. Little things were provided that not many host leave! Any spices you need along with amazing coffee needs! All the things you’d need if your own kitchen! If your passing through La grande this place is perfect!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah’s is a wonderful host and was flexible to meet our needs. The loft is homey and the little touches made it that much better. The location is perfect for a stop a long the way. Would recommend to anyone!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place can't be beat. Perfect in every way. I don't know how they packed so much hospitality and comfort in such a small place and still make it seem so spacious and roomy. Very clean, well decorated, comfortable and great hospitality!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little ""tiny home"" style air bnb was all we could have hoped for! Very clean, private, and comfortable. We got amazing sleep, and the kitchen had everything we needed, minus a cheesegrater but other than that perfect. Plenty of coffee and creamer provided, seasonings, toiletries, Netflix, washer and dryer, and they even left us lindor truffles and fresh eggs from their chickens! We will be returning again on a future getaway! Loved it. 5 stars"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A quick stop over on a long road trip, Sarah's place was close to the grocery store and town. Both beds were super comfy. Very tide and well used space. Easy lock up. Lots of amenities like shampoo/condition, toothbrushes and toothpaste, dishes, tea and coffee made us feel at home. Sarah was great at communication throughout the booking process. Great shower. Definitely recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is incredible. “Thoughtful touches” is an understatement. Probably my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, quick, easy place to stay."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great place! Definitely would stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time relaxing would highly recommend making the trip
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were referred to this place by our daughters, with a recommendation to rent the yurt. We weren't disappointed! The lodging was cozy and the whole site was kept nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The hot soaks in both the public pools and private patio were wonderful. We will go back again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,so much fun! great little place to visit.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! One night was not enough!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous peaceful place! Bring a sound machine for trains (not a problem for us, we always travel with one). Back patio is private, fun for kids/families too! Water is adjustable temperature and the tub is clean and amazing. Best food in town: Side A brewing."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Yurt 2 was comfortable and exactly what we expected. The soaking tub was excellent. the owners were responsive and helpful.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, clean, and amazing deck with private tub was amazing! The only part that would make this any better was a closer bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and nice just a bit of a walk away."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great evening staying in the Yurt. The facility was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the outside patio and the privacy of the hot tub. The bathroom/shower facility was a short two minute walk but very clean and safe.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area and the hot tub was awesome. Excellent instructions. Would totally book again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great quiet little secluded place, ample scenery and services."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Sweet yurt! Great soaking tub!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful yurt in a clean and well maintained camp ground. The yurt was clean and well stocked with everything you need to enjoy yourself. The soaking tub is perfect for 2 people at least to enjoy. The restrooms are extremely clean and not too far of a walk
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Yurt and tub were great, but bring earplugs. The yurt was well-appointed and comfortable. Tub was wonderful, in a lovely patio setting. But, loud neighbor late into the night in the yurt next door marred an otherwise great experience. To make matters worse, the host was unable or unwilling to correct the issue after we complained. The yurt displays quiet hours, but these don't seem to be enforced. For the price that is being charged, I would expect an on-site host to be available and at least trying to enforce the quiet hours."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I came to celebrate our anniversary. We really enjoyed having our own private soaking tub. The only drawback for returning would be my husband is 6’3 and too long to fit in the bed. Otherwise an awesome place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s always a great pleasure staying here!! My only complaint is that I wish they had more yurts with private soaking tubs!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific, beautiful, relaxing and stunning views!! Terrific hosts!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great! Will recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My husband and I fell in love with this little yurt in the outskirts of La Grande. The private soaking pool is amazing. The property was every pretty and the owners are nice! We will definitely be back for more trips here for in the future for multiple days! It’s a must stay on your way through the area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love staying here and this was our first time in the yurt - we’ll definitely be back! A family of 4 fits snugly in the yurt and it has all the basic amenities we needed for one night to rest and relax in the hot springs! The beds and pillows were way more comfortable than we expected! The private tub was perfect to wake up and have coffee and a soak while the big pool was perfect for the kids to play and stretch and move their bodies on our ping road trip.
The resort is so well run! A 10/10 stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love staying in the yurts here, soaking in the private little geothermal tub, and now you can walk or quick drive over to the hotel and get food at the pub or see a movie at the theater. Bed was comfy and everything was clean, no complaints."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay. Private soak tub is the best!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Nice place. Just what we thought it would be.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love this place!! The tub was tons of fun. Water get nice and WARM!!! Will be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience. Very peaceful, natural surroundings."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great place to stay, the private hot spring was wonderful. Bathrooms are kept very clean. The provided propane grill with the yurt was fantastic."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed Yurk #2 very much. I was surprised that the top bunk was not made. It would be nice if there was a small microwave in it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really appreciated the clear instructions for everything from check in, during the stay, and check out. The heated floor was such a treat and we were thankful to have heat as the temp outside cooled off at night. Having private access to your own hot spring was amazing! Super cozy place! Already booked another stay 😊🎉"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the second time we've stayed. It's a wonderful little escape for our family of four. The tub is great and the yurt is very cozy. We hope to come again.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Apparently we missed the part that there was no restroom/shower attached to the yurt. To use a restroom, you had to walk about 75 yds to the facility, which was actually warm and spotless. But, in the middle of the night, wind blowing 30 mph, it was a miserable trip(s) Also, if you wanted to shower before/after the soaking tub, again, a walk of 75 yds. Maybe an additional garbage bag, with 4 people, we filled the small garbage can in one evening. Otherwise, this was an absolutely ideal accommodation, spotlessly clean, comfortable, private, heated thermal floors, fantastic! But, without the restroom/shower, definitely pricey..."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Best place ever
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect weekend getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place to stay overnight. Extremely romantic. To have a hot tub all to yourself with fresh Mineral Spring water pumped in from the source is outstanding. The yurt was incredibly clean and fresh and the bedding was absolutely spotless. They provided all the amenities necessary for an overnight stay. There was a storm that night while we were sleeping and it caused the pump to shut down. We called our house up and they had it repaired within an hour. We were still able to get in our morning soak without being inconvenienced in any way. We would definitely recommend anyone who's willing to go out of the way to come to this place and enjoy it as much as we have. We plan on coming back here as often as we possibly can.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The private hot spring was great! We will definitely go again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a great escape. Very clean. Very private. 100% would come again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love the personal hot tub, having a warm cozy place to sleep and the bathroom is always spotless! Also the lights along the path guide us perfectly to the facilities! The cats are a fun addition too"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great remote gateway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this is a very clean relaxing stay, beautiful scenery with an amazing Hot Springs♨️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location for a stop on a road trip or just a stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We really loved staying here. We will definitely be back again. The bathrooms were right next to the yurt and very warm. The tub was amazing and filled up quickly.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, pretty much as described. Was comfortable for small family weekend. I would note, there is nothing there to cook on the grill with or make coffee with, so be sure to bring all your own supplies to save a trip to town."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very relaxing.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We frequent the Hot Springs at the hotel. But we decided to rent the yard for a girls weekend getaway. It was very peaceful this time of year because there aren’t many campers. The bed was very comfortable. There is a walk to the bathroom, but it’s not very far. And the bathroom was very clean. We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful time to visit!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great relaxing stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The 5” round soaking hot tub was awesome, the propane fire feature was warm when standing next to it, we did not use the propane grill but we made sure it worked. The town had plenty of options to eat and dine, the views were stunning, it started snowing while soaking in the tub it was pretty epic. Can’t wait to return."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I will be returning often. So peaceful! The winter season has lots of availability; in my opinion that’s the best time to go to hot springs in general. There is so much fascinating history in this area. This location is really close the ominous Hot Lake Hotel. I love historical buildings; this one did not disappoint. The Yurt #2 that we stayed in has the perfect tub for 1 to 2 couples. I would not recommend more than 4 adults as the yurt is small and cozy. It was perfect for us! We went with one other couple and we had such a sweet time. Really clean and beautiful! I highly recommend the Yurts with private tubs! I really look forward to our next visit.
*no kitchen; we brought veggie platters, crackers and dips. There is a gas grill and we did bring beyond burgers. We forgot a cutting board, plates etc., so we skipped it. No biggie for us at all! I’m only mentioning it so if you do want to use the grill, make sure you bring plates etc.
5 STARS!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The yurt was a great retreat and was just as described. Very pleasant stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The yurt we stayed in was fantastic! It was super cozy and perfect for our girl party of four. The only downside was the fact that we couldn't check in until 4:00 pm and had to check out by 11:00 the next day. We didn't have enough time to enjoy the soaking tub as much as we would have liked to! It was a great spot; will definitely go back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Review
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cool setup and really enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed another amazing visit! Thanks for a relaxing and peaceful stay. I will be back AGAIN😉
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite places to stay. Peaceful and relaxing. Great way to recharge your soul.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We met at the yurt for a girls' weekend. It was perfect. They included a small fridge with 2 complimentary waters, and a coffee pot! There was room for all 4 of us to sleep. Soaking in the tub was great. The heated floor was wonderful. I was worried about staying warm enough. It was cozy. We had a question about the tub that the host texted back about right away. The bathroom and showers were just a short walk. It was a great weekend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful location and private patio area. Heated floors in yurt were wonderful. Only downside is lack of bathroom at the yurt spot. There is a communal rest area nearby, but a bit inconveniently to walk to on a dark chilly night."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay as always! This is a great place to go and unwind, checkin was smooth as always, inside of yurt and the bathrooms just down the way are always clean. Had a great soak all evening. Wish the weather had cooperated a bit more for an early morning soak but that has nothing to do with anything anyone could actually do lol! We will be back of course!!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Yurt#2 Very nice But the tub needs to be a little bit deeper. And a little bigger around. That's my take. Other than that, very enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute! Love the tub!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Yurt #2 was the perfect spot to spend a girls night before a photoshoot the next day. We felt pampered with the private tub and the space was cozy and welcoming. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s always a relaxing getaway . Highly recommend .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We will definitely return!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed in the yurt and it was a very unique experience. We enjoyed the privacy and the soaking tub with the mineral waters. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow from the time of booking until the end of the stay. I would highly recommend staying here.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,It was nice. Hard to sleep people next to us playing musics until 2 am. Bed was to hard for me! I’ve stayed in yurt 1 and 2 now I loves yurt 1 better it had a showers outside and two tubs.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing. The private tub is a must. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Next time I’ll stay more than one night! Love this place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun way to spend our 27th annual sisters' outing. Sitting around the firepit on the private deck was a perfect way to end a busy day. While we didn't use the private soaking tub, it was a short walk to the soaking pools, which were wonderful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful hope to stay again soon .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for a great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our second stay at the yurt!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay~ it was a peaceful location, private patio with soaking tub, fire table, picnic table, and bbq. The beds were very small and short~ certainly not made for tall people (I struggled to stretch out straight and I'm only 5'5"") and the soaking tub only fits 2 adults comfortably. There were only two of us, and the yurt would have been extremely cramped with more guests. The shared bathroom facilities were very nice and clean. Overall a great little pit stop along our travels."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I rented a yurt for my parents as a birthday gift for my parents and they just raved about how wonderful their stay was and having a private tub.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Appreciated the private patio and soaking tub, especially since the public pools were pretty small (we didn’t use them). There is a walking path by the creek behind the patio so we did have people looking into the backyard as they passed. Shared bathrooms were clean but a bit of an inconvenience to walk to, so this is like a more expensive version of camping. Something that would really enhance the space would be an outdoor shower (like yurt 1 has) or even a spigot so one can rinse off before or after soaking, or even wash hands. That would keep the tub cleaner too cus then people wouldn’t just get into the tub with their unshowered bodies. Noticed a lot of dead skin in the tub as i was filling it for the first time. There is a cold temp faucet just for the tub but it’s short and hard to use outside of the tub."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"I went for a relaxing birthday getaway with a few friends, and it was enjoyable. I thought everything was put together well and instructions for using the hot tub made sense. Overall a good experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was better, than, pictured. I will be making it a yearly stop on my list. The private hot spring tub sold me!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was spotlessly clean and was so relaxing and fun to stay in the yurt. We really enjoyed the hot tub and fireplace on the back patio
Only thing I wished was a bath/ shower house a bit closer but overall it was fabulous!! Thanks so much for a great stay!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about it!!! The space was enjoyable and relaxing. We will defiantly be back
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely experience and better than expected! I will definitely rebook.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peaceful and beautiful location. We loved the private patio and hot tub. It’s was a fun and unique place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was incredible! So quiet and private. I loved soaking in my private tub, looking at the stars, staying in the yurt, and going next door to the hotel for supper. 10/10 would absolutely come back!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The private soaking pool and patio are a plus! We BBQ breakfast and dinner in a private setting with a fire amd soaking pool going in the great outdoors. this is my kind of camping. It was a great relaxing overnight get away not far from home. I would definetly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,great place for relaxation!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Yurt was a excellent little get away! The soaking tub was relaxing! Overall great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW!! We must have mentioned a dozen times how relaxing our stay was! Spent some time the first day in the community pool area and it was wonderful, but the rest of our stay was in our yurt and our own little hot tub and that was amazing!! So quiet, private and peaceful, we wished we had booked our stay for much longer! Next time for sure."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a fun getaway! Loved the private patio and wood tub!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This yurt experience is one-of-a-kind. Where else can you have your own hot tub filled with natural spring water in the privacy of your own rather secluded back patio? All typical inconveniences— like having to go elsewhere for the bathroom, not having plate and utensils—melt away as you leisurely hop in and out of the tub filled with gorgeous spring water that restores and heals. The owners also did a great job with the aesthetics of the place too. Finally, the kids loved splashing around in the bigger pools. So there was something for everyone to enjoy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A favorite getaway, just minutes from La Grande. Clean, modern bathrooms/showers plus private patio & soaking tub. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique property with its yurt with a private deck and hot springs tub. It also drew my attention to a dynamic and unforgettable Oregon natural wonder. I’d definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This spot is a gem! I feel like I found a treasure and we can’t wait to come back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will definitely be back! Loved the yurt experience. Our kids loved the bunk beds. We were impressed by how nice the shared bathrooms were and they weren’t too far away. The private soaking tub was divine. We used it at night and in the morning. Very peaceful, quiet setting. The only downside was getting bit and stung by a wasp on the patio and having an allergic reaction! Thankfully it subsided quickly and all was well. The view of the stars was stunning. Loved the shared pool—the perfect depth for our 4 and 7 year olds. All-around great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We Will Be Back Again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was clean and we all enjoyed the stay, staff are nice and prompt.
We will definitley come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot! Well appointed and private. Will visit again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The mineral soak in the hot tub shouldn't be missed! The shared bathrooms were close and pristine. A really wonderful stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable beds. Loved the back deck area. Watched a deer eat breakfast just a few feet behind us. It was a super hot day (100+) but the Yurt was cool when we arrived and stayed that way the entire time we were there. Would definitely go back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was great and peaceful. I will say bring mosquito spray cause in the evening they will eat you alive. Also there is a train nearby that goes by, other than that super peaceful and great trip"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was amazing. Very clean and the back private patio with soaking tubs was amazing. I could have stayed in the yurt for the entire stay. And good thing too because every night around dusk and every morning at dawn there were thousands of mosquitos. My son has at least 40 bites all over him from one night at the big soaking tubs. I wish this would have been communicated more clearly so I could have had bug spray and candles as well as long sleeve shirts and pants for everyone at night.
It is a gorgeous place and I really enjoyed the yurt… maybe winter would be a better time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the yurt. The beds were clean and comfortable. There was plenty of bedding and towels. The hot tub was perfect. We truly enjoyed the private patio with hot tub, fire circle, bbq, and picnic table. At dusk, the mosquitoes were thick but that's to be expected near the hot springs.
The bathrooms were lovely if a bit of a walk...not too bad. Our only issue was water. We never did find a working spigot. However, we ran into town and easily picked up a couple gallons."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing! We’ll be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun little place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time in this lovely space!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was awesome loved it ..
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for three nights and left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. The grounds are peaceful and pristinely kept, the bathrooms are the cleanest I have ever seen in any place of this type, and the yurt was comfy and cozy! We used the private tub at least twice a day and especially enjoyed the tub at night - under the stars and watching the fire from the fire pit. Absolutely beautiful. The staff were also quite lovely and helpful. The nearby town of Cove has an awesome steakhouse (and a beautiful drive getting there!) and La Grande is super fun for exploring! Lots of fun antique / thrift stores, bookstores, cute places to get coffee. We went to The Smokehouse twice for some of the best breakfast we’ve ever had. Just a lovely stay all the way around. We look forward to returning! Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful place !
I would definitely come back again"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy process and very clean
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful ""glamping"" experience in our first ever yurt! I would definitely come back again. We really loved the privacy and beautiful surroundings. The bathrooms were nearby and were always in clean and orderly condition. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolute perfect location to spend time with family and friends. We will plan our next trip from SC around the amazing Grande Hot Springs! The only thing I’d change from our first visit…staying another night!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Yurt life is the good life! We loved our stay at Yurt 2 and would recommend the RV park and the Yurt to cozy friends or small families. It was comfortable for a couple nights but not a lot of room to spread out - definitely not a good place for working, but a GREAT place for relaxing!
The yurt has a bunk bed with full/queen bottom bunk and a twin top bunk; there's also a futon but if you were using that for sleeping there's no other indoor space, which might be necessary for rainy days. Inside there's a mini fridge, coffee maker and all the fixins for a great coffee or tea - in fact, the coffee provided by the Resort is INCREDIBLE.
The back terrace feels pretty private - but there is a nature trail that passes just beyond, which can get active. You are private if sitting in the hot tub but be aware when you stand up!
The hot tub was awesome. Fed by the hot spring, it was extremely hot. The toilets and showers are a short walk away, sparkling clean. Excellent stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cool to have the private soaking tub in the back yard, and the view from the back is beautiful and tranquil. We did a short stop off on the communal pool area and it definitely felt more like a typical pool and hot tub than a hotspring but that is pretty clear from the pictures. Mostly kept to the private soaking tub and that part is well worth the stay!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great visit to a great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very happy, we are definitely coming back"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect spot to meet up with our family before heading to Joseph, OR. This was the first time we stayed in a yurt. The beds were comfortable, and the private outdoor sitting/dining/grill/hot tub (which guests fill with water from the hot spring) was fantastic. We enjoyed a nice soak under the stars and again in the morning before departing.
All the facilities were clean, and the people were friendly. Union (a quaint town) and LaGrande are nearby. Bonus, there was a Tesla charger onsite allowing us to top off at no additional charge before heading to Joseph, OR.
Many thanks for a great stay. We will be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Glamping in style. Felt very homey even though we were staying in a yurt. They really thought of everything. Comfortable beds.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The yurt and private patio and tub was the perfect way to spend the weekend. Loved it and will definitely be back. A new fav.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing place with the sounds of nature!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place to relax . Hot springs are very nice and this yurt provides great opportunities for families with kids as they can swim in the pool. Very well maintained areas around camp.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay! Very quiet & nice.
Celebrated an early Mother’s Day & had a blast with my mom & grandma.
Soaked in the pools after check out.
Wasn’t able to get into the twilight swim like advertised but it was still a fun experience.
Staff was not super friendly but that’s okay. The yurt was fun!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fijfjrnrkd
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay with hot springs soakingwe had so much fun😁
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, serene, and relaxing. The yurt was so cozy, comfortable, and clean. The private soaking tub with patio was absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The private yurt was so lovely and cozy! We fit 4 folks and were comfortable. The soaking tub in the back is fed with geothermal water, fills up in maybe 15-20minutes. Make sure to read instructions as the hot water is very hot!
The area is beautiful. Easy to add on a trip to Joseph / Wallowa mountains for the day. It can get windy though, cold in winter, and I'm sure in the summer hot. The yurt stayed warm, and there was an air conditioner.
The beds were comfortable. Bedding and towels provided. Mini fridge and coffee maker provided. The back area had some high fencing to protect from wind and provided privacy. The grill was great to cook with and a burner on the side.
There is a view of the hill behind and sometimes hikers walked by, but that was ok. You do have to walk a little bit to bathrooms but they were squeaky clean. Staff was friendly, helpful. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quite quick getaway! Will recommend to others from out side the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I love this place! Thank you for another amazing stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. We had a great time. Perfect late winter/early spring getaway. Can’t wait to come back
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, private, relaxing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little yurt to stay on a long road trip. I loved the design of the private patio to allow for both privacy and to enjoy the beautiful ridgeline, reeds, and trees behind the yurt. The heated floors of the yurt were a great touch, especially coming in from the chilly deck in late winter, and the heating system inside was easy to use. Bathrooms are a short distance away, and seemed very clean. Very glad I chose to stay there!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It seemed odd that the hot springs pool was down because it was cold. Winter is my favorite time to go to hot springs.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for our one night stop after snow skiing all day!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booked this yurt for my birthday weekend. It was absolutely lovely and a restful experience. The private patio and hot spring fed tub was wonderful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot! Super clean, quiet, and peaceful. Exactly what I needed for a few days of r and r. Soaking tub is huge! It takes a while to fill so I recommend starting it when you get there. Truly amazing place! Spotless bathrooms! The only negative I can think of is that trek to the bathroom in the freezing cold wind is not fun."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect setting for a girls weekend!! We really enjoyed the prviate soaking tub :) we will be back for sure!! Maybe next time my husband & I will come. Well worth the wait & the price was Wonderful for what you receive :)
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time. It was nice soaking after a long day of skiing at Anthony Lakes. Yurt was clean and very adequate.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We always love staying here. Will return!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great, relaxing getaway. We very much enjoyed our visit."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"As always, one of our favorite destinations. Thank you."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean, private yurt. Loved the private soaking tub!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful for that weekend getaway together...or alone! Amazing place and we can't wait to come back
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice peaceful place, especially during this time when there was only 1 RV there. The hotspring tub was the best. Only thing it needs is a microwave. It's a bit of a drive to town/restaurants, so would be nice to have something to heat up left overs. We used the BBQ, but whe its super windy and cold, it would be a nice additionto the space. But totally worth the stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable atmosphere. The privacy fence allows for a secluded place to soak. The beds are not not ideal for people over 6 feet tall. We will definitely come back and have recommended to friends."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I lost the code to the lock box sent an email and they got right back to me. The place is very clean. Can’t wait for a walking path to the lodge for food and drink
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, beautiful and relaxing! Nice place!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing😎 cant wait to stay again
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a place. Highly recommended if you like a hot tub after skiing, we sure did and it was quite a unique experience. There is a hotel down the road at Hot Lake that this is connected to and its a great old place that they are fixing up really nicely. I particularly liked that they had so much history there and a movie theater - with BirdMan playing! The yurt is crazy clean and comfortable with coffee in the morning to get you going and a fridge. Its a little pricey but go ahead and do it."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"First time for us to stay in a Yurt. The floors are heated just enough to make it very nice and cozy. The water is lovely to soak in and enjoy each other's company. We will definitely come back and stay again.
Things we thought were the cons...we thought if they had a small table or counter at the head of the bed it would have been nice to have some space to put your items.
Overall was a neat adventure and we enjoyed our time."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The bed is comfortable and the yurt is very warm! The hot tub is amazing, especially being under the stars!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place in a great location! Every thing was great! We will be back.
2023-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,Beautiful with good amenities. Great photos. Heated floors and very cozy. Tub was wonderful. Inside the yurt it was extremely noisy at night with moderate winds. Probably won’t do this one again for the cost in winter.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, and enjoy your weekend with no interpretation. Very private and quiet was a much needed vacation. the host was also very flexible and easy to communicate with."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredibly relaxing get away. Can’t wait to come back and stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay was so beautiful and serene! The back patio was magical and had the perfect ambiance. Inside was super cozy and the sound of the wind made us sleep like a baby. I was so upset we only booked one night! Definitely coming back in the future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time staying here! The yurt was clean and spacious and the private cedar tub was such a treat. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to others.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grande Hot Spring is so grateful yurt and soaking! I visited in December, inside of the yurt was warm."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed in this yurt in particular, and it is always a lovely time.
It has its own private deck and soaking tub which we love.
We will most definitely be booking again in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A relaxing and fun getaway! The private soak tub was worth the whole trip! the yurt was a fun and unique experience. Take the time to explore the hotel.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved the stay. The private tub for soaking was amazing even in 10 degree weather! The BBQ on the patio and the fridge made it so we didnt need to go anywhere. Definitely will be coming back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,First time we have stayed at one of the yurts and we absolutely loved it.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second stay here and it was just as good as the first time. The yurt is cute and cozy. Everything was really clean and comfortable. I will definitely be back for another stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The yurt was so cozy. It was very well thought out and had everything we needed. We absolutely loved the soaking tub!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Lovely space! Will make this a tradition!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The private patio with hot tub is peaceful and has a beautiful view of the hillside. The heated floors make the yurt extra cozy on blustery nights. We really enjoyed our stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place to stay. Everything including bathrooms super clean . Stayed very nice and warm in the freezing temps.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,The private soaking tub was so lovely! Would definitely want to go back in September or October with a small group. The space was even bigger than expected and the patio was super cute.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit here this year and absolutely love it! Very peaceful surroundings, and the RV park is home to a few adorable cats"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Heated floors and private soaking tub were awesome.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Hosts were super helpful and responsive when we got confused. Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was our second stay and we loved it as much as the first. Will definitely be back and next time will stay longer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, beautiful simple yurt with an amazing patio!
The trains are loud!! So bring headphones"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay clean, comfy bed, amazing out door area with tub. They even furnish towels. I was impressed I booked last minute and they even had the lights on for us when we got there!!! Excellent place to stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great. Very clean. People were amazing. Pools were amazing to soak in. Highly recommend staying in their yurts. Very fun experience.
2022-10-01,2,Stayed one night,"This place is nice, easy check in, beautiful yurt. Private Hot tub needs improvement had mold and smelled really horrible. It was unusable. Public hot tub was amazing and clean. Very warm."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great 1 night stay on a road trip with 2 old friends. We loved the place. The Hot Springs tub and the sleeping accommodations and the whole RV Park were awesome. Even did some Laundry and bought a Hot Springs book in the gift shop. Loved the late night soaking hours as well. Be sure to check out the Main Hot Lake Lodge up the road which has great soaking tubs by reservation overlooking the lake and a bar as well.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great yurt, fabulous patio. One of the hoses in the firepit caught fire and it was fixed the next day. Tub takes a long time to fill but very nice once it's full and you're sitting under the patio lights in the dark. Very nice bath with shower near the office. Great soaking pools at the office. Only thing missing is more hooks to hang stuff from. Excellent hosts."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time. The place is incredibly clean including the shared bathrooms. Will stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The private hot springs under the stars was exactly what we needed! It was such a relaxing time. I highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,One of the nicest places to relax in eastern oregon
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little getaway. Only cons were The mattress was very hard and light on the heater was very very bright with lights off and made sleeping on that side very difficult.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The fire pit was not working during our stay just fyi. Also, I don’t think it mentioned in the description that there was a mini fridge."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cool yurt stay - the hot spring tub is awesome! Clean and comfortable and very cozy.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The yurt is amazing! So beautiful and clean. The private tub and patio is perfect. Great experience.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend! The yurt is cozy and the private soaking tub was wonderful. We’d love to visit again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot with great amenities. The restrooms are pretty close by so it’s not really a problem that the yurt doesn’t have its own bathroom.
The hot tub is amazing! The natural hot spring water is super hot but it’s easy to temper it with cold water. It was the perfect way to recover from backpacking in the Wallowas."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great time and wonderful place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! We stopped here on a road trip with our two small kids. The yurt was really comfortable and had some very fun amenities, with a little private area in the back with a small fire pit, picnic table, and soaking tub. Check in was really easy. We didn't get time to visit the hot springs, but hope to return to check them out in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My kids and I had an awesome time here! Usually I pack our trips full of activities, but this time around, everyone was perfectly content hanging out in the pools and the private tub on the back patio, and relaxing around the yurt and property. I have three children, a 16-year-old, an 8-year-old, and a 7-month-old, and it’s sometimes tough to find activities that everyone enjoys. However, all three of them had a blast!
It was great that we didn’t need to bring any linens or towels. And I brought my propane camping stove, but didn’t need it because there was a burner on the propane barbecue provided on the back patio. That was super convenient.
Another feature we really liked was that the private tub had a cold spigot and a hot spigot. That way we could adjust the temperature as needed. We visited in the summer, when it was very hot. But we were able to adjust the temperature in the tub so that it was just right for the temperature outside. Then, in the evening, we could heat it up and relax in the cooler air.
We had complete privacy on the back patio, and a nice view of the hillside behind us. We were also very thankful for the air conditioning. It was in the high 90s when we were there, but as soon as we entered the yurt, it was a cool 72°.
The staff was super nice, and responded to my questions promptly. Overall, this was a great experience, and I recommend it for anyone!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice stopover between Seattle and Grand Teton National Park.
Comfortable yurt, well equipped (fridge, air conditioning, barbecue...).
2 communal hot pools and a private hot spring water bath on the terrace.
Recommended!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and two boys stayed here, and we absolutely loved it! Very clean, comfortable beds, the back patio is just adorable. We very much enjoyed our private little hot spring tub on the back patio, we’d sit out in it at night and look at the stars, just beautiful. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. I can’t wait to go back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This js a fun, unique, picturesque gem- we had another wonderful weekend here with the kids!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily’s place was perfect. It was clean and welcoming, the location was fabulous and the bed was super comfortable. The cost was really reasonable and I’d definitely stay there again if the need arises."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was an amazing place to stay. Lots of nearby places to eat and shop. Emily was a wonderful hostess and so willing to help in any way. I would definitely stay here again when I’m visiting my daughter and her family.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emily was an awesome host! Very responsive from inquiry to check out! Her home is very cozy, comfortable and clean!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about my stay at Emily’s place! Check in was a breeze. I arrived to a perfectly clean apartment that was exactly as described.

The walls are thin upstairs but the business downstairs did not disturb me at all."

plenty of options within walking distance to restaurants/ bars and old town la grange"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily’s air bnb is perfect is you just want to get away, it is in the middle of the historic downtown and close to a ton of restaurants. She provided a basket with “in case you forgot items” which was toiletries that are often forgotten, I have never seen a host do this and it was amazingly appreciated.
The coffee provided was excellent, I have never had coffee of that quality outside of a specialty coffee shop.
Lastly, the bed was so comfortable and cozy! We fell asleep right away and woke up fully refreshed from our travels."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay in Yurt #1. Loved the deep claw foot soaking tubs and fire feature on our private patio.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a great nights get away! Hot bath tubs , deck and fire pit were a great addition along with the fenced private back patio!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Yurt was very relaxing w/ the two clawfoot tubs. We have had a hard spring with a death in the family, this setting and water help with the rejuvenation of our spirit. Thank you; a much-needed rest."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you want your Owen private patio and soaking tubs. Very clean and enjoyable experience.
2024-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Wasn't what i was expecting. The bathrooms were shared. They were stocked but not cleaned (i stared at the same rock and piece of paper, in the floor,everytime i went to the restroom...all 3 days)
The fourth wall of your outside area is short and faces a walking path that was constantly used (even had a golf cart race down it). So its not private at all. It was fine but not what we were expecting."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend getaway for a couple.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and peaceful. It's a fantastic place to unwind. The surrounding area is so pretty, with many opportunities to see wildlife at Ladd Marsh. The yurt provides a private, tranquil space for soaking and relaxing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My first experience in a yurt and it was terrific. Comfy bed and couch, scrumptious towels (bath only; bring your own wash cloth, hand towels.) Easily warmed with mini-split. Soaking in the hot tubs on the private patio in the rain was sweet. The only downside is the walk over to the bathrooms. Probably the cleanest, most designer bathroom I've experienced at a campground. (Don't forget your own soap/shampoo.) We walked over to check out the guest pool/tubs situation and really appreciated the view of the hillside from the deck chairs. I expected the trains to be a problem and took ear plugs, but didn't need them."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the individual tubs at the yurt!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have been wanting to stay here for quite some time, and it just so happened to be available for our anniversary weekend!
The yurt is clean, comfortable and looks exactly like the photos. The tub area is more magical and serene than the photos show. We had the most relaxing weekend soaking, walking around the park, playing horse shoe, and checking out the lodge next door. I cannot say enough about how perfectly relaxing Yurt #1 is. All the good stuff you read from other reviews are 100% true. We will be back !!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t wait to go back again, it was so relaxing and peaceful"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"My friend & I was visiting with a lady traveling to the poker tournament in Pendleton, who was soaking & not staying overnight. There was a couple in the hot springs, my friend & I sat in the lounge chairs while the traveler hung out in the pool by herself. The lady had asked if we knew what time it was. Just then, an employee came out dipped a container into the water and said ""It's 5 o'clock & time to get out,"" which she did. My friend & I thought it was very impolite how the employee handled the soaking guest, being the only person in the pool & announcing it for everyone there to hear. She should have leaned in quietly & said something. I actually felt embarrassment for her, and the employee who lacked the manners to deal with the situation tactfully. At 10pm that same night we walked to the bathhouse & there were 3 people still in the hot water pools while several others stood outside the pool. You should enforce rules to Everyone."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I went here to rejuvenate and ignite my soul. It was that and so much more! I loved the whole entire experience
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely soak!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a blast and will definitely be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Looking forward to our next stay!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The place was cute but host unresponsive with my request about WiFi not working. When I checked out I found out it didn’t work . It would have been respectful to know this up front when booking .
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This yurt was amazing! The private soaking tubs were well worth the price. Being able to soak in hot spring water under the stars was what our visit was all about. The outdoor space was so magical with the fire pit and string lights. Clean and very well maintained. The yurt itself was clean, cozy, and warm. The fridge and coffee maker was nice to have. The bathrooms were in a different building, but we knew that because the description was spot on. What we didn't know was that the bathrooms/showers would be so nice! Clean, warm, and well laid out. The only downside was that the train seemed pretty close to the property, which was loud, but not too disruptive. We visited for only one night in March, and the RV park was pretty empty, but I'm sure it would be full during the summer months."

Other than that, our stay was wonderful, and I highly recommend it!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grande Hot Springs yurt with private soaking tubs is my new favorite getaway! The yurt was very clean and amenities nicely thought out, we'll definitely be back!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our quick stay was amazing! We live only 40 mins away but had never stayed at the hot springs before...the private patio and soaker tubs were unreal and the yurt was so cozy, clean and warm. Will absolutely be back!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem in Northeast Oregon. I Highly recommend staying in the yurts!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall good experience, don’t recommend going while it’s windy, it’s very noisy! Would be amazing in better weather! Also don’t be early I think the lady was upset that I was early. Super cool that it’s close to the lodge we ate and watched a movie there was super fun!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is an Excellent choice for relaxing in the private tubs.
Everyone is wonderful here!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Been coming here with my friend for about 4 years. Other than hot springs in the forests, this the is the only way I enjoy a good soak! Private, beautiful, and spacious yurt/patio. Clean bathrooms. We really love petting the cats that hang out by the laundry rooms. Quick walk to the hot lake resort for a movie and a beer. 10/10, as always."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to relax and unwind. The private soaking tubs make this place a total gem!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our 3rd stay! It’s been wonderful
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our overnight stay very much. We came in the wintertime so all the warned about mosquitoes were a non-issue. The soaking tubs were wonderful and the yurt was decorated so cute and clean. This was our first glamping experience and we were super pleased with our experience here.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place!
Great Place to stay, wonderful hosts! Peaceful and relaxing! Especially Clean and cozy!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 3rd yurt stay, and we'll be back! It's especially peaceful when the wind isn't blowing, which is rare, in this location. Coffee was not provided. Good thing we brought our own. Wish the yurts had their own bathrooms. It's a bit far to get to the restroom, especially in the middle of the night."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent time— beautiful surroundings and the tubs were amazing on a very peaceful deck. The only downside was how windy it was even white noise of the fan and earplugs couldn’t drown out the wind noise in the yurt at night. Other than that it was an amazing stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely would stay here again. Private and relaxing!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay in the yurts! We loved the private soaking tubs
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just there for the night, but everything was great! We love the area, a little bit of confusion that you can’t use the hot springs at the lodge without paying extra and the communal hot springs at the RV park are closed for the season. But the private tubs at the yurt were really nice!
Definitely recommend, the yurt cozy and warm in the winter."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The only negative thing - and not in relation to the air bnb at all was we were visited by a frog all night lol at one point I woke up to him croaking, found him with my flashlight and took him outside. Couple hours later he had found his way back in and was croaking away lol"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing little gem this lovely yurt is with its private and perfectly appointed back patio. The yurt itself was a perfect 74 degrees inside (geothermally heated—including the floor!) even though our stay was in early December with morning temps outside in the teens. The only amenity I wished was included was a microwave, but seriously, everything else that WAS there made this glamping experience the best ever. The restroom is a super short walk away, and it, too, was warm, clean, and welcoming. That all said… we enjoyed the hot-spring tubs on the back patio multiple times, including the morning before we left. The stars above showed bright, and a hoot owl serenaded us from a nearby tree. We did experience an extra roommate (a frog!) for a while, but we only heard him and never did see him. Not certain if he was inside or out, but he quieted down when we banged on the wall. Bottom line, we’ll definitely stay in Yurt #1 again when we’re traveling through La Grande. Two thumbs up!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"we had a very nice stay there. Tubbed in the evening and also morning. we did have issues with neighbors in the yurt next to us. Came in a bit later but not too late and had a VERY loud child they allowed to scream and yell till very late. They were all very loud, but thankfully, I had ear plugs. A bit frustrating to us as WAY past the quiet hours posted."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My s/o and I LOVED celebrating our anniversary here! It was private, serene and beautiful. Soaking in the private tubs while it was raining felt surreal — such a warm, cozy and fun experience! We will most definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a real treat staying. Soaking was amazing during the snowstorm! Thank you 😊
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space. Very comfortable. Private. Could have used more hanging space closer to the back door
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family absolutely loves this little getaway. It’s private but only a 12 minute drive to la grande city. I have sent many many folks this way because it’s a fantastic & relaxing spot for couples or with the kids. I brought my daughter for a girls trip and it did not disappoint! We even locked ourselves out and the host was there to help us 🖤
The heated floor and personal heat with a huge plus for me, soft towels, beautiful fireplace that’s really easy to use.
Do watch for ants, so if you clean up after yourself you won’t even know they are there.
Only suggestion I would make is to offer bigger, thicker, softer blankets for sleeping.
Thank you so much!! Look forward to many more visits"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Relaxing and lovely.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed a relaxing weekend soaking and enjoying the privacy. Checked out the lodge next door and the town. Had a great time.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt is cozy and the whole place is run exceptionally well. Pack ear plugs if you're a light sleeper due to a nearby railway, but the experience is well worth it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was pure Heaven! The bed is so comfortable. It was so calming to her the rain on the yurt roof at night. Very clean place. The heat works great and we stayed toasty warm. Those clawfoot bathtubs and the hot spring water made me feel so spoiled. Such an amazing experience.
We also tried out the pools at the Hot Lake Lodge next door. Very friendly people, very clean, and beautiful view of the lake and sky. We are totally relaxed from our trip. I highly recommend this place."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"Beautiful surroundings. Enjoyed the mineral baths. Clean accommodations.
Close to active railroad tracks. Waterfowl hunters in the area during our stay. Woke to the sound of shotguns."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ve been here many times. Wonderful location and soaking tubs in privacy
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"We loved the private Hot Spring tubs connected to the Yurt! We soaked for hours!! It was warm inside and had a comfortable bed. However, the yurt was too close to the other yurt who did not follow the respectful quiet hours!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Grande Hot Springs was great! The yurt was perfectly furnished, it was nice to have a fridge, and the shared restrooms were very nice and clean and very close to the yurt. The clawfoot tub private hot pools were so fun and the wood surround with the patio lights tucked up against the hills was beautiful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed as a late anniversary trip. All we wanted was somewhere relaxing and peaceful and that is what we got with the yurt that we stayed in. So beautiful and peaceful! Loved it! Plan to stay again in the near future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great getaway here from Idaho! Had rainy, chilly weather and got to hangout in the hottubs quite often, it was amazing! Hot water straight from the springs and the lights add a great ambience. The yurt was clean and matched the description, it is a little loud with the campers and such around but they do a quick drive pass on their way out and are gone within minutes. The bathrooms were very clean and well maintained, 10/10. Would recommend and would go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool
place to stay! We loved the yurt and would highly recommend .
The private soaking tubs and enclosed courtyard were wonderful and the bed was so comfortable !"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed in Yurt #1 for our anniversary. It was better than expected. Despite the wind gusts, we relaxed in the private tubs for quite a while; we barely felt any wind at all. Instructions are clear and precise for everything. The yurt and outdoor area were spotless on arrival. We will problably do this again in the near future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was very nice, I loved the private soaking tubs at the yurt! Being able to go to the resort next door was great! everyone who talked to us was kind, and I'd stay again! (I'd just bring towels next time!)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to soak in this area!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay. Very quiet and lots of privacy. Great retreat close to home yet felt miles away. If you close your eyes while soaking in the tub the leaves of the cottonwoods sounds just like you are at the ocean. Very relaxing and will stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,loved the location and privacy. there was also a fireplace and picnic table that completed the private tubs and shower. Can't wait to go back again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had very relaxing get away for the night. The private soaking tubs and outdoor patio were perfect. Comfortable bed and very clean. We will come back again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is magic the landscapes are breathtaking the year was amazing and the back area soaking and gas fire pit picnic table and little shower and drinkable water just made it a wonderful time . The waters are extremely healing but smelly but totally worth it this is a great place for healing relaxation there is no TV and I love that I loved walking the beautiful ground I even saw a toad thank you for having such a great place to go and experience and be healed
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect spot to recharge and take a romantic getaway.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun stay if you want to experience the Hot Springs in LaGrande up close and personal. The yurt bathtubs were what made the trip for us.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time my wife and I stayed in Yurt 1, the first time was when we got engaged. I have to say the second trip really solidified for us how much we thoroughly enjoy the experience here. It’s very private, scenic and the amenities are exactly what you need for a weekend away. The host was very communicative when there was an issue with the hot water and took care of it very quickly. I know my wife and I both very much look forward to our next stay here. The bathrooms are communal and there was a lot of RV traffic during the time we stayed, but we both couldn’t help but remark how these are the cleanest communal bathrooms we have ever used."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved everything about this stay, especially soaking in the private tubs. Highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here. I love this yurt! The outside private tubs make it so relaxing. It was clean and had all the things we needed for a quick get away. I totally recommend this for a semi rustic adventure!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Absolutely beautiful
Hidden gem , it is very quiet.
Yurt 1 has its own outdoor set of hot mineral spring tubs.. privately fenced in
Our own privet oasis."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was amazing! The yurt was super clean and very well maintained. Just a word of caution, the mosquitoes at dusk were insane! So I’d stay inside at dusk if you can, which isn’t hard to do with such a wonderful yurt to be in. Also, the soaking pools were very clean and felt fantastic. I look forward to visiting again, definitely 5/5 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time! The Yurt was amazing! Will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The yurt is clean and well furnished. It was also air conditioned which was a necessity as it was a hot summer day. The star of the show was the private patio with the 2 soaking tubs. This was really well furnished with a table, couch, gas fireplace, sun umbrella, string lights and of course the 2 beautiful bathtubs. We really enjoyed our time soaking in the springwater under the big eastern oregon sky"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"drove, from tacoma, wa... was everything i loved. will, be makibg this a new run away location"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip to the hot springs, and we are so glad we found this site! We choose to not pull our trailer and reserved Yurt #1. We soaked in our tubs while enjoying the beautiful night sky which was brilliant star gazing."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay so much! Will definitely visit again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I celebrated our 10th anniversary at Grande Hot Springs in Yurt #1, and it was amazing! It was so relaxing with beautiful scenery, and we loved soaking in the private tubs. Definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for a night while in La Grande for a wedding. The private soaking tubs were the absolutely perfect way to end the night. We aren’t typically “camping people” but were pleasantly surprised how much we enjoyed yurt #1. If you don’t mind sharing a (nice/clean) public restroom, I would definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and peaceful staycation. Highly recommend
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We wish that we had known about it years ago when we started going there to visit our college student. Will always recommend
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I really loved the yurt with private soaking tubs. It was very relaxing!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The yurt was wonderful! I highly recommend! I wish we could have stayed another night! The hot springs were clean and peaceful. The sky light was great and we could see the stars while laying in bed. My only recommendation is a bigger mirror in the room but besides that it was wonderful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredible experience, the Yurt’s with private hot tubs are the way to go!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed at the property in a yurt on a cross country drive. The private hot spring tubs were amazing. A thunderstorm rolled in, in the evening and made for a great cozy sleep. I recommend staying here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was one of a kind. So private and peaceful. Private soaking tubs but you also have access to the public pools which were sparkling clean. No private restroom but the shared ones were very clean and free showers. I will stay here again. Do bring your bug spray! We saw snakes and a neighbor even said they saw a turtle! Make sure to check out the hotel as well. What a great find. Oh and I can’t forget the staff. They are all so friendly and helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot and so peaceful. There were some mosquitos, but also they provided a large fan. The yurt felt very much like a glamping accommodation where they thought of little amenities that made a nice difference in our experience. The private soaking tubs were incredibly relaxing. We'd love to return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve been wanting to stay at the hot springs for a long time, I wish we wouldn’t have waited so long! The space was so relaxing and absolutely beautiful. We will definitely be going back! Hands down most unique and relaxing place we have ever stayed! The outdoor set up with the claw tubs was incredible and so beautiful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,great place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place nice and relaxing definitely will be back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can not rave enough about our stay! we stayed in yurt #1, the bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and welcoming. The bathrooms located at the clubhouse were very clean, updated and warm! Everyone on staff was personable, and had a knowledge of the grounds and history which was a bonus. Will be coming back and bringing family!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place check in was easy and the lodge next door was super cool
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. Peaceful and comfortable.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a great place to be! Wish I could have stayed longer. Next time we will bring the kids!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place to stay. We really enjoyed having our own soaking tubs and not having to walk back from the pool in the rain/wind. The bathrooms are very clean, and easy access. The showers have plenty of hot water. It stayed pleasantly warm even with all the storms that came through. We are night shift workers so having the sun come through the skylight as soon as it started coming up was a little bit rough, but other than that it was a wonderful place. We will be back....... with eye masks lol."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was cozy and very enjoyable. Loved the private hot springs bath tubs. This is a good home base for hiking, cycling and other adventures.The only negative was the wifi was not available and this was part work, part leisure so that made it a bit difficult. I was able to use my phone as a hotspot since the cell service was good."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful trip! The yurt is exactly as pictured and described. The soaking tubs were amazing, the location is beautiful, and we came at the perfect time of year. It felt extremely private, even with the yurt being booked next door and plenty of RVs being there. They've done such a beautiful job creating a clean, luxurious, beautiful space. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and peaceful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderfully relaxing, quiet stay in Yurt 1. The hosts were fantastic, responded quickly to any needs, and realy enforced the importance of quiet and relaxation. We will absolutely be making a trip back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great host, clean bedding, clean place. We are very satisfied with our stay. We invited along our son and daughter in-law to rent the other yurt, and they were satisfied. He did a special drone tour of the place, and posted it on his social media, and got a lot of interests and questions about the place. Definitely will come back to this place as one of our vacation destinations, and will bring friends to enjoy this nice place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I live an hour away from this place and come every chance I get! Whether it's a romantic weekend getaway or a family campout, this place is perfect for everyone. Close to town yet still private."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place! I only wish I could have stayed longer. It was such a lovely break from the world and was very restorative. Absolutely immaculate accomodations and those soaking tubs are so unique.
2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"The bed was ok , lots of spiders it needed a bath room to far to walk in the middle of the night
The price is not worth it the outside tubes were ok would not do it again or recommend it to my friends."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our La Grande Hot Springs Yurt stay! The yurt has a patio with two amazing clawfoot soaking tubs, a gas fireplace, and twinkle lights! Everything was very clean. We had all the amenities needed for a relaxing and restful stay. We can't wait to stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most relaxing places I’ve been to, the hot spring tubs out the back door was perfect!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable. Loved having a private hot spring bath X2! One for hot and one for cold. Though the cold is only 77 degrees F. It was lovely! Be prepared that there is no bathroom in the Yurt but it is glamping after all, so it isn't too far of a hike:)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was exactly what we had hoped for. Everything looks exactly as pictured. It was so great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The place was super quiet, peaceful relaxing exactly what we needed after working or tails off over the last several years. Everyone needs an experience like this."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outdoor bath tubs perfect after a long drive. I got in an evening then a morning soak. Easy to find a comfy hot temperature. During my early morning soak there were very light flurries.
Yurt is organized well. During daylight, the dome opening is quite bright.
Also enjoy hearing birds and possibly an owl last night.
The bed is firm."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great accommodations in beautiful surroundings. Wonderful couples get away. We will be back again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was amazing as usual. So nice to decompress. It was really nice listening to all the birds in the morning.😊 Will book again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful adventure. The yurt is very cozy and clean. It was indeed very windy at night, but I loved the sound of the wind and really enjoyed being away from it all. The highlight for me was soaking in the private mineral tub with snow falling! Great bird watching."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a wonderful time at the yurt!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely get away, the propane fire was a little challenging to light, but was worth the effort ❤️"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was incredible! Just as described. Relaxing and private yurt that was incredibly clean.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very nice, romantic, and private spot for a couple to spend a night together. The yurt is very clean and has a heated floor. It's a unique experience with the bathtubs apart, but it feels like as if they were together. The water is really clean and good for the skin with a slight sulphur smell. The only thing missing was a little rain shelter to hang the towels and keep them dry. We would definitely go back and rent it again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We LOVED our stay at Yurt #1! The private deck with 2 hot-spring fed clawfoot tubs was so serene and dreamy! The bed was super comfortable and the yurt was warm and cozy! The bathrooms at the campground are close by and the nicest bathrooms I’ve ever seen at a campground!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I've stayed several times and always enjoy it. The whole package makes for a relaxing and refreshing time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We visited off season, no one around which was great. Even the yurt next to us was vacant. I could see when the park would be full it might lose some of the appeal. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I rented this place as a surprise gift for my dads 70th birthday. They really enjoyed their stay and kept sending me pictures the whole time. They said the hotsprings were adjustable and really enjoyed their soaking.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The private soaking tubs are worth the visit!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,we always have the BEST TIME! bring extra towels if staying during the colder months (we always do) the temps don't allow for things to dry in between use of the tubs. we love it here!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an incredible stay! The yurt was beautiful and clean and the private patio was incredible. Looking at the stars at night in our own little hot springs tubs was INCREDIBLE and having coffee in the tubs the next morning was equally as wonderful. 100% will go again and highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The only addition that they might consider adding is to add the hot springs water is always available at the yurts even when the main pool is closed for the winter season. Also with the Tiny house you get free access to the pools at the lodge but not the yurts. That should be clarified as well. The noon Check out time is nice.
Also there is a heater, floor heat and AC. I don't remember that being in the description. I had to look at the reviews to find out if the yurt would be warm enough in the snow. It was wonderfully warm and perfect. If we rent it again I think I will bring a bathtub pillow to make it more comfortable. Also check the head area of the tub, it was not scrubbed and gray greasy dead skin was smeared there and I scrubbed it off after leaning against it in the dark...gross just a small things to check and for the cleaning staff."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Will stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to be and relax, as long as neighbors are quiet it’s very peaceful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful private little yurt.
Great for a relaxing weekend getaway"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I booked my next trip before I even left! New favorite place to getaway and clear my head - Thank you!! 😊
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing and relaxing, all you need for a night or two away. We will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super windy night that kept us awake, but other than that it was perfect! If you can handle sleeping with ear plugs bring ‘em!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. The private soaking tubs were just what we needed, and it relaxed every part of our bodies before we climbed into the very comfortable bed. The yurt was warm, clean, and inviting. We will definitely book with Grande Hot Springs again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfortable yurt with nice amenities. Loved the outdoor tubs even more than expected. Highly recommend this spot."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s expensive but also very unique and enjoyable for us!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great get-away for those who enjoy peace and quiet and natural settings.
2023-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"Love the yurt and the tubs. We were just disappointed in the cheap amenities.
For what they are charging there should be much nicer coffee making facilities."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very relaxing. Great get away spot.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our second stay, it was perfect!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time enjoying this gem. We are two friends taking advantage of this local get away. Relaxing, cozy, and wonderfully private. We’ll be back!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Just as described, very clean and nice, it stayed very warm even though was below freezing outside. There are nearby trains that run through night that could keep some awake and the fiancé didn’t like the sulfur smell of the hot spring water but it did not bother me. I plan on coming back and maybe tent camp from motorcycle this summer."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect getaway weekend. Love the heated floors. Love the privacy. Love that we could adjust the temperatures in the hot tub while we were in them. Clean. Good coffee maker. Can't wait to go back next year!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was amazing! We lucked out with the weather. No wind. Will book again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great stay. Very peaceful and relaxing.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s an incredibly rare opportunity to soak in hot springs water privately in the PNW - and this place gives you the opportunity to do so! The patio with the soaking tubs was incredibly cute, the outdoor shower, fire pit, and well water hand pump were all really nice amenities as well. The yurt was sparking clean when I arrived and I stayed toasty and warm despite the freezing temperatures outside. It was super fun visiting the historic Hot Lake Hotel next door, as well. 10/10 would recommend staying here!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Super comfortable and a beautiful place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great getaway!! Private and peaceful.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sturdy yurt with a very comfortable bed and great private patio. Coffee maker, mini fridge, and heat/ac provided. The ability to soak to our hearts content in the clawfoot tubs and control the temperature was wonderful! We even enjoyed them during a wind storm and in the rain! Note that you have a very short walk to bathroom/shower facilities but they're clean and nice. Bring extra towels and earplugs (canvas walls) and don't forget to check out all the great local places to grab food and drinks."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We camp at this location 2-3 times a year just for a quick get out of the house weekend. The kids enjoy it and it's very easy to get in and out. My wife and I have stayed in yurt 1 a few times over the past few years. It's always a very reminiscent place for us. It's the break we need from life without too much travel or hassle. Even for one night. The bathrooms are always very nice and clean. The owners and staff are always very nice and helpful. I know they have a lot of irons in the fire right now. But I wish they would put up more of these rooms like the yurts. The word is out and it has become very difficult to get a booking. Plan way ahead.
We also visited the hotel next-door. We hope to stay there soon too. Ryan in the pub was great."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing as always! Amazing hosts.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay happened to coincide with a big ice and wind storm, so sleeping in yurt 1 was problematic especially on Thursday night when the winds were ripping across the roof of the yurt and rattling the walls and tarps. That is no fault of the space and certainly not a problem for the host. Just unfortunate timing. We didn’t sleep much at all that night due to the noise. On the other hand, the lot was totally private and was a beautiful arctic contrast to the hot tub experience. The local deer spent time with us too!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to relax
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,One of my favorite places! Had some issues filling the tubs because of ice but the host responded with some things we could do and even offered to send over maintenance. We got it working with the help of their suggestions. I will always come back to this place! The yurt stayed very warm even in the freezing temps and strong winds. Bed is very comfortable too. I love everything about it.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was wonderful one of the top nights I’ve had spending somewhere else!! We will definitely be back loved the soaking tubs fabulous time!! Thanks for having us♥️
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay, peaceful, and super cozy!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was peaceful and relaxing. My son and I had a great time, super warm inside the yurt. Great place to stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Always a favorite of ours! It’s a beautiful, relaxing location and the private hot springs with the yurt is incredible."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. Will be back again!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, relaxing little getaway. Just what we needed. Everything was as advertised and can’t wait to book again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s an awesome place to relax after a week of stressful work.
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,great place
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oh what a lovely yurt! Very cozy, comfortable bed. Good lighting. But the patio and hot springs soaking tubs were unique and very enjoyable. Definitely a Glamping experience, bathroom and shower house 20 yards away, but very clean."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,👍
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lucked out and got a yurt day-of while just passing through.
The place was super nice and everyone there and at the lodge next door were very friendly. Will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Already planning the next trip back!
2022-11-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt #1 was very clean and nice. Thay being said during our stay a caretaker(?), in a a white minivan came to clean the unit next to ours and for at least 3 hours all we heard was the person slamming her car doors and driving back and forth right in front of our yurt and quite literally right up next to it. Kinda ruined our ""quiet soak in the healing hot springs tubs""."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I’d stay there again and would recommend it.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but it was well worth it. We got in the pools around 1030 and had them all to ourselves, we checked out all the common areas and had a great time. Rooms were clean and very authentic."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was a little rough. We had to wait about twenty minutes and by the time someone came to the front desk, there were quite a few people waiting. The gentleman who checked us in was really rude though I think he was overwhelmed. It made a rough start for the weekend.
Otherwise the staff was really great and we really enjoyed the stay. The photos didn’t do the rooms justice and overall we had a very relaxing fun weekend. Highly recommend for a quiet, relaxed stay and particularly for those who loved old buildings and history. I can’t wait to go back."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I used to come here with my mother when I was a child. It was super creepy and dilapidated then! It has now been made quite comfy without destroying the history!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time at Hot Lake Springs. Everyone was super friendly. Room 217 with the two bedrooms and sitting area, was very spacious. The second bedroom is completely separate from the sitting area. There is some noise from the room next door though. And you can hear the train and traffic but ear plugs work well. It wasn’t a big deal.
We enjoyed a nice girls trip from Portland and want to return!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay the staff was super friendly beds were comfy and soaks were amazing!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I've stayed here numerous times and have loved each time.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time staying at the lodge and it never disappoints!! The lodge is so cool and full of history, the hot spring tubs are so relaxing and look out at the pristine hot lake and the mountains. We saw a movie in the little theater in the lodge which was super fun, and enjoyed many drinks at the bar! Everyone was super friendly and even though they were fully booked when we were there, it never felt too busy! We loved hanging out with the super sweet resident cat Rocky! Such a fun and relaxing vacation. We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I had an amazing stay and cannot wait to go back. All of the staff were welcoming, friendly, and helpful, including Rocky, the cat. The hot spring facilities were clean and peaceful. We were also pleasantly surprised by the historical beauty of the building, free movie showing and tasty food at the pub.
I would recommend this experience to anyone looking for a unique place to visit and stay. For selfish reasons I hope the Lodge keeps it’s character and doesn’t get too commercialized."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely go again! We were warned about wind, but mother nature had other plans... no wind, which made the mosquitoes come out in full force! Yikes! The building is exactly as described although maybe even more charming. The building is VERY warm on sunny days. Make sure your room radiator is turned off asap or you will have a hot night despite outdoor temps below 40. The window screens have to be put in and out for use - they're not permanently installed. That felt a little awkward considering I could climb out my window and over to another room very easily. Provided fans should fit the windows better and instructions on how to use the ceiling fan and radiator should be more clear. 1st night ""slept"" hot and was grateful for morning, 2nd night had it figured out and slept wonderfully. I heard the train when I was awake but it was not loud enough to wake me from sleep. It will be fun to return and see how they continue to improve this historic gem!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Always clean and a great escape from the world! Water was clean and staff are friendly and helpful!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Love this quirky place. We were last here two years ago and not too much has changed. We had hoped to see more parts of the hotel renovated/open but we appreciate what is available. I do feel like it is a bit expensive but it is a unique experience with the soaking tubs.. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,I love the unique nature of this place. I look forward to returning over the years and seeing their remodeling and renovation progress.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Great service!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staff at Hot Lakes is great! Our friend got hurt skiing at Anthony Lakes and the staff helped refill ice and make sure he was comfortable. Check-in was a breeze for both myself and the guests staying with us.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for a great stay!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,great staff. super friendly
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful relaxing place to stay with friendly staff and continued upgrades to the property.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had another wonderful visit to Hot Lake! Thank you for the wonder experience.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The most relaxed I have felt in a long time!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love Hot Lake Lodge, such a unique place and atmosphere. My only critique is it would be nice if there were some Robes in larger sizes available. All of the robes are M/L so bring your own robe if you need something larger."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very neat place to visit. Lots of history there. I would definitely recommend going.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying at the lodge during the Eastern Oregon Film Festival. Hope to be back!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing and relaxing! We enjoyed the sunrise in the hot springs tubs, enjoy a few drinks in the bar, slept well in our beautiful room and overall felt rejuvenated after our stay! Will definitely be returning, and recommend to all!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Hot Lake. I see so much potential for property and have so many ideas for them! I hope they eventually build a culinary destination restaurant so you don’t have to leave at all. They have great outdoor seating for it in summertime. The thermal pub is great for a snack.
I enjoyed soaking every day and appreciated that day users have to leave by 8 PM. All the people who were tipsy and rowdy mostly left at a reasonable time when staff asked them to.
The breakfast offerings were great for a light breakfast. My only suggestion is to serve it at the half moon bar in the lobby area adjacent to the Thermal Pub so it doesn’t get too congested.
We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great break if on motorcycles!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time and I guarantee we will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is a timecapsule; full of history. It's genuinely peaceful. There are a thousand little details that show thoughtful consideration of design (modernized) and usability within the building. Terry cloth robes and spa like atmosphere in personal bathroom. Extremeyly friendly and helpful staff. The pools are just outside the building, not a long walk which was nice. There are: cubbies for your things and hooks to hang towels, etc.; a privace fense from the hotel; shaded spaces if you need to escape the sun; beautiful fire pits when it gets dark; posted temperatures of each pool/tub hourly; and a resident cat named Rocky. There is a bar with appertizer options. Not much for breakfast aside from a few pieces of fruit, granola bars, and coffee. I wish we didn't have to leave the property to have meals but you can bring food. There is a fridge provided for guest use with a dinning area. Town is about 8 miles away. Over all a wonderful stay and we'll be back. Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice - friendly staff. Beautiful and private. The soaking tubs were out of this world and the view was spectacular! We loved it!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love this place. Love the vision of restoring a place to previous grandeur. Love the tubs. Would love more food options and cocktails, but the Pub serves a great ceasar salad and meatball side dish. Don't miss the pretzel bites, as well as a great selection of local beers. Staff is friendly, rooms are immaculate, mattress perfect. This is a don't miss visit if you are anywhere near La Grande on your way to anywhere else. Backpacking in the Wallowas, Skiing or Mountain Biking Anthony Lake? Must stop and recover."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and we were happy to support the effort to restore this historical building. Wonderful and friendly staff. Thanks!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is definitely an experience! Filled with history and the air dense with it. Room 217 was beautiful and it seemed to just continue on. So many little closets and character. I love this little hotel an need all the creepy little charm that comes with it. Best part about staying here might be that there’s no limits to the tub times so enjoy your wine or drink of choice and relax as late as you like.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is a lovely spot in a very cool old hotel. They are renovating but were clear about that up front and what was being done was quite unobtrusive. The rooms, restaurant, spas, sun rooms and public spaces were all great. The local-made bagels for breakfast were super.
They had personal robes for each guest to walking to and from the tub area was easy and comfortable.
I like the idea of a movie night, available Thu-Sun.
Staff were all very friendly, informative and responsive. The food in the restaurant, although a limited menu, was good and reasonably priced.
There is not much hiking on the property but nearby are several parks - Catherine Creek State Park, Morgan Lake Park, and more that have nice hikes. La Grande has some good restaurants."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hot springs 👍
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish we could have stayed longer! Such a hidden gem. It was a perfect moms night away! Great, accommodating staff and the soaking tubes are so relaxing!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"We had an overall good stay at the Lodge, it is very much under construction and very much in progress but you can see the potential for the space and the vision for restoration. We look forward to seeing how it progresses over time and might consider coming back when it’s a little more developed."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We'd stayed about this time last year. We booked for another stay, twice as long as last year, in spite of knowing a few things had not changed. Its tough to justify the room rates when you need to travel to La Grande for restaurants. Granted, the bar has a few offerings, but ones that are warmed up, not prepared fresh. As well... I was hopeful to have found something more along spa services/treatments. It seemed as though nothing had moved in the remodel, and the space was the exact same as last year. We'll likely return, but also looking for a more full service location in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriends and I stayed for 2 days for our annual girls trip. it was the perfect place! The rooms were clean and cozy, we sat for hours in the hot spring pools, sat out late at night by the fire pits, and there was ample food and drinks for purchase that we didn't need to leave the property. We all agreed it was a perfect relaxing getaway to connect and recharge! We will definitely return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at Hot Lake. For us it was a destination stay, as we wanted to soak in the hot mineral pools multiple times a day and enjoy disconnecting.
The waters are incredible and healing.
The movie theatre is sweet and we went to a movie
We used the sunroom to play board games.
Our suite was super comfortable and clean.
Staff was kind and knowledgeable.
The entire stay was quiet and
Great work on the tasteful upgrades. Keep it up."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at the hotel and are already planning our next trip.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and peaceful stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We are definitely coming back! So relaxing and away from everything! Staff was approachable and helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second time staying. Love how guests have 24 hr access to the ponds! Thank you for the wonderful stay. Can't wait to see more restorations done!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We love it here! We make sure to come back every year & are never disappointed!
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,I enjoyed the hot springs and the grounds have a natural beauty
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Inside of lodge was beautifully done. Mix of old and new.
If you plan on soaking bring mosquito repellent. The mosquitoes are hungry and in Great numbers.
Bring a pillow if your allergic to feather pillows"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a hidden gem! Staff was so friendly and accommodating. The hotel in and of itself is a beautiful piece of local history. The rooms are so charming and tranquil and felt quite luxurious. The pools were a glorious way to start off in the morning and end in the evening. Our stay was absolutely top notch. Cannot wait to come back!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place. Very relaxing. Great facilities.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hot springs were very therapeutic and very clean/well maintained. You can see this is a beautiful 'grand dame' old hotel. The giant cast iron claw foot bathtub in the room was amazing! It made me feel like a little girl floating in a bubble bath again. Friendly and helpful staff too. A fun trip!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The hotel room was spacious and comfortable. The historical building was fun to explore with lots of room in the lobby to relax. Drinks were reasonably priced and service was friendly. The soaking pools were nice and hot. Very relaxing stay. We will definitely come back
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a return visit so the Lodge has its charms. We understand they are working to get the restaurant remodeled & working 7 days a week, ditto the movie theater. It is a bit inconvenient to drive back into LaGrande (Monday-Thursday ) for supplies or dinner.
The room we stayed in had a small fridge & microwave so that helped the situation. We wish the lodge had soaking tubs exclusively for lodge guests; as it is, the RV park gets to use the tubs, too, and can seem crowded until 8 pm, when lodge guests are the only designated users. Tubs exclusive to lodge guests WOULD BE A HUGE PLUS.
With “soft” check-ins available (use of soaking tubs until 4 pm check-in), it is a tiny bit better than NO EARLY CHECK-INS, but my friend and I did not want to wear wet suits for long after soaking…so we opted to take a 2 hr drive instead.
In all, the Hot Lakes Lodge has nothing but great potential and it is NICE to see an old, historic building with many past lives coming back to life in this way."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So peaceful and healing. I’ll be back soon.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,we keep coming back for a reason.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the absolute best time. Loved everything about this place. soaked for about 12 hours in 2 days. The rooms are so charming, the beds and pillows are very comfy. Even the pull out bed! Staff was so helpful and friendly. We felt very comfortable and had everything we needed."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Relaxing stay and a beautiful historic hotel. I am excited to see what restorations they do next.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cool and interesting property - its fun to learn about the history of previous uses and the site itself. Lots of cool details and fun history to explore. The hot springs are AMAZING - very clean, peaceful and relaxing. I also appreciate that there are various tub temperatures so I can pick how to soak. The whole building is heated by geothermal piping which is really cool but I'll note its hard to control the room temperature at times. La Grande is a 10 minute drive and there are some yummy restaurants - the hotel has some good recommendations. Definitely a great place to visit in Oregon."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful visit! Staff was incredible
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Love staying at Hot Lake, absolutely beautiful and so relaxing soaking in the hot springs"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Lodge at Hot Springs Lake is a destination. Located in the wilds of eastern Oregon it is a historic gem in the middle of rangeland. Popping up like a mirage in the desert, we we could see the steam rising for miles away. The owners have done a wonderful job sprucing up this dilapidated property. Their incorporation of old and new creates a polished, historic experience we won't soon forget. This is a an old building, that must be said, but great care has been taken to create a warm, relaxing environment for guests. We will be eager to return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A unique and peaceful place. Very well run and organized. Very clean. We rented the two bedroom with a private bath #217. Super comfortable beds and living space with a mini fridge and microwave. There isn’t a ton to do. It’s a place to chill. With gorgeous public hangout spaces. There is a ping pong table and a mini theater for movie nights when they have them. And no real food just snacks. The pools are incredible the water amazing. If you love to soak and want to relax I highly recommend
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Lodge was fantastic! Our group really appreciated the ""no persons under 12"". We really enjoyed our girls night. I was a little disappointed that construction was still happening on the third floor as it is such a beautiful and historic place we were unable explore (obviously for safety reasons).
We will be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Friendly staff. I’ll be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great fun and cool place. Tubs were very relaxing!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,This was a great time at a great place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My 2nd stay here and this room is LOVELY. There is much to love about the entire place; not just the soaking tubs! I really enjoy the sitting rooms on each floor. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The fresh cold mineral water stations are a great touch! In the pub, Metta makes a mean charcuterie! 😉. The beds are sooooo comfortable after a soak, and the bathrobes are thoughtful for trekking to and from the tubs.
The hot lake is a beauty and the soaking tubs are luxurious! You have to soak in the evening as well as the next morning before you check out. It’s 2 totally different, equally amazing experiences! My fave is the rock tub, bc I feel almost “one with the lake,” lol.
Heed the instructions to wear heavy shoes. If they blow into the lake, you’re not getting them back!!!
This is a true gem, and I look forward to returning!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"It was just what I needed! Girls night for my birthday. The bed was super comfy and the pillow was awesome. The robe made me feel at home. The coffee and the homemade bagels for breakfast was delicious! The pools were hot and the views surrounding the area are stunning! And the staff was very friendly!
Can't wait to come again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning room!!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for making this place nice again! It feels like a healing magical place not the scariest place on earth.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family of four really enjoyed our one night stay at the Lodge. Our suite of rooms (Rm 217) gave us tons of space to spread out. My teenager said the pull-out couch in the living room was comfortable.
The uniqueness of the building was fascinating and fun to explore. Although it was a fairly busy weekend( we were there the day before New Years) we were still able to find an open tub. We Skied at Anthony Lakes during the day and drove over for the evening and also soaked the next day. The breakfast is basic, but the bagels are really good, and it’s so nice not to have to leave the property in the morning. There is a beautiful breakfast room to enjoy. The noon check out is great, and makes the morning feel very relaxing. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice that they had activities like the theatre and pub. I can’t wait for a restaurant and full bar to open. It seemed like the movies could have been reduced price for guests (not that they were expensive) and the day users took the majority of the tubs during the day, but I understand the need to survive as a business. I enjoyed the off hours that was closed to the public, it was awesome."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love the Lodge at Hot Lake. First time spending the night, usually just day soakers. It’s a very expensive splurge, but made for a fun evening with friends."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful visit at Hot Lake Lodge and can’t say enough about how kind and accommodating the staff were. The suite we stayed in had everything we needed for a cozy stay and we can’t wait to return. Thank you again!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The hotel is woderful and the addition of the pub and movie theater are great. I love staying here. Be prepared for noise from the trains at night. The staff are wonderful.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,I booked the room for my sister and cousins. They had a wonderful time. Hope to stay myself sometime.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,definitely would recommend staff makes you feel at home. Hot springs were so amazing
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Unique, fun, and relaxing!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The historical building was very cool. The room was immaculate and the hot pools were fantastic.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Big rooms with big bright windows. Comfy beds. Fascinating history, and overall it was a neat place to stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hot tube were magnificent! We loved the large very clean rooms and the exquisit beds and natural fiber plush pillows and bedding. We loved the showers. We loved the historical aspect of Hot Lake, Its where our great grandmother died."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely room and lodge. The owners really did a great job restoring this gem. I look forward to returning when there are more substantial food options on site. The soaking tubs in the morning are heavenly, with quiet peaceful vibes."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Always amazing!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing! The staff is very accommodating and friendly. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. I love the atmosphere and the tubs were incredible! Will be back again for sure"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,SUCH FRIENDLY STAFF-LOVED OUR STAY
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great combination for a history buff and hot springs fan! The restoration efforts of the new owner are fabulous! Everything is clean and very comfortable.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Fun stay at this historic building, they are still in the process of restoring and cleaning the place up but the staff is very kind and the hot spring soaking tubs are very nice!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic little diamond in the rough. The listing was very clear about the quirks of the property so I knew just what to expect. Even then, it was better than I could have imagined. The room was lovely and comfortable, the public areas were well appointed, and the soaking area was seriously picturesque. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We two teenage kids were comfortable and enjoyed soaking. I'm looking forward to watching the property evolve over the next few years and will definitely be making return trips!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find! We went for a girls' weekend and were not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, the soaking pools well maintained and clean, and the facility was as advertised. We definitely will come back and cannot wait to see how the renovations continue to make the lodge an even better gem."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I have stayed in this room — it is perfect for traveling with a friend, with the two separated bedrooms and the sitting area in between."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,We love staying here. It’s really a lot of fun and taking a walk back in time. The staff is great and the bathtubs that allow you to soak in the mineral water in your room is really awesome.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our time and the history is great!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second stay here and we can't say enough about how much we love the hotel!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was excited to finally see the place, and finally got a road trip together with so.e coworker friends! This place is AMAZING. I'm on deck for a shoulder repair at the moment, and after an hour soakng, felt PAIN FREE for the first time in YEARS!! The rooms are 5-Star, as it the lodge. I wish the dining room was open, but plenty in town. Lastly, top marks for Toni... she was a fantastic hostess!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Best getaway ever!!! Always want to stay longer!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts . Hot springs and hotel are great . Love the vibes and hospitality. Can’t wait to come back .
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a plunge into the past. A venerable sanatorium that reached its peak in the first half of the century, almost fell down and has just recently been saved.
The hot pools are delightful, the staff very pleasant and the setting quite beautiful and haunting.
If you are willing to spend some extra money, Suite 217 is spacious and charming. No restaurant, but tasty light food, beer, wine and cider available at the bar."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,New ownership has whipped the place into shape and is restoring to its former glory. The soaking tubs are amazing and being open 24 hrs is a huge plus. We had great service at the pub and enjoyed the lounge atmosphere. We loved seeing Rocky the cat outside on the patio and on the steps in the morning. We were missing our cats and he is a very good boy. Rooms were clean and comfortable and it was fun to explore the entire grounds. Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our time here. Tranquille and relaxing. Ping pong table was a plus and we look forward to more renovations to finish and to enjoy more what the lodge could offer next time!
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,See previous page.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Could use some more updating, pest control (BIG ants in our room) and have the bar open. Bed was comfy and soaks were great."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful mixture of old and modern, in a surreal setting. Love it!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice hot springs, hopefully a wooden path to the soaking tubs will be in plan for upgrade. So nice the hot pools are open."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this historic mineral lake resort. It is set in a beautiful eastern Oregon country setting. The mineral soaking tubs were wonderful, and the staff were very accommodating."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a cool place! Can't wait to go back.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderfully relaxing environment in a beautiful area. The pools are relaxing and there is a desperate pond with wild life that’s enjoyable to watch.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and amazing staff! Thank you for hosting us.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love this place. The history is cool, soaking tubs were great and room was amazing"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,The hot tubs are amazing. The lodge is very lovely inside and out. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,❤️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love it here! Peaceful, relaxing, & the history of the place is great! Loved our room! Beds were very comfortable!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to stay. We’ve been here a few times now and will definitely be back. Can’t wait for all the renovations to be done & food available.
Only downfall is the lack of quality food nearby and no kitchens in the rooms.
We bring a packed cooler with us."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is truly a gem! The room was clean, spacious, and relaxing. The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable, and the tubs were fabulous!!!!! We really hope to be back in the future because this place is truly amazing!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Staff were friendly, room was perfect, everything was clean
This was my third time staying at the hot springs, overall it was a great mini vacation, although not as relaxing as it previously was. They now have day soak passes which fills up the 5 tubs from about 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. If you are staying in one of their rooms you will likely be sharing a tub during day hours, which does make the experience less relaxing. My time there was still enjoyable and I did a meet some very nice people."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had wonderful time! Great soaking tubs and very friendly staff. Loved learning about the history of this historic lodge!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"great location, pools were wonderful"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Have dreamt of visiting here for a long time and it did not disappoint! The rooms are so cute and the hot pools overlooking the hot spring lake are amazing! Staff were so friendly and loved the resident polydactyl kitty named Rocky aka Thumbs! We will be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great experience again!! Love this place!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing and unique hotel and experience. Great employees. Wonderful tubs. Perfect!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staff is nice and helpful. It’s very relaxing and only a short way from good food options in La Grande. Our room was recently renovated, clean, and comfortable. The hot springs themselves are nice and well maintained. We had a great girls trip."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Visited over the summer and it's great to see all the renovations they've done since then. The movie theater and pub are a great addition. The staff we interacted with was friendly, helpful and we learned more history about the property which is so fascinating. The room was as described and the clawfoot tub was such a treat to soak in, but the real treat was the hot springs. Absolutely perfect and relaxing. Definitely recommend coming during the week if possible because there were hours we had alone to soak. Will be coming back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time. The pools were great.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We took a 3-night birthday trip for 6 friends to this wonderful little retreat, and could not have been happier! The hotel has so much character, is so welcoming and charming, and felt very clean and well appointed. We appreciated the little touches, thought the staff were super helpful, and LOVED the pools. So thankful that guests can soak at any hour, and we loved the sweet little theater experience. We booked this trip site unseen and were thrilled it turned out to be a diamond in the rough. Lots of great hiking nearby too! Thank you for a beautiful weekend."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! The restoration progress is amazing to see. The historic photos are incredibly interesting and really help craft a connection to the Lodge. The robes in the room are a great touch.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the hot tub experience. Clean rooms
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful historic building. Loved our room and the soaking pools. Was definitely how I had hoped it would be. Looking forward to coming back in the future.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful quiet place. The Lodge is what I would call rustic elegant. The staff were warm and knowledgeable. The soaking tubs were so clean and the lake is beautiful. I would highly recommend it.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Loved our stay at this beautiful old building—we will definitely be coming back! Be sure to read the room descriptions carefully as each is slightly different and there are active train tracks not too far away, so bring ear plugs if that is a concern for you!"
2022-01-01,3,Stayed one night,unable to use pools until almost 8 pm because they were filled with people not staying at the lodge. very disappointed in the whole experience...very over priced. I was paying for the use of the springs....and couldn't even use them until very late at night...
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Historic building with lots of character, but has a work in progress vibe. The suite was comfortably sized for our family of 4, but would not recommend using the sofa bed. Regular beds were firm and supportive, sofa bed not so much. Soaking pools are the jewel. Nice to be able to grab a drink at the bar. The movie theater was unexpected and definitely a standout feature, too."
2022-01-01,4,Group trip,What a special place! Hot springs are amazing. Rooms are clean and charming. We would come again!
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Hotel was great! Beds were a bit firm, but loved the historic aspect. Had great decorations and amenities. Everything was clean and staff was around when we had questions. Nice complimentary breakfast with fruit, granola bars, and little sweets, cocoa and coffee. There were five different tubs, all nice. The surrounding area was beautiful and scenic. Easy 8 miles to town. Would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"I’m guessing on everything because we didn’t actually get to make this trip, so I’ve given them 5 stars on everything except accuracy.
A few days before we visited, the host changed their policy and began to allow day guests at the hot springs. We only found this out through Instagram, no one notified us of the change. I messaged for more information and while the host was responsive, their strategy was disappointing- no official cap on the number of day passes, they’re just playing it by ear. With the pandemic numbers way up right now, we couldn’t justify a trip not knowing how crowded the pools would be, so we had to cancel.
This place looks beautiful in the photos and hopefully we can visit someday. For now, I wish the host would be more proactive about sharing changes like this with booked guests so they have all the info they need to make decisions. It would also be nice if they had a more generous cancellation policy, especially if they’re going to change things last minute and make you choose between feeling safe and losing your money."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time at the lodge. Our rooms were just what we needed and the hot springs rejuvenating. Everything was exactly as advertised. Even though the lodge is a work in progress, our accommodations were comfortable and relaxing and the hot springs rejuvenating. Do follow the suggestions of bringing a water bottle and shoes to the soaking tubs that will not blow away. The first visit to the tubs was calm and peaceful with the stars above. The next morning the wind was roaring off the hill and even our hydro flasks had to be propped next to the tub to not blow away. I highly recommend you visit."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My aunt and I had a wonderful time. The staff was very inviting and the place was really clean despite the aging property. Looking forward to next time!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a really lovely visit. Everything was very accurately described. They aren’t joking about the wind. But it was beautiful and windy and the stay was great!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful historical gem in Eastern Oregon. The mineral springs paired with this beautiful historic building make the ideal get away. The owners have put in a lot of efforts to reimagine what this hotel could be, and I am so excited to have this beautiful place so close to home. I absolutely love what you all have done here, and can't wait to come back!!! We had a fabulous ladies night, and were so rejuvenated from the relaxing geothermal pools and tubs. Thank you again for all that you have done, this is a true jewel for Eastern Oregon!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ask for the ear plugs from the front desk!
Use the robes, they are great!
Bathrooms only have tubs, there is a shared but private shower.
Rooms have mini fridges and microwaves."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay. Loved the soaking tubs and the historic charm. Great hospitality!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is am amazing hidden gem. So much history, beautiful renovations reclaiming the Lodge, the hot tubs are clean and accessible, clean rooms, and helpful staff. A nice grab breakfast saved a trip into town, and La Grande has many choices to eat! The landscape is breath taking. It is a true getaway!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Really neat, historic hotel and hot springs for a relaxing getaway in a country setting. The soaking tubs next to the hot lake are great! And cool lighting and fire pits make it even better. The hotel restoration itself is still a work in progress. But they've done an amazing job so far! Can't wait to return when it's all done."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,The hotel has been renovated and cleaned up so nicely. The new hot tubs are very neat and enjoyable. We did experience some paranormal activity which was exciting. Overall a great experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a gem!! Stayed here for 1 night after a long backpacking trip. The hot springs tubs were just what we needed for our sore muscles. It was extremely nice and relaxing. Staff (especially Paul) was very welcoming. Would definitely return!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to soak and unwind!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a fun and quirky stay. The room was clean and comfy. The staff are friendly and attentive.
Remember that it's an old building and not a five-star hotel, which is just fine with us. The soaking tubs are hot. Breakfast is minimal."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at The Lodge at Hot Lake Springs! Emily at the front desk was super friendly and helpful.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"20 years ago I lived in LaGrande, and always wanted to sneak into this place. It was an abandoned run down place at that time, but I knew it was an awesome historical time piece. So glad I waited and was able to experience the place in first class relaxation! The mineral tubs are probably the best part of this place, but staying their really brings you back to a time when simplicity was all you needed. I hope they never add televisions to the rooms. Great way to get away from it all and build a memory of a life time. I hope to return some day."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Cool place with awesome hot spring tubs. Customer service was perfect from Sara and Ruthie.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Lodge at Hot Lake Springs was a fantastic place for our family to stay. The room was spacious and luxurious. The soaking pools were amazing and relaxing, especially at night. The hotel is old and currently under renovations which we were aware of ahead of time. The only reason we gave 4/5 stars is because we needed to open our windows to cool off the room during the heat wave. This let in some bugs from the nearby marsh. They have temporary screens and this should be fixed once they put in permanent screens. We definitely plan on coming back and checking out their progress in the future!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay in our very spacious suite. Beds were very comfortable. Staff was very nice, hot spring tubs and fire pits were ultra relaxing. I would recommend this to friends."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the hot springs and I like the mix of modern and new. I’ll be very curious to see what the hotel looks like when it’s all done. The restaurant, bar & theater are not yet up and running despite the listing mentioning the restaurant. Over all my family had a great time."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"More amazing than expected! Very very quiet, relaxed and exceptionally friendly people."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Friendly staff, lovely soaking tubs, friendly hotel kitty :) Had a great time!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE. First up: this charming room is so spacious, with two large bedrooms, one with a desk, separated by a lovely sitting room with an electric fireplace and a large bathroom with a long clawfoot tub. The style of the room is so thoughtful and lovely! Good to note, there is a microwave and a small fridge in the room.
And the hot pools: AMAZING. We had cloud cover, so we couldn't see stars, but the full moon was on full display. The steam rising off Hot Lake creates a wonderful atmosphere.
The overall property is this wonderful blend of historic charm and modern simplicity, and there is plenty of places to have a meeting, read a book, or relax outside of your room. I can't wait until the pub is open."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! Friendly staff and super clean hot springs tubs. Our room was stylish and beds were extremely comfortable. We will be back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun place! Great soaking pools. Excited to watch it evolve as they continue the renovation.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a treasure, thankfully being restored and nurtured by new owners. The soaking waters are incredible, the grounds beautiful, and overall vibe is quite magical. You can sit in the tubs, watchingthe sunset, sipping a drink of choice. The room was very large, comfortable,clean with hip appointment, and a very nice bathroom with claw foot tub. The old building is charming, a bit magical, and evokes a time long gone by. Can’t wait to go back and go to the soon to be opened pub andtheater!"
2021-04-01,4,Group trip,"This Lodge is truly one of the most unique places I've stayed! I wouldn't have expected to find something like this in La Grande. The updates they've done have only added to the Lodge. It's beautiful, clean, a little creepy (but in a really good way), and historic. The lodge is old so sound travels pretty easily so be mindful or your neighbors will. The pools are all CLEAN and so well kept. I can't wait to go back and enjoy the quiet."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Largest mineral hot spring in the world. Great hot springs experience in a museum like setting. Hotel is historic building adjusted to modern needs as much as possible. Most of the rooms have a bedroom and a sitting room and prolly large closets.
Never felt crowded. Always room at the hot tubs. Known for winds, bring a hat. Staff is great and trying hard to please"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Off the beaten path and a little off-beat! You can see how much effort has gone into restoring this old building and the results are lovely. There are several hot springs soaking tubs that are clean and have a nice view overlooking the hot lake. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. Great spot to stay overnight if you're road-tripping on I-84 to give your bones a good soaking!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Like stepping back in time to stay at a rustic early-1900s hotel on the Western frontier, only with added modern comforts. Imagine our surprise after using a physical key to open up our suite (Room 217, two bedrooms), only to find a remote-controlled fireplace by the couch in the middle common room! Along with WiFi, this was perfect for finishing a cozy evening watching a western on my laptop after a long soak out on the lakeside deck.
The hot pools do not close at night and were consistently at a perfect temperature of just over 105° (with very minor temperature fluctuations at night) and temp-checked by staff every hour. The tubs' view of the hills, steaming lake, ducks, and sunset were unforgettable. We will be back and can't wait to see what other amenities (theater? on-site kitchen or restaurant?) may eventually be added & opened to guests!
But even before any of those renovations are completed, you won't be disappointed by what they offer now: daily delivery of custom dinner orders (from Side A Brewing) and MANY on-site drink options: beer, cider, wine, hard seltzers, etc. Family-friendly, respectful and relaxing atmosphere. Treat yourself to a night or two at this mini-vacation destination that you'll never forget!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and relaxing. We had a very peaceful night’s sleep after soaking in the mineral baths outside. Can’t wait to go back!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome staff, lodging, and hot springs!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place is beautiful and amazing! The staff was exceptionally friendly and the hotel is a great, historic building, with this phenomenal natural resource of a 150 degree lake. The soaking tubs are modern, clean, and very comfortable. They only opened a month ago, so there’s still a little to dial in around details, but overall they’re doing a great job, with what sounds like much more to come!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed one night,A unique place with dedicated and hard-working hosts who have made so much progress in renovating this piece of Oregon history. The hot springs tub set-up is delightful and the staff very friendly. The cons – it's unfinished and a little clunky at times. The pros – it's unfinished but a treat to see the before and during…we cannot wait to come back again and experience the after. This is going to be a gem in Eastern Oregon.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would recommend for anyone to stay here!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, close to everything you need. Awesome shower, hot and great pressure and comfy bed"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little room. The cats are super friendly! :)
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Don’t let your first impression ruin your experience here.
Once inside this cute, well equipped basement suite, you will soon forget the difficulty of trying to park while avoiding the neighbors scrap wood pile and that you had to dodge free range chicken manure in the lawn to avoid tracking it into the house (which discouraged us from wanting to use the hot tub).
This cozy and nicely decorated shared space provides everything you will need for your stay. The coffee is great, internet is fast, and the bed is comfortable.
Monica has helpful signs throughout the unit to provide clear instructions including the “watch your head” sign, as the short ceilings may be an issue for taller travelers.
The hosts live upstairs and do their best to keep the expected overhead noise at a minimum for those of us who retire early."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect spot if you’re visiting La Grande.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much for accommodating so last minute. We just did not have it in us to get to Baker City that night. My daughter and I were headed to Utah for a mountain bike race and this was the perfect stopover from Snohomish, WA. Everything was so comfortable and it felt like home. Thank you again. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place great host great bed!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely place to stay while we visited EOU.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay at Monica’s place. Very comfortable, clean and cozy. Would absolutely stay there again next time I’m in town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This airbnb was in a great location, with lots to explore in the area. The chickens were cuties and the eggs were incredible - beautiful orange yolks. The bed was super comfortable and all the streaming services available. My favourite part was the visits from the curious kitties and their stellar catio 🥰. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would recommend for a cozy, clean, affordable, great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay at Monica’s was perfect! She was so kind and responsive to any texts. We absolutely adored her sweet cats and they even spent time downstairs with us and on the catio. We also tried a great bakery in her recommendation book- it’s just downtown -called the Liberty Theatre Cafe. We highly recommend it! We would stay again anytime gladly!! :)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed my stay at Monica's place, very cute and cozy room and loved the added touch of country too it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for hosting me.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay for a night! I walked over to Side A Brewing and the Local, then had a great sleep in a comfy bed. It was just what I needed before getting back on the road in the morning. I hope I get the chance to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts who obviously care very much about making their guests comfortable. My stay was very brief so I didn’t get a chance to be in the space long but I was comfortable and had everything I needed for a good nights sleep and easy exit early in the morning.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Monica was super helpful and very responsive. The space is private and cozy. The bed was super comfy! I would recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay passing through on the interstate. Enjoyed the hot tub after a long day of travels! Shared the space in the morning with two of the friendly cats that came to say hello:)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Will & Monica's place. They are both so friendly and accommodating hosts. It was an easy place to access, very convenient and overall really nice too. Hit all the spots for our travels through La Grande. Thanks for hosting us!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My go to place! They're the nicest hosts and it's always clean and quiet!!! Exactly as advertised! I will be staying many more times I'm sure!!!🙏❤️
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the comfy bed to the fabulous shower to the friendly cats, the stay was perfect. Monica and Will have made a great cozy space and I will surely be staying again next time I’m in town."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Will stay again when I’m in town for work and it’s available!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in the area was perfect to visit kids just down the street. Easy walking around town and a great bakery downtown. Liberty Cafe. Hosts were available for help with small requests.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I would definitely recommend! Kind hosts and a great location!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you! Perfect for my quick trip!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is great for cat lovers and those looking for a cozy bed in LaGrande! Friendly hosts (cats included). The egg cooking machine is fun to use, Keurig is super handy, and the robes were a plus!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Monica has created a space that is welcoming and comfortable. I loved her attention to small details that made my stay extra special. I would definitely come here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Monica’s place was perfect. Felt very safe and comfortable in the room. All described amenities were included. I appreciated how communicative Monica was. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monica s location is great. She has so many nice little touches to her place. Bottles of water, tea, coffee, was all great. Great location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This little room was perfect for a quick overnighter in La Grande. Easy walk to restaurants downtown. Monica was very communicative and accommodating. Would definitely recommend this place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful, very homey and welcoming place"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank-you; I had a wonderful stay, and it was perfect for my weekend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! Quiet and cozy. I will stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute place and the hosts are super sweet! One of the cats had an issue down stairs and they cleaned it up immediately and handled it like pros! The bed is pretty soft, so if that’s not your jam be aware. 100% would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I picked Monica’s place because I needed accommodation heading home toward Boise, and the roads were closed due to weather. They did end up opening up that evening and I did end up going back home that night, but I was able to rest and recover from the long drive prior, so it was worth it to me. I would stay again if I’m ever in La Grande!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a nice place to stay, definitely more private then a hotel and more comfortable as well. We stayed prior to a big exam and it was great. The wifi is strong, we were able to stream while simultaneously studying and working on projects. The space was very clean and fairly private for being a down stairs airbnb. They stuck to the quiet hours and we did not hear much from above after 10 pm. they do have cats that run around but someone put them away for the night and so it didn't keep us awake. the hot tub was private and very nice. there was a mini fridge, air fryer and egg cooker but no microwave which made eating left overs difficult in the morning, but wasn't a big deal overall. the bed was incredibly comfortable and the fresh eggs were a nice touch!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Great spot for a one night stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much!!
Will most likely be back"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Attentive
Thoughtful
Great location
Comfortable bed
Plenty of space
Easy access
I reached out with a question when I arrived and had an answer from Monica in 2 minutes.
I would stay again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Monica’s place was great and was as described. She and her husband Will have stayed at many Airbnb and so took what was best from what they saw and put into their place. A great manual was provided with restaurants and how far to walk (several were within 10 minutes) and things to do. If I’m in La Grande again I will definitely check them out.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at Monica’s 3 other times, but they did not have my last 4 digits of my phone number in the lock code. They said they couldn’t find it, but that is hard to believe. It is an inconvenience to show up and have to contact your host to get another code to get in.
My husband and I have stayed here before, but I don’t think Monica and Will were home because last night it was really noisy upstairs when we were trying to go to sleep. This was after 10 PM. Also, this morning while I was in the bathroom, I could hear people out side the sliding door, and in our shared space downstairs. This was at 6: 30’ish. Pretty early for a Saturday morning. This hasn’t happened in the past, but it felt invasive. Her husband also came downstairs, and when my husband said something to him he was a bit defensive. This place is not a bargain if the hosts are going to be in your space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Monica and Will are very nice people. Space was accommodating and clean. I will return in future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy to find location in the heart of La Grande. Comfy bed, just what I needed for a quick overnight stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a great place to stay. The place was neat and she gave us very clear instructions on check in and check out
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is adorable. The chickens (especially Daphne) are hilarious, the garden is soul soothing, the bed comfortable, the shower has quality products, and the hosts are very responsive. We walked to the restaurant for dinner and felt safe. Totally staying here next time I'm in town!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was very clean and decorated so cute. Loved the aroma therapy! They had everything you needed in the bathroom-very nice shampoos, soaps and lotions. Both Will and Monica were very responsive to questions."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came into town for construction work and the location was great only a few minutes away from the job site and other things to do. Comfortable bed, cats were friendly, privacy was respected, and amenities were nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quaint basement apartment w separate bathroom. Modern and clean. We also enjoyed the hot tub. They offer coffee/tea bar and have farm fresh eggs to steam for breakfast. Definitely worth the stay. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. Lots to see and explore. Fun Saturday Market. Would definitely stay here again. 🤍Loved all the cat decor touches. Thank you again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was quaint. Within walking distance of places to eat and drink. Cozy bed, Netflix available, wifi. Just what I needed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed my stay it was a great location to stay in La Grande.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great overnight stay, quiet and walkable to eateries downtown. We enjoyed the cats hanging out with us, especially Ronald."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"First let me start with something that I missed my fault, if I had known few things no way I would have stayed there.
Not having a microwave does not work for me and just about every air B and B have a microwave.
Cat situation is very bad. There is a difference between cat friendly vs i could not even open the door without that cat just taking off outside. Also I do not like them on my bed. I spent an hour chasing them out of my room and finally had to shut the door.
The shower was the best. I have stayed at air b and b all over and this is my first bad review."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Host was communicative, friendly, and graciously accommodated us on short notice. Accomodations were clean, shower was fantastic. Cat and chickens are a fun bonus! If you are a tall person be aware that the ceiling is very low in the basement."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay at Will and Monicas place! Very nice and clean room! Would definitely stay again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Monica was such an amazing and attentive host making sure that everything was perfect for me before I even got there. I absolutely would stay there again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great room to stay in. Even tho it was a shared space Monica was very respectful of my privacy and communicative. Great value in this stay as well.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was even better than described. Monica and Will are wonderful hosts, and they do all they can (and then some) to make you feel at home. Their kitties even roll out the red carpet and will give you as much or as little interaction you want (I let them know I preferred 'much'). I was very happy with the amenities, cleanliness, and charm. It will be my preferred accommodations any time I visit La Grande."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Monica’s place was very cute and homey! They communicated great and we felt very welcomed, even just for a night. The cats are so friendly :)"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely little place, so conveniently located to main street eateries. The space outside of the bedroom is not completely private which felt a little awkward but was not a problem at all."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Good value.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable bed, large selection of pod coffee, and a hot tub."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monica and Will (and the cats!) were truly warm hosts. Helpful and friendly, they even gave some spot-on recommendations for food and music. The yard is a lot of fun with a few little chickens and the catio - - I enjoyed lounging outside while I did some work from ""home."" Whether you're traveling for work, school or fun, if you are going to La Grande, stay with Will & Monica - you will find a super comfortable stay in the best location in town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a long day of driving in the heat, it was so wonderful to enter into a very cool and peaceful bedroom. Just what I needed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is brilliant - easy walking distance to Safeway and a number of restaurants. the room itself was tidy, clean, and super comfortable.
I really enjoyed my stay.
Thank you, Monica and Will!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was exactly what I needed. I slept well and everything was excellent. Will stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for a quick overnight stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was cute and cool!!! Very homie and quiet. The yard was great and saying good morning to the chickens before walking to the coffee shop was awesome. It was like being on the farm in the middle of downtown! 10/10 would stay a full week at this place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were passing through the area and needed a place to stay just for a night. Monica & Will’s place was perfect, located centrally, and exactly as described. We are cat people so we were excited to meet their 3 cats. Even if you’re not a cat person, they keep the space very clean and the cats keep to themselves. We were happy Ronald came to say hello though! What a gent! The bed was sooo comfy and the a/c was very nice with the summer heat in full force. Would definitely recommend this cozy space! They’re wonderful hosts!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely compact space that was plenty comfortable to lay my head for a night. Loved the fresh eggs & nicely appointed bathroom, along with gracious hosts, the cute cat with bowtie & floofy chickens! Would stay again. Central, walkable location to lots of good stuff & appreciated off street parking."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a decidedly bad airbnb experience in Provo, Utah, Monica's rental was everything we could hope for. A clean, peaceful & comfortable haven to lay our heads, not to mention cute & cozy! You can tell these hosts take your experience very seriously & we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you Monica & hubby!! Linda & Curt."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Monica and Will were great hosts, and their unit was very clean and comfortable. I especially appreciated Will's help in carrying my heavy baggage down at check-in and back up at check-out, since I have back pain.
I didn't realize that their unit does not have a microwave, and I suggested they install one. They're cheap, and guests like me like having one to use.
Their neighborhood seems to be more a commercial area, but it was quiet and seemed safe. Their chickens added a rustic touch, without bothering anyone!
I would recommend their unit, if you don't require a microwave."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool hosts and great space. The chickens and cats are an awesome vibe! friendly clean and comfy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very friendly hosts. Clean space. Walkable to lots of stuff in La Grande.

Communication was easy and frequent, I got to meet both Monica and Will and they’re very nice and friendly, and it was fun seeing the cats and chickens. Definitely recommend whether for a quick overnight or a few days!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I only had a quick one-night stay but we really wish we could have stayed longer!

Would highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed. We will be back. Thank you so much for your hospitality.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place! There were even a couple happy chicken eggs waiting for us on the dresser -- very thoughtful!
Bear in mind it's a basement with low ceilings (I'd guess 6' 3"" high or so), so if you're tall you'll be ducking! It can also get chilly even on hot days but there's plenty of blankets. :)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay. really appreciate the hospitality. Looking forward to future stays.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Monica and William were responsive and accommodating which I really appreciated. The place itself was as described--comfortable and private, and it didn't feel claustrophobic at all. Would definitely return!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Monica and Will were very responsive hosts. We felt privacy was lacking as their laundry room was right next to our bedroom., between the bedroom and the bathroom. We loved the cats who visited us in our room and enjoyed the chickens."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we loved the place!! we stayed there a week and the whole space is perfectly equipped and beautifully decorated with wonderful attention to details. it is listed as a room but it is almost a whole apartment. the hosts use the space outside of the room very little so for the most part u have the whole unit for yourself. they have a beautiful backyard u can use and the location is amazing. right smack in the middle of town. u can walk everywhere and it is still very quiet and peaceful. they have 3 nice cats and one of them was friendly and sweet and welcoming. a perfect host!
Monica and Will were awesome and helpful whenever we had a question and the stay was just great."

Extra perks like the hot tub, robes, coffee/water, private bathroom and fast internet were greatly appreciated! Will was especially thoughtful and kind about allowing us to check in early. He also helped me, in person, with the digital door lock and was quick to respond to messages. Awesome hosts!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were taking a road trip across country and our car's check engine light came on. Not only did our host give us excellent recommendations for mechanics, but they also extended our check out time to 12pm so we could get our car fixed the next day.
The room was cozy, the cat was cute, the town was peaceful, what more could you want?
P.S. - if you have a car with a lower bottom, look out driving the road behind the house to park. Major pot holes, just be aware! Still worth the stay though"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a great stay! I needed a place to stay as I was going to be sitting for a board exam and it was such a quaint stay. Made me feel right at home. Check in was super easy with step by step instructions! Would stay here again. Thank you guys!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful sanctuary. Exactly as advertised. Sweet cats and gracious hosts.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in La Grade and walking distance from the city center. I would’ve enjoyed a little more privacy, the husband worked downstairs and would go up and down from the basement (where we were staying) and upstairs. He was very sweet and helpful but him working downstairs was not initially advertised in the original listing i believe. A very clean house with a comfy bed and walk in shower with 3 very sweet cats and chickens outside which we loved. Would recommend and also would’ve liked to have known the husband would be coming in and out."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy location. We enjoyed the private space, using the hot tub, and also the company of one of the friendly cats. Hosts are extremely responsive, friendly, and descriptive and a great value on place too."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked very last minute in the late afternoon for just that 1 night and received a confirmation right away, which was a relief as my alternative was to get an expensive hotel room. As I was traveling as a female alone, I was hesitant at first to reserve a room in someone’s home, but the positive reviews I read before booking put me at ease and were very accurate. The space was clean and tidy with many appreciated amenities like a kuerig & creamers, hair dryer & shampoos, and even the special touch of 2 fresh eggs from the hosts’ chickens in the morning which I welcomed and took home to make the next morning! I didn’t get the chance to meet the hosts but our communication through Airbnb and their attention to detail was more than enough to make me very comfortable there."

Before too long we were also greeted by two curious cat friends, which is always a welcome surprise.
We grabbed dinner down the street (like 3 blocks away!) at Side A Brewing, which we definitely recommend. Their place is centrally located in town and very convenient. If you don’t mind potential cat visitors, this is a neat place to stay for a couple nights. I wish we had a little more time to stay and explore the area!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Host, great response time! no complaints"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah was thoughtful about stocking her house. I loved the natural cleaning products. the linens were so fresh and luxurious. The cupboard had just the right amount of (cute) dishes, even toddler dishes and silverware. the Keurig bar was loaded and the fridge had 2 types of coffee creamers and the water filter pitcher was full. I loved having two bathrooms too. Layout of the house was nice. I especially loved the back entrance having a place to leave bags and shoes, right next to the huge laundry room. The back patio has a gorgeous apple tree too. I've stayed at a remodeled older airbnb and it was musty smelling. Not this house! it even had an air filter running and an essential oil diffuser."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place - spacious and clean. Enjoyed our stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very impressed with the cleanliness of everything, the instructions for operating the TV and dish washer and washer and dryer, and we could park right at the front door. And the coffee and tea options were extensive. Having two bathrooms was a real plus. We were two couples, but the place could accommodate three. The living room was very large with a big comfy couch. Our beds were super comfy. We even met a neighbor who was super friendly. Another plus was it was on a dead end street in a nice quiet neighborhood. A beautiful sitting place out back under a big apple tree."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a quick turn-around at Sarah's place, just an overnight while passing through. The home was cute and super clean. The kitchen had everything we needed. The home was well represented by the photos, the beds were comfy and our short time there was good."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is away from a lot of drive by traffic. So clean it felt new. The best part was not having a laundry list of things to do at check-out! We would 100% stay at Sarah's again.

Well worth the money!!!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at Sarah’s exceeded expectations. From the photos, description, and reviews, we felt confident that this was going to work well for our group of three couples on a road trip. What was such a delight was the care given in thinking about what guests might need and then it being so thoughtfully presented. The space was roomy, ultra-clean, super comfortable. As we were leaving, some in our party commented, “Can you give a 10 star review?” This is a place that will be remembered as a great beginning to a special trip! Thank you Sarah for all you’ve done to create a space so functional, welcoming, and inspiring."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb is super nice! Spacious, open floor plan made it easy to accommodate four adults + children. Air conditioning was really appreciated as were the fans for each bedroom. Very turnkey accomodations. The location was great for the wedding in Summerville. Sarah was very responsive to my questions. Our only problem was unlocking the front door - it can be a little confusing, but with a little patience we were always able to get in. Super appreciated the washer and dryer and the large bathrooms. The outdoor area was cute - could be a little noisy with the freeway traffic, but nothing a speaker and music couldn't mask. Appreciated all the extra touches like generous shampoo/conditioner/body wash, condiments and of course the coffee bar was most appreciated by both the coffee drinkers and hot cocoa lovers. Thank you for sharing your home!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night in the home and it was perfect! It was clean, comfortable and quiet, with ample parking and such a charming interior. We were not there long enough to really use the kitchen. This house offers much more than others at the same rental price and I would love to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah and Emily have created a wonderful space, thoughtfully put together, inviting and comfortable. Everything you need and easy to find in bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen.

Highly recommend!"

There is lots of room to hang out, comfortable bedrooms, and the house was extremely clean and organized."

We didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb hands down. With 10+ stays across the United States I can say from experience this was our best stay to date! Cute, unassuming house in a small town, but EVERYTHING was top-notch: cleanliness, décor, organization, amenities, comfortability. Our group of 3 adults and 3 children had plenty of room to sleep, bathe, relax, etc. The thoughtfulness of the hosts was evident in all the details of our stay. I almost don't want to write such a glowing review, that might make it harder to get a booking in the future :-)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed at many vacation rentals over the years and this was the first one that felt like I was coming home. Such welcoming decor and furniture.

Thank you,
The Rollins Family"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We loved Sarah’s home. For a family of 5 it was the perfect amount of space. It had an open concept for a fun New Years Eve dinner and game night. It also had a front bedroom that was very private and quiet away from the noisy kids at night. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking every meal which I did, and for a family of 5 it worked out very nicely everyday. Everything was immaculately clean, organized, and she had everything we needed from toiletries to snacks. We will be back to this Airbnb again when we take our annual family ski trip. The discount lift tickets Sarah left for us saved us a lot of money too. We absolutely loved this home! Thank you Sarah! Your an excellent host!"

Sarah clearly paid attention to every detail - we found a fully stocked kitchen (even with coffee and creamer!), full sized shampoo and conditioner in each bathroom plus body wash. The diffuser and essential oils was such a fun touch as was the laundry detergent and extra toothbrushes and toothpaste!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking for another place in La Grande! This place is it!
We were a little weary seeing how close it was to the Hwy, but we didn’t hear a thing!
Everything is so well thought out, from how the room is decorated, coffee/tea/and other kitchen extras, or even all the toiletries in the bathroom. Loved the nightstand outlets too! Thank you for getting the *good* coffee too!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the absolute best house I've stayed in! The pictures already looked amazing but itbwas even better in person. There wasn't a thing we said ""I wish they had such and such"" because anything you need in a house is there. Very clean and a lovely location!"

I can’t say enough about this lovely home. Tastefully decorated, perfectly appointed, roomy and comfortable are you just a few of the many positives about this home. Well stocked kitchen and washrooms. The entire home was spotless.
Excellent and prompt communication from the owner Sarah.
Looking forward to visiting La Grande again and staying in this wonderful home.
Cheers!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Dis place is the best
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sarah's place was so welcoming! Very clean & cozy. The beds were amazing to sleep in and the coffee bar was a nice to wake to. The patio was relaxing and it had enough space for 6 of us to fit! My family and I would definitely return to this place. Thank you Sarah!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the most comfortable places we’ve ever stayed! Sarah was super responsive, even to the littlest concern. She has added charming touches - darling decor, artful touches throughout, & even the dishes & knives reflect her careful choices & eye for style.
The home is SPACIOUS! We had 2 parents & 5 adult children, & we did NOT feel crowded or cramped in the least! We loved the big couch, & especially the gas free-standing stove in the living room! It puts out some heat!!
The beds were super comfy, & bedding was lovely. Lots of extra towels & bedding available.
Soo many extras! Shampoo, toiletries if you’ve forgotten a toothbrush, & even bath salts to soothe sore muscles. The pantry is stocked with Keurig coffees, specialty teas, & enough ingredients to make cookies!
Our only regret was that this was just an overnight stay along our road trip. We’re hoping to come back & enjoy the comforts of Sarah’s home for a few days next time!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Roomy, clean, full of amenities and a place we will be back to. We were in town for a long weekend and came across Sarah’s AirBnB as an option. We had plenty of room and it was perfect for all of us!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house. It’s light and bright, beautifully decorated and comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked, I made a full breakfast and had all the supplies I needed (bought my own food). Beds are comfy and communications with Sarah were quick and easy. Our favorite Airbnb to date!! ❤️"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the cozy aesthetics of this house. Felt like a cottage with all the yummy blankets and lovely linens and special touches that made the home feel extra welcoming. Great place to come home to after a day of skiing and a soak at the Hotlakes Hot Springs. Great value. Will totally stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really wonderful place! There are super little touches that make it awesome. Lots of space to stretch out. The street its on isn't anything to write home about, but whatever, the house and value of it are awesome."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful home and wonderful hosts! Clean, safe, quiet, parking right next to the house... 5 Stars in every way! I'll be back when traveling through again the next time (hopefully it's available!)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah's house was extremely cozy and accommodating. Its very close to the downtown area of La Grande. Its an easy drive to Anthony Lakes and the house has every amenity you would want. Sarah was extremely helpful and our whole group really appreciated the detail that went into making this rental and cozy place to stay for a few days. We plan on staying here again!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Excellent place to stay! Best air bnb we have stayed in. Very clean and comfortable. :) we will definitely stay here next time we travel to La Grand.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place is absolutely wonderful. We were there to see our son perform at the University and it was so nice to feel like we were staying someplace special.
The house itself is decorated so nicely. Peaceful and relaxing. Kitchen had everything we needed plus extra little touches that we hadn't expected. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom had little extras in case we forget anything and the fluffiest of towels!
We had the slightest problem getting into the house but that was because I didn't look through all the check in info properly. When I contacted Sarah for help she answered promptly and got us in. (without once pointing out that she had already sent me the info. Thanks!)
Just a lovely place and one we are hoping to book for other upcoming performances."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This airbnb is of exceptional quality and value. Five adults shared a weekend here and we could not have been more pleased with the accommodations. While the neighborhood is not something to write home about, the house is within walking distance from town, which was important to us. The house is exceptional. The vaulted ceiling of the living room (and dining area) gave such a feeling of spaciousness while the fireplace added coziness. The quality of the furnishings is outstanding, and every inch of the house is tastefully decorated; one has the sense that it was a labor of love for Sarah. We came to ski at Anthony Lakes and appreciated that we could store our gear on the back porch out of our way. The kitchen gave a whole new meaning to ""well-stocked""; there is even an ice cream scoop! We lacked for nothing. From bed linens to bathroom rugs, the aesthetics and quality gives one a pampered feel. We loved staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I want to stay here every time I visit my son in college. This visit was because he had his wisdom teeth taken out. It was so nice to have such a clean, cozy place to take care of him. As comfortable as home. Thank you!"

Heather's communication was quick, friendly, and very accommodating. The location can not be beat...a couple blocks to downtown, a couple blocks to Eastern Oregon University, and 10 minutes to Morgan Lake.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Apt 101 is a spacious two bedroom, two bathroom unit with all the modern amenities of home, which makes it a very comfortable place to stay. There are two large TVs with several movie channels, like NETFLIX, one in the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The kitchen is fully furnished with all the essentials for preparing and serving meals if you plan to cook. Also, there is a combined washer/dryer in the unit. Everything was immaculately clean. And finally, the location is very convenient for easy walking to downtown or strolls through quiet neighborhoods."
