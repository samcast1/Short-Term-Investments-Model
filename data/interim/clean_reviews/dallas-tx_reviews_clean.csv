2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s was great . Just the guy at the front deck was rude when asking about where my room was located. Everything else was fantastic.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location.. Squeaky Clean and Comfy bed. Paul’s place is pristine. As soon as you open the door you will be pleasantly surprised - everything is very new and very clean. The kitchen is fully stocked. The location could not be better- there is a Starbucks and Cava right across the street and whole foods next door. Tons of shopping and the beautiful mall across the street. There is even a Bowl and Barrel on the first floor. 5 min drive to SMU. The reserved parking space in the covered garage is very convenient as well. If Paul’s place is available definitely book it!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very great apartment! All amenities! Paul was very responsive and quick to meet requests! When checking in it did take some time to familiarize myself with area and locate lock box, parking spot etc. might want to check in when you’re not in a rush or during daylight hours also! Besides that all was great!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Paul’s place. We appreciated the detailed check in and parking instructions. Made things so much easier for us. We appreciate the assigned parking spot. The apartment was so comfortable and so clean! The location was perfect as well, not hard to find or to get in. We loved having shops and restaurants near by. We really appreciated the great communication, especially with our conflict with the bedside lamp. The bedside tables are wobbly so you need to be very careful. We accidentally broke their bedside lamp, so we tried to search for the lamps at home goods but no success. We thankfully found them on Amazon and ordered them to replace the one we broke. They were very understanding! But be very careful with the tables! They are very wobbly!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. We came into town for a hokey game. This location is absolutely perfect. It is right across from the stadium. Everything was exactly as pictured and described. The apartment is located near an elevator and is positioned at the end of a hall. The area is nice and quiet. We enjoyed sometime on the patio and even with street traffic it was not loud. Other residents/guests were quiet. We did not hear any noise. Empire Luxury Stay's provided fantastic instructions prior to our arrival. Check in and check out were easy and staff were very nice.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Walked into music playing, fresh clean smelling rooms, bright sunlight coming through the windows and snacks/drinks to greet us! They have everything you need (but I honestly didn’t check out the pots situation since I stayed one night for a concert). The bed was so comfortable. Shower had great pressure! Even took a bubble bath. Nice toilet paper, and that does say a lot for a place. So very very impressed with this place. WILL stay here again when I’m back in Dallas."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location is great. Close to lots of bars/restaurants and very walkable. We had great views of downtown Dallas. It was kept very clean and the host was very communicative. Would definitely stay here again if we’re ever back in Dallas.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable. Slight smoke smell when first entering. Balcony view is great, can hear surrounding music but not loud. Inside is very quiet. Unfortunately check-in time is kind of late; wish there was more flexibility with that. Overall, a good stay especially if going to AAC. Will definitely stay again in the near future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near American Airline Center, and restaurants walking distance. Enjoyed my stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean nice great host
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment! Clean and cozy. We booked this place for an event at American Airlines Center as it was a simple walk across the street. Easy walking distance to several restaurants in the area as well. Would 100% recommend and will stay here again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience. From the moment I walked into the lobby it was five star accommodations. The fitness center was immaculate. They also have an indoor driving range so if your clubs and balls you can use that. I did not get to use the outside pool, but there are plenty of places to sit outside on the roof deck and relax The pictures that are posted are exactly what you get. It is very spacious with a beautiful outdoor deck."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment looks exactly like the photos posted. We appreciated the detailed instructions given to us about how to find the building, checking in, and checking out. The apartment was much cleaner than other airbnbs we have been to, though a few surfaces could use some attention.
The view from the balcony and bedroom window is great! There are good blinds for the windows. We found quite a bit of light filters through the bedroom blind. Eye masks might make you more comfortable.
The location is great for getting to anywhere in Dallas. It helps to be aware of the American Airlines Center schedule to avoid traffic from events.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful apartment! My husband and I went to a concert at American Airlines Center and it was just a few feet away. Clean, beautiful, great host! Everything my husband and I wanted!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location right across the street from AA Center. Restaurants, CVS, and Statbucks within walking distance.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great unit! Perfect location for American Airlines centre!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location - directly across from AA center and walking distance to many bars and restaurants. Gorgeous building with beautiful amenities. My only complaint is the carpet in the bedroom, it’s in need of replacement . They did tell me they are in the process of replacing it with new flooring very soon. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you’re planning on attending an event at AAC.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved everything about the property! It’s right in the heart of downtown Dallas with plenty of good food, bars, and attractions around within walking distance. Everything was clean and easy to find. Overall this location made our stay very enjoyable. Thank you again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Clean and comfy stay!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We were pleased with the unit and plan to try and book it again when in the area.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unit looks exactly as pictured, is in a great location (good bars and restaurants within walking distance), and is extremely safe and secure. I appreciate the fact that you need to check in with the front desk to collect the key fob which is used for elevator access and for entrance into the unit. The parking garage is safe and convenient. The only downside is that the unit faces a lawn so if there’s an event with loud speakers, like there was during the weekend of our stay, it can be loud. The unit was very well decorated but a few items definitely need to be replaced (end tables made of mirrored glass are broken and have sharp edges, and the carpet desperately needs to be replaced as it has large visible stains)."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location is perfect! The view is amazing too!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent a couple of days in Dallas for our anniversary at this perfect high rise apartment. We enjoyed the beautiful view, the safe location and the exceptionally clean and very comfortable space. The community areas in this building went far beyond our expectations as well. We felt like it was home. We loved our time at Empire Luxury Stays and would highly recommend anyone staying here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and very convenient location to the Americans Airlines Center!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very nice, clean and walking distance to bars. The only down fall was the ghetto door/security guy at night time who was disrespectful and foul mouthed!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend. I’ll most def come back. This was the best airbnb I stayed in. There’s a lot of restaurants and bars that are walking distance or a short drive. The host was responsive when questions needed answers. To enter the apartment was easy and not complicated like others. Everything looked just like the pictures shown. :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came across this listing out of pure luck. I needed something last minute & I was not prepared to be this pleased. The view, the city lights, the ease of travel, the ambiance. I loved & appreciated it all."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Was greeted by the friendliest host. Nice, cozy place to getaway."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The bungalow was a perfect birthday retreat. Jim was helpful and responsive. His place is absolutely serene. The nature/landscaping had us feeling far away from the city, yet we were conveniently located when it was time to explore. We will definitely be back, just wish it was slightly less expensive so we could stay 2 nights."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host and accommodation. Great location. Was a fabulous find on here. Shower was best ever. Ideal location for base in Dallas
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was amazing! Jim was an amazing host and I would definitely recommend to others! The feeling of being within nature was the best feeling. Jim made sure to make us feel comfortable and at home!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice secluded space well off the roadway. Came for an event in the city and this place was plenty close enough to make it a short commute but also far enough out of the city to be very quiet and peaceful. The star of the show is of course the superhost “puck”. Jim is very friendly and quickly responsive to any request you may have. Would recommend and would definitely be my first choice should i return to Dallas.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Jim was super responsive and the place was clean and adorable.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim is a wonderful host. The bungalow is seriously so beautiful. It is much closer to their home than you think, so be forewarned about that. Aside from that, Jim is so friendly and attentive.
Thank you for everything (:"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would stay there again if in Dallas :)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was AMAZING! Me and a friend stayed for one night, not long at all and yet we felt very comfortable and at home. Puck the dog was our favorite touch ;) I had some car problems and Jim was so kind in offering help and making adjustments with his lights to help out. It was quaint and peaceful, a great break from the dfw craziness lol. Such a great stay I can’t suggest it enough!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and Jim always gave information about things that are nearby as well as all our questions - thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s bungalow was the perfect little spot for a weekend getaway! It rained while we were there which made sleeping in the loft even more magical! The place was super clean & cozy & very uniquely decorated! Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim was very attentive from the beginning, he described instructions for everything very well. The house was very cute and a nice get away for my husband and I’s anniversary. Not far from downtown Dallas. We would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Jims little Airbnb.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay. There was parking inside the property and it was an easy check in. It was so nicely and interesting decorated inside the cottage and it had everything we needed. We were able to meet Jim and his two dogs. They were all friendly and welcoming. Jim recommended a few places that we loved.
It was 15-20 mins from downtown Dallas. Would definitely recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Jim was very nice and provided lots of information for check in and for our stay. However, the spider webs, dead bugs, and other insects in the unit made us leave earlier than anticipated. For a short notice booking, the place did somewhat provide a place for short rest and the host was very nice and accommodating."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a pretty good place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Jims place. I would definitely recommend this relaxing get away.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I loved the loft (im scared of heights but had fun anyway) 😆 there’s a little pull-out sleeper that you can use if you don’t want to sleep upstairs. I loved all the decor and the shower was REALLY nice. My favorite part was seeing Jim’s dog Puck! 🐶 I’d say that’s the only con. I didn’t see him enough and needed more Puck. If you’re lucky he’ll bless you with his presence. ❤️ It’s a fun cozy little getaway and not a far drive from a lot of cool things.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I visited Dallas, and stayed at Jim's Bungalow, for the solar eclipse. The Bungalow sits on a large, lush property that was the perfect place to view and experience the eclipse energies. We loved the space - with it's eclectic artwork and furnishings, and big covered porch. The location was close to downtown, and areas like the Bishop Arts district. It was a place where we felt comfortable just hanging out, or using as a base to explore the surrounding areas. Jim was friendly, helpful, and was the perfect host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was a fantastic host, very accommodating and flexible, and made our stay wonderful.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a fantastic stay in a beautiful place - only “negative” thing was it was a little tricky figuring out how to get inside and which driveway, and the ladder up to the loft was very narrow and hard to get up and down. But the place was amazing and gorgeous, very clean, and Jim was super nice!!! And the little dog Puck was SO cute and friendly!!"

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most interesting places we stayed at. Some pros and cons. Pros: the BNB is cute and eclectic. The 2nd floor bed was a great idea, the shower is amazing! Getting into the actual guest-house is easy ( just a key ). Cons: getting into the property was a tad burdensome, you have to get out of your car and open and close this 2 door gate, which, even if you leave once, you’re messing with this gate 4 times. Additionally, I feel like the location is disingenuous, it looks like the guest house is more private but you’re literally 2 feet from the main house and 5 feet from the 2nd guest house, we didn’t enjoy being that close to the hosts, just because we like our privacy. Also the bed is a full-size on the 2nd floor, which is small for most couples. 1 critique is a tv would be nice but not a big issue and the listing said no tv. Raymond was friendly and communicated well! Area and Dallas are great! I can’t say I would recommend but we didn’t have a bad time. 3/5"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a gem! Really loved the location. Jim was a great host. We will be back next time we come out to see the grandkids. Thank you Jim
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at Jim’s! The property is so cute, the decor is eclectic and provided an excellent ambiance as well as lots of fun pointing out small hidden things. We were specifically delighted by the bathroom, the door is small at first inspection but hides a beautifully designed and surprisingly spacious full bathroom. Jim greeted us along with his dogs as we arrived, he was extremely friendly and hospitable! If I’m back in the area I’d definitely stay again (:"

It was charming, cozy, and you can tell a lot of love has been put in to it. Jim provides everything you need and more, we were never without during our stay. There were also instructions left on the counter which included tidbits about the property so we were not left wondering at any point. Jim and his pups met us as we arrived and recommended several places for us to enjoy during our stay. We will absolutely be staying again and are looking forward to it!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good communication from Jim, thorough instruction for how to enter the B&B. It was a lovely, cozy little bungalow. It's a bit smaller than I expected, but there is plenty of room all around. He provided coffee, condiments, dishware, dish soap handsoap, bodywash, shampoo, conditioners, towels, and bugspray. we were located in a very nice neighborhood, on a very nice property, only a stone toss from the host's house. It was convenient if we had any issues or questions. Jim was very friendly and attentive. He even invited us out to watch the eclipse with his family! it was a great experience all together, and all our needs were met."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was beautiful, and Jim was an amazing host! This place is so serene and relaxing, yet the location right in the city is so convenient and close to the hustle and bustle. Jim was so kind and easy to talk to, either via messages or seeing him at his house. The dogs are wonderful too! So sweet and adorable. I would highly recommend this place, and we will definitely stay again if we're in this area in the future."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim was very communicative. Me and my girlfriend didn’t get to Jim’s place until 1130 and he came out and greeted us even though it was so late that’s so thoughtful. The place was super clean and super Vibey. We loved it.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very cute and perfect for two guests. It was smaller than I thought but it wasn’t inconvenient. Overall the place was great for us to go in and out and the host was very informative with their clear instructions which I appreciated.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Jim's little bungalow! It was quaint and just what we needed for the night. We drove in for a concert, and the bungalow was just a 15 minute drive from our venue. Everything was clean with a great number of amenities. Jim was very proactive and gave us plenty of time to check in with great instructions on how to find the place and get in. Would definitely return if in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was an awesome host and was very friendly! His pup, Puck, came rightout to greet us and was so excited.
The loft was unique but we decided to sleep on the pullout couch as it was easier to get to and the mattress was just as good, if not even better.
Totally vintage inside was so cool to see the art and how it is decorated.
Such a peaceful environment and this was just what we needed. Thank you Jim!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! Beautifully decorated and designed, felt right at home. Jim is super nice! Great place to stay in Dallas, we spent the evening in downtown and it was a quick Uber ride."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place was great. Close to Bishop Arts neighborhood with many restaurants, small shops, etc. Beds were comfortable, shower was hot, kitchen was well equipped. The A/C had gone out earlier in the day on my check-in day. Jim was extremely proactive in letting me know ahead of time as well as getting a repairman immediately. I arrived while the repairman was still working. Jim met us, explained the situation and even had a fan running to keep the temp as cool as possible. This was at a time when Texas heat was about 105 each day. The A/C was fixed within an hour or so after arrival. The rest of the stay was great! Jim's animals were friendly, very private location and well decorated BNB. I'd recommend to anyone!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was a great host! He is super friendly and communicated with us throughout the entire trip. We really enjoyed our trip, the Airbnb was very clean and it’s at a perfect location! We would definitely stay at this Airbnb again in the future☺️"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! The shower alone makes it worth it, but the entire vibe of the place is cool. Very close to a grocery store and several restaurants. Close to downtown. Over all great BnB!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was awesome, very accommodating. The place was great, felt like home. Close to Downtown and plenty to do. We found great food and had a blast, highly recommend"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely stay here again! Felt right at home from the minute I arrived. Such a perfect location for popping into Dallas as well. Felt peaceful and secluded, but easy access to all the things.
Jim was flexible on check-in and instructions were very helpful as well.
This place is a masterpiece inside, with beautiful art and clean spaces. 100% recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully hidden little getaway in the middle of Dallas! It was somewhat hidden, but Jim sent us very detailed instructions on how to find it so we had no issues. We only stayed one night and we absolutely loved it. Amazing shower and the cutest little loft.
The only small takeback for us was that there were no privacy curtains on the front windows so at night with it dark outside and the lights on inside we felt a bit exposed. However, for the price, this place can't be beaten. Small, cozy, and comfortable.
Definitely recommending it to any and all of our friends who stay in Dallas!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim's place was one of the most unique and charming places I've stayed. It is clear that a lot of care went into designing this bungalow and it was a pleasure to stay here, even for just a night. It was easy to get to and park, very comfortable with very welcome bottled water and coffee, peaceful though still close to many great restaurants. Really good taquerias in the area. Jim was super friendly as were his dogs who we were delighted to see and give some attention to. Definitely recommend Jim's place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was amazing. After driving 16 hours to get to there, he was flexible with us being early. He gave very clear instructions on which house we were going to, where to park, and everything included in our stay. He was there to greet us when we got there, along with his very friendly dogs. He recommended a town about 10 mins away for dinner (303 bar and grill) and breakfast (odd fellas) which were both amazing in a cute area to walk around. The place was beautiful and had everything we needed for our one night stay including wifi, a mini fridge , and even coffee and tea for the morning. The shower was beautifully built and very powerful with soaps included. Everything about our stay was wonderful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim is so nice and friendly. His bungalow was so great, peaceful and it's a good location for me. I was recommended if y'all travel to Dallas."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim was such a wonderful host to us! The doggies were an added plus! The listing is exactly as shared. It felt very peaceful and calm which is exactly what we needed as we were headed to Houston and needed a space to stay in overnight. We will definitely be booking again with Jim for future Dallas visits. Thank you for welcoming us and making us feel at home even with the Texas heat!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the bungalow was lovely. Check-in/out Instructions were clear and reasonable. Everything was clean, comfortable, and just as described. As other reviews mentioned, the only recommendation I have is curtains would be a nice addition for added privacy. The bungalow is not able to been seen from the street or neighbors so we still felt safe and comfortable. Jim was accommodating and allowed for early in check whenever we arrived to town. We up not needing to check in early but we loved that we had the option. Location and neighborhood were excellent as well. I definitely recommend a stay here!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay, very peaceful! Jim was super friendly and responded quickly to questions or requests. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, magical spot in Dallas. For me, the location was ideal. Less than 10 minutes to the Bishop Arts District, which was lovely. Jim was easy to communicate with and the bungalow felt like a well-kept secret respite tucked away in the middle of the city. Absolutely loved my stay and will book again if I’m back in Dallas for work travel."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun stay while I had a class in town. Had everything we needed - extra linens, towels, coffee etc.
Jim was very responsive and gave clear instructions! Would stay again and I recommend trying out!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really a nice and super quiet place in Dallas. I enjoyed it and would definitely return. Jim has everything you need for a great stay and makes it easy. You will need a car for shops, stores etc. Nice neighborhood and he has his own secluded compound that is pretty cool at the top of a hill. Great porch area as well to sit outside which would be great in the fall, winter and spring."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot! We really liked the space, the shower in particular. We ended up sleeping on the pull out, and it was surprisingly comfortable! Would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim’s place was very quite and cute. The ladder loft bed was a little scary at first but it was a neat experience. We didn’t realize there wasn’t a kitchen but that was our fault for not checking. Everything was lovely! Very peaceful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim's place was amazing, great stay!! Thanks Jim!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Got to spend my fiancé’s first day back in the states in this beautiful place. Couldn’t recommend it more!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a sweet guy! Loved this little slice of heaven in Dallas!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim was so friendly upon arrival. The place was so cute and had all the basics we needed. The bed was comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. It was close to the some cute restaurants and it was easy to get to. We would definitely come back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our little stay here in this beautiful bungalow. Every little detail Jim put into this space is so special. I enjoyed relaxing in the loft bed and reading through some of his books. The shower was amazing. It truly was a treat to stay there. We will be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s place was very cute and just as described. We loved the distance it was from everything we did! The entry gate was a bit of a nuisance to get in and out of but did not take away from the stay itself!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this was by far my favorite stay ! the bungalow is stunning and full of beautiful art work . the loft is such a fun spin and I absolutely loved the location
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy, and exactly as described. Despite visiting during a heatwave, the bungalow stayed refreshingly cool. Jim and his dogs were wonder hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time and absolutely loved our stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay! Space was exactly as pictured. We loved it and the neighborhood
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"jim’s place felt like i was staying in a cottage straight out of architectural digest. it was cozy, quiet and quaint. loved having the french doors to open up in the mornings and having the covered outdoor area for dinner while it rained. jim was friendly and responsive and the location was perfect to get to everything i wanted!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful, safe, peaceful spot to rest for the night in the middle of busy Dallas! Jim was easy to communicate with and had everything we needed! Would absolutely stay here again when we come back to Dallas!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so charming. It’s essentially a carriage house next to another back house and behind a main house. Despite being surrounded by other living spaces, it feels remote, private, and peaceful. I absolutely loved it and I wish I could stay here all the time. I love the funky layout and the decorations made it feel very home-y. I hate staying at sterile, cookie-cutter airbnbs so this place felt extra special."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt right at home. Jim’s hospitality was very comforting & he was a super nice guy. His place had all the necessities and more. Definitely would stay again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay with beautiful yard.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at the bungalow and had a wonderful time. The design of the space is perfect for getting some quiet: no television, far from busy roadways, and surrounded by beautiful design and greenery. It was an isolated surprise in the middle of a busy metropolitan area. All in all our stay was wonderful and we will definitely look to book with Jim again if we find our way back out to Dallas."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jim’s place is lovely and cozy! My favorite place to stay in Dallas
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved the place ! Exactly like in the photos if not better! Very peaceful location but close to popular destinations if you do want to go out. Definitely would stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Even better than expected. Thank you for hosting us Jim you have a beautiful home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit staying at Jim’s bungalow and would definitely stay again. Accommodations were exactly as listed and it was a peaceful and serene place to unwind after busy days of exploring the city. Jim was so friendly (his pups too) kept open communication when needed and made check in/out a breeze. I highly recommend staying here during your next visit to Dallas!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place! Jim was very nice and helpful! Will definitely be coming back for my next stay in Dallas!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little bungalow near the bishop arts district! Very cute inside, eclectic and peaceful. We slept in the pullout couch since the loft was a little high for us. I was excited to stay here, would definitely come back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the bungalow, so peaceful and beautifully decorated. We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in Dallas!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, private-feeling space with thoughtful accommodation by the host and two wonderful dogs. Great for cooking (we didn’t but I assume) & impromptu dancing downstairs, comfortable, spacious sleeping upstairs (if you’re daring enough to brave the heights), & tea in the garden or on the porch if it’s raining. Great proximity to Bishop Arts as well. We’re eager to return!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim’s space was very quaint and quiet. Only stayed for one night but the area was nice and close to the Bishop Arts District. Lots of artwork and books which was a nice touch. There is no TV, which I actually appreciated since I’ve been trying to unplug more. Neighborhood felt very safe. Communication was excellent and he even let us check in an hour early since we had an early flight the next morning. Only thing that would make this property even better than it already is, would be some small curtains in front of the main doors. We didn’t mind at all, but just something to note if privacy is something you value in your stay. Overall, location was tucked back away from road, check in was seamless, and the space was amazing. Will stay again when we’re back in the area! Thanks again Jim"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Stay!
Absolutely loved the Airbnb, the location is beautiful & the owner of the location was so nice & very helpful. I would definitely stay here again when I’m back in town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim’s Loft was a peaceful sanctuary for me to hunker down and get tons of work done after a 2-day meeting in Dallas. His property sits in secluded, wooded suburbs. It’s a green haven away from the city’s hustle & bustle, but still in Dallas proper. The place has so much rustic charm & character! I sat on the covered patio almost the entire time sipping coffee, or wine.. There are comfy lawn chairs too. Sweet dogs and cats came to visit me too! :) Jim could not be nicer - He even offered to scoop groceries for me / invited us to dinner! We headed on to Austin for the weekend but Jim’s place was still the highlight of my trip. I was a little afraid of climbing up to the loft, but it is secure as can be (plus, the couch/pull-out are always down below if you need). I know where I’m staying if I find myself in Dallas again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best host! Beautiful location and space felt at home. Would definitely recommend and stay here again in the future.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We missed the entrance the first drive by but overall the guesthouse was beautifully decorated and such a nice retreat. It was a little bit farther from most of what we planned to do but it wasn’t hard to navigate anywhere.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing property. Secluded, but easily accessible to the metroplex. I WILL be coming back"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this stay! We STAN Jim so nice and his dogs are wonderful. The only thing I will note: If you are 200+ lbs like me and/or have any fear of heights the loft may not be for you but the sofa pull out was plenty for me and my partner.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim’s home is lovely and has already you need for a comfortable stay. The guesthouse is well located and provided easy access to Dallas Love Airport where I was leaving the next day. Jim was responsive, welcoming and incredibly warm. I wish I could’ve stayed longer."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The instructions were very clear and easy to follow, parking and check in were easy, and the Airbnb was extremely cute and clean! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you've stayed in many small houses, many AirBnBs, then know that this one is unique. This space is special. The build is spectacular. Everything is of the best quality from the ceilings to walls to the cabinetry to the shower. This is not a home assembled in a hurry to generate some income but rather a labor of love.
My favorite features are the outdoor space, the doors (especially the vintage Dutch door), the fixtures, the built in bookcase in the loft.
I was inspired.
And Jim is cool too."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is a mini getaway from the city without having to actually leave the city. Host was super responsive and gave clear instructions. Would stay again if I’m ever in Dallas!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was accessible to many parts of the city, and we loved the vibe! It was the perfect size for the two of us and the shower was fantastic! This was such a fun, unique stay, and I'd be happy to come back in the future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little place. Charming and cozy. Great host

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Darling little bungalow! Way better than any hotel.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place is amazingly beautiful and Jim is very helpful and descriptive of everything you'd need to know about the house. I even left an earring and he's going to mail it to me. thank you! we loved it!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome stay at Jim’s place! Such unique and lovely decor. Jim was very friendly. Would stay there again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay when visiting the Dallas area. A short drive from the Bishop Arts District and about 15 minutes from downtown. Jim is a very friendly host, and the property is peaceful. The cute dogs were a plus!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was a great place to stay! Not in the midst of all the bustle of the city, but not too far from it. It was a peaceful place to return to at the end of the day after going into the city for things to do.
Jim was a great host, and never hesitated to answer any questions we had for local recommendations. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim never disappoints! He is the absolute sweetest and we will continue to stay with him if we ever go back to Dallas!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment / cabin was super cozy. Everything was perfect. It felt very homey. I have absolutely nothing bad to say. We made the reservation last minute and Jim was quick to let us know how to get in. The kitchen is super cute. It felt just like that little cabin in the movie ''The Holiday''. Wish we would’ve stayed for more than a night. 10 / 10 :)
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was amazing to stay at and we loved everything about it! The neighborhood is up and coming and what can be best described as gunshots went off in the middle of the night. They have gates to the entrance which keeps cars from driving up the driveway unless it is your own!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim's place was the best little getaway vacation spot! The bungalow is a great place to rest your head while exploring Dallas. Everything was as described and the bungalow had a very cozy vibe. Thank you for the great stay Jim!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a fabulous stay. The guest bungalow was so well decorated and comfortable. It was magazine worthy. Communication was excellent and check in was easy. We're trying to come up with an excuse to come back for a longer stay. The sleeping loft takes some courage, but there is also a sleeper sofa downstairs."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a lovely time staying at Jim’s bungalow. He went above and beyond to make my birthday weekend special including putting a birthday banner up! We would definitely stay there again if we come back to Dallas. Would strongly recommend to anyone going to Dallas.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved staying at the Bungalow. I told Jim, the owner of the airbnb, that I had booked this for my husbands birthday, when we got there there was a ‘happy birthday’ sign hung up, it was awesome, very thoughtful. We will definitely come back for a small trip !"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim was great to deal with and his place is off the charts awesome. It is one of the neatest places we have ever stayed. The layout of the place is great! It sits on a large lot with huge trees. The neighborhood is beautiful, but when your there, it feels like there is nothing else around. There is private parking, you couldn't even see our car from the street. The property is fenced as well, so I never had to worry about that. The Bungalow itself, has this amazing front porch that I wish we had had time to drink coffee on. The lofted bedroom is really cool too, but the ladder might not be for everybody. I would come back again for the shower alone! Even though it is small, so much thought and time has gone into every detail from design to decoration. There are several good restaurants a short uber away. I can't say enough about it and we would love to come back again some time. Thanks, Jim!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay! Jim was helpful and kind. Wish I could have stayed longer!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay! Jim was such a gracious host and his communication was excellent.

Thank you Jim!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jim was awesome! Super responsive and kind and made sure to come say hello once I arrived :) He was very flexible when I needed an extra spot for my husband's car and made sure we had some fun Christmas music on outside on the patio when we were relaxing outside. The space itself is LOVELY, cozy and curated. I am partial to Jim's snowman painting in the kitchen from when he was younger :) We would recommend this lil hideaway to anyone!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at about 50 AirBnBs now, and this was one of the best. Jim's property and bungalow were very cozy and quiet, but also only five miles southwest of downtown. Jim was also very friendly and helpful.
I'd highly recommend staying here, and hope to return."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice but could certainly use some upgrades. Almost tripped over carpet in the hallway. The room had poor ventilation. Their was lots of condensation in the room and clothes felt damp each morning when getting dressed.
ACCESS: Also, the Key pads were very temperamental and challenging to use. They never worked on the first attempt to enter the elevator or the room. ACCOMMENDATIONS: The room only had one set of towels when clearly the reservation was stated for 2 guest. Requested ice to the room several times during my stay they brought it in a little bag and not the ice bucket. The staff was not always friendly reporting poor accommodations. PARKING: There was no control over who parked in the handicap parking. So had to park in other parks because all handicap had been taken. I was also concerned that the room had two SPEAKERS in the ceiling. I felt as if some one was listening. I EXPECT compensation for these poor amenities.
The Host was no help at all>>"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Would consider returning.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hotel if you want to drop your stuff off and explore the DFW area or spend the day at the hotel and explore the amenities they offer.

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a good stay but be sure to read over their policies especially if you’re bringing a pet. I didn’t do that and ended up spending way more than expected. Also you pay all that money for breakfast to be 20$ is a little insane to me but yeah overall was a decent stay, might not stay again though."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"nice space for the price!

nice friendly service at the bar!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Dallas for a wedding and Le Meridian was a great choice for my stay.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was short but Sweet. I arrived in Dallas on time. I reached out about early check in and the host was very responsive and informative.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great only thing I would suggest is that the women at the front desk be more clear on things and kinda loose the attitude. The parking instructions was very on clear. And also didn’t have a privacy sign for my room. But other than that I would come back again

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’m definitely coming back again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nice room!"
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would first like to start off by saying it is a beautiful hotel. I had no issue with the host . I had an issue with the hotel staffing as far as payment when I booked through Airbnb, which was weeks ahead of time I paid the price of 396 for my room for two days, we were told there was going to be a $75 holding fee just for any damages very understandable . We had no issue with paying that what we did have an issue with is being charged an extra fee of $250 when we left the room in perfect condition and because the payment wasn’t taken out until later mind you, we had already paid for this room weeks in advance when we tried to dispute our case we were told the charges were reversed but it is also Sunday none of the banks are open ! Mind you we are on vacation this was money for miscellaneous fees we had to pay with the airport . If we didn’t have extra money we wouldn’t be able to make it home . They didn’t offer any type of different compensation and further they didn’t even care"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So nice to land in a clean and comfortable place!

Parking was 20 dollars a night but parking seems a little ridiculous everywhere in Dallas. The host and everyone was very nice. Unfortunately I went to the wrong location for the hotel at first and the clerk at the other location was not very nice. However the Valet Manny was super sweet.

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in restriction for the main guest to be the guest that checks in was a little annoying it was my birthday trip and my friends were trying to surprise me luckily the safe at the location was able to make an exception.
Room was clean but had a very sewage like smell that came from the bathroom. We did everything to get rid of the smell but it might something to do with the plumbing.
Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. They always cleaned the room
Half way through my stay, something hit the building and we lost power for almost a whole day. Because it was my actual birth day day I had booked another room at a different location to be comfortable and able to actually get ready for the night festivities.
Even with all of that. No one notified me on what happened. The lobby had a horrible smell, almost gas like. No additional accommodations were offered. I didn’t even know what was going on. I had to go to the reception desk to ask because I woke up to no power in the room."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"best value for your money, I would definitely stay again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came here for our anniversary and it was such an incredible spot! 2 minute walk to the Galleria can’t be beat! It was clean, modern, and in my opinion a steal of a deal! We loved staying here, and will definitely stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely hotel across the street from the Macy's entrance to the Galleria. Nice hotel bar and the breakfast buffet was nice. Only complaints - I wish there had been a top sheet on the bed, not just a duvet. Pillows and mattress were not comfortable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staff was very friendly and bar tender was very outstanding and their food was delicious, especially their breakfast buffet"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greetings Fellow Travelers,
This space is located within the hotel. It is clean, and the setup is nice for two. I love the bathroom, and the procided toiletries were indeed all culture friendly from our summation. The front desk ladies were very nice as well as fellow patrons even the Washington fans (smile!). Considering it was Thanksgiving affectionately known to us as Football Appreciation Day sprinkled with Mac n Cheese, the restaurant was open, active, and lively after our polite thrashing of the Commanders. The 2nd game was on, and the bartender and chef were on overdrive, but doing it excellently! The food was great! Drinks were great, and again, great service! Lastly, this location is a bit of a drive to The Entertainment District and sports complexes, but worth it bc around there can be a bit loud at the hotels. The host was responsive as we sought out eating spots and his recommendations included the hotel restaurant as well.
Thanks!
A Cowboys Lady in a Bears World"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exellent

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,5 beam
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I was unaware that this was a hotel. The description stated entire rental unit and still posted under house rules. It wasn’t until I saw check in at the front desk that I realized it was a hotel. Although it was a fine stay, some guests were very loud in their rooms. This is the reason I prefer a house through air b n b. The description should have disclosed it was a hotel."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Le Meridien was a very nice stay. Check in/check out went very smooth. Le Meridien accommodated all my needs and more. I definitely recommend booking this place for your stay & I will be booking again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! The check in process was a little difficult due to the way the hotel keeps track of the Airbnb bookings but they gave us free breakfast for this. I would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay the Le Meridien. Hotel staff was very kind and accommodating for early check in although I did not accept it. Only thing off setting for me was that my junior suite did not have a microwave but it did have a mini fridge. If I had the two together it would’ve been the perfect stay. Other than no complaints and I would stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice Marriott hotel and booking through Airbnb brought the price down.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So glad I went ahead with this booking. I stayed here with my parents for a short trip together, and it was such a lovely oasis for us. The beautiful design is what drew me in, and the place is really as good as it looks, if that makes sense. The shower was luxurious and there were plenty of amenities (towels, nice shampoo/conditioner/soap, kitchen stuff). Jamie was communicative and kind, and if I'm ever back in Dallas, I definitely want to stay here again. I'd never really been to the city, and my parents, who are DFW natives, were delighted to experience Oak Cliff, a neighborhood that they hadn't really known when they grew up there. The only thing I wish we'd known about or been able to plan around was the pool/yard workers who came by during the short 1-2 hour window we had to swim and relax during our stay, cutting our time by the pool short."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our favorite place to stay, its quiet, beautiful and confortable!"

Every detail was carefully thought out, making it feel like a true home away from home. The only downside was that the pool lights weren't functioning during our stay, but it didn't detract from the overall wonderful experience. Thank you for providing such a lovely space for us to enjoy!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute cozy place in a great area - close to good eats and cool shops. Enjoyed our time there.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie was an amazing host who proactively checked in. Their home is beautiful and walking past their stunning backyard towards the Airbnb felt like walking to a private lake house. Everything was very clean! For future guests I’d advise not to bring heavy luggage as the Airbnb is a walk upstairs. Though there was a hot tub and pool, It was way too cold and windy during our trip for a dip in the hot tub. This amenity would be lovely during warmer months :))"

During the hot days we were there, we took a refreshing dip in the beautiful pool most evenings. Their backyard is gorgeous with huge trees, sitting areas, and lots of plants. Even in the heat, the shady, tree-lined streets made it possible to walk to some of the nearby stores and restaurants. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we're in the area."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The outdoor space steals the show! These guys have a beautiful eye for design and comfort. The pool was amazing for those really hot summer days! We struggled with Texas rainstorms so we didn’t get to enjoy the balcony or pool as much as we had liked but would 100% come again for another stay. They have 2 beautiful dogs and 2 sweet ducks but they have designated areas away from guests! The inside was comfortable and cozy. Loved the bathroom and the couch was great!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hospitality at it's finest! We had a fantastic stay at Jamie and Larry's. The place was even more amazing than the photos and access couldn't have gone smoother.

We can't wait to come back in a few months.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Larry and Jamie's place. It was just as lovely as the first time! Really the perfect place for travelers wanting two bedrooms; the bedrooms are identical, with super cozy beds and just the right amount of space, hangers, etc. for a short stay. This is also an especially nice place for women travelers, as it's enclosed in the backyard of Jamie and Larry's place and feels so safe and private. Working during the day in the cozy living room is nice because you're surrounded by treetops in a light and airy space. Highly recommend!"

Maybe in the summer when it's warmer to use the pool :) Jamie and Larry were helpful from beginning to end - always responsive and there to help. The beds and linens were so comfortable and the blankets next to the couch were a nice touch. Everything we needed was there! It was so relaxing to hear the birds outside in the morning from the balcony. The hot tub was our favorite part - 10/10!!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I didn't want to leave! Linens are outstanding. Tons of towels, blankets, bath robes. Jamie really has thought of everything."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Larry and Jamie's place. It is incredibly peaceful and cozy - and super safe for women travelers, since it's an upstairs space located in the (gorgeous) backyard of their home. The beds and couch were super comfortable, and everything was super clean. It's also nice that the bedrooms were exactly the same - no deciding who gets the ""better"" room!
Perhaps the best part of this place, however, is the remarkable use of a small space and the gorgeous design. Easily walkable to the restaurants and stores in the absolutely charming Bishop Arts district. Highly recommend!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry & Jamie's AirBnB is a perfect place to stay. They go over and beyond to make your stay a great one.

We highly recommend staying there and we will definitely stay again!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To say this place is incredible is an understatement.
THE PLACE: absolutely wish I could live here. It’s decorated in such a cool way and clean. The backyard is beyond beautiful and peaceful. Absolutely loved Gary and Goose the resident ducks and was happy I got to see them as was my hope.
AMENITIES:
I was even totally saved when I forgot my curling iron and hair dryer at home..they had BOTH! The shower was AMAZING (as was the style of the bathroom). And the coffee that was provided delicious! I didn’t wind up using the kitchenette very much but good set up for sure. I had hoped to use the pool more but it was in the 40s/50s I did hop in my last morning and it was clean and wonderful! Sad I didn’t get to swim with the ducks though!
HOSTS:
Super communicative, nice, and helpful hosts!
AREA:
Beautiful area. I even went for a morning jog once by myself and felt incredibly safe. Five minute drive or $6 Lyft to Bishop Arts. We ate at some of the restaurants there and went to some cool coffee shops!
I have negative zero complaints even though it rained most of my stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic AirBnB. One of the best I've ever stayed in.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,This was such a beautiful place! Amazing location. Stunning property! And Jamie and Larry are two of the best ppl I have had the pleasure of meeting. It is a smaller apartment so be aware of that for a long stay. But other than that it is exquisite!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Smooth and easy check-in! Gorgeous property with lots of style and character. The beds were so comfortable. Thank you for a great and easy stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! 2 days at this place is just not enough!!!!!!! I even looked to see if the next few days were available to book an extra night because I was not ready to leave! We had activities planned both days and all I wanted to do was stay at the Airbnb!! This place and hosts are amazing, it is so evident that they put so much time and work into their home and you can see it every which way you look. I don’t have a single complaint, everything was perfect. 10/10"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a solid Dallas location, this is it, just outside of downtown Dallas, the pool is wonderful, the place is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, the beds were super comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in Dallas."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a hidden gem! Super dreamy decor and a perfect size. Loved staying at this guest house!!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at this Airbnb. It’s as beautiful as the pictures and the bed and couch were comfortable. The location was great too, super close to the Bishop Arts district where we got great coffee every day and central enough to everything else we had to do in Dallas. The hosts were really responsive to our messages and able to provide everything we asked for and the guesthouse had lots of privacy. We were lucky and was able to catch a glimpse of Gary the duck swimming in the pool!"
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were unable to use the hot tub & the house gets really hot , the ac provided doesn’t cool down the house enough so the rooms stay hot . Other than that the house was very clean & very well decorated and the yard is a vibe !"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great outdoor seating. Cozy.

We definitely look forward to another visit."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is designed meticulously providing a wonderful escape from reality. Though the pool is cold during the winter and spring months, the hot tub is the perfect place to sit back and relax, especially when you can chat with the ducks! The space has everything you need though the shower temperature wasn’t very consistent and hard to control (sometimes it was scalding hot, other times the water came straight from the glaciers). Overall, I would recommend for someone looking for a calm getaway. Recommend renting a car to explore the Bishop Arts Districts as the streets of Dallas aren’t built for walking."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home! A perfect weekend getaway and we loved exploring the area. Hot tub had perfectly hot water, perfect for a cool evening."

They were very accommodating and if/when I had a question, they were fast at getting back to me. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the stay you'll reminisce about when you're old and gray. You won't want to ever go to sleep because shutting your eyes and wasting one moment not taking in the beauty will nearly be unimaginable!! BUT waking up to don your bougie robe and sip your Nespresso coffee in a pottery mug while you overlook the stunning pool and gardens will be the awaiting you in the morning! Your time will be some of the most restful, serene days you can imagine! You'll find yourself wondering how you got so lucky to stay at an oasis like this! Happy tears are a guarantee. :) The location is perfect and central to everything, and Jamie & Larry are truly the kindest souls!! One morning my car battery even died and Larry was outside within seconds, saving me a lofty AAA bill by jumping my car! Who does that?!! Hosts like Jamie and Larry. You'll be dreaming of your next trip back from the moment you set foot on the property and will be missing the sound of birds chirping from the moment you have to leave and go home. While I'm fortunate to have traveled to many wonderful places over the years, this one will always be a standout! Take this as your sign if you're on the fence... book, book, book! And add a few extra days to your trip while you're at it because you'll be glad you did. :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect little Dallas getaway. We were obsessed with this place. A must stay if you want be in the bishop arts area
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place to stay! Loved the style and open space. Location to bishop arts is amazing too. Added bonus of having access to the hot tub. We had a hot water issue with the shower and Jamie and Larry were on it right away. The tankless water heater does run icy cold after a few mins of hot showering which is not the most comfortable experience. Overall, would recommend staying here a few nights when in Dallas. Lovely place with adorable ducks 🦆 🦆"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This AirBnB is absolutely beautiful. The decor and furnishings were stunning. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. I would recommend & have already recommended this place to my family + friends. Jamie and Larry were easy to work with and very nice.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Home Away From Home
Jamie and Larry were AH MAZING hosts ,
They are kind, generous and beyond brimming with southern charm.
The space is chic , exactly as shown .
I enjoyed our stay immensely, so much so I extended my reservation twice more .
Had I known , I would have booked my entire stay there and been quite comfortable :)
Thank fully this stay restored my faith in what air B and B is or was . Yes it’s a business , but it is guests staying with you choosing the option of both interaction , and the comforts of home which are often absent in a hotel setting .
We’ve been through a storm together (Literally ) a little Dallas ice never dampened our stay. .
It truly felt , like they were old friends and that we were welcome. They are generous kind people , who “genuinely care” that you have the best stay, your comforts matter.
They should be super hosts !
There isn’t one thing I could say that could have made this stay any better - super grateful to have met and stayed with them .
Ps they have ducks ?! Love!!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. We stayed here and biked around the city so the size of the place and the quality was great. Wish I could’ve spent even more time in the yard it was very nice and the pool/hot tub are great.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place to chill and relax. Less than 5 minute drive to restaurants and shops in Bishop Arts.

Would absolutely recommend this adorable place to anyone looking for a comfortable & inviting place near the bishop arts district!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here and would definitely recommend and return!! It was walking distance or a short Uber ride from the cutest shops and restaurants in Dallas. The place itself was clean and stylish we felt extra comfortable and treated during our stay. The outdoor area and pool were a dream. Jamie and Larry went above and beyond for us.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great stay with Jamie and Larry. You won’t be disappointed if you decide to stay with them.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie and Larry’s place was amazing. It was comfortable and designed beautifully. I loved the decor and the ambiance. My husband, brother, and I were in town to visit family and their place provided a nice spot to rest in between traveling out to see family. Jamie and Larry were very helpful and went out of their way to make sure we had a good stay. They provided little amenities like coffee and snacks. The pool was lovely and perfect to relax in. We would definitely stay again next time we’re in Dallas and I recommend their place to anyone who is considering it.
There are tons of cute restaurants nearby and places for coffee. Overall it was a phenomenal stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home near the Bishop Arts District. Jamie + Larry went above and beyond helping us locate a few items we needed throughout our stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what you would expect. Excellent choice for a relaxing stay.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very cute and I can imagine it is very good to stay for just a night. We stayed for 3 days and felt it was a bit cramped towards the end.
When we arrived we noticed some dust and hair on the floor, and noticed that the space is actually much smaller then it appears in the photos. It is more of an above detached garage loft.
The area of town was not convenient for our needs, but thr house itself was very well kept and felt like a luxury property.
The fact you have to ask to use the pool is understandable, but inconvenient that they need advanced notice as the few times we had a second to jump in the pool it was very last minute and something we could not have planned.
The two ducks and two dogs who you will see in the backyard were honestly the highlight of this, they are all so cute.
The shower in the bathroom has very odd water pressure, the the temperature varies from cold to very hot without you touching anything.
Be warned if you are a hot sleeper, there is only one ac unit in the entire place in the living room, and never enough cool air reached my bedroom. You have to keep the doors open all night if you don’t want it to turn into a hot muggy room.
Also, I understand this is an air bnb not a hotel, but having to take the sheets off the bed and put them in a bag is terribly inconvenient and the last thing I want to do first thing in the morning."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are not enough words to describe how great this place was. There home is gorgeously designed and they have so many unique features that you wouldn’t expect. From beautiful pool and jacuzzi, to pet ducks even down to just the overall beautiful design of their home. The location was 10-15min drive from the downtown and uptown areas where the big city is. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back again."
2021-07-01,5.0,,"The guest house and grounds are such an amazing, serene, peaceful place. The interior is decorated in natural elements that bring the outside in for a relaxing stay. The outdoor space is thoughtfully and lovingly planned out to give you the feel that you are vacationing abroad with nature. Location is perfect...far enough away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to enjoy the Bishop Art District and downtown Dallas. Will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was gorgeous. Absolutely stunning backyard. The suite itself is tastefully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. Plenty of pillows and blankets. We really enjoyed the shower with the sun streaming in through the sky light (no privacy issues, just wonderful natural light). The hosts provided us with relevant information prior to our check in and were available via text/airbnb app anytime I had a question. Super simple check in. I love that they did not hover and we (my family) were all able to hang out in the pool one morning without feeling as though we were intruding in someone's sanctuary. I'm definitely planning to be back for a girls trip next spring."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is vibes! Loved our stay — everything was clean and so on trend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wowza is this place perfect for a relaxing time in Dallas. It truly feels like a tropical oasis, and Jamie and Larry are delightful hosts.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal place to stay! Jamie and Larry have made an oasis of their backyard and the guesthouse was a amazing place to come back to after a day of exploring Dallas. My wife and I enjoyed a rejuvenating trip relaxing in the pool or reading on the pool deck. If we are ever in Dallas again, this is the place we will stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying at the guesthouse. The pool was so lovely as was the company of the two resident ducks! The pool and hot tub were certainly the highlight of the space. And the hosts were very responsive and kind. We’d love to return sometime!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are considering a stay here I couldn’t recommend it more!! It was just me and my partner staying so we only had to use one of the rooms but it was such an amazing and peaceful experience. The only negative I can imagine is knowing I can’t return to a home as beautiful as theirs now haha!!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! My sorority sisters and I stayed here for a retreat. The backyard was the perfect place to hangout and have a picnic.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is beautiful! We are from Chicago and enjoyed this backyard oasis. The inside is designed beautifully and has everything you could possibly need. Jamie and Larry were very helpful. The tv broke our 2nd day there and my husband wanted to watch the March Madness basketball games, so they went out of their way to buy a new tv and set it up for us that night. We will be staying here again for our next Dallas visit!"

I was amazed at how much thought was put into this AirBNB, from the decor to the stocked kitchenette to the board games and even a little ambiance noise machine on the nightstand! The beds were also super comfy. I loved being able to relax poolside each morning with a Nespresso, and hang out with Gary and Goose, the resident ducks! Jamie was super nice and was very responsive on text every time I had a question. It's clear that Jamie and Larry have a great eye for interior design, and are top tier hosts. We will for sure be back soon!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what I needed - a stylish getaway during the election with places to lounge and relax.
The owners’ are so gifted in design that I felt like I was staying in a place straight out of the pages of a magazine - which makes sense due to their line of work. Everything was thoughtfully created and beautifully put together.
This is a great gem in the middle of DFW’s hustle and bustle."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! What a gorgeous and pristinely designed home and an OASIS in the middle of the city. We didn’t want to leave, we enjoyed ourselves so much. Check in and out was seamless and everything we needed was at our fingertips. We loved the super long and comfy sectional couch so we had ample room to spread out. We ate breakfast on the patio and relaxed in the comfy robes provided. The kitchenette was super cute and had all the basics- utensils, creamer, even non dairy creamer which was much appreciated!
The backyard/garden/oasis-or paradise, as we called it, was so wonderful. We spent the entire day swimming and then relaxed in the hot tub in the evening. We even took a page out of a fellow reviewer’s book and did morning yoga on the grassy area.
All of the thoughtful touches really make a difference. From the warm, welcoming scent of incense as you arrive, to the outdoor shower complete with ACV shampoo and conditioner so you can rinse the chlorine out of your hair, to the recommendations for local exploration-Jamie and Larry have thought of everything! Definitely stay here, but not too long, we want to come back! :-)"

They hosts were phenomenal and the apartment and backyard felt like I was walking into a magazine. It was so peaceful and relaxing. It felt like we were on a retreat. When we walked they had rainforest music playing on a sound machine and we kept it on all weekend to continue to feel that relaxing peaceful feel. Their welcome book was filled with all the information you needed to know and they communicated with us well before and during our stay.
Check in was the most simple checkin. I was skeptical of staying in someone’s backyard at first, but it was no problem at all. They were respectful of our space and time there.
This was the best vacation we’ve had in a long time and we can’t WAIT to come back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the guesthouse for a little getaway and had a wonderful time. We live nearby in Oak Cliff but the place was perfect for a short staycation to make us feel as if we had gotten out of town! The decor is minimal, artful and soothing and the backyard is a calming oasis wish lush plantings. The pool is perfect. Getting to visit with the resident animals was a huge bonus as well! We hope to return for another relaxing stay!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect quick getaway — especially during covid. We had a ladies trip here for a birthday and barely needed to leave the house. The hosts were wonderful and I felt like I was staying in a magazine, but without the fussiness. The photos of the outdoor space don’t do it justice either.
I hope to be back.
Tip: I didn’t catch that it was a mini fridge and brought lots of groceries to avoid the stores. If you do the same, you may want to bring an ice chest."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was pretty awesome. It had everything we needed for a few stress - free days.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for us to stay for 2 nights during the April 2024 eclipse. The inside is light and airy with a beautiful design. I really liked the courtyard you walk through to get to the stay, it makes you feel like you step into a new place. We walked down to the Bishop Arts District daily for coffee, breakfast, and dinner. It’s a really nice neighborhood to walk through and it’s home to maaaany cats which I loved. Alexa and Joshua were very understanding and helpful when we wanted to leave our luggage at the room before check-in. Overall this was great for a short stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space with super comfortable bedding. Easy access to downtown Dallas and close to shopping, nice restaurants, wine shops, coffee shops and pubs. Overall, it's a perfect getaway spot near the city. Only concern was the stairs leading to the unit. Unless I missed it, the stairs are not mentioned in the description. My husband is recovering from recent injuries. We managed, however if we had booked a few months ago it would have been nearly impossible for him to get to the unit."

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Location was good, and the home was well decorated. However, unfortunately the bed sheets and bath towels had a VERY strong fabric softener smell, which my wife cannot stand. It is beyond me why AirBnB’s are still using artificial fragrances and forcing people to sleep on bedding that leaves them smelling like a fake scent for days afterwards. For everyone’s safety, PLEASE stop with all of the artificial smells!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! It is a nice location for you and a partner to relax and get away from the world. The courtyard was phenomenal and was very peaceful. The place was spotless when we arrived and the furniture was very comfortable.

I would love to stay here again for work or leisure A+ stay."

It's so tranquil and gorgeous with greeneries all around, smartly and thoughtfully designed with windows framing all the treetops in the yard. The place is comfortable with peaceful surrounding-- I could do a Zoom meeting uninterruptedly! The AC works superbly in the Texas heat (107F), the water pressure is nice, and the internet is fast.
Alexandra is a thoughtful and responsive host. I had everything I asked for and more! There are great books and indoor plants to compliment the space (I took the liberty to water the plants too :)) Will definitely come back when the weather is much cooler to sit in the garden. Thanks for being such a superhost, Alexandra!"

Would definitely stay there again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Next time I'm in Dallas, I know exactly where I'm staying. Alexandra's place is an enclave of elegance; think spa resort vibes with the comforts of home. The attention to detail? Spot on. From the artwork to the mood lighting to the linens, everything was curated to perfection. The fridge stocked with bevvies was a delightful touch.
Alexandra and her partner were there when I needed 'em, always ready to help. Such a sweet couple; I wish I had gotten to know them better! Their best-ever recs for things to do, especially in the Bishop Arts District (a quick 5-min drive away) compelled me to envision a life for myself here. Rarely am I that enamored with an area (or an Airbnb)!
Leaving felt like saying goodbye to an old friend. It wasn't just a stay; it was an experience. Rejuvenating, cozy, and right near the action. Book it."

We especially loved the airy ceilings and big windows, the serene courtyard area where we spent several hours on a beautiful afternoon, and the shower - it was perfect. The bed was comfy and I appreciated the linen sheets like we have at home. Host was quick to answer questions. The location was ideal. We decided to get Ubers and Lyfts just to make it stress-free, but honestly we were in walking distance of most places we went.

Everything was just as pictured and felt cozy but not claustrophobic. It rained some during our stay so we only got to use the backyard area once but it was a great private area to relax. The kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed to cook some of our meals. The bed was super comfortable, the shower was amazing, and all the natural light made it super relaxing.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Such a cute and absolutely well-designed studio that you’d be mistaken not to book. We came for the Tulane Cotton Bowl game (Roll Wave), and the location was just a short drive to AT&T but still allowed us to explore parts of Dallas too. Area is fairly residential but still offers nearby grocery stores and shops/restaurants. Honestly, if you told me that no one had stayed at the Airbnb before me, I might believe you because it was spotless, and I mean that with the highest praise; rentals can often feel like you still see the remnants of those that stayed before you, but that is NOT the case here! Every nook and cranny was extremely well thought out in design and cleaning/maintenance. I would book any rentals managed/hosted by Alexandra, including this one again, in a heartbeat."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have never felt more at home then at this AirBnB! After a long day of travel, walking into this pristinely clean and cozy studio was a huge relief. No stone went unturned to make this space inviting and relaxing. The place boasts incredible design, natural lighting, and a tranquil backyard. The bed and linens were so comfortable and the fireplace added a warm touch to the room. There are so many great restaurants close by and the neighborhood was quiet and made for a great run (beautiful homes and parks to see). Will absolutely be returning next time we are in Dallas!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is amazing, a space clean and comfortable to rest. It is as shown in the pictures and more! The apartment has a lot of little details that make the big difference. Alexandra was very attentive to us and her recommendations were great. The best Airbnb we've ever been to, we definitely have to go back when we're in Dallas!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazingly peaceful, relaxing home! We slept so soundly in the very very comfortable bed! Beautiful decor. Woke up to the sound of chirping birds and beautiful scenery outside."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So, it was like a feeling of a hotel but nicer. Don’t wait to book just do it and thank me later. I’m extremely picky on Airbnb and this was one of the best ones I’ve been to . So ya just do it or if I’m booking at the same time as you I’m taking it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! It was conveniently located to everywhere we went! We loved the Bishops Art District which was close by. Alexandra was a great host and we would definitely stay there again. The place was very nice and quaint.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was so cozy I tried to stay an extra day. The design is impeccable and comfortable. Alexandra goes above and beyond with response times, free coffee and a seltzer filled fridge. There is a nice arts district 5 minutes away. Escape to her tranquil oasis, you won’t regret it."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is GORGEOUS! We didn’t want to leave. They even had water and drinks for us, including coffee creamer! Can’t tell you how many Airbnbs don’t provide the simple amenities. 12/10 recommend you stay here! Can’t wait to come back."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay!!! The suite was exactly as described: clean (very clean!), beautifully decorated, and inviting. It was conveniently located which allowed us to explore Downtown Dallas and some of the other suburbs easily.
Alexandra answered my messages promptly and was very helpful with suggestions for places to eat and things to do.
We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to our friends and family!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful air bnb! Extremely clean, comfortable bed, and serene vibe. The bathroom was aesthetically pleasing with beautiful tile work and a large floor to ceiling window. We did not use the courtyard but it looked peaceful and inviting. The air bnb is conveniently located about 10 minutes from downtown Dallas and close to the Bishop Arts district. Hosts were very attentive and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the little details. We had a very late check-in and hosts provided clear instructions and left the light on for us, which was very thoughtful. We appreciated the personal touches like ingredient conscious toiletries and plants throughout the suite. Would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in the Dallas area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is perfect. My go-to spot when staying in Dallas!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such an easy place to get in and out of, a “quicker than you would think” drive to most places. It’s amazing how easily you could be directly downtown one minute and then back at this location 10-15 mins later.
House had everything you need. Clean, comfortable, great design, incredibly attentive hosts. Would stay here every time we come"

You can tell that every single item in the suite was intentionally picked and truly adds to the overall vibe of the space. Alexandra was kind enough to provide early check in for us, and was wonderful to communicate with! The location is super close to Bishop Arts, and we loved exploring all the great shops and restaurants nearby. Highly recommend! We can't wait to go back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful place! We had no issues finding it, and the parking was very convenient. We loved the happy plants! The entire place was spotless, and it felt safe. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well, so needless to say we got plenty of rest! We appreciated the extra things like soaps in the bathroom and drinks in the fridge!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alexa & Josh’s Airbnb is absolutely stunning! Incredible design, great location, responsive and thoughtful hosts. Located walking distance from the Bishop Arts District with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby; but in all honesty, you might not want to leave this space. This is THE perfect place to just spend an entire day/weekend relaxing and enjoying the design and aesthetics of this studio. The courtyard itself is an oasis - a great spot for meditation and yoga as well! If you’re looking for a place outside of the normal hotel and you appreciate beautifully designed details…you need to stay here!! Oh, and the restroom!! Feels like a spa ✨"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Sage & Light! It was the perfect retreat for our anniversary weekend. The indoor plants, natural light, and design of the place brought a sense of peace and relaxation. Makes me want to become an indoor plant lady. And, I still can’t get over how beautiful the shower is! Alexandra offered us a charcuterie board from a local small business for an additional fee, which I loved! It was so great to snack on throughout the weekend. Bottles of water were stocked in the fridge and we enjoyed the bottle of wine that was left for us. We super appreciated the quick response (<30 min) when the smoke alarm was chirping in the suite next door. We loved how close we were to the Bishop Arts District! So many fun & trendy restaurants and shops. Thank you for an incredible stay!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be my absolute favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed in! The attention to detail, design, and comfort is outstanding. The apartment is full of light and plants. There are tiny touches everywhere that make this a stellar stay like the coolest, tiniest Bluetooth speaker, drinks in the fridge, dimmable lights, scrabble, and an awesome fireplace that can be used in the hot summers. The patio was relaxing and a great gathering spot. The kitchen had everything you could need in a compact design. The sofa and bed were also super comfy. The home is also located in an upscale neighborhood. I cannot express enough how much we loved our stay and really impressed our friends that came to visit.
Thank you, Alexandra!"

I’ll be keeping Sage & Light in my favorites for future Texas visits.
Thank you, Alexa & Josh! 🤍"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had trouble finding this place because we kept looking for a house. It turns out this is a Hilton Hotel. It is a 4-star Hilton Hotel. We could probably never afford to stay here if it were not for the affordable price. It was very competitive compared to other Airbnb listings. We will definitely consider staying here again.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Needed a place to stay for 2 nights during Mother's Day weekend. My fiancé and our 2 yr old baby were able to sleep comfortably in the King bed. The room was also larger than it appeared online. There is large work desk that appeared to be new, a couch, and a side table included in the room. The sink and vanity area located in the bathroom area were beautiful and recently updated. I like the fact that the toilet is separated from the sink and vanity. The mirror in the bathroom also displayed the digital time. The toilet is in the same room as the shower. The shower could be updated and I had to disinfect the headboard that was covered in a thick layers of dust and dirt. I would stay here again if I needed to.
FYI: This is the Hilton hotel and not the Hyatt hotel as displayed in the profile pic."

The host was immediately available when I texted and I was able to extend my stay without challenge. I will use this accommodation again and/or refer. You gotta admit, this is a brilliant business move as an AirBnB host, particularly considering the economic climate a lot of hosts are facing as the housing industry is shifting.
If your considering this for your choice of stay, go ahead and click “book”. You’ll be satisfied you did.
Thank you for the experience Richardson."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was worth what we paid and all was fine. While $14 is not a lot for a parking charge these days, we were not made aware of it ahead of time and is was just a big self parking lot around the hotel and I didn't know why we would be charged this.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only things left me wanting during my stay was the elevators being slow, there being no refrigerator in the room itself and just going down for a simple waffle, eggs and bacon breakfast costing 22$.
Aside from these complaints I thought the room was perfect for the two of us, it had a great view and was a comfortable place to rest. The area is great for walking, you're right across the street from an outlet area to find a bite to eat and snacks and the host was super responsive and informative.
Loved it. Would recommend it to anybody coming for the weekend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hotel overall was very nice. The hotel room was clean and the walls were quite thick. The TV was not a smart TV so keep that in mind if you’re wanting to watch something other than cable.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The receptionist was great. I had an early check-in, and they helped me out with the same. The room came with a peloton bike which was a good add on, and the city view room offers amazing views."

Clean, super comfortable bed. No issues at all!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was surrounded by many restaurants and coffee shops I enjoy. If you’re looking for a spot that is the middle of everywhere from Plan, Carrolton and downtown, this is your destination."
2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hotel needs work. It was built in 1979 and if you look past the surface level renovations it shows. The A/C would not dip below 72 even at night and the wait for the lobby elevator was sometimes greater than 10 minutes. Hotel parking is an additional fee of $14 for non covered parking. Wouldn’t recommend staying at The Hilton Richardson at this time.
The Front Desk Staff and Restaurant staff however, are great."

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Edward was professional and responsive. The apartment was nice and clean. No extra bedding, the towels smelled moldy. Not enough dishes for a family of 4. Our experience was overall inferior than expected. Location is not the best, a lot of weirdos in the building and surroundings. “valet parking” is not near the building. Coming with groceries was a hassle! You have to wait usually a long time to have your car and then walk around a block’s distance to get to the back of the building (only entrance )."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My son and I had a wonderful stay here! Would definitely recommend!

I was worried about parking but it’s in a secure parking garage that requires a fob to enter. The elevators from the garage give you access to the floor you will stay on. The views of Dallas skyline are awesome from his place! The rooftop pool and gym were a bonus! Everything we needed was in walking distance! I will stay anytime I’m in Dallas!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Key didn’t work for the first night there but Abraham was quick to come and swap out the key fob to give us access to the gym and pool. The pool table on the roof did not have any balls or sticks to play, however the gym was great and swimming pool also had a great view. I’d definitely stay here again my next time in Dallas! Also, he had an assigned parking spot which is really helpful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"amazing place , and amazing host would definitely do it again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abraham is a very good host! He will help you if you need anything and replies quickly. Thank you for the pleasure stay!

My only complaint is the kitchen supplies are more minimal than I was anticipating. However, if you’re not planning to cook this shouldn’t affect you at all! The location is awesome! It is walking distance to all sorts of museums, restaurants, and venues. Abraham himself was a delight to communicate with and was super helpful with the check in process."

Only criticism was to get into the parking lot you have to get a key fob from the apartment and parking is not easy in downtown Dallas otherwise! Would be tricky if you were on your own. Appreciate that not much can be done about that. Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, Abraham was responsive and provided helpful details for easy access."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abraham’s place is extremely clean. Provided amenities is efficiently good for a short stay. The bed is very comfortable. You have a good viewing down from the 22nd. floor room level.
Location is right central in downtown Dallas. Behind the building is all the public bus lines to roar the city if so desired.
The front of the building is Elms street and the back is Pacific avenue where the garage entrance is. Pay attention a bit to the garage levels and spaces marking since all are pretty much fade out. You also need the fob (attached with the room key) to operate the elevators at the garage.
Abraham was very attentive to any questions you might have. I would highly recommend Abraham’s place and definitely stay here again if coming back."

If we ever came back I’d definitely stay again though!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for more than one. Super close to things. Great rooftop. Really appreciated the enclosed attached garage. Somewhat of a transitional neighborhood but close enough to things that make it so worthwhile. Would consider here again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Townhouse was even better than expected from the pictures. I wish I was staying longer because there was some much to do in the area. I actually took some pictures of the space to show my friends. The host was extremely accommodating and I will check this location first anytime I return to the Dallas area. He was extremely clean and it is in the perfect location.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay and this place is really great, overall.
Having garage parking was excellent and the space of the home was well laid out.
The bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen were all spacious and extremely useful.
However, we did notice a couple issues.
The second bedroom door was broken and unusable, but we were grateful that Noemi and the property manager were able to fix this issue the next day.
The place has general wear and tear in various rooms such as the bathrooms, kitchen and rooftop area.
While the rooftop was essential for our visit to see the eclipse, we noticed that the lights and TV were not working and the games and furniture had extensive weather damage.
The kitchen bakeware and utensils were great, but there were many chips in the few plates and bowls available, and the refrigerator door needs repairing.
Overall, our experience at this place was very positive, however these issues did have minor negative effects on our stay."

Thank you for making our stay so marvelous."

,,,"The Bungalow was different than what we expected. Kind of eerie and not the vibe we were hoping for. Not a lot of privacy, and it was much too small for us. The space was dusty, and some parts of the house were unstable."
,,,FRONT DESK IS HORRIBLE! I arrived and the front desk stated my Visa card was not accepted then inform me of a deposit that was much higher than I was told. I still agreed to pay but she wouldn’t take my card. I said give me a refund then she grunted and said it take the card. Then the elevators were functioning properly. I got stuck in the elevator. Then get to the room it’s hot as hell. The room phones were all unplugged. I tried plugging them didn’t work. I called front desk on my cell she puts me on hold never comes back. The heat continued to rise. Finally I got ahold of someone at front desk they sent a maintenance man. He tried his best and couldn’t fix it. They finally placed us in another room around midnight. This was a surprise getaway for my wife’s 30th birthday. I was embarrassed and disappointed.
,,,"Airbnb has to do a better job with reservations, especially pertaining to hotel rooms. I found it strange that rooms (Le Meridien) which clearly showed there was availability on their website were actually booked and reserved. How is a customer supposed to know that? My reservation still went through the normal booking process but I was turned away due to no vacancy when I arrived. No one wants to go through that on vacation so an update on their website is very crucial. Also, reaching out to the customer would be beneficial so quick changes or new plans can be made."
,,,first I paid they took my money and when I got there they said no reservation. I tried contacting host and no response for three hours I drove 4 hours and I had to get another room that took me three more hours to book worse experience ever I will never use air b and b again
,,,"I have NEVER had an additional fee after making my full payment on AIRBNB site!
I booked this location that seemed to be a reasonable price, after paying all the fees required by airbnb there was another additional fee of $50. We were on a trip just getting to Dallas and about to head to a new city, we reserved this location with the last of our spending budget to be able to rest our heads! We received a message from the host that also included that there is an additional charge once you arrive on site. This was not ideal, especially for the traveling circumstances, therefore we reached out to the host and informed him of the news and situation. We requested a refund in light of this, and he continued to say, ""you can reach out to customer support, but their is no guarantee you will receive it,"" this was already a sign that he has already made up his mind that he would not be returning our funds. Lastly, we asked to reschedule and he denied this. Money Driven, and inconsiderate."
