2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Guests will love this place.
The apartment is on the upper floor.
The stairs up are a little tight for large suitcases and still good to walk.
The apartment itself is bright,friendly and cozy.
Everything is easy to find in its place.
Each room has a separate dressing room where you can easily store all suitcases and clothes.
Great bathroom with hygiene items available as well.
In the kitchen there are basic equipment
There were two of us in the apartment and we really felt very comfortable.
A lot of space.
The garden is also to be used.
Garden furniture to relax and sit down is also provided.
We will be happy to come back!"

Bonus- there is a Starbucks in the lobby of the Hotel and a small store.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are a light sleeper I wouldn’t recommend this place. At 11 floors up you can still hear everything going on on the first few floors and the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors talking. On the Saturday I was there the elevator was a pain to access with all the younger adults there. Overall though the stay was fine. This is just a basic hotel room at the Hyatt Regency. It’s nothing special. I will say the hosts and all who worked at the hotel were all very kind and responsive whenever I had any questions so I appreciate that.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and perfect place! There is an endless amount of things to do within walking distance. We had a great stay here and would definitely come back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great customer service!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful and matched the photos - very clean and spacious. Location was amazing, and convenient! The check-in/out instructions provided were easy to read and very thorough. Parking garage was easy to locate and close. Bed was very comfortable, and the blankets and pillows provided were just right. Temp control is nice and easy to adjust. There is a fan directly above the bed you can turn on or off. The air (or heat) blows right over the bed as well which I like. Good for snuggling. :) I am a light sleeper and had no troubles sleeping. Everything was quiet at night and the room has a black out curtain that really blocks out the light. If I had to think of anything to improve (which is really small and petty) it would be to provide extra towels. There were two of us and we were provided 3 towels for a 4 night/5 day stay. I've rented from Flexhome before, and love everything about them! When visiting the area, we only search for Flexhome listings!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. The parking was a bit confusing at first. Its not located at the building. (Not far though) It’s a few blocks over so I thought I had the wrong place lol. Flex home was quick to respond to help me out with my confusion though! The place looked like the photos and everything was clean! Would stay again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a fun space. The historic beer district had so many cool places. It was close to fun things to do. We walked everywhere…The bronz fonz, the historic 3rd ward, the Bucks game, and great restaurants. The instructions were clear and having free parking was a huge blessing. My husband and I highly recommend this space."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, as advertised."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a long weekend in Milwaukee, walk to bars & restaurants and the Fiserv Forum. Building is quiet and unit is clean and spacious for 2 guests."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!! Pictures did not give it the praise it deserves.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place as always
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is a good value compared to hotels. The space is large. Our experience could have been great, but was just ok.
Little things like stains on the wall, hairs in the bed and bathroom vanity, a broken handle on the kitchen drawer, a disgusting shower curtain liner, fingerprints on the fridge, dirty light switches, and a strong smell of weed with a failed attempt to cover it up using large amounts of cleaning solution made the experience a little disappointing. Not a deal breaker, but not great enough to make us want to return.
It seems like a lot of the apartments in the building are short term rentals/air bnb's and the building has it's own cleaning crew that cleans the apartments as quickly as possible without giving much attention to detail."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stay was lovely besides the minor issues we had but I would definitely book again
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location downtown!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a great place to stay! I would come back in a heartbeat. The owner answered my messages right away when I had an issue with the AC. A short walk from third street where I went to dinner for my birthday and walked around daily! I also loved the historic building itself. The game room was fun and the gym looked very nice
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My fiancé had a wonderful stay here! He needed a night away out of the house so I wanted to find him a place that had both good location and great amenities. He had a good stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had to stay again cause how great of a place is. Planning my next trip already.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, location and communication. Loved the clean, spacious and minimalist concept, plus the brown noise while studying and working is a plus! The private parking garage with a security car doing rounds is amazing, just a block away. It’s a few minutes walking to lots of bars and the heart of downtown. The communication was clear, fast and smooth. Will definitely stay here again pretty soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space in old brewery district. Would definitely stay again! Parking is a little far away however, so just be prepared for a little trek to take your items in. You can also hear some loud sirens at night which I’m sure is typical of any downtown area stay. Fantastic living area, kitchen and bedroom. Shower was nice with plenty of hot water and easy to use!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although the parking lot was a walk to the apartment, it was really great! The apartment smelled nice and is actually smaller than the photos but felt like home. Thank you for hosting this mini vacation! Personally, I really love flexhome!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this location! It was such a beautiful spot with convenience to everything. So quiet during the week and walking distance to several spots during the weekend. We saw 3 weddings at Pabst between Fri/Sat alone. If you're attending one, this is really a prime location to stay.
If we had one piece of feedback to give, it would be to add a TV to the bedroom. But that's personal preference.
Thank you helping us have a great first time in Milwaukee!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying in Collin’s apartment! We loved the high ceilings and cool 19th century industrial vibe. And everything was well-communicated, timely, and clean.

We were only there briefly, but having laundry in unit was a huge bonus. Very clean and comfortable. The Pabst coffee shop a block away had great coffee. Overall a great value. Lots of restaurants near by. We went to the Blue Bat Taqueria, and enjoyed sitting outside but the water."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at The Malt House. We loved the mix between industrial/brewery and mid century modern feel. We took advantage of all of the amenities, rec room, fitness room, media/theatre room, and coffee area. Great location in brewery district and a short drive to other downtown Milwaukee areas. Flexhome was great to communicate and responded to a couple questions we had quickly. We will definitely be looking forward to our next stay!"

2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location in a historic building. Really a cool area of the city and well-appointed apartment.
Note that sound travels in this space and you will hear several neighbors very clearly. Most noise stopped by 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper you may need ear plugs."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent space, perfect for a quick overnight in Milwaukee. We had a minor challenge at check-in but communication with Flexhome was quick and easy. Really great value for the quality of the loft and location, look forward to returning."

If you want to feel like a Milwaukee local, this 5th ward neighborhood will do it. It’s stocked full up up & coming restaurants, bars & coffee shops; all within a quick walk of the apartment.
Plus, you’re only a quick 20min walk into the historic 3rd ward downtown & a super easy Uber from the airport & lake.
Do yourself a favor & book before someone else does!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host has definitely done a lot of thinking and preparations to make the guest's stay as easy and comforting as possible.

It also feels private as you have your own entrance over their garage. Scott and Noreena made us feel right at home, were extremely responsive and provided clear instructions for everything related to the air bnb. They also welcomed us with freshly baked muffins and snacks. And had thought of anything you possibly may need while staying there. We would stay here again!"

Close to everything we had planned, and Scott’s tips pointed us to some other nice things we hadn’t planned for - bonus! Apartment was easy to access, very clean, and as described in the listing. A few unexpected snacks were a pleasant surprise as well. We weren’t sure what to expect with street parking but we didn’t have a problem finding a space each night we were there.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place if you’re staying in Milwaukee! There was so much attention to detail, it immediately felt like we lived there, lol. Everything was very well stocked, with a lot of thoughtful touches. The space felt warm and inviting. Everything was squeaky clean, without feeling sterile. Very easy to find location, convenient to everything, but outside of the downtown chaos."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a good location for the Third Ward and heading to the American Family Field or the American Family Amphitheater for events. A nice brewery is around the corner. Restaurants are within 5-8 blocks as well. Place has a lot of nice extras provided and it was quiet for sleeping. Parking was right on the street outside generally. There is currently a lot of some kind of work being done that has plywood covering holes where the sidewalks should be which makes some noise in the mornings.

I will definitely book again when I'm come back."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Near some cool bars/restaurants. Room was clean and exactly as described. Hosts left recommendations for local bars/restaurants which were helpful. The treats they left in the room were a great touch. Bed was firmer than I’d like personally, but that’s personal preference for sure. We’ve got family in the neighborhood, and when we come back to visit we will definitely try to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable, centrally located apartment, thoughtfully furnished and well-maintained. I would gladly stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came for Summerfest. We walked both ways the first night as it's a flat 1.5 mile walk. (The other times we took ride share and bar shuttles). The loft was exactly as described, clean and perfect for two. Scott responded immediately to all my questions. Will definitely look them up again when we return to the always friendly MKE!"

It is very private despite being adjacent to the main house, and the shared balcony is peaceful. Scott and Noreena left clear instructions, as well as suggestions and coupons for local spots.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just wow. Obviously thoughtful and caring hosts who are proud of their city and the service that they provide. One of the best places that we have stayed in a long time.
Location: perfect. We were able to take one bus from airport, walk to fun restaurants and bars, get easy bus to Third Ward, Downtown, Lower East Side. It’s a little empty on the weeknights, but our friends and acquaintances said it’s pretty safe for urban-savvy travelers. Lotta tips from hosts available to you. Super-friendly Sam at local market La Tropicana hooked us up with bus passes and good beer.
Accommodation: clean! Comfortable. Well stocked.
WiFi fast but no workspace.
Quiet. Great hot water, nice towels, good hair dryer. Plenty of dishes, microwave. Coffee, breakfast bars, welcome beer!
I know this stuff is in the listing, but there are so many times when we have been to an ABB not as advertised. This is what your person-to-person vacation rental should be. This was amazing. We will be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Noreena’s place was perfect for a weekend in town! Location is great, lots to do and very walkable. We stayed in mid-feb so it was cold outside, but the loft was warm and comfortable. Our whole stay was seamless thanks to Scott’s recommendations and communication. The loft is packed with everything you need which made it that more comfortable. Parking is easy and convenient. Would 100% stay again."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Scott's place is a nice quaint spot and it worked for us. Being from Milwaukee we understood the challenges of winter street parking which is not the best. Scott was informative on how it worked. It was very cold during our time there and the hallway leading up to the place didn't seem to be heated. We made it work though. This is a second floor unit so if you have challenges with stairs it's not for you. All in all we enjoyed our stay. This is definitely a great spot for spring through fall when there's so much to do in the city. A lot of walkable places in the area. It is near the freeway and that noise is noticeable especially at night. Would stay again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scotts’s place was very nice, quiet, yet very close to many great places to eat and drink, Milwaukees specialty.
Walkers Point has it all!
The loft was extremely well supplied from kitchen appliances to small details like coffee, tea and lots of other assorted items. I even found local craft beers in the fridge. For me, I found the lighting design over the top! Undoubtedly designed by a high end professional electrician, even every switched marked for ease of use.
Thumbs up!
Tom Schupp"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,THE BEST HOST EVER! I was staying here till my apartment was ready for me to move in.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place is everything you see and read. Adorable and super clean place with a fun but chill vibe. Check in/check out extremely easy, and though I never met Scott face to face, communication with him was a breeze. He made sure to send messages as needed leading up to my visit and throughout without being intrusive, just provided everything I needed to know. Street parking was never a problem. A few noises from the street below but you have to expect a little of that in such a vibrant city. It was never enough to interrupt my sleep in the warm and comfy bed and all the other amenities were great too. Hope to stay at Scott’s place again on future visits to beautiful Milwaukee."

Perfect location in Walkers point area for exploring this really unique neighborhood. But you might not ever want to leave the loft! It’s so cozy, extremely clean and you feel like you’re in a different country when you look out the kitchen window at the vines growing over the warehouses and adorable backyard garden.
They were also great at communicating and helped me with a request.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Noreena were incredible hosts and their loft is a beautiful place to stay in the heart of Milwaukee. I was in town apartment hunting and getting familiar with the neighborhoods and Scott’s couldn’t have been a better place to stay for this. Walkers Point has tons too offer and Scott and Noreena have a deep knowledge of Milwaukee history. Chatting with them on the balcony about the characteristics of the different parts of town helped me make a decision on where to live. Highly recommend for anyone passing through town, taking an extended trip, or looking to move to Milwaukee!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay in this loft apartment was wonderful. Scott goes out of his way to make sure you feel welcome and provides ample information regarding Milwaukee to enhance the visit. He responds promptly to messages and allowed me to check in early when the prior tenant departed early. I enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and would stay here again if/when I return to MKE.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable, with some nice amenities like snacks and chilled coffee creamers. Scott's place is about a 15 minute walk to historic 3rd ward area.

Located in a cool neighborhood with much to offer. If downtown is your thing, only a $12 Uber ride most times. Anyone visiting MKE though - I try and challenge you to stay out of downtown. The neighborhoods around it are really where the heart and soul are! Walkers point is a great neighborhood. Alsoo not too far away is Bay View and the third ward.."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, only 30 min by bus to get there from airport. great spot close to town with local bus. hostess provides thoughtful extras. place looks as shown."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! It was clean and all the house rules were very detailed and easy to follow. The only downside is that the main wifi wouldn’t connect unless we were out in the balcony but it’s ok! we weren’t really there to use the internet. But because of this we weren’t able to set up a roku or google chromecast unfortunately. But the place itself was wonderful, as stated before. They left snacks and even sodas to make our own root beer floats, which i thought was really cute and thoughtful. The neighborhood is super quiet and beautiful. There’s a lot of fun stuff to do nearby! I would definitely rent this place again!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment and location was great! The apartment had everything a traveler needed and we were able to walk to restaurants in the area. The only obstacle we faced is that the apartment's WIFI was not working. I had to work while I was there and this made it difficult for me to do so. However, when I did reach out to the owners they both responded quickly and reset the WIFI router for me. Although this did not work, the communication was excellent."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay and would definitely recommend this space. Excellent clear communication. Easy check-in. Friendly folks.
Very clean and organized space. We hope to be back again someday!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time using an Airbnb for travel. The place is pretty clean and has some nice touches like the snacks. I will say if you are a plus size person the shower may be tight. In addition the proximity to the highway is nice but you can hear everything at night. Overall it was a good stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott was very friendly, helpful, and communicative. He allowed us to leave our bags in the Airbnb between check-out and when we had our Amtrak scheduled.
The place is very cute and nice. The tall ceilings make it feel like a spacious, little haven. It's well equipped with everything you may need, including an iron and ironing board which was important as we were attending a wedding. Scott was generous with including some snacks, eggs, and ingredients for root beer floats! Such a sweet addition.
The Airbnb is within a 20-30 min walking distance to some restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops. And one can certainly make their way to the Third Ward on foot. This Airbnb made for a wonderful Milwaukee trip."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was good. Good communication and they have lots of the personal touches that other reviews talk about. There were also some frustrations— wifi was pretty bad, tv and A/C weren’t great (we were there when it was hot!), and some other small things. We’re pretty low-key guests but we probably wouldn’t stay there again. In general though it was a fine stay and they seem to be nice folks and Milwaukee was a lot of fun to explore."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot in an easy to get to area. The deck was a perfect place for coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening. Very clean and hosts were very helpful.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's place was the ideal stay for our visit to Milwaukee to attend a wedding. Everything was as advertised: clean, functional, and private. We enjoyed walking to the many quaint cafés and restaurants in the neighborhood as well."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's place had just what we needed for a quick stay... studio apartment type set up. However, there is only street parking available. We parked out front of the property, and our car was stolen in the early morning hours. After speaking with an officer, he stated that the location of the airbnb was not the best. If I go to Milwaukee again, I would pay more for a nicer area or a safer place to park."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool spot. Helpful host. Well appointed.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay in MKE. The hosts leave plenty of little surprises for their guests. Location was quiet, felt safe, and was easily walkable to breweries etc. Street parking is available for free and we were able to park it right next to our window. They leave plenty of brochures for all attractions nearby and any information you need about your stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in Milwaukee. One of the most well stocked Airbnb's I have stayed in with snacks, kitchen tools, and amenities. Great location for me as very close to a friend i was visiting. A little far for walking to bars and restaurants, but very close to water and 3rd Ward if driving."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cozy! Perfect for a long weekend in MKE!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay for the 4th of July weekend! Tons of snacks, utensils, and hygiene items were stocked and ready for our use, loved the root beer floats! Location was perfect for walking or taking a short drive to the beach. I definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Milwaukee, WI. Scott was also kind enough to lend some lawn chairs for firework viewing, super happy we chose this Airbnb!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful stay for my first time in Milwaukee! Super comfy, very clean, and right in a great spot (within walking distance of some really good places)! Loved it!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is beautiful and just perfect for my wife and me. We were surprised a number of times by the surprised left in the kitchen for us, beginning with fresh cupcakes upon our arrival. A great location which is perfectly removed from the downtown area! We came up from Chicago to catch a few games at Great American Ballpark and were there in 10 minutes."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, a lot of homey touches and terrific value!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a charming get-a-way... yet in the city. It is in a nice neighborhood from which you can leisurely walk to the Third Ward and Public Market in 20-30 minutes or drive in 7 minutes. The loft was clean with lots of extras including fresh layed eggs and honey from the hosts' bees! We loved having a full kitchen so we could make a meal or two. We also enjoyed relaxing on the balcony in the evening. Scott and Noreena were gracious hosts, and we hope to visit again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Had everything you can think of and super cute! They made sure we felt welcomed and had solutions to anything we were unsure about (where trash goes, how the ice machine works, etc). The only thing that might be an issue is that it’s close to the highway, but it wasn’t a major issue for my stay. Would stay again and recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s loft was an amazing base from which to explore the city! Could not ask for a better location, and the apartment itself was well stocked with amenities. When there a problem with the AC, Scott delivered a replacement unit within hours. Highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is, hands down, the greatest Airbnb my husband and I have ever stayed in. It doesn’t get any better! Immaculately clean, cozy, comfortable, and charming. Wonderful and thoughtful touches throughout- plenty of helpful information, a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom, and incredible and detailed communication from Scott ahead of time. If you are looking to stay in Milwaukee and have come across this treasure of a place, do not hesitate for a moment to book it!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Scott's place was great-- great location, great amenities. He communicated very well with us. Would stay again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s studio was clean, well decorated, and spacious enough for two! I felt safe arriving late to his place, comfortable with check-in and check-out procedures, and communication with him was prompt and helpful! In a good location (about 1 mile from the Third Ward) so easily walkable! Highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My stay at Scott's place was perfect. It was comfortable and I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay there again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is THE place to stay in MKE! It was absolutely the spotless, beautifully decorated and the perfect place for our three night stay in MKE. This is probably the most hospitable air B and B we have ever stayed at. Their thoughtful touches are unmatched! The location also cannot be beat with it being downtown."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing was just as expected. Being right off the expressway gives access to unlimited options. The snacks and other food items were an added bonus. Would highly recommend

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I loved the layout and the ambiance of this place, with the high ceilings and the spacious area between the bed and the TV made it easy for me to do my home workouts! Scott is also a great host!
The immediate area is a little rough but this location is still very close to the Third Ward which is a super awesome area!! If you stay here, you MUST check out the Milwaukee Public Market; that was my favorite thing I visited while I was in MKE. If you’re in to coffee shops, I very much recommend Colectivo Coffee; that’s a great one."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place is so cute and comfy!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved this little loft it was so cozy and stayed super warm for the winter. My daughter really enjoyed her stay too. It definitely felt like home. I will actually miss this little place! Thank you for all the goodies you had there for us as well!!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's accommodations made our visit to Milwaukee a great experience. The region experienced frigid temperatures before we arrived and Scott made sure that the loft was heated and warmed upon our arrival - it's the little things! The living space was clean, expertly decorated, and included all the amenities we needed (should I mention the hot chocolate and heart-shaped cookies for Valentine's Day!). The space is conveniently located near great restaurants, grocery stores, and shops in Walker's Point. This is a perfect place to stay if you are looking to explore Milwaukee or need a weekend away!"

We would highly recommend this place if you are in the area!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and stylish space. This is a cozy studio apartment that is in a great spot to travel either to the inner city or suburbs.

There is a lot of information about local spots to check out and the apartment was stocked with things to make life better during our stay. Location is great, too! I highly recommend this place."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fantastic, from the self check-in, to the stylish loft, to the many, many thoughtful touches including homemade sweet bread, local honey, well stocked kitchen with a large variety of snacks and teas. It was lovely. Appreciate the local tips and loved being able to walk to Milwaukee Public Market, not one but two Colectivo Coffee houses and many fine brew houses and restaurants. Some were closed due to COVID but it wasn't hard to find a place nearby. We'd stay again in a second."

Their loft was perfect for our needs: close to all of the attractions (including just a 2 mile bike ride from Lake Michigan), a kitchen complete with what we needed, extra touches like breakfast cereal, tea, granola bars, and even four eggs from their chickens. We were able to spend time getting to know Scott and Noreena on their lovely deck overlooking their beautiful garden and sharing food. Our stay was delightful, friendly, and fun! Definitely one of our best airbnb stays!"

2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio loft is in a great location in the Walkers Point neighborhood of Milwaukee. The space is charming and well equipped and the kitchen is stocked with essentials. Scott is a terrific host. The freeway is less than half a block away and you can hear the traffic all night so bring earplugs or a noise machine if you’re a light sleeper, but this was a minor inconvenience. Great place!"

Also, our dog loved going for walks in the neighborhood and nearby park."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was immaculate, very clean and decorated with style. It was greatly located in the neighborhood of Wauwatosa within walking distance of many parks and The Village shopping center. We had a great time. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Milwaukee."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jen's place was a delight. It was beautifully decorated and perfectly organized with every need anticipated. There was lots of natural light and lots of thoughtful detail. The overall effect was peaceful and comforting. My husband said it was the most beautifully appointed airbnb we've stayed in and I agree. We had family to visit in town but I found myself thinking I could stay in that space all weekend for a peaceful retreat.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great set-up for what we needed.
Easy to come and go.
Close to our family we were visiting."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, roomy, spotless, beautifully equipped, and stocked with everything to make guests feel comfortable and at-home. Beautifully updated, with just the right amount of artful decor, contemporary clean-line furnishings, large-screen TV. Amazing attention to details - like fully stocked coffee/tea counter, linen closet with extra toiletries, ample cooking utensils & dishes, and so much more. The entire place actually looks like no one has previously used it - which is testimony to the care taken to prepare it afresh for each new guest. We had to contact the owners (Jen & Brett) a question regarding an appliance (the beautiful 5-burner gas range) - they were quick to answer the phone & respond to our question, and even came in person to make sure it was functioning properly. If you want a place for 4 or less in this area, I don't see how you could do better! Thank you, Jen & Brett, and we'll be in touch for next time!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Collected Casa became our home away from home while we were in the Milwaukee area. From the moment I saw the pictures and read the reviews I was impressed with Jen and the home. She warmly welcomed our family with our 2 pets into her home. Our family was able to relax and enjoy a very busy weekend away in a wonderful atmosphere. Jen was a super host who answered my messages and provided wonderful suggestions. Everything was perfect for our birthday weekend!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jen's place was great -- very cute space and a good location. The kitchen was big and spacious with a fully-stocked coffee bar that we appreciated. We also really enjoyed the design touches throughout, including the black and white striped hallway, gallery wall of art and bar area. A lot of attention to detail including the essentials you need when traveling far from home like bottled water, dental floss, makeup remover, etc. My husband and I stayed with our 11 year old niece and we had enough room in the single-story home. Very pretty place while also being functional."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved our stay at Jen’s place. The home was beautifully decorated- with attention to fine details and conveniences such as the multi-way coffee bar, sound machines in each bedroom, adorable and stocked linen closet, the luggage racks in each bedroom, and everything you need to build a fire.
The home was spacious with an abundance of closet space and hooks- love being able to stay organized on a trip! The home was probably the cleanest I’ve ever stayed in and smelled lovely! The location was perfect- close to downtown with plenty to do. The neighborhood felt safe and was very walkable with our pups. We always appreciate a home we can bring our dogs! Overall was an awesome stay and would highly recommend to friends or family!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! It was decorated so well, beautiful kitchen and great dining table! Felt like home right away, toddler friendly (Not too many nick-nacks) and just two blocks from a park!

This house was perfect for us. There was plenty of space for all of us to sleep and the house comes with a ton of kid stuff so we were able to pack light. I would highly recommend this house if you are looking for a place in the area. It was close to the pool, zoo, parks, etc. Jen also treated us to ice cream at the local ice cream shop which was delicious. We had a fabulous stay and will book this house again for our next visit. Jen - thank you very much for your hospitality!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a really cute house! I liked all of the helpful notes listed everywhere. I appreciated the “Did you forget something?” box in the pantry. One thing that my friend didn’t have and wasn’t in the box was a toothbrush, so perhaps something to keep in mind for the future guests. It was also nice that they provided firewood, a starter, and newspaper. The fire with the outside lighting was lovely. We would stay here again."

My wife and I stayed here for our wedding weekend and the hosts were sweet enough to leave a wedding card and some treats for us. They were also very accommodating about the fact that we were going to have people coming in and out since the bridal party was getting ready at the house. The kitchen was fully stocked with all of the cooking essentials you could need, which was nice since we did end up cooking a few meals there. The house, overall, was exactly what we needed and even nicer than it looked in the pictures (which we already loved). I would recommend this house to anyone looking for a cozy but spacious place to stay. The only thing we did not love was the lack of window coverings in the kitchen, but it was an absolutely great stay!"

I was looking for somewhere cute and cozy to escape to and explore Milwaukee, and this home was perfect. It was very clean, decorated nicely, and had everything we needed for our weekend away. The little touches throughout the home made us feel welcomed and comfortable. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and was about 15-20 minutes away from everything we did. I would plan to have a car so you can easily get around Milwaukee, but since the house comes with a parking spot it's really no problem! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone who appreciates design and wants a relaxing spot to call home for a few days."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We highly recommend this home!
So comfortable and cozy. Everything was just perfect. Great spot to be in the Tosa/Milwaukee area. Wonderful walking and friendly neighbors. Everything was clean and organized.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an adorable, well appointed, comfortable place! Wish we could have stayed longer! Loved the decor ( I’m a huge Frida fan and noticed one of the pieces in the gallery wall was also another fav—from the Gaudi tiles in Spain!) Special touches abound in the Collected Casa from local coffee to additional toiletries and recommendations for local restaurants. Slept like a baby with the fresh linens, comfy beds, and sound machine. Jen was so responsive and helpful to point us in the direction of local eats, etc. One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had so far. Can’t wait to visit again. Thank you so much!"

(My husband even ordered the same reed diffusers for our own home because he loved them so much)
Jen was the kindest and most professional host, and we will definitely be looking at this house for all of our future visits to Milwaukee."

Our hosts dropped everything to make sure the problem was resolved and we were taken care of.

Excellent nearby restaurants:fixture pizza, hamburger Mary’s, station 3, fuel, and mob craft beer. The neighborhood felt safe at all times of day. We’re originally from the twin cities for reference.
We were in town for Summerfest and found a free shuttle within walking distance. Stevy’s. Could not have planned the trip better!
I am a new Airbnb user. Michael was super helpful and responsive to all of my questions quickly.
We will definitely be back.
One thing to note is you do need to be able to walk up 20-22 steps to get to the second floor. Plan what you bring according."

Great cocktails at Great Lakes Distillery, you can’t go wrong at Zocalo Food Court and 2nd Street (a super short walk) is lined with restaurants and bars. Hamburger Mary’s Drag Brunch is also something that was crazy fun, even hungover on a Sunday morning, pepped us right up for the Wild and Blackhawk’s Home Away from Home pregame series, great venue!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean, comfortable, and Michael was an excellent communicator. Neighborhood wasn’t the downtown area I’m used to but it grew on me during my stay. It has charm and some cool places to eat & drink nearby.
I also liked how seamless everything was with digital door locks, straightforward house guidance/rules, and even signs/instructions posted in relevant areas (ie how to work the unique shower).
Thanks for the great stay!!"

Pillows were just ok. Brought my own white noise machine given city stay. Coded security to enter building and Airbnb room. Covered parking was nice touch. Easy Uber (about $8-$10) to most places.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t beat the location. We easily walked to many different restaurants, bars, breweries, the Harley Museum, and even downtown to the Riverside theater. The off street parking was a plus, as we didn’t need to worry about the car. It was a bit noisy at night, as the hamburger Mary’s rooftop is right outside the windows, but that is to be expected in a busy neighborhood. We had a great visit!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this condo for Summerfest long weekend. It was close to the festival, as well as many restaurants and shops.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael's place is a great place to stay for exploring Milwaukee. It's in a trendy part of town with lots of restaurants, bars and breweries really close by. Just a short stroll or bike ride into the Third Ward or downtown and very close to the Harley Davidson museum.
The apartment is well equipped, the bed is very comfortable and the shower is super nice. It can be a little loud on weekend nights, but that's what comes with staying in a lively neighborhood. Having the private parking spot was phenomenal and a huge perk.
Michael was easy to communicate with and a great host. I would definitely recommend his apartment."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. It was centrally-located, clean, and nicely appointed. We really appreciated the garage access.
That made our stay much more convenient. The only drawback was the noise at night from Hamburger Mary's and loud car/motorcycle traffic at all hours of the night. It was a holiday weekend, so that might have accounted for additional noise.

Do be aware, the spot is next to a bar and it can get pretty loud on Friday nights. But! It's only occasionally and we had no issues sleeping."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful first experience in Milwaukee and much of that is owed to the accommodations, amenities and suggestions provided by Michael. His place is clean, private, comfortable and in a location that made it easy for us to get around. We were able to get around mostly by foot and only had to drive to a couple further out attractions/restaurants that we wanted to visit. Our favorite food & drink spot during our visit was Zocalo, a food truck park that is only a 2 minute walk from the studio apartment."

Being able to park your car easily in a downtown area really made our trip great. Michael was easy to communicate with, and the place was super clean. The bed was so comfy and I melted into it. Just a fair warning though, Hamburger Mary's that is next store can get really loud. It didn't bother us, and they were usually done by 10-11 PM. Other than that we had the perfect stay."

2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a top notch Airbnb property. No detail or amenity was missed, from the great host to the beautiful space. However, be aware that the noise from the bar next door is VERY loud. Bass and general music could be heard very loud each night until 11pm (on Saturday) and 10pm (on Sunday). The bar is called Hamburger Mary's and it would be wise to check what events they have before you book your stay. If you're planning to be out until 11pm or after, it's no big deal. But until then it's really loud."

The room was great, felt very homey, and had tons of extra amenities that played a nice role in our stay. The garage was a very nice, secure touch. I would recommend Michaels place to my friends and family, as I’d use it again if I were to come back to Milwaukee."

She loves Milwaukee, and it shows that she enjoys sharing all of her favorite spots! The check in was flawless, there was close parking so we didn’t have to walk far with our luggage, and the place was absolutely gorgeous. The WiFi was very fast, with many options for tv and movies. There were fun, small games around the house for entertainment, the kitchen was amazing, the bathroom was clean and the view was pretty! The lighting was great inside the place, and there was very little noise.. even on New Year’s Eve!! This is a must stay in Milwaukee if you are visiting.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great aesthetic! Would love to stay again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful new apartment in an old warehouse building. Very nice view from the expansive living room windows. Nicely decorated in an industrial motif. Probably the most well provisioned AirBnB we've ever stayed at. There are no windows in the bedroom which is a very good thing when you are coming from other time zones and sleeping during some of the daylight hours in Milwaukee. Walking distance to the Harley Davisdon Museum. Washer and dryer. A bit of food in the fridge and in the cupboards. Three ways to make coffee. We were really impressed.
p.s. We found an absolutely wonderful understatedtapas restaurant about a mile away, La Merenda, at 125 E National Ave. You walk in the front door and you're in a neighborhood bar, but in the back room was a whole different world where the food was exceptionally good."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing stay we had at the Dakota gal dig’s well appointed, thoughtfully, decorated blue serif loft. In the world of Airbnb there are places you stay, and places you call home. Blue Serif was a home to us. We really appreciated the amenities. The kitchen, the luxury toiletries, decorative accents and artsy touches throughout the space created a warm and inviting atmosphere. The location was not only peaceful and private, but within walking distance to some amazing eateries and attractions. We appreciated all of the suggestions that she gave in regard to great places to eat and places to visit in our hometown. Even as Milwaukee natives we were amazed at the things that we had never seen or visit before. We cannot wait to visit again! Don’t miss the opportunity to treat yourself to this beautiful space."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From booking to check out, it’s incredibly clear why Julie has the title of super host. The place was spotless, inviting and felt so homey — an excellent vibe to come home to during stressful work trip. The surrounding area is great and the air bnb/apartment building is lovely and felt very secure and safe. We even got to meet a few residents in the building and their adorable pets. Julie was responsive and clear in her check in and check out instructions. Even if work doesn’t bring us back to the area, we want to plan a vacation and come stay back at the Airbnb again. Thanks so much, Julie! :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blue Serif immediately felt like home. It was so nice that we wanted to stay in the entire weekend watching the snow fall from the 5th story window. The entire place was immaculate and full of delights in every cupboard: he bed was comfy, the view was nice, the couch was cozy, the decor was interesting, and the bathroom and kitchen were as clean as any.
Julie was communicative throughout the process, from providing extensive check-in/out instructions to offering a comprehensive list of places to try. The Yelp collection she shared was a bit overwhelming! She was also available via text during our stay if we had any questions.
I love the addition of free snacks and food in the fridge, as well as toiletries in the bathroom drawers. These simple touches go a long way.
One thing to note is that the bedroom light switch controls the outlets. So if you’re charging your devices there, make sure you turn off the lamps manually to ensure you have a full battery in the morning.
Great stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. If you can’t find what you want in Walkers Point, the Third Ward is 4 blocks away.

The views were so incredible you wanted to retire early and just relax (something my wife never wants to do) Every detail was so thought out, anything and everything you needed was available. The location was perfect so much to do in a small area! We came out here for a few days to explore before heading to Great Lakes for our sons Navy graduation and found a GEM!! Great restaurants great shops and things to do but honestly we could see coming back just to stay here and relax the whole time as her place is so peaceful and relaxing!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was absolutely beautiful. The views were great and the Art Deco filled places was a pleasure to my eyes. I literally sat back and looked at every single detail. Just beautiful. Anything and everything I needed and/or wanted was supplied.. There’s so much to do that it was difficult to choose. The bed was comfy and that’s important to me. I ate pancakes for breakfast; that and so much more was right at my fingertips. I truly will be back!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the space was AMAZING. My partner and i walked into Julie Ann's space after a long day of work and were welcomed to a warm and inviting escape. It was stunning. There were snacks, extra pillows/blankets (never had that at an airbnb), wine, and laundry detergent (that was huge bc most spaces just have a washer and dryer). Our host was so accomodating (especially when we lost the keys after our anniversary outing). A MUST stay."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hardly know where to start. Best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Generously stocked kitchen--was shocked when I went to make coffee that I could select from several types of beans, use the provided grinder, select from several sweeteners, and there were even little cartons of milk in the refrigerator. Snacks and beers aplenty. Absolutely gorgeous space. I loved working at the desk. Loved that I had space to place out all my toiletries in the bathroom. The location near restaurants and bars on S 2nd was perfect. The owner answered every question I had within seconds. Mind blown."

We had fresh milk, oranges and much more to give us a good start the next morning… very thoughtful and very much appreciated! I highly recommend this place… we hope to return."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly loved staying here for 6 days over our wedding weekend! We had 4 days of events and having this gorgeous apartment as our home base between them all was more than we could have asked for! The king bed is incredibly comfortable, the bathroom is huge, the living room is sun drenched with beautiful views of Walker’s Point and the kitchen is fantastic too. The entire apartment was spotless and the host left a thoughtful gift and sampling of treats from some amazing Milwaukee small businesses! The off street parking spot was so convenient and we found the building to be quiet and beautifully kept. We lived in Milwaukee for years and finding an airbnb that is walkable near fun activities was a priority for us this trip. The surrounding area has so many fun bars, restaurants and shops in walking distance in the Third Ward and Walker’s Point/5th Ward. We want to stay here again soon!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well appointed unit in a fun location! My daughter and I enjoyed staying so much it sometimes was hard to decide to leave for the day. Close to the many of the fun scenes in Milwaukee. Julie Ann was a fantastic host - she has every detail dialed in and she’s lightning fast to respond should you happen to have any questions. Lots of thoughtful details were built into our stay that were “above & beyond.” We had a fabulous time & would highly recommend - we’d love to return to this or another of her properties someday soon!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and communication. Would definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Julie Ann was a great host. Very communicative and helpful. The place was beautiful and very secure. Loved that there was a parking space designated to the stay. Everything was walking distance as well.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie Ann’s loft apartment is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for! It is clean and in a wonderful location. It is within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and fun bars. We enjoyed our stay there very much. We highly recommend this wonderful apartment for anyone looking to enjoy the area. We went to a Brewers game on Saturday and it is only about a 5 minute walk to Steny’s Tavern & Grill where we took the shuttle bus to the game & back. It was very convenient for us! We would definitely stay there again when visiting the area.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to stay. It is beautifully decorated, with many thoughtful touches. The windows and light in the space are so nice. The bed is extremely comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. Walker's Point neighborhood is fast becoming our favorite and from the apartment you are in walking distance to great restaurants, breweries, bakeries, etc. Julie Ann was so helpful and easy to communicate with. We will definitely stay here when we visit Milwaukee again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing. 5 Stars. Luxury. Everything you could ever need. Worth every penny. Possibly the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The care Julie Ann has put into managing Blue Serif and her customers really shows. It's a gorgeous, comfortable loft and we appreciated the attention and great communication. All the details were taken care of, like having just enough food, snacks and other supplies to keep us going in an unfamiliar area for a little bit, so that we would't have to leave if we didn't want to. The place was secure and served as an excellent home base and recharging point for our explorations of Walker's Point and everywhere else around Milwaukee, in between attending our daughter's Ultimate Frisbee college nationals tournament in town. Just a few of our long list of recommendations: for Walker's Point there is a *lot within walking distance, restaurants, craft beer places and bars, even an old school jazz place less than two blocks away, Caroline's - the real deal. The Noble is an excellent, tiny bar/restaurant not to be missed, get the crawfish jambalaya if it's your lucky day and it's on the inventive, changing menu. MobCraft for an extensive craft beer (and pizza) menu and they're friendly and generous with tasting. The 3rd Ward is just across one of the river bridges and so much to explore there including the Public Market and many shops around the neighborhood. Purple Door in WP for ice cream, but farther away and worth it: Kopp's for *frozen custard* we found is the best quality for taste and value (omg a 2 scoop on waffle cone is gigantic!); and Leon's if you want the traditional drive up experience (and the custard's super good there too!) - both driving distance. If you want to walk along an authentic, natural part of Lake Michigan, we were overjoyed to discover Doctors Park and the Audubon Center at Fox Point up north, driving distance. We could have spent hours there but the sun was setting, unforgettable - wish we'd gone back for sunrise! Next time. The parks near the Milwaukee Art Museum were wonderful also, more of a walk but doable. If you want vegan food like my partner, close by there's On the Bus at the Public Market, and up north the cool and funky Wonderland and Art Bar, both solid options and we really enjoyed. We would definitely love to stay at Blue Serif when in Milwaukee next time. Thanks again, Julie Ann!"

I mean, the place comes with a coffee grinder! It’s a very quiet location and no noise from neighbors. I wish I could live there."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve been staying here fairly regularly for maybe a year now and I love this spot. Julie Ann’s place is absolutely stunning and full of character. She is a thoughtful host, the place is always clean and stocked with extra touches, communication is great."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location just south of the main downtown. Walking distance to some breweries and spots in the area. We walked to the Third Ward too. Very good communication and answered all our questions. Perfect get away spot and a nice view!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place was perfect for a long weekend in Milwaukee. The building is secure, but easy to navigate. Less than a 10 minute drive to a lot of things - and seemed very walkable in warmer weather! The space is beautifully designed and decorated, the place was super clean and so comfortable. And we really appreciated how quiet and calm the building is. A special thank you for surprising us with some free and clear laundry detergent after I said we’d need to get some for our laundry! Julie is a great communicator - thank you for the great stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well appointed. Cute. Comfortable and ideally located with a fun view. What a perfect place to stay for a weekend away. restaurants, shops and beverages all within short walking distance...even in Feb in Milwaukee. Julie Ann is a superb host who knows how to make a guest feel well taken care of. Thanks for the use of the apartment!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay in a fun location. Julie Ann gave us every detail in advance so that checking in was easy.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably one of there better Airbnb to stay in Milwaukee. An amazing urban industrial view from the 5th floor, as well as a thought home feel to the entire place. The pictures absolutely do not do the place justice, absolutely breathtaking. The entire place has a urban rustic feel, the furniture feels thoughtfully picked out and decorated. Place was located at the end of the hall so you only have neighbors on one side. An absolute jewel of a place to stay at for a small weekend get away to visit or possible for a long time stay. Around the area some amazingly good restaurants/ coffee shops near by if you're into that thing. The only bad thing is that the places is literally located right next to some train tracks which is in active use, which tend to pass by at 6 in the morning, 5 in the afternoon and 11 at night. The train does not use the horn and it seems to pass by at a very slow speed the only thing really that of any concern is the building rubles ever so slightly but nothing to unusual or unheard of in a major city. Miss Ann was incredibly thoughtful and fully engaged in trying to make the stay as amazing as possible, she provided restaurants, places to go for sight seeing and places for entertainment. Honestly if you're looking for a place THIS IS THE ONE!"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Over priced.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is a true gem. So relaxing. I don't want to stay anywhere else when we visit Milwaukee. We ADORED the location, the free off-street parking, the quiet building, the beautiful design, the wildly comfortable bed and couch. Walker's Point is a really fabulous neighborhood. Book this property now! Don't look any further. :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apart from a mixup on the address and location of the loft (Julie mistakingly sent us the address to another one of her properties), we had such a wonderful stay both at the loft and in the city.
The loft was exactly as described. I typically am skeptical of lots of rave reviews as we’ve stayed in some disappointing AirBnBs that did not live up to the hype. I can confidently assure you that this loft was the real deal, just as described, and Julie was so helpful when we needed her (the virtual key to get in is a hassle! She offered some alternatives.)
This really is the only AirBnB that we would stay in again.
And Milwaukee?!? Who the heck knew?? Such a gem of a city!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful cerulean escape! There is so much charm and character to this cozy loft just off of Milwaukee Bay. It has a modern industrial vibe and is new and clean. This hidden gem is in a good area and within walking distance or a short bike ride away from Harbor View, EastTown and Historic Third Ward. Julie Ann does an excellent job of making it your home away from home. I highly recommend staying here and would stay here again."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb stay and I’m so glad I stayed here! This looks just like the pictures! Julie was a great host! There are so many things to do in walking distance! I will definitely be coming back!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is great and within walking distance of all sorts of bars, restaurants, markets and shops. The lighting in the main room is so nice and you have an excellent view of the sunrise every morning. Julie Ann was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. My stay was around 3 weeks and I couldn't have picked a better place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mark’s place was perfect for our 1st family weekend getaway with our dog and tiny baby. The whole place has a really cool vibe to it and was super cozy and clean. The location was also ideal for us with the dog park in walking distance and many restaurants to choose from. When we come back we’d definitely choose Mark’s place again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in a great neighborhood!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Mark's place was short but sweet. He was flexible, responsive, and provided excellent recommendations for local restaurants, activities, and sites to see. Our pups especially appreciated the pet-friendly accommodations and fenced-in yard!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice stay, will return if in the area again 😋"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark’s place was great! Located on a quiet residential street it was only a few minute walk or drive to restaurants, shops, or the beach. Very pet friendly & one of the best fenced back yards we have ever seen at an Air Bnb. Mark checked in proactively just to make sure we were all setup but honestly we didn’t need anything bc his unit was perfect. Definitely recommended for others going to MKE."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful stay with our two pups. Fenced-in yard made it easy to take our dogs out. Walkable neighborhoods with 3+ quaint bars within blocks. King bed was very comfortable! We would stay again next time we visit Milwaukee.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's house in Bay View is perfect. It is in a great location with easy access to Downtown Milwaukee, Summerfest grounds and trendy Bay View. I took a nice walk every morning to Groppi's Italian grocerette which has killer coffee, delish egg sandwiches and an amazing variety of baked goods. From there I would stroll to the shore of Lake Michigan to enjoy my breakfast with a spectacular view of the lake and downtown Milwaukee. Mark's house is comfortably appointed and is well represented by the photos. The house also has a really well manicured private backyard with a gas grill and picnic table. When it came time to leave - I did not want to! I was ready to move in! Mark, thank you for the perfect experience!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just book it. Seriously. I’ve never had a bad Airbnb experience, but this one was the BEST. Clear instructions, the cutest, cleanest place, easy parking, close to everything. You couldn’t ask for more. The yard is shared but we didn’t even see the other person staying there so it feels like it’s your own, which is great when traveling with a dog. The guidebook from the hosts is seriously incredible. We found so many cool places that we wouldn’t have otherwise. 100000/10. Will absolutely be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first time using/staying at an Airbnb. It was awesome! Mark’s place is just Perfect. Super spacious, cool, mid-century modern decor. Huge kitchen and eat-in area. A great size office. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets were super soft. Mark sent me an email with super explicit instructions on where to park, how to get in, wi-Fi password, instructions on how to check out, etc. we couldn’t avast for a better experience! And if we head back to Milwaukee anytime soon, I will be sure to stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot in the heart of Bay View. Well appointed with everything you could need. The bed was extremely comfortable.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great stay!! The place was easy to find, clean and with fun and tasteful decor. The host (Mark) responded immediately when we messaged him about a slightly early arrival. The yard was great for our dog and the area was fantastic! We followed Mark’s guide as well as found our own things to do, and we didn’t even scratch the surface of what the area has to offer. So many things in just a few miles! We had a great stay and would love to go back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cozy but still funky and the design was so much fun. You could tell Mark and Brandon thought a lot about the guests in the curation of what was provided. Cozy faux fur blanket in the window seat for reading, robes and extra blankets in the closets so you felt right at home. The location is great and so close to a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops and a really good record store.
They even sent a list of their favorite places to go in the neighborhood. I would love to go back or stay at another one of their properties."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! Beautifully decorated and in a very calm neighborhood! My partner and I needed an escape from our chaotic water damaged home!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time we’ve stayed here when coming back for a longer trip home. Love the location! It’s close to so many of our favorite things and that big beautiful lake. Having a fenced in yard makes it all so much easier when traveling with the dog.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark’s place is just like the photos - full of character and personality! The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark’s place was clean and comfortable. The house is a nondescript house in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Entry is thru the back, which is odd at first, but also makes it feel more safe. Narrow & steep staircase up - so it might be hard for someone with limited physical abilities.
The place is well decorated and just like the photos. Bed was very comfortable. Extra AC unit in the bedroom kept the room perfectly cool.
We didn’t cook, but the kitchen seemed equipped.
The local recommendation from Mark are great! We hit up a few places and found a few others along KK. Walk and explore!!"

We were here on business over Thanksgiving weekend and so appreciated being able to bring our dog with us."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our family (toddler, goldendoodle, and myself) are on tow while my husband does travel nursing. We accepted a last minute 3 month contract to Milwaukee, WI (mind you, we have never been to Wisconsin) and were scrambling to find somewhere to live. I messaged Mark regarding the bottom unit and to my delightful surprise they were days away from posting this upper unit. All the stars aligned! He was so helpful every step of the way. Communication throughout our entire stay with Mark and Brandon was timely and so kind.
The unit is so beautifully decorated. Throughout our stay, my husband and I kept saying how creatively inspired we felt because we were living in such an artistic space. Things we loved: the fenced in yard (we had many BBQs), how the unit is so accessible to Bay View and Downtown Milwaukee, our walks to the lake, two playgrounds steps from the house (a daily trip for us), how kind people were, our daughter learning to sleep in a toddler bed for the first time. This experience was perfect for our family. We absolutely loved the unit and would 110000 recommend to anyone. If we find ourselves back in Wisconsin, we will definitely be booking this unit again."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,we booked a king room and that was unavailable. we didn't know until check in. would have been nice if that were communicated at all.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay when exploring Milwaukee's art scene.
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I booked a king room, but upon check in, was told the king rooms were sold out, so I was offered a queen. The host was quick to respond at first, but didn't resolve the issue and then stopped responding after check out. Overall, very disappointing experience."

Nice room and bed"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, would stay again. Everyone was helpful and friendly."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My host was very responsive. I took a cab from the airport late at night and the driver pulled up to the Hyatt. I figured it was a shared private residence at the back side or upper floor. No, it was the Hyatt. My convention attendees stayed at the Hyatt, and I got an AirBNB steal of a deal in the same place with all the same accommodations! My first time in Milwakee and it was great, and so clean. The local people were a great part of the experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing is located in the heart of downtown and near the Fiserv Forum. Bars, a Walgreens, and restaurants are also nearby.
Bianca did a wonderful job as a co-host. The room was just as described upon checking in. Bianca messaged me to ensure that I had no complaints about the room. She checked in with me throughout my stay and upon checking out.
There is a historical museum across the street from the listing. The Milwaukee Public Museum is about a 10 minute walk away.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I will stay here again upon visiting Milwaukee."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Check in and check out was easy it is a very nice place clean and very peaceful. Everyone was friendly and it’s also in the middle of downtown Milwaukee close to everything restaurants and other. I will definitely recommend anyone to book the place for a good stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love it here!!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was nice
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a hotel in a nice area of Milwaukee. Clean bedrooms and nice hotel. My reason for being unsatisfied with this stay is because hosts were deceitful of what the suite offered. We checked in and the “chic King” suite that was advertised turned out to be a junior suite. I went to the front desk to say what happened and they told me they can’t guarantee a King Suite when it comes to Airbnb reservations. The host said they would be in contact to fix the situation the following day, and I heard nothing from anyone until the end of my stay. Host tried to contact me once while I was busy, and when I returned the call, more than once, nobody picked up. I have requested some compensation back for the false advertising and bad communication, and still I have heard no response from anybody. Not very adaptable, agreeable or trustworthy hosts. Would not book with them again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we got there around midnight (hosts knew beforehand, early in the booking), front desk told us they were overbooked, which confused us because the room was supposed to be available for our arrival. They offered us to spend the night in a different hotel, but it was several streets away— concerning since we had our luggage with us and being out with that in the middle of the night is no-no, especially for foreign tourists. The hosts had sent an email to the hotel, but we still had to pay for an Uber, and head to the Cambria hotel, whose manager was very kind and understanding of our situation, and we spent the night in a nicely decorated room— the next morning, we were allowed to leave our bags secured in the hotel, prior to finally checking in Regency. There, super kind front desk lady Aloha gave us a five star service with her charming and considerate attitude, giving us a lovely room, and coupons to compensate for the initial inconvenience from the hotel. Thanks for having us 🙏🏼"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were so lovely and everything was perfect about the place!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about At Mine and the establishment they set me up in. I went to an event that I had wanted to attend for months and my location had to be close to the stadium where it was taking place. At Mine had a place three blocks away.
At one point, I was trying to plan my trip on an internet location map (which was showing me the wrong location). I called At Mine and they explained to me how to get to my destination and exactly where it was. That's right, At Mine was more helpful than the internet!
The suite itself was pristine, safe and in a really great neighborhood. Lots of stuff to do inside the building and in the surrounding neighborhood.
Most importantly, At Mine was right there for me from the time I made the reservation until I checked out. They were like an angel looking over my shoulder!
I would absolutely highly recommend At Mine to my family and friends and I plan to use them again and again in the future."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't choose any other listings. This one is worth your money and time.
Super responsive host. Above and beyond to check in with me to make sure everything is Ok. I always felt supported and knew help was just a message away.
Great location. Walkable distance to downtown Milwaukee. Lots of restaurants, even late at night on a weekday. Must try: Fil Fil. The owner will go above and beyond to make the best meal for you. $20 for a bowl but it was 2.5 meals for me.
Worth the price. Cheaper than getting it directly with the hotel.
The only feedback I'd say is, wifi was a little slow. Lots of lags on Zoom. Great thing there's Starbucks downstairs. Plenty of room to work downstairs. I didn't mention this during my visit because it wasn't too big of an issue for me. This is more of a hotel issue vs. the listing management.
Will for sure recommend this listing with others and also check out their other listings around the country."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful stay for a weekend trip! Really appreciated how the front desk host Aloha went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The price point was incredibly reasonable for the quality of the stay!

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was as pictured and described. It was clean with a comfortable bed and had good quality towels and linens.

Everything is conveniently located within walking distance and there are reasonable parking options available if you choose not to use the valet or self-service parking.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great AirBNB choice — you can’t go wrong! Great location, easy access, lots of free on-street parking on S Barclay Street (all day every day as far as we could tell). Building is safe, neat, and convenient. The pull-out sofa bed was comfortable enough. The only flaws are: Not enough light in the bedroom and living room, something overhead or more in-room lighting. Also, there were no teaspoons, for preparing coffee, just two large soup spoons, those were the only spoons. And not enough hooks in the bathroom. Put a few on the back of the door! Overall great, though!! O’Lydia’s tavern is a block away and wonderful!!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice place

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Johns place was great. He made check in super easy. We were in town visiting family and our original place didn’t work out and he allowed us to check in a little early. The parking was easy street parking but never felt like my car wasn’t safe. Clean place with lots of space for a one bedroom. We had a great stay and would stay here again

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A beautiful space and much larger than expected
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost the place was nice. It’s near the Milwaukee river which has very scenic views and routes which I liked the most. The apartment was nice. The only main problem was there was very little lighting. The kitchen, bathroom and closet were the only places that had overhead lighting. There were lamps but they didn’t really suffice to my liking. One of the lamps in the bedroom was very dim so we really only had one lamp in the bedroom. The bed was “okay”. Very soft and malleable. In the kitchen the only thing I found inconvenient was only having one fork to eat with. I visited with my partner so sometimes he had to eat his food with a spoon instead.
The only other issue is the location. Which has nothing to do with the host but it’s something to look out for when staying. Me and my partner went on a walk down to the Milwaukee river and found two cars that had been broken into. Their windows were busted out and their belongings were on the ground.
It’s a nice stay."

The building is great. It’s very secure and safe feeling. You are also in a perfect location. Walking distance to the historic 3rd ward across the river which has everything. Very short walk to the ‘up and coming’ warehouse type area with lots of really cool restaurants and bars. The restaurant at Iron Horse, Morel, Odd Duck, and Toast are excellent! The area is very safe to walk around. John was also excellent with communication and was quick to respond to our needs and questions during our stay. Recommended!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John’s place was a very comfortable stay! The place was extremely clean and had the necessities. The unit may look a little larger in the photos due to the lens, however they are still accurate and there is still plenty of room! It is a cozy stay with a nice view out of the window. Around the area there are many attractions, restaurants, and shops that are just a few blocks away! John was super kind and even accommodated our request for an early check-in. After notifying him that I would be bringing my service animal, he was happy to have her. The one con of this unit is that the walls are pretty thin however, that is nothing that John can control! If you prefer to drown out any noise, having the TV on was a great way to do this. Communication was great and the space was perfect for our short stay. Overall we had a great stay and really appreciated John’s willingness to accommodate and be available when needed!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John's place is great! It's perfect for a long weekend or extended stay in Milwaukee. (I'm not sure if he allows children, but I could easily see a couple with their baby staying in his place as well.) Check-in was easy and well-communicated, the place was very clean and has a fun industrial feel. The location is also great. There's a bunch of restaurants/bars/coffee shops nearby, and it's a 10 minute or less walk to the main street of the third ward! I would recommend and stay here again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We want to personally thank John for working with us due to an extenuating circumstance. It turned out that on the day of our arrival we had to cancel due to a family situation. We reached out to John and he said he would try to rent the unit and refund us what he was able. John recently messaged that we had received a substantial refund. Certainly John was under no obligation to make these extra efforts. We believe his actions demonstrate his integrity as a super host and are most appreciative. Not all hosts would go to these lengths to support guests. Thank you!
John and Ellyn Wrzeski"

The parking was interesting as some streets were dark but I felt safe entering/staying in the apartment alone. The building is well lit, has a keyed entrance and other tenants were helpful.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent clean stay in a bustling area. Perfect for walking!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had my eye on this place for a retreat to have easy access to everything but a quiet place to focus, and the lofts did not disappoint. 5 stars for everything that Airbnb asks for, but with many things juggling at once and a heavy mind, I saw first light peaking through the blinds and decided sleeping wouldn’t be worth what was on the other side of the darkened window. You can’t put a rating on seeing Hoen Bridge at 530am still celebrating the city of Milwaukee as the KK and Menomonee River ebb and flow with the vast waters of Lake Michigan under a deep orange hue of sunrise - while Buddha smiles in the corner.
Stylish, equipped, and throw a stone and you’re there.
Great place for those that want that retreat that is in the mix but do not want to sacrifice luxury, or the chance for Buddha to smile on your day."
