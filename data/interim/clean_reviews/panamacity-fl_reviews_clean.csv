2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable little studio is so convenient to everything in Panama City. I could tell Elizabeth put in so much effort to make sure the space is safe, cozy and comfortable. It was truly my home away from home for 4 nights. I loved being able to do laundry. And everything was well stocked. The bed was firm, but that’s how I like it. And my favorite part, just a 5 minutes drive down Cherry street and you can sit on a bench and watch the sunset over St. Andrews Bay. If you’re staying in Panama City, this is a lovely spot to lay your head."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, quiet and convenient! This space was perfect for a quick weekend getaway.
Things to note:
The shower is tiny. Ladies, shave before you visit.
The bed is quite firm.
The AC is a window unit - great if you sleep to white noise (we do), but might be a bit loud otherwise.
Thank you for a great stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth is a great host, very friendly with good communication. Place is 100% as described, feels like home. Very nice decor, shower is a bit small so keep that in mind as pics show, everything else is perfect, highly recommended!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The studio was perfect for us. I have traveled with kid (12 years old). Furnished nicely, everything at hand. The location is very quite and pleasant, 20-30 min drive to St. Andrews or Panama City Beach. We enjoyed the garden very much, too. All in all, highly recommended."
2022-09-01,2,Stayed one night,The Communication with the host was horrible it seemed like she was trying to be a smart ass with us we thought we had booked for 2 nights but we didn’t when she came over and told us about it she rudely said you have 10 minutes to leave .
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay! Very clean, everything you need (coffee, washer/dryer, etc) and easy communication.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay smaller than a hotel room but better than a hotel room
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great space overall. But be very mindful of the description given for the shower specifically... It IS very small overall and depending on the size of the person they may not be able to fit through the opening or inside of it. Totally did utilize the kitchen and the washer and dryer and all is as described and what was in the pics. It was a very comfortable space overall.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It really is a super nice place, very clean and tidy with everything you need to enjoy the walk. There are Sercano of nice places to eat and enjoy the beaches. It is really a blessing that these spaces exist to stay"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy space! We came for a short staycation and were NOT disappointed. The cottage is in a quiet location, easy to find, and has a welcoming vibe. The host is available if you need her, but allows you to be to yourself and feel secluded during your stay. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and Michael were very friendly and welcoming. It was wonderful chatting with them. Jan had baked goods for us upon arrival. Their backyard was large and fenced; perfect for our dog.
Their guesthouse was exactly what we wanted. Thank you Jan and Michael for your kindness and generosity! All the best."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you Jan’s for your great hospitality and warm, comfortable home.
I would definitely visit again"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I had an amazing trip! The accommodations were fantastic! I am a single female and sometimes get nervous staying at places alone. I felt very safe here. Jan and Michael were so nice! Their animals were super cute too! My dogs came with me and loved the backyard. Jan was super friendly and shared lots of goodies with me and the pups! She’s a fantastic baker! I can’t wait to come back again! It was a wonderful experience!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Jan’s place. It was super clean and cozy. Cookies she baked were great! Jan was very friendly and responsive. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay with Jan and Michael was wonderful, probably the best air bnb experience yet. Guest house was so clean, cozy and had everything we needed and more. Jan left helpful notes all over the house and we were greeted with some delicious cookies. They were extremely accommodating with our two pups and gave us great local recommendations! Would definitely stay again if ever in the PCB area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and Michael were wonderful hosts! They made you feel like you were staying as family, not strangers. The little touches, such as easy communication, baked goods, beautiful garden backyard, and welcoming to pets, made you feel welcome. This was a great place for my parents to relax and spend time with family in town. Thank you Jan!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great, we really like the cookies they baked for us. This space is really peaceful and we loved the garden area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Michael are just the best hosts! This was our second stay with them. They really saved us on a trip where within 30 minutes of departure for driving 8 hours to close on a new house in the area, our original place to stay fell though. Jan to the rescue! When my husband and I got there, we both said it felt like home. The space is comfortable and when I say clean, I mean sparkly clean! If you forgot your shampoo or toothpaste, don’t worry, Jan’s got you covered. We just love the neighborhood and the proximity to lots of good restaurants. But most importantly, we consider Jan and Michael friends."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan and Michael were phenomenal hosts! Their hospitality and attention to detail were top notch! There were welcoming gifts of baked goods and we were able to sit and chat with the hosts while sharing a beverage. We will definitely be back to stay again for our next event in the area!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the finest stay yet at any airbnb. Beautiful high quality fit and finish throughout. Perfect location for us to visit family. Lovely fenced yard for the dogs, comfortable clean space, all needs met, nothing left out. Fantastic!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and Michael are the perfect hosts. Friendly and truly thought of everything one could need while visiting…And a plate of cheesecake to boot. Beautiful area and beautiful yard! We felt so welcomed and safe - they were super helpful with things to do in the area and restaurants to consider. The guest house itself is easy to access, comfortable and very quiet. I consider Jan and Michael friends now and will visit again soon."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The best place to stay at panama city!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience. Nice and comfortable place and cleanliness was absolutely amazing. I’ll definitely recommend Jan’s place. Thanks Jan for being an amazing host and making our stay comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and her husband Michael are wonderful hosts. The guest house was lovely, spotless, and comfortable. Staying with them was a breath of fresh air. If we ever come back this way, we won’t miss an opportunity to stay with them again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and Michael’s place is an absolute dream to stay in. Jan even noticed we were vegan in our bio and baked us a vegan cake to welcome us to our stay! There is so much attention to detail (aloe, electrolyte packets, a gift basket with doggie bags, board games, books, puzzles, I could go on and on!). They were so welcoming and kind and were so gracious with our dogs- who are very sweet, but have a tendency to “sing” from time to time, and even played fetch with them! They have dog toys for your pups in the yard, which is just a beautiful and serene space all on its own. It was such a cozy space that felt so homey and safe. I highly recommend staying with Jan and Michael, we would do so again without hesitation :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A fantastic find. We loved everything about this place. It was quaint, quiet, and cozy! Jan was a great hostess that left cookies for both us and our pup. Her backyard garden is something to envy, it was peaceful and beautiful. Highly recommend staying at their place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything in Jan's listing is as described. The guest space is filled with all the things big and small that you will need to enjoy your stay. Her yard/garden is a beautiful backdrop and is truly a sanctuary. Look forward to staying again when we come to visit our daughter who is at Tyndall.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan does an exceptional job creating a welcoming and relaxing experience at her Airbnb. The rooms are very comfortable and the yard is beautiful. The house is within walking distance to the bay and a short drive to great beaches.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have way too many words for this review. From the moment My reservation was made she began her care. She she left treats for my dogs and me.. The space was supremely clean. It had literally everything you could think of that you may have forgotten at home. They played with my dogs they took me to the Bay. She took pictures and sent them to me and videos. Her Garden was an absolute dream. Jan and Mike are so sweet and accommodating at every turn. I enjoyed them so much I extended my stay 3 extra days. They are absolutely the most perfect hosts in the most perfect space and this was the most perfect space.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan and Michael's stay was the perfect getaway for my spouse, pup, and me! We all enjoyed our time in Panama City, and especially appreciated the hospitality provided during our stay. We hope to visit again soon!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"easily the best experience I have had with AirBNB... clean, quaint, comfortable, with a great location and the best hosts ever..."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jan will help you any way possible. Above and beyond
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan is an incredible host! Her quaint guesthouse is full of personal touches that will make you feel right at home. Her enormous backyard is perfect for kids, animals, or even just relaxing. The location is amazing, walking distance to the beach and an incredible park for kids. And only a few minute drive to Historic St. Andrews area. We had an amazing time and will certainly be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan is the GOAT! We arrived at a beautiful space and found homemade cookies and a handwritten note! She was very attentive making sure we didn't miss out on anything we needed during our stay! The actual best! Yeehaw!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing time during my stay. Everything was local and close. Would definitely stay at this listing again and again. It was worth it
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great and clean
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely stellar! Perfectly clean, great amenities, luxurious master suite, very peaceful. And Raymond is a very friendly and helpful host. 25 minutes to the beach, 1 hour from several beautiful state parks, grocery store 5 minutes away, and lots of good food within a short drive. Couldn’t ask for more, 10/10 👏"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed in the master bedroom, can’t recommend this place enough - this is why I check Airbnb when traveling, to find places like this that feel like you haven’t left the comforts of home behind"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a perfect Airbnb. Immaculate. Thanks for making a place feel like home for us out there on the road. If and when life brings me back to Panama City, I'll be staying at Raymond and Eloisa's place.
Thanks again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I hardly get any decent sleep my first night at a new environment, but this was a different experience for me, felt right at home the first day. Everything was perfect just as it was described. The master bedroom which I booked was massive, very clean bath, shower and towels….supplies were more than sufficient. Definitely worth every penny. I absolutely recommend this. Good job Mr. Raymond."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is your home away from home type of vibe. The host is very respectful and responds quickly to all inquiries and requests. Highly recommended home!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall The Stay Was Just Like Home Away From Home!!! I Most Definitely Would Stay Again & Recommend It To Anyone Visiting The Panama Florida Area!! 😉😊😉
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful home and so beautiful. Daniel was so sweet and helpful. Very responsive. would highly recommend staying here.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. The tiny home is immaculately presented. Clean and neat. The king-size
bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable.. No both sides of the bed had charging ports for phones, etc. The washer and dryer was a wonderful amenity for a tiny home. The neighborhood is mixed with new builds and older homes. Parking is safe and secure. Was exactly what I was needing for my weekend checking out the springs in the area… Thank you! ."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful home to spend a weekend getaway. Would definitely spend another trip here
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and clean. Loved that it was on the bay side, and had a walkable area near the water. It was perfect size for my husband and I. It took about 15 minutes to get to St Andrews state park, which was beautiful! Nice to visit the ""touristy"" area then retreat back to the quiet. It felt comfortable and clean. Would stay again when we come back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful home we really enjoyed it very clean

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay for my wife's birthday was amazing as soon as we walked through the door we knew we made a great choice. This was my first time using an Airbnb and I'm so happy we chose this home it was the most romantic and peaceful place to come home to after a long fun day at the beach or after having adventures. The shower was heaven and the accomodations was very much used and enjoyed. Thank you Daniel for making us have a home away from home experience.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel responded to any of my concerns almost instantly throughout the trip. The home was amazing to stay in and was exactly what I had expected. Everything was very well kept and accommodating. I would highly recommend this house and would definitely book with Daniel in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a pleasant stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're like me and want to visit Panama City without staying in a condo and want something a bit more private and quiet, this place was great! Daniel was super responsive and helpful any time I had questions. The place was spotlessly clean and comfortable with everything I needed. It wasn't huge but at the same time, it wasn't cramped - everything just worked great. Definitely would stay here again if I'm in the area again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay for a great price!! this place was perfectly sized for me and my boyfriend, perfect for couples!! The airbnb was perfectly cleaned when we got there and we didn’t have any trouble with our stay!! definitely would stay again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was amazing and I had a great time in Panama City, the hosts were really nice people and the place was really clean and was worth every penny i spent"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay here a week after my first. So glad I didn't book a hotel, these hosts are fantastic. On my first stay, I asked for a small table in my room, and this stay, they had a nice desk with a lamp so I could read in my room. They really do listen and act on suggestions. The neighborhood has sidewalks, so it was nice to take a walk after it cooled down in such a nice and safe place. I very much would recommend this wonderful and peaceful place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience with Air B&B, and it was fantastic. I came to town to be in a school course over the weekend and this was a perfect choice over a hotel. My hosts were so very nice and very accommodating, beyond what I expected from a host. It was nice to mingle a bit whit them, but it was clear, they new when to leave me to myself and gave me space to do my studies. How nice too, that my first stay with this company was with such wonderful hosts. Very highly recommend this place, the room and shared space is very nice and well equipped. Seriously, I didn't expect all that to be offered. You don't get that in a hotel."

Can't wait to book them again on my next trip to the panhandle!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place with wonderful people! Easy commute to town and beaches. Lots of hiking trails within a 20min drive. Just the right distance from town to enjoy the quiet! If you’re looking for a place to stay while in PC, I’d recommend here instead of some average hotel! Plenty of privacy if that’s your thing, but great conversation, company and great nights having family dinners and sharing stories!

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this was a cozy cottage to relax in. However, there were a few hiccups. Upon arrival, I had to ask for the check in code instead of having it readily available beforehand. The house was fairly clean but I did come across some spider webs here and there. There was a nail sticking out in front of the bathroom from the floor boards, which I stepped on accidentally. The drains did not properly work leaving me to figure out how to wash dishes etc. Lastly, the air conditioner did not work leaving us to be extremely hot. However, There was a nice scenery to the house and I enjoyed that subscriptions were already available on the tv and how there was a mini back yard for us to relax in and the host had a fast response time."

The decor was so classy and we could tell that much thought went into preparing it for guests. The bed was so cozy and the bedroom very spacious. Bathroom was very nice too and had washer/dryer, extra hygiene goods, and a blow dryer. The kitchen had a lot of resources to cook with as well and had a full sized fridge.

Ricky and Juliet have done a great job providing a safe well thought out home with the comfort of their guests in mind. We would recommend this spot for a 1 night stay +
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looked like the pictures. Hosts live right next door but was quiet and very accommodating. The palm tree in the driveway and plants hanging over the walkway could use some pruning. It was a bit of a pain to walk from the driveway to the apartment with the plants in the way. It was raining during my stay and the plants wet my clothes every time I walked by. Overall it was a comfortable stay while I was in town for work. I would stay here again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ricky’s space was perfect for our little family of four. The kids (6 and 3) enjoyed bunking together and feeding the koi fish on the patio every morning. Very close to Hunt’s Oyster Bar (one of my favorites). Only a 20 min drive back across the bridge to Panama City Beach and St. Andrew’s Park where we spent the days on the beach. Without traffic it probably would have only been about a 12 min drive but it was the week of the Fourth so there were lots of people in town. Highly recommend!

The place is quiet and clean. Good for a break after the trip.

I liked the detail of getting up in the morning and being able to make a delicious coffee or tea. (there are some basic pantry things)
The garden is ideal for spending time thinking or reading a book

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn't have been happier with this adorable Airbnb cottage. I was trepidatious the first time up the ladder to the sleeping loft but after that felt safe and secure. The setting is beautiful and quiet except for singing birds which I love.

The main issue we had was the cottage is on their property, essentially between their residence and their shed. We arrived to them doing yard work and felt like each day they were busy doing house work. No privacy at all."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this place! Super clean and so cute!!! Place looks exactly like the pictures! Mark was right there for any questions or concerns!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful AirBnB’s we’ve stayed in. The cottage is even more beautiful than the photos, and Mark and Tina have thought of everything. The cottage is about 25 minutes drive from Panama City Beach and has everything you could need. We particularly loved the outdoor area, and were grateful to relax with a fire after a long day exploring. Bathroom needs a mention too - as one of the most spectacular we’ve ever seen in a small space!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I’s stay here was excellent in every way. The cottage is cozy and comfortable… it feels very spacious for a “tiny house.” The bathroom especially is a great size.
The location of this cottage is also great… a short drive to the beach, parks, and a wide variety of restaurants and shopping areas.
Also, we found the hosts to be very easy to communicate with. Mark and Tina are great people and hosts!

Lynn Haven is a short drive (20mins) from the beautiful beaches of PCB. We really enjoy St. Andrew State Park.
Our host also recommended the “Jet Ski Dolphin Tour”, which we were looking into. We got to see many dolphins and even saw 3 jumping out of the water. Then, we spent some time on shell island. This was definitely a highlight of our trip.
Thanks again for the pleasant accommodation. We will see you next time!

We slept on both the loft bed and pull-out couch bed; the loft bed was comfortable. The wooden ladder to get up into the loft to sleep was challenging at first, but I got the hang of it, plus the ladder is very durable and sturdy. The location was very safe and conveniently located.

I loved sleeping in the loft! The bed and pillows are super comfy and I slept great. The ceiling of the loft is pretty low, so if you're tall, you may not be able to sit up straight on the bed. It's a very fun and cozy space!
There were lots of little touches that were so nice, like water and fresh ice in the fridge, snacks and coffee pods on the counter, really soft and fluffy towels. The outside seating area is also beautiful and comfortable.
I have nothing negative to say. I stay in Airbnb's frequently and the tiny house is one of the best ones I've ever stayed in. I hope to stay there again when I'm visiting family in the area. I loved it!"

Location was perfect, easy to get anywhere in PCB. Communication was so easy, Tonya introduced herself and told us to let her know if we needed anything and to make ourselves at home. They gave us space the rest of the time we were there. We did not want to leave! Thanks for sharing your beautiful home."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who has been to Panama City on many, many occasions—I’ve stayed at numerous kinds of places; beach houses, hotels, and condos of all kinds.
This by far has to be the best place I stayed at, especially for what I paid.
The amenities at this location are unmatched for the price. And frankly, Tonya and Ken are some of the best Airbnb hosts I've ever had. Check-in instructions were extremely clear, the property itself was gorgeous, and the check-out instructions were refreshingly straightforward and simple.
Although I was traveling for work, whenever I was at the place it truly felt like I was on vacation!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a clean and cozy place. The owners were very responsive to anything that we needed during our stay. Perfect for two people! I wish we would have had time to take a dip in the pool; it looked so inviting and very clean!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya made our arrival very special with a warm welcome and little touches. She is warm and gracious. The boat house was just as described, a bit spacier (is that a word?) than expected. Although toucked into a neighborhood, the backyard felt like a private oais. Too cool to swim, we did enjoy the hot tub one evening. Would recommend for a quick, quiet get away."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"a beautiful gem in Panama City close to all the cool stuff in St. Andrews!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya’s place was wonderful, even more beautiful than the photos. The outdoor space was amazing, and despite being a shared property we had plenty of space and privacy. Tonya was easy to in touch with and made checking in and the whole stay a pleasure.

Also, if you need a car headlight bulb replace, Ken is your man!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is the place to stay! The only thing i wish I could’ve changed was the fact that we came here during the winter instead of summer :) the airbnb is exactly as listed and feels very private and safe. The space is beautiful and comfy. We loved the hot tub and used it almost every night— probably our favorite amenity! Hosts were responsive and helpful and made the stay very welcoming. It’s about 20 minutes away from the beach and anything you need is within a 15-minute radius. We recommend looking at the recommendations listed in their binder for some good local spots to hit. Will try to book again during summer!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya and Ken’s guest house AKA Ivy Palms Resort / Retreat is one of those hidden gems of Panama City.
It was such a delight to meet them and they gave me the warmest of welcomes.
They’ve went above and beyond to make the guesthouse a magical experience. The design is nothing short of impressive and it’s integration with the pool and resort aesthetic, from colors , to textures, and patterns, they’ve put a lot of hard work and dedication to give guests like me an amazing experience.
Thank you Tonya and Ken!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Dear future guests, we are happy for you! We almost don't want to write our review because we want to selfishly keep this treasure all to ourselves. But what kind of friends would we be to not wish them the prosperity they clearly deserve. 💌 Tonya & Ken have placed such thoughtful attention to details. The serenity and comforts you are surrounded with will make you want to stay for much longer than you booked. Look no further. You have found your little private oasis in Panama City.

A very convenient location to restaurants and shopping. A beautiful drive to Panama City Beach, 20 to 25 minutes away depending on where you’re going. The bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen is perfect with all the amenities that you need and more! The AC in the pool house was amazing, and wonderful to walk into especially in the hot summer months. I will absolutely stay here for any future visits to Panama City Beach.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Airbnb of very high quality. Comfortable, safe, functional accommodation. Access to the courtyard and the possibility of using all facilities is a plus.
Tonya and Ken are friendly, always available while remaining discreet.
Tonya's proposals for places to visit are relevant.
Even though Tonya mentioned, the unreliability of the wifi network is unpleasant and would deserve improvement.
In short, we had a lovely week and would definitely recommend it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! The place was very clean and well equipped with everything we needed. A real Oasis in the city.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a “home away from home” feel during my stay. The home was centrally located, ideal for all my needs, and provided easy access to many places. The affordability was by far one of the best in the area. The amenities offered a relaxing atmosphere which I wish I would have taken more advantage of if it weren’t for my busy schedule. This owners have placed their personal touch on this home…and it shows! It was evident that they put their heart and soul in this amazing place!"

The property and pool house were adorable, comfy, and inviting. I wish we would’ve been able to spend more time hanging out there. Also, there was the sweetest cat that hung out with us anytime we were poolside!
Only downside is the internet connection wasn’t great so we weren’t always able to connect the Roku tv (but that may have been user error).
Tonya has created a beautiful, convenient, and affordable experience!"

A nature lovers utopia, lots of cute small lizards, frogs, birds, and 2 adorable cats!! The hot tub was a great way to soothe those aching muscles after a fun day of snorkeling and kayaking at St. Andrew's State Park, just a short 20 minute drive from this paradise! Every corner, nook and cranny of the backyard was meticulously thought out and harmonizes...a calm sanctuary. If you value a peaceful and quiet neighborhood, you'll feel like you're in heaven here!! Tonya and Ken are down to earth, friendly, fascinating and just great people!

We will never stay anywhere else in the area.

Ken & Tonya are such amazing hosts! 10/10 recommend & will be back as many times as we’re allowed!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cutest space to unwind and enjoy the sun. The location is great as well close enough to the beach and other activities.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Tonya's pool house. Perfect location for my needs. Near a Publix and food options. Quiet, clean and cozy. The bed and bedding was very soft and nice. Huge bathroom and plenty of hot water. Kitchen was very efficient and I loved having the Keurig style coffee maker, I used it everyday. I did not use the pool or hot tub but they looked wonderful, I would use if I stayed again and had the time! Tonya had excellent communication and was very hospitable.
Just a couple of things to note: the smoke alarm does go off easily when cooking on the stove! Also, the WiFi is a bit spotty...but this is told ahead of time in the information on the booking.
I would definitely stay again! :)"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to say very nice people and very quiet
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place!! Very clean!! Great friendly host, wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks for everything"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jonathan was a great host. The house was very comfy and convenient to everything we wanted to visit. Will definitely rent again if we are ever back around Panama😊
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Jan and Michael’s place. They were so friendly and made us homemade cheesecake. The place was very clean and homely. Place was very dog-friendly. Our dog loved the backyard. Beautiful area and home! Thanks
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful oasis. This place is so convenient to everything. Jan is a wonderful host.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan’s place was incredible, she baked us homemade lemon bread that was amazing and her place was stocked with anything you could need, definitely recommend this place!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great communication, easy check in and check out.
The house is located in a great location"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I read every 5 star review before I booked. And here I am, writing another 5 star review. It's all true: immaculate, inviting, comfortable, relaxing. Jan and Michael are kind people and it shows. I would book here again in an instant!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great to stay at for the weekend! The place was very clean and very private. They had tons to offer in the house from dishes to even a Wii gaming console to play on the tv! We will definitely be back to stay here again! Thank you guys!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Far enough from the main strip that everything is nice and quiet. Close enough that getting to the dog friendly area of the beach is just a short drive. We'll definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A HUGE thank you to Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike for making our stay the most wonderful relaxing first ever stay in an airBnB rental. We loved every minute we were there. We arrived very late and we didn’t quite know what to expect with it being our first time and all, but when we arrived we felt extremely comfortable and happy to have made it there after a long drawn out drive. We were welcomed with fresh delicious sopapilla cheesecake, a nice Florida souvenir gift basket, and some nice treats for our fur babies. The home was emaculate with thoughtful touches everywhere. I was in awe of everything!
The back yard is a nature lovers dream with plenty of gorgeous flowers and with birds and squirrels and occasional turtles. Our fur babies loved the back yard and we felt comfortable letting them roam around in it off the leash with it being fenced. I want to call this place a tropical oasis with the beach or bay within a block away and parks, restaurants, and more also nearby.
No hotel can compare to our stay here. We were so relaxed here. We highly recommend! We are thankful to have met Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike and we are thankful to have found their rental when we did. We hope to come again one day.
A million “thank you’s” to Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike for everything…"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jan is so kind and thoughtful. She is absolutely the best host we have experienced! The house is neatly organized with everything we need for a short visit. Small notes everywhere and heart-warming welcome gifts. Her garden is truly an oasis and I enjoyed reading in the shade and watching the trees, birds, squirrels, turtles, and our puppy having a good time. Close to the beach and a dog park. We had a great time exploring the area and relaxing in the house."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Michael were so gracious and welcoming. We were more relaxed and comfortable with them in their gorgeous guest home than we ever were at the condo we stayed in the prior 5 days of our vacation in PCB!! We were in complete awe of everything feom the gorgeous guest house to the scrumptious citrus brownies that were devoured by all within the hour of our arrival. There were other snacks and drinks provided that made our stay so welcoming. We felt right at home and have already planned our next vacation with them. Even after speaking to them for only a little while, they left us a little something to take home for our fur babies that didn't make this trip. If it was possible I would rate Jan and Michael 10+ stars!! And their adorable fur babies were so sweet! Jan and Michael went above and beyond and we couldn't be happier 💗 See you all next year!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,fantastic place! 110% recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They’re such beautiful people, they have a really clean and cozy home, my family and I enjoyed very much our time there. Hopefully we will go back there in the future. They have amazing garden & backyard. Home puzzles 🧩 & board games were blast. We never had to turn on tv . Jan’s homemade cookies sweeten up our vacation . THANK YOU FOR YOUR SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY , God bless you & your husband"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Michael both were incredibly gracious and helpful from the beginning. From recommendations to drying towels, we knew we could depend on them! If you are looking for an experience that you will enjoy - look no further!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Good
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,They are a perfect example of how a host should be.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I would recommend to everybody to book with them! Stay a whole week and you’ll definitely not want to go home. Their home is so beautiful and has some great naturalistic views
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am seriously so thankful we stayed at this gem of a place. Jan & Michael are the most gracious hosts! They are very quick & helpful with questions and suggestions. The house & grounds are absolutely beautiful! It is very clean & comfortable. Jan has every toiletry you could need, as well as snacks, water, coffee, etc. The location was an extra blessing, as it afforded us nearby areas to swim in the Bay area, when the main coastal beaches were closed due to red flag rip tide warnings (it stormed off and on the three days we were in the area). There were many other activities for us to do. We recommend St.Andrew’s State Park. We walked the beaches there (even in the rain); It was beautiful and very close by. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Michael’s place is a little beach oasis!! What a gem! If you have the opportunity to stay here, take it! It’s a wonderful little addition to their home, two very spacious bedrooms with comfortable queen beds, a large bathroom, living room, and small kitchen area including a fridge, keurig, sink, and microwave. Jan has everything you could possibly need for your trip/stay from chips for snacking to extra toiletries! There’s also beach chairs and beach towels to borrow if you need them! She also made homemade lemon pound cake with the lemons from her backyard which was amazing!!
Lastly their backyard is one of a kind! Her flowers and the plants are absolutely beautiful! She also has two cats, a doggo, and 12 turtles outside! My favorite part of our stay was sitting in the backyard listening to the birds sing and reading my book. We can’t wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very nice airbnb option! The space is on property with the owners, but the rental is private space. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. They had anything you could need or may have left at home available for use."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! If it’s your first time doing Airbnb like it was ours make the leap and go with Jan and Michael!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both Jan and her husband were fantastic hosts! They were both friendly and cared about our needs should we have any questions. Jan is ready for ANYTHING and even left us homemade cookies as well as treats for all of the furry friends we brought along with us! Not only is the space perfect for any kind of visit you plan to have but their garden is to die for! I will 100% be back to their location, should there ever be any other openings😅"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 3rd or 4th time staying at Jan and Michael's. It is always a pleasure. We will be back soon.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything you could possibly need Jan has. From shampoo for the pups to beach chairs and delicious treats when we arrived. 10/10 would recommend
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about this place. And there is absolutely nothing bad to say AT ALL! Everything you needed was there, perfect and clean, quiet and convenient!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brewzer (my fur baby) and I had such a great time staying here! Even though he didn’t use much of it, he had so much space to run around in outside in the yard! I absolutely LOVED hanging out there and watching all of the little critters running around! Also, Mrs Jan left us some yummy welcoming treats upon our arrival! They were so thoughtful and delicious! (I may have eaten them all my first night there 🤫) I highly recommend staying here if you’re bringing your pet/pets! Great hosts, great space, great neighborhood, 10/10 recommend! 😌"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate and charming spot for visitors that want to live like locals! The location just off Beach Drive and Lake Caroline is perfect. The suite is filled with thoughtful details and the yard is a wonderful bonus!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Jan and Mike’s place was a great experience! Jan really has the gift of hospitality. The apartment was very homey and spotlessly clean. Jan spoiled us with yummy homemade sweet treats and the apartment was supplied with everything you might need, (or may have forgotten), for your trip. They also have a beautiful private backyard for you to enjoy. Thank you, Mike and Jan, for helping to make our first trip to Panama City an awesome one!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay here! The bay was just a few blocks away with an amazing view. The back yard was really well kept and perfect for fur babies. I highly recommend staying here!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Jan's place. This is our second time and I can't say enough good things about their Airbnb. Jan has thought of everything. Walk out the door and in a block and a half you're fishing on the bay. It's perfect all the way around.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Very clean, homey, and comfortable. The yard was amazing and perfect for our dog. So many nice touches. _an goes above and beyond to be a wonderful host. We en_oyed the delicious baked goods she shared with us. Would definitely recommend, and will stay here again when we're in the area."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jan is a warm, helpful and welcoming host - she greeted us and our cats, gave us tips and even provided treats for all of us!
Her place is truly gold standard. The kitchenette is stocked and the decor is a great mix of being eclectic, adorable and personal. We loved it. There were so many thoughtful items for comfort and hygiene, and it was very clean without being at all stark.
Our cats loved watching the wildlife and pets in the yard, and had we stayed longer they would have loved walking the yard and neighborhood.
We enjoyed driving along the coast nearby, and had no trouble getting to the house or parking. The coast is so close that we walked to the bay for the sunrise before needing to hit the road!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our best AirBNB stay to date. Jan was so accommodating and the attached guest quarters were perfect. Jan has thought of everything you might anticipate needing and already added it to your accommodation. She even baked red velvet cupcakes for my daughter's 17th bday. We enjoyed our time at her home and in her beautiful yard so much we found it hard to want to go out. Our dogs enjoyed it to. They even had a family dog, a golden retriever named Danny, come over for a play date with our Dutch Shepherd. We felt right at home and look forward to staying there again next time we go to Panama City. Oh, and the one block walk to the bay beach makes for a perfect evening stroll. All around A+."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and her husband were wonderful hosts, and there was so many thoughtful touches that it felt like a home away from home! Jan made sticky buns for us (which were to die for 😋), and she told us about the salty dog day at the St. Andrews Waterfront Farmers Market. Their home is walking distance from the bay and a short drive to so many beaches. We had an amazing stay, and we wish we could've stayed longer!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Always the perfect place to stay! It just couldn’t get any better
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place. Great for fur babies too and located perfectly with things to do and restaurants not far away. Hosts were great and very thoughtful.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a true gem find. The space is well laid out and so comfy and clean. It’s charming to the point you feel you are at home next to the beach. The hospitality was first class. You don’t even have to worry if you forgot anything. I’m sure Jan would accommodate. I have stayed at several places and this is one I will definitely repeat.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Our favorite place to stay in Panama City!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Our 2nd stay at the perfect fur baby friendly place!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful location in St. Andrews, close to everything. The yard is beautiful and a great bonus with a fur baby in tow. Lovely accommodations and the sticky buns are the best. A definite must."

I recommend them and would stay there again in the future."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jan is the sweetest host. The accommodations are spotless clean and comfortable. The ambience is wonderfully warm and welcoming. Jan provides everything we needed plus much more. She even baked us cookies. The special touches are supprising and perfect. The beds are very comfortable. The bath is very clean with plenty of clean towels. . Everything works perfect. Lots of hot water for our party of 3 adults and 2 kids. I will definitely stay here again if i ever have a need to be in the area.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jan and Michael are amazing hosts. Their property is beautiful and the apartment is incredibly clean and comfortable. They've thought of every detail. Thank you guys for a great experience!!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect host!!! Extremely accommodating to our arrival time. The place was so cozy, and was at a decent distance from Panama City Beach. Perfect location to stay away from the crowds, but close enough to be on the beach by a quick drive. Beautiful spacious garden for the dogs to enjoy. Will definitely return!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! This place is in brand new condition. Host are really nice

2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here at Jan's on a whim it was a last-minute trip I didn't know what to expect out of the stay. We arrived very welcomed she made our boys some treats the place is very clean and nice I couldn't get over her backyard it was a dream. I'm so inspired now to have a green thumb. There was a lot of small touches that had a huge impact on us, the board games, the small things in the bathroom, the frozen mugs, I enjoyed reading through the notepad of other peoples stays. Not only did she make our kids treats she interacted and played with them and the morning of leaving made us all but mostly the boys lol a wonderful breakfast that they loved! We will definitely be back soon and cant wait."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won't be disappointed. Stay here and enjoy.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan was such a sweet host! We were there to celebrate my husband’s birthday and were greeted with homemade baked goods. She was SO responsive, and very generous for allowing us to borrow her beach chairs, beach bag, and towels during our stay. She made everything so easy for us. If you don’t mind driving a few minutes longer to the beach, I would definitely recommend Jan’s place (:"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. The amenities were beyond our expectations, from the peanut butter brownies upon our welcome, to the adorable pets. The location is also amazing— the beautiful bay is down the street and PCB is about 15 minutes away! Hurricane damage is still very apparent in the area, but Jan & Michael’s place is pristine. This place is a GREAT VALUE!!! Please do not pass this bnb up, the hosts are wonderful."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super friendly. Beautiful yard. Comfortable with lots of nice touches.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING!! This place is from top to bottom GORGEOUS! Mrs. Jan and her husband are incredible people! They make sure that everything goes well for your vacation. If you wake early enough you can see her beautiful turtles! The location is only 15-20 mins from the beach side of PCB! It’s a quiet and friendly neighborhood to stay at. Her backyard is truly magical and she has the cutest animals! It felt like I was truly at home for the days I spent with her! 11/10!! Let’s not forget her OUTSTANDING baking skills! She made me sticky buns for my birthday! I can’t wait to come back and see them again next year! Enjoy your time!! :)
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"While staying at Jan’s place, you can expect a quiet well maintained beach property! Jan and her husband are so nice!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Jan’s place was wonderful, very cute and very clean. Jan and her husband are great hosts and very welcoming."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan’s place is a unique piece of paradise! It is convenient to get to a lot of places and she makes it feel like a home away from home (for us and for our 2 dogs). It was a joy to communicate with her and then get to know her more during our stay.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan's place was absolutely WONDERFUL! We booked this last minute for 4th of July and WHAT A VALUE! I feel like this place is a steal! They have a beautiful back yard with so many plants, birds, squirrels, fruits and spices to investigate. Its just such a relaxing space. Inside is just as interesting with all kinds of personal touches of family art and keepsakes! Just makes you feel right at home. This house is only a BLOCK from the Bay! Very Convenient for kayakers, or anyone looking to play in the bay water. Jan and her husband were so friendly and down to earth. And man can they cook! If you are lucky enough to try some of the Homemade queso dip or Sopapilla Cheesecake TRY IT! You won't regret it. The house has the ability for lots of interaction with the host or it has a private entrance and detachment from the house so you can keep to yourself and private the whole time if you wish (but they are pretty cool people to socialise with, with lots of great local info and stories). Its in a quite, peaceful, safe nighborbhood. The surrounding town areas does still have a lot of damage from the hurricane, but obviously there is nothing they can do about that, just dont be alarmed. They have worked hard to keep their property well maintained, and we were so glad to have found this GEM! We will DEFINITELY be back!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Expect the best airbnb in all of Panama City. Jan and her husband do a great job at making you feel at home!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time doing Airbnb and I must say my experience was nothing short of amazing. Jan and her husband are good people... they made us feel right at home. And the space was just like home! And the muffins were amazing!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was super friendly and responsive when I had a question. Home was clean and convenient to where we wanted to be.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was wonderful and was just what I was hoping for a nice and friendly warm places to stay on my vacation will be hopefully returning back in July
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jakina was a fantastic host. She messaged what was needed beforehand and made sure we were on the same page. The house was beautiful, in a very small neighborhood, it was quiet and close to the freeway. Making it easy to get to the major beaches quickly."

But we loved the place! The host was great and responded extremely fast. Definitely would stay here again."

Thanks."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a clean and comfortable place to stay! A couple minor issues with the WiFi going out and the battery on the door lock keyless entry died and needed replaced. But both issues were resolved. There’s a few dogs in the area that barked in the mornings but not constantly. We had no issues with noisy neighbors and enjoyed a relaxed environment. The bed was comfy. Plenty pillows & blankets. Coffee, sugar and other kitchen items available. If you have joint issues the spiral stairs could present a problem. I just took my time and was extra cautious. We would definitely stay again."

I stayed here for one month. The house was beautiful and exactly as described. The parking was private and easily accessible. The kitchen was perfect and the back porch off the living area was a great space to hang out. 10/10 recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the standout features of staying in Lynn Haven is its convenient location. Situated just minutes away from the vibrant city of Panama City Beach, Lynn Haven provides easy access to world-class beaches, shopping, dining, and entertainment options. Yet, despite its proximity to bustling tourist attractions, Lynn Haven maintains a tranquil atmosphere, making it an ideal retreat for those seeking a peaceful getaway. Will visit Again !!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect for a short weekend getaway. Everything was just like the pictures and location was great, close enough to drive to the beach but far enough to avoid the beach traffic. The neighbors and nearby houses were not a problem at all! Me and my partner loved the design of the house, especially the spiral staircase and unique bed frame! We will definitely book again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Blake was a great host and the place was super nice
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Cute house and easy to find. Beaches and restaurants very close by, and so many to choose from. ￼we would book this home again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was awesome, host was always responsive to answer any and every question I had. I love the set up of the apartment and the location. This will be my stop whenever I’m back, I really enjoyed here"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice cute house; it was hard to locate only because the guests in the front house we’re parked in our driveway, but it was an easy issue to solve. Beware if the spiral staircase. My friend who was staying with me fell down the side hole on the 2 floor. They’re ok and its a good memory. Other than that it was a pleasant stay"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay very much. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you so much
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,😊

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent the Christmas season here for a week with family and made great memories in this place and want to book next year. Very peaceful and felt like a home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Palm Paradise was a true oasis for a relaxing and entertaining two week vacation. This two level (The spiral staircase will keep you in shape if you don't have time to workout in the garage) vacation rental sits behind it in a rather private setting in a residential neighborhood. Robust amenities and a first rate internet exist for one's needs and comforts while vacationing on the FL Panhandle. Access to groceries, retail shopping, and restaurants is minutes away. Blake and his team are fabulous communicators and responsive when you reach out. Its value cannot be overlooked for its location although it is a ways to the beaches. But sitting in north Lynn Haven one can access them as readily by actually going north on Hwy 77, then west past the airport and turning back south on Hwy 79 through West Bay to Panama City Beach. I found this far less traffic stressful, as quick, and far more scenic as it launches you onto all that Florida's Emerald Coast has to offer. Check it out!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! The neighborhood was quiet and close to plenty of shopping and restaurants. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need. The attached gym and laundry facilities were super convenient. Loved how the location was decorated; it definitely fit in with the beach vibes of Lynn Haven!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to getaway and enjoy some peace and quiet. I was happy with the Roku TV both upstairs and downstairs. Also, the kitchen was perfect and had all the cooking utensils you need. The shower does not have a light inside but it was fairly big. Everything was clean and well stocked."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here for my honeymoon and it was terrific! The house was beautiful itself, city around it was really easy to navigate so no guess work, and the beach close by was amazing to have. Unless you're trying to have a bad time, it's not going to happen."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful place nice and quiet just perfect
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very awesome place to stay. Thanks Blake!!

2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The AC went out in the guest house so we had to get a hotel. Blake was awesome and tried to accommodate with another unit he had available, but unfortunately the other unit was not nearly as nice nor big enough. We stayed one night all together out of the 3 we had reserved. Wish we could’ve stayed there the entire time, this guest house is so cute & homey! Just had an unlucky stay. I would still recommend to stay here! Love the stairs."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,place was very clean and easy to check-in to. Out stay there was perfect
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved this stay!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute and quaint place. Perfect for a small family quick stay. Good location without all the noise of the beach but within decent distance.
Negatives…no light in the shower, the sofa bed mattress is thin and uncomfortable and I ended up staying on an air mattress instead. Also, the neighbors smoke as well as have 3 dogs and outside smells like poop and cigarettes. you can also hear the dogs growling or fighting at night.
Overall it’s good for the price and I would stay there again. Hosts are extremely responsive and helpful and would rent from them anytime."
