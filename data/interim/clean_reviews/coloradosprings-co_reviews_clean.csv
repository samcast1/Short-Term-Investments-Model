2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute air bnb, it was perfect for our trip!! Whitney was super responsive & gave us tons of recommendations!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, it was just what we needed. Clean and quiet! Close to great food and Garden of the Gods. Wished it would have been open more than the one night!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Large room with great shower, linens, and selection of coffee. The refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster oven and hot play provide all the elements for housekeeping for a week. The ‚Äúchicken coop‚Äù is within walking distance to the Garden of the Gods and downtown Old Colorado.
Whitney was very responsive and provided lots of helpful information."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay here, very easy and enjoyable! The host(s) provided perfect, easy to follow instructions for everything and fantastic notes about the area, restaurants, things to do, etc. The coop was nicely stocked with everything we could have needed plus some. The chicken theme throughout made us smile and was very well done!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a really nice stay here. Comfortable bed, very clean, easy entrance. Super cute chicken theme. I wish we could give 4.5 stars instead of whole numbers: the hot water ran out pretty quickly for our showers, and the pillows were quite flat (which I suppose some folks might love but we found pretty uncomfy). Something for tall folks to note: the shower ceiling is pretty short, someone over 5‚Äô9‚Äù would probably struggle a bit."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, and great ambiance. Whitney was very helpful with suggestions and clear with instructions. Will comeback! Thanks"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot! Only thing that I would suggest is bringing either your laptop or iPad to watch shows on before bed üëçüèº
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The chicken coop has been one of the best airbnbs we have stayed. The place is better than the pictures described.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy little place only a few minutes drive to Garden of the Gods and shopping. Ideal for one person with everything you need. Parking was handy and Safeway is just a one-minute drive away. I went up to write and hike and it was a good little spot for that. Good heat (it snowed while I was there). Good hot water. Nice shower. Good wi-fi let me work and stream whatever I wanted. The only quirk was a somewhat low bathroom ceiling (I am 5'11"" tall) but it was workable. An overall a good choice for the mission I was on!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Whitney was an excellent host. Helped us in extremely quick fashion and really prepared us for our stay by giving us a local eye on the area and things to explore. The cabin was a perfect escape and met all of our needs. Will be saving this location again for the future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy spot with no TV- just what I was looking for. Tastefully decorated with lots of impressive attention detail. Clearly a much time and energy went into creating this welcoming environment. I‚Äôm looking forward to return visit when next in Colorado Springs.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love Whitney‚Äôs place the most of all my trip (14 days with 5 Airbnb stays)! Chicken Coop is very cool and clean and cozy property with just everything you need for your stay. Plus, Whitney must be an artist because she decorated her place very nice and decorative. Parking is also super convenient with a private parking right in front of the cottage. A big yard with table and chairs for morning coffee and sunset relaxation is a real value.
The location is also great, close to some best sightseeings in Colorado Springs (Garden of the Gods, Manitou Springs) with quite and beautiful neighborhoods.
One more plus is Whitney and her husband are super helpful and responsive. They‚Äôre quick to fix things when needed and provided lots of useful guides for dining, sightseeings, etc.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can see why Whitney and Brian are Super Hosts. They were very informative and were great with communication before our stay. The Chicken Coop was a fun place to stay with nice amenities and lots of little extras to make our stay comfortable...even a night light in the bathroom.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whitney is a terrific host. She is responsive and sent us a wonderful list of things to do and places to eat. The space is clean, charming and comfortable and we appreciated the snacks & coffee! Thanks, Whitney!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in the Chicken Coop.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay at the chicken coop. Very clean, and cozy. Whitney and Brian are great hosts!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute, unique space. Location cannot be beat to get to Garden of the Gods and historic Colorado City. Went with one of Whitney's recommendations for dinner: Front Range Barbecue and it was some of the best BBQ we have ever had. However, I can see how it would be difficult for someone over 6 feet tall to take a shower without bending/squatting a little bit.
Overall, we loved it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. It was so cozy, clean and exactly what we were looking for in a quiet getaway. I could live in this place. We enjoyed the space plus the outside area for morning coffee. It felt safe and homey."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was quite and lovely. This location is the reason I use AirBnB instead of hotels. It was close to Garden of the Gods. Also, easy access to Pikes Peak avoiding the crazy traffic in mid town Colorado Springs. I would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands-down the cutest AirBNB we have ever stayed in ‚Äîvery comfortable and in a great location, super clean, and private. Perfect for GOTG hiking and Pike‚Äôs Peak‚Äîa great value too for the space‚Äîso many thoughtful details. I would highly recommend to anyone and will stay here again one day!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here at the chicken coop!They really stuck to the theme and the whole place truly is adorable!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Merle‚Äôs wife:
HIGHLY recommend!!!
I absolutely fell in love with the chicken coop. From the location, private entrance, decor, amenities, and quick response from the host. (I had a small operator error initially).
They had the best reading nook with books and post cards. The bathroom was amazing and had access to bath products and other accessories. I feel as if a lot of thought and love went into the chicken coop. Even the coffee cups were cute and fun! I would definitely request a repeat stay if I ever get the chance to return to Colorado.
Reagan"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a cute convenient place to stay in the Springs. Took my teenage grandaughter for an overnight and she couldn't stop talking about how great and cute everything was.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Chicken Coop is adorable, spotlessly clean, comfortable and very relaxing! This property is very conveniently located to local eats and shops and a stones throw from The Garden of the Gods.
Whitney was very helpful, giving lots of recommendations for local restaurants and things to do as well as easy check in/out instructions.
If you‚Äôre looking for a great place to stay in CO Springs that‚Äôs quiet, comfy and clean, this it it!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, such an amazing place! The place was cute and well-designed-- a perfect balance of aesthetics and practicality. The kitchenette was well-equipped and the bathroom had quality toiletries.
The location is a big plus, you're a short drive from Garden of the Gods and a convenient distance away from Manitou Springs + Pike's Peak. We were only there for a couple of days but Whitney's place allowed us to seize the day and check off some of the destinations on our bucket list.
Most importantly, we came back ""home"" to a beautiful/relaxing place. Will book again for sure."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place! It's very cute and well-appointed. We walked to Garden of the Gods from there and it was an easy drive elsewhere. The mattress was on the soft side.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The chicken coop is every bit as adorable as it looks in the photos. We stayed just one night and took full advantage of the proximity to Garden of the Gods (where we got caught in a cute little hailstorm), the Manitou Incline, and downtown Manitou Springs. My favorite feature had to be the little reading nook. I took a bit of time to read through ""Weird Colorado"" and plan out other stops for our trip. Whitney is a great host, always responsive and ready to help with any needs during your stay. I will definitely stay here when I visit the area again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time to co springs and chicken coop had great location for pikes peak and garden of gods!
Whitney went far and beyond with info on the area and all that it offers!!
Linens were great
The coop was quiet and comfy"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I ADORED the Chicken Coop! What an amazing little place. We were so comfortable there. It was clean, well-decorated, quiet, everything we were looking for. It was fun being able to walk to Garden of the Gods. We also walked to Old Colorado Springs a few times for dinner. We would gladly stay there again. Great Place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a cute little spot to stay, and it‚Äôs very close to all the spots we wanted to visit in town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the chicken coop. Very cute and comfortable! Thanks for all the extra touches.
All of the travel tips provided were great! Very much appreciated!
One note: Enter Garden of the Gods with your car. We tried using the walking path described for us but ended up getting lost in the bike paths.
Thanks, Whittany!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Chicken Coop was so adorable. The location was incredible to get to Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. We fell in love with Old Colorado City and tried out some of their recommended restaurants. The Coop had everything we needed for a lovely stay, and then some. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay!! Very clean. Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gem! The Coop is exactly as described and pictured. Cute tiny-home custom features, feels nice and secluded tucked into the hillside. The bed is super comfy. Whitney was full of excellent suggestions about local activities and food, and gave very clear instructions about how to get to the house. We asked for some extra items beyond what would be expected, and Whitney was still quick to oblige. We‚Äôll definitely recommend the place to friends and hopefully be back ourselves. Do note that if you have a long vehicle, you‚Äôll probably need to park on the side street. Our CR-V + hitch mount bike rack was a challenge to get in & out of the little alley parking spot (but we always did it!)."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for a couple. I loved the fact that it had no TV üòÅ. It was a good location. We were just 30 mins or so from other cities. The gate door and Coop door are kinda hard to open/close(host did mention that) would be nice to repair those. Otherwise if my husband and I came back we would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coop was a blast. Located next to Garden of the Gods and so many great hikes, which was what we wanted. We absolutely enjoyed our time here in Colorado Springs. Whitney‚Äôs place was clean and just what we wanted. She was always responsive when needed but also gave us our privacy. Would highly recommend this place anytime."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for a getaway. It was quaint and exactly what we needed. I would definitely stay again the next time we visit!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brian and Whitney‚Äôs Chicken Coop was an extremely nice and quaint stay. Our first day arriving, we got to meet Brian and he was very nice welcoming us to the Coop as he was finishing up a couple of things! We also had unexpected visitors on the other side of the fence, some deer! Very relaxing and peaceful to sit outside in the mornings on the adirondack chairs with coffee in hand. So many stores and restaurants in the area that are 100% walkable! We did have an issue with the ceiling fan and Keurig being a little dirty but Whitney did send someone at the earliest convenience possible and went above and beyond to make it right! She is great at communicating and gives very fast responses! Only issue I had that isn‚Äôt their fault, it‚Äôs that I am 6ft tall and I just needed to duck under the restroom doorframe to get in as well as for the shower, but it did not take away from the experience! Highly recommend this stay if available!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is hard to beat. Just outside Garden of the Gods. Close to Old Colorado City. We had a very good time here.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Exactly like the pictures and Whitney was so sweet! Definitely would stay at the Chicken Coop again when traveling to Colorado Springs!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome location! Close to everything to see in the area. Can‚Äôt recommend enough!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Chicken Coop was a great time. Bit tricky to find since it‚Äôs hidden in the alley, but once you find it you‚Äôll never forget how to get back. The parking space was a nice perk. So close to Manitou Springs and Pike‚Äôs Peak. Had so much fun there. Highly recommend this place for a couple‚Äôs get away. Whitney was very good at communicating with us and recommended some great places to eat nearby."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is adorable and it‚Äôs clear the host put a lot of attention to detail. It was perfect for what we needed. We ran the races in town and I asked the host for a late checkout. They were extremely understanding and accommodating. I ended up winning the race!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Property was just as the listing said. It was cute and quaint. Note that as the listing describes, the parking is tight and the bathroom is small. There is also NOT a TV. We missed seeing that as not being an amenity. During my shower, the hot water went out after about 10 minutes, but heated up quickly for my husband to take a hot shower. I'm assuming its a small water heater. It was very clean and decorated very cute and the essentials for a short stay. It was comfortable and served our purpose for a one night stay. Communication was excellent."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Colorado Rockies are incredible to visit and view, especially from a quaint, homey place like the iconic Chicken Coop--a tiny house that boasts more room than one might assume. a spacious main room with kitchenette, and a fun corner nook for card playing or eating breakfast. The bathroom is a little tight for those of us over 6-ft tall, but workable. And Whitney was super helpful with A TON of local tips and info for our stay."

Not only was it the perfect size and location, but the intentionality and sweet touches in the space made it even more enjoyable. Whitney was an incredible host. She was quick and kind to respond to any questions or concerns that I had. I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and our host was very quick to respond and flexible when my sister‚Äôs wedding weekend was a little hectic. So grateful for a peaceful place to stay and the coop decorations were such a cute touch! Thanks for a wonderful weekend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to stay that is so close to everything.

Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this great location, close to everything you'd want to get to. Whitney provided a ton of detail of what the area has to offer, a great local's perspective especially for us who were unfamiliar with the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Loved the patio area and the Coop was nice and cozy. It had everything we needed and Whitney was very responsive and helpful.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about our stay at the coup! Definitely recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Whitney was absolutely on top of it. We got in from our cross country trip around midnight and was having issues in finding the place and I messed her and within minutes she‚Äôs messages and calls me to help. The place is absolutely the cutest thing and very very comfortable. The price is the best part and I‚Äôd recommend this place over any other listing near the area (unless you have family)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall really enjoyed our stay, the place was clean and the bed was comfortable. I'm not sure if this is mentioned anywhere but the only thing I would bring up is that the tallest point in the bathroom is about 6'5 inches and slopes down to about 5'6 inches to the other side. I am tall at 6'4 so the bathroom and shower was less than ideal. I could manage but I did have to duck the entire time I was in the bathroom. If you are not over 6 feet tall this should not be an issue. Thankfully everything else was great and the location was right in the middle of pretty much everything you would want to do in Colorado Springs."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can‚Äôt wait to come back! It was such a cozy little space and so close to everything I like to do! The hosts provided so many local recommendations I felt like I had my own personal travel agent, it was such a shame my trip was just a quick overnight stay this time around. I want to bring my partner back with me and really enjoy the space and area next time!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Next time we are in the Colorado Springs area, The Chicken Coop will be the first place I look to see if it is available. It is cozy and comfortable. The parking is a little tight (I have a full size truck), but not hard to get in to the spot. It is right next to the entrance. Very private. The place was very clean when we got there, and there were some little touches that make your stay memorable. It is super close to the places we wanted to go, and still not far at all from other things we found to do. Overall, it is a great place to stay, and great hosts. Whitney is great at giving you instructions on how to get in, also she sent a lot of recommendations on good places to eat, and things to do."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay (see review for previous night) I only scheduled 1 night when I needed two, so I scheduled a second night here. I wrote a review for the first reservation. This review would be the same. Bottom line, great host, great place to stay, great location. When coming to Colorado Springs again, I will check to see if this space is avail. I would gladly stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Whitney was so personable. Even with thr slight snag with check in she was honest and upfront. I would recommend any places she owned. Best owner encounter I have ever had.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whitney was very good at communicating with me. The property was very well kept and felt like home. Lots of neat touches from coffee, tee, water, creamer, dishes, pots, etc. The area was pretty quiet as well. I definitely recommend it for anyone visiting the area."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cute little place for me and my friend. We either walked (and felt safe doing so, compared to walking around in Denver) or rode Lyft/Uber to get around. This place has a weak water pressure for the shower, but the water heats up well!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As fate would have it, there was a snow storm the morning after we arrived. We had intended to walk to Garden of the Gods, but chose to drive instead. It‚Äôs a super quick ride - right down the street. Gorgeous park! Even in crazy weather. Most of the restaurants were closed bc of the weather, but the place has a nice setup for cooking light meals. üòÅ"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first AirBnB experience and wow did it set the bar high! The bed was comfy, everything was so clean, and they even left little snacks and coffee for us. Everything fit the chicken coop theme so well. They even had little post cards for us to send to family at home! They made checking out a breeze too! When we return to Colorado, we will definitely put this place at the top of our list."

Brian and Whitney were lovely hosts and had wonderful suggestions of eateries and things to do around.
We would definitely recommend the place !! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Me and my daughter made a quick stop at ""the coop"" on our way to Breck. We LOVED it! it was so quaint but at the same time so homey and had everything we needed for a nights stay. It was very clean and smelled fresh. We loved the postcards! The bed is really soft, which my daughter loved, im more of a firm girl but we both slept great! The shower gets good and hot but the water pressure is a little soft, so ladies just go a lite on the condition :) The area outdoors was really nice as well! We were so close to main street where you could eat and shop all day! We even got to see wildlife! The only warning i would give is about the parking, its tight!...if u drive a full size truck or something in comparison, i was able to get into area provided but it was a job, Whitney did offer other parking but wanted truck close and honestly it was the neighbors horse trailer across the street that made it difficult to get in&out of spot. Over all we loved and would definitely stay again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Chicken Coop. It is exactly how it looks in the pictures. I loved all the details that could be seen throughout the cabin. It‚Äôs very calming and relaxing there. If we had any issues Whitney and Brian were quick to handle it and were super sweet. The bed was super comfy, as well as the grey chair. We loved the chair so much that we want to find one for our house. The location is the perfect spot to see and do all things Colorado Springs. We came down for our anniversary and it was the perfect get away spot for us. We will definitely be staying her again and totally recommend it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little cabin. Perfect for a couple on-the-go. Dedicated parking spot makes this a stress-free stay. Super-cute interior design and decoration.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable space with a lot of character and thoughtful hosts. The Chicken Coop works if you‚Äôre the type to want a place to hang out in or just a good location to drop your bags off at. Close to Garden of the Gods and a short drive to any part of Colorado Springs this place really made our trip more memorable.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved how close this Airbnb was to GotG and the little touches in the home. It was exactly like the pictures and a wonderful place to stay while in town.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coop is cute, but not for anyone taller than 5'10- low doorways and shower height.
The location is ideal and access was easy and instructions clear.

Overall a clean and nicely outfitted space."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The chicken coop is adorable, clean, convenient, and cozy! We had a lovely night‚Äôs stay. Taller folks should know that the ceilings are a bit low in the bathroom area (this was fine for me at 5‚Äô5‚Äù). It‚Äôs a lovely little place and we a had a great time!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Chicken Coop was such a fun place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Easy access to anywhere in the area. Centrally located between Manitou and Old Colorado City at the edge of Garden of the Gods. We look forward to staying here again.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So glad we found this place instead of booking a hotel. The hosts go above and beyond and it shows! Cozy and private environment. Not far from our other planned destinations either which was a plus. Would definitely stay again :)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay in the Chicken Coop! Check-in was easy and the place was clean & cozy. Whitney was easy to communicate with and we felt right at home in our own private area. The location was perfect for a quick drive to Garden of the Gods and right near downtown.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the only ""complaints"" I could make are there is no TV and be careful going in and out of the bathroom.. at 6' tall the doorway is maybe 5' 9"" tall so I had to constantly duck to go in and out. location was amazing for garden of the gods and downtown. very quiet and plenty of space for the two of us. plenty of food and grocery options. would highly recommend if one the garden of the gods area."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is in the absolute perfect location! Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, and Manitu Springs were all within 15 minutes. The Airbnb itself was as 15/10. It was beautiful, clean, and overall we really loved staying there. I would highly recommend if it's available to snag it up, you won't be disappointed! We couldn't have been happier!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay! Airbnb matched description, easy access, safe location with the ability to walk to many restaurants & coffee shops! The stairs in the unit required a bit of focus and getting used too but weren‚Äôt bad. The place was well stocked, only thing I wish they had would be blinds on the back door, but other than that it was a great stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A well located place near the center, good communication although the internet had faults and its TV only has access with roku and few apps (I could never connect my Netflix account)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Space was as listed and would return upon trips to Colorado.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was really nice everything was just as described. In the area there is lots to do.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Photos need to be updated. Houses on either side of Airbnb are boarded up with broken windows. Porch is sorely in need of repairs.
This unit, one of four in this building, has a bedroom with an extremely low ceiling. I am 5'7"" and could not stand up without bending my neck down.
Very close to the city, easy to walk to coffee shops, bars, and stores."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"While my stay was very brief, I very much enjoyed this Airbnb. It was very comfortable and I felt right at home without feeling like I was in someone else‚Äôs space. It was perfectly kept and clean and really cool. It had everything I needed and was just great!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this location! Host was very attentive to any issues and the place was very clean!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little apartment. Super clean and comfortable. Bed is in a loft with fairly narrow curving stairs to get to. Fine for us, but if someone is older or has mobility issues, just be aware.
Had some trouble getting in the front door when we first arrived (apparently needed a separate front door code, which was accidentally not sent) and once our apt code stopped working. BUT - hosts have a 24 hour response and they immediately got back to us, so we didn't need to wait.
Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great stay. Had an issue with door entry in the middle of our stay, which was quickly resolved by contacting the emergency line."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the place. Very quiet and close to Manitu Springs and Pikes Peak. Comfortable bed and sofa.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the hospitality and effort, along with the communication from the host. Was very close to downtown so made grabbing a bite or shopping super easy. Would definitely stay again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed a week here. It was a neat experience and a great location for walking but it‚Äôs definitely made for smaller framed people. I‚Äôm about 200lbs solid andI wasn‚Äôt a fan the staircase.
It‚Äôs a great concept, and a great use of space but not ideal."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for my husband and my one year anniversary! While the previous reviews are very accurate in describing the small size and narrow stairwell, my husband and I had no difficulty and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this tiny condo. It was cozy, and the kitchen was equipped for all our cooking needs. We walked to the market and local restaurants everyday :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt very confortable, host was very attentive"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was in a very quiet location which was very nice. I enjoyed the patio area, but the stairs are very steep so I would say that could be the only downside to this stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was cute and walking distance to many restaurants and all that downtown offers. As described, the bedroom is in the loft. Just be careful when getting out of bed as the ceiling is sloped and you may hit your head. Everything was just as the photos on the listing showed. The neighborhood is very quiet."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot to stay for the weekend in the Springs! Great location walking distance to Downtown, and close to the highway to get around the area easily. The shower and sleeping loft might be tough for taller folks, but shouldn't be a problem for anyone under 6'. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive and helpful!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for couples and close to restaurants and bars
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We stayed here for a week. Was a great location for what we were looking for.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Was not cleaned prior to arrival and no solution was given by Hoste other than requesting a refund through Airbnb or refund if cleaning fee. They did refund the cleaning fee but definitely feel like they could have done more since we had to was the bedding ourselves and clean the apartment.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Next to a bunch of cool things to do, like downtown. The porch was a nice place to relax in."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great .. close to down town and a lot to do .. great for a weekend getaway

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great price for a great place to stay. Hoste was very responsive and helpful with the instructions. The place offered an amazing place to unwind and had amenities to relax after a long trip.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super nice stay, the bathroom did have a noticeable smell. However I do not believe it should detour anyone from staying!"
2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I first got there the place looked great at first sight. As I was scoping the place, I noticed the throw blanket did not smell clean, the stove was stained, & the restroom had an odd smell - enough to have to keep the window open. The restroom seemed fine, until the smell wouldn‚Äôt fade, the toilet felt wobbly, & the shower spilled water unless the shower curtain was tucked in, which only made it that much smaller and slippery. There is no curtain on balcony door, which allows others to look straight into the airbnb. The heater did not work. I had so much trouble keeping it on. I even put it on 80F to see if it would turn on & still no luck. It snowed while I stayed there, so this was not appreciated. Having to use a 3rd party to get the check in felt so unnecessary because why, after having to pay so much money, should I have to verify my identity. Other than that, location is GREAT, parking was always available, & lots of nice restaurants around."
2023-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although very close to downtown COS and walkable to restaurants, our stay was unpleasant. I was never sent the check-in instructions and had to call customer support once we arrived in COS and be transferred to an associate who was finally able to ""check us in"". The heater in the house did not work our entire stay. We walked into a very cold house and the heater clicked all night and eventually turned on ONCE but quick working again. The house did not have any extra blankets - only the sheets/comforter on the one bed - so we had to bundle up with extra clothes to stay warm for two nights. The bathroom tub was dirty and full of hair. Pots and pans were dirty with old food. The outlets in the entry way, bathroom, and upstairs bedroom near the bed did not work. The neighbors were incredibly loud and got into a fight around midnight our second night there. They were screaming, slamming internal and external doors, and moving furniture around for multiple hours in the middle of the night."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable stay for me and my boyfriend! Was in a great spot and close to lots of activities. If ever back in Co Springs will definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was very cozy, perfect for my weekend getaway. The kitchen was fit with all the listed amenities. The bed was very comfortable, I had no trouble falling asleep. The stairs to the loft are very narrow as mentioned in the listing, I found it a bit scary at first to go down them, but got comfortable with them pretty quickly. Overall great place to stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing beautiful home. Close to many activities
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A perfect ü§© place
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Appartement was lovely and clean, as was the neighbourhood. The host provided tea, facial wipes, soaps, laundry detergent, etc. The loft staircase could be a bit scary at night going down."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The property is in great location. The overall is clean and cute. I just wish the bathroom is bigger and just shower with no tub. The Star of the property is easy to work with the host.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and loved the location!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,super cute and clean and user friendly...close to colorado college
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly like the pictures and reviews even down to the low ceiling you may hit your head or shoulder on. It‚Äôs a cute small place however the window in the door to the balcony needs a curtain as does the window across from the bed. Even though it‚Äôs on the second floor you can still see through the unit. Neighborhood is quiet and very close to restaurants. Abandoned house was kinda creepy. The level the bed is on doesn‚Äôt cool down well even with the ac on so if you‚Äôre a hot sleeper you will definitely notice it, if not there is two fans provided.
The bad‚Ä¶.
Initial checkin was seamless and the unit looked exactly like the pictures however upon inspection of the bathroom, the tub had a balled up towel with pubic hairs and was still wet. There was also mens soap and dirty foot prints and more pubes inside the tub. It clearly wasnt cleaned and someone had just used it. I messaged Hoste around 630pm when we checked in and he apologized for the issue and said he would inform the right people however he offered only the apology and no solutions or compensation. After the dirty tub the integrity of the entire apartment was at question because how is the only tub in this small unit missed ? Once we advised him we were uncomfortable with the tub he advised he would reimburse us for any cleaning supplies we would have gotten to clean his tub. He would have even had the cleaners drop off supplies incase we didn‚Äôt want to buy them. I politely asked him to have the cleaners clean the tub then since they were going to drop off the cleaning supplies. He said ok and advised they could come after 330pm. Our stay was only 2night 3 days."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time staying there and seeing the sights!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is as cute in person as it is in pictures. There are plenty of fantastic restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It took a night to get comfortable with going up and down the spiral staircase to get from bed to bathroom. I parked on the street in front of the house with no issues. Overall a great stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Philip is a great host! This is an excellent place to stay! If you got hooked by the pictures, it's even better to stay there! We had a fantastic stay and would recommend this to anyone! Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! As pictured and all amenities described. Loved the loft and spiral stairs. No issue with the height, even at 5‚Äô8 and 6ft."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small, cozy, located in a plsce that is conveniently close to everything!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay. Cleanliness 10/10. Super comfortable and cute. perfect for solo or couples. the loft is pretty low ceilings though, i'm 5'8 and my head was touching the ceiling."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great tiny retreat. It was beautiful and welcoming.
With it being an older home, the clawfoot tub and toilet rocked and were a bit unstable.
The aesthetics were beautiful.
Didn't think about wanting to stand up when getting out of bed. The vaulted ceilings, however cute and cozy looking and in theory, were troublesome to someone that would like to fully stand when getting out of bed. lol"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was very nice and centrally located. It was perfect for two people, although I would not recommend it if you are taller than 5‚Äô6 as the loft ceiling with the bed in it is about 5‚Äô5 and must be physically able to walk up a VERY narrow spiral staircase, it is not the easiest. Easy check in and access, the laundry is located in the basement of the building, not in the portion we were staying in. But overall, a wonderful Airbnb."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place stay!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication, beautiful place, close from anything you need"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Nice stay. Only comment is if you‚Äôre over 6ft tall you won‚Äôt be able to stand up in the loft
2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"the tub was dirty, hair in tub and stairs, sofa was broken, you couldn't even sit on it cause the bed was popping out and detached at the bottom.. scratches all over the floor. there were specific instructions not to touch the thermostat on wall although it was left on with the heater throwing heat in the already hot upstairs loft that gets no circulation on cool air. cob webs everywhere. and to top it off there was a dirty diaper in the kitchen under the rack of dishwear... I only got refunded the cleaning fee of 75.00$ couldn't use the tub or the living space, the owner is diffinitely greedy and lacks any communication over any of theses matters. I've never written a bad review before because usually when I spend decent money for what looks like a decent place I get a decent if not awesome experience... this one was a bust sorry phillip fire your hr rep."
2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Pretty disappointing stay. Looked good at first glance, but overall was a fairly dysfunctional apartment."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was cozy and cost efficient. You get exactly what you see, and the hosts are very communicative."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, nice, and perfect spot in town!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space! Hoste almost checks all the boxes for a vacation rental. The apartment is newly renovated with a modern design. Upon first glance the space is neat and clean. When you dig a little deeper you will find mold in the bathroom and dirty nooks and crannies. This space has great potential with a little more effort by the cleaning crew. Be advised that the loft bedroom is not easy to navigate. If you have any mobility difficulties this is not the rental for you.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was on time and courteous with everything we needed! 10/10!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! My husband and I stayed for a week and everything near by was walking distance and a ten minute drive from Fort Carson. The balcony was a plus! We had a lunch there and it was very peaceful. Oh! We are 5‚Äô3 and we were able to stand up perfectly in the bedroom loft while if someone were taller than our height, I can see how it can be extremely uncomfortable to sleep up there, getting up and down the stairs. The stairs are VERY narrow and steep, I would be afraid to go down the stairs most times haha. BUT nonetheless, this place is great."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Great location and amenities. Super comfortable for any length of stay. Would recommend!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute stay located near everything. Upon entering the bathroom did have a sewage smell to it.. As I was getting ready for the night I noticed the plugs in the bathroom weren‚Äôt working either. I had no where to do my hair. When walking up or down the stairs we had to use extreme caution‚Ä¶ the stairs felt incredibly flimsy and poorly build I literally thought I was gonna fall. Over all the space felt very crammed but it was okay, better alternative than a hotel I‚Äôm sure."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute space in a great location. Very clean and well maintained, and it has a nice big patio. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is really small and you can‚Äôt even stand up in the bedroom without hitting your head on the ceiling, and I am not tall. The stairs going up to the bedroom are also small and a bit precarious. The host was very friendly and communicative, and the location is really awesome."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very nice and cute, stairs were slippery so just be careful with socks on them. i made dinner in the kitchen and didn‚Äôt have any problems finding what i needed to cook. overall had an amazing time and if you‚Äôre going to the cheyenne mountain zoo, which i would suggest you do, it‚Äôs barely 15 minutes away"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near good food and drink. Outside balcony was perfect for enjoying the spring weather.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The only reason I don‚Äôt feel like I got my moneys worth is three reasons, I was told they would be in the place alone when I bought it, but Instead i had a neighbor right next door(who‚Äôs tv you could here), then the place was VERY small, I am 6‚Äô6 so that would have been great to know because I hit my head on everything including the hanging light, and last but definitely not least the pull out couch was completely broken and un usable."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Communication was grea! Location was perfect and a very hip and cozy place to stay short term. Would highly recommend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great little place in a perfect location, close to bars and night life."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for some relaxation and peace and quiet I would totally recommend it
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nothing but positive reviews!
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We liked this Air-BNB it was the perfect size for 2. Beware of the bathtub even if the curtain is inside water still manages to get everywhere. Upstairs is small you need to watch your head. Location was excellent and we enjoyed the stay for the price.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay !
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute cozy spot to unwind!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice home, nice location!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place to stay in the springs! It‚Äôs close to lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and areas for sightseeing. The neighborhood feels safe and the building is well secured!
The kitchen is well stocked with pots,pans, plates, bowls, and utensils! We made several meals and never had an issue with the kitchen not having something we needed.
The only thing I would say is this is not a good place someone who is uncomfortable with small stairs. The spiral stairs going up to the loft are cute but are kind of scary to walk on because they are thin and very steep.
Overall we loved our stay and would recommend it!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful unit with a perfect location and an amazing host. Check in and out is a breeze. Very highly recommend this until unless you are tall, the shorter bedroom loft ceiling could be a small inconvenience."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for easy access to downtown and other activities. It had everything we needed for a nice stay in Colorado. There were small issues like the shower getting water all over the floor and the stairs being difficult to use, but neither were intolerable nor did they keep us from enjoying our stay overall."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Philips‚Äô place is a total hidden gem! It was absolutely lovely. Perfect central location, easy check in, beautifully decorated, charming loft. What I‚Äôd give to live there permanently! This place was just the spot for a romantic winter getaway ;)"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Very conveniently located!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week and loved it! We did underestimate the size a little bit, but the pictures are definitely what you are getting. It is so cute, so efficient, and so close to downtown!! We did notice a few things that lead us to believe that some spots were missed in cleaning, such as the pull out couch and comforter. And things that got old after a few days, like no dishwasher, no washer and dryer, and dodging the corners of the bed so you don‚Äôt gash your heels and feet. The host and the company he works with is great, they were both very responsive and helpful."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host and an easy checkin process. Very comfortable and pictures are accurate
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,location is great and the room was clean but there where some faults. The shower curtain barely covers the shower so it's hard to not get water out of the tub. The stairs are pretty tight and it shakes and moves as you go up and down it. Also the couch is sunk in and is kinda uncomfortable and small. Other then that the rest of the place was very nice and pleasant. the location itself is worth the stay.
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Having stayed at Philips place before, I was looking forward to it! I‚Äôm sure it was just a hiccup but the initial listing and the listing after you booked rules change for whatever reason. Before paying it states you can smoke outside as long as your 10ft away from the door or window. After I paid it changed to you‚Äôre unable to smoke at all. I messaged Philip to see what‚Äôs going on and was told that I‚Äôm not able to at all but I felt a little misled. On top of that, there was a couple dirty towels on the entertainment system but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs an outlier as I‚Äôve stayed with Philip before and the cleaning was immaculate the first time."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place was really nice and clean. It looked just like the photo. The only issue I had is because I‚Äôm tall being in the loft area where the bed is was a struggle so I found myself on the couch other than that it was a good place to stay for sure.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything from top to bottom was absolutely beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone and am so grateful for a place to regroup and breathe. Gorgeous stay ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"organized, efficient"
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Let‚Äôs start off by saying the home was beautiful an had a great style throughout. It was equipped with all the necessities as for things you might of forgotten which was nice. The location was great due to garden of the gods being not even 10 minutes away and in a very quiet neighborhood. I will say that although the style was good I wish the house would have been cleaner. I do appreciate that the host let us check in earlier and we landed earlier but the vent elation system wasn‚Äôt cleaned and that was dust accumulated within time. Our allergies acted up due to that and only in the house. Some outlets worked others didn‚Äôt. Overall the cleanliness just seemed not up to part or what I had expected I should say because that‚Äôs why a cleaning fee is charged right? I feel like overall everyone is right about the stairs being DANGEROUS. Every step seemed like either it needed tightening on the screws or like it was about to just give in. Overall I think the location is nice. The house was beautiful but I‚Äôd probably stay in a hotel if ever in Colorado Springs due to the expections on cleanliness and health safety.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location close to downtown but in a quiet area.
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy access to apartment, cute aesthetic. The only downsides were no ventilation in bedroom nook & the non functional shower design. Feeling clean and rested are my top items when staying away so I was a bit restless considering these two needs were not met adequately."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit #202 was exactly as advertised. A clean, efficient unit close to great local restaurants."
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,We appreciate him trying to get us in early with flight changes. Place was way smaller than what it looks like. I‚Äôd recommend one person stay not four! Place is in a great area! However it has some stairs that are very dangerous at night! Be careful!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication! Location was prime right downtown!
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This Airbnb was not only super cute but in a great spot to access everything to do in Colorado Springs!
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful but small. Both me and my boyfriend are over 5‚Äô10 so we had some troubles washing our hair and face in the shower but it was doable. Even considering this and the low ceilings around the bed we were comfortable and still enjoyed our stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute small place, perfect for a weekend get away! Had everything I needed! 10/10 would go back again:)"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As others have said, sleeping up in the loft got pretty warm; the a/c is below the loft, so even with a fan going full blast upstairs, I got too warm to sleep several times. The shower leaves a lot to be desired; technically, yes, I got showered, but the showerhead is short and the shower curtain pole really needs to be much bigger/wider than the tub... it's impossible to take a shower without standing on the curtain, and without the shower curtain clinging to you from all sides. The listing claimed ""mountain views,"" but the only way to see the mountains was to be on the patio, and get a tiny glimpse of the top of one in between the trees next door. This is really a super cute place, so it's kind of a shame that it's overall pretty inconvenient. The spiral stairs are a bit frightening in the middle of the night, and if carrying anything at all. Again, really cute place, but needs some definite improvements."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Colorado Springs! Definitely in walking distance to the happening downtown area. Really fun and cute Colorado condo!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This apartment is awesome. well decorated, awesome porch to sip coffee on and eat a late night dinner, super close to all the restaurants, great view of the Rockies. Will be staying here again."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Once inside the apartment, the space was modern and inviting. The loft where the bed is has a short celing and a very tight spiral staircase, but the bed was really comfortable. Short walk to Tejon Street where you can find nice restaurants, breweries, and cofee shops."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute home.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our Airbnb stay. The location was central between downtown and several adventurous options. The host tried to accommodate a last minute ask for early check in, after we‚Äôd been traveling all night, and it was greatly appreciated!! There was a cute little book with local recommendations, from food, to drinks, adventure, etc. that precious guests could add to... just another little treasure that was appreciated."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Very central. Loved proximity to downtown restaurants and mountain biking in Red Rock, Garden of Gods, Cheyenne Mountain State Park. I was traveling with my son and it suited our needs well. I gave 4/5 for cleanliness because the shower curtain hadn't been washed for a while. It's one of those lovely clawfoot bathtub/showers but they had shower curtains going around the tub on the outside and first time I showered water dripped down and got the whole bathroom floor wet. I pulled the shower curtain into the tub to avoid this but realized it was quite dirty and pulling the shower curtains in, there was a higher likelihood of them touching me. Also, I could deal with not having a dishwasher, but there was no dish rack either. I had to put utensils, bowls, dishes into a plastic bin to drip dry and later did some cloth drying before putting them away. Yes, the upstairs loft can be quite warm when it gets 80+ even with AC on, but once the sun goes down cool circulating air from open windows plus the fan upstairs makes it tolerable. All in all we did enjoy our stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute place - great location for exploring Colorado Springs area. Spotless & beautifully decorated. LOVED the outdoor deck with mountain views & walking to restaurants (Denver Biscuit - so yummy) and the new Olympic Museum.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute, modernized cozy place matched our standards of cleanliness, accessibility and ease to enjoy our stay. It is aesthetically pleasing and all amenities were used including the laundry! It is always nice to have your laundry done before vacation is over. We took advantage of walking to nearby downtown restaurants and the food market whenever we needed a snack run. The provided linen, towels, kitchen supplies and cutlery was sufficient as well. All in all we LOVED staying here and would recommend going back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place in a great location walkable to lots of fun activities.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was much smaller than expected. The loft bed area was not tall enough to stand up straight and there was very little room on either side of of the bed. I actually broke my foot the 2nd day from kicking the bottom corner of the bed, so I couldn‚Äôt even hike on our hiking vacation. Now I get to wear a boot for 2 months. There is no place to change in the bedroom and no counter space in the bathroom. The stairs are tiny so if you need to go in the middle of the night, it‚Äôs treacherous to say the least. The owners were good communicators, but we would have preferred a simple hotel room to this tiny apartment. We would definitely not go back."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,10/10 would rec!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property‚Äôs location is fantastic; tons of shops and restaurants are within walking distance. The interior is also clean and well-appointed. Great host and a great place!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house worked fine for what we needed, but it was tight even for 2 people. The couch bed needs to be replaced. I wouldn‚Äôt rent this if you or anyone else has mobility issues - seniors, kiddos, or otherwise - the ‚Äústairway‚Äù to the loft was super narrow & impossible to walk up or down in the dark. This is a great home base, but not a place you should plan to relax/hang out in. Hosts were lovely and super responsive & we felt very safe. Never heard any neighbor or road noise, either. Best nearby restaurant we found was Dos Santos. Don‚Äôt bother at Shugas - they don‚Äôt seem to want to serve out of towners ;). Central location was great."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful and clean space and i would definitely stay again. The apartment was easy to find and had all the necessities we needed for out stay. It was near great food as well as all the different places we were visiting and exploring. The place is a bit small like other reviews say but that wasn‚Äôt much of a problem for me and overall it was a great place to stay for my road trip.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phillips place was very clean and charming. Well located to downtown and comfortable for the three of us. We would definitely stay again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location at a great value. Communication was awesome and they really worked to meet our needs. Definitely would stay here again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a really cute unit in this adorable home!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and cute space. Definitely smaller than it photographs but good for 1 person or two max.
Only problem is that it gets very hot up in the loft bedroom. There is a fan there but for someone who needs cold to sleep it wasn‚Äôt ideal for me and I slept on the couch downstairs instead (which the AC works great downstairs)
Overall awesome location in a nice place tho"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean! We walked to plenty of restaurants with ease! Definitely would recommend for a couple to use! Great place.
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect walkability to downtown shops and restaurants. The unit is comfortable and a good utilization of a small space. We loved the outdoor balcony. Check in and check out were a smooth process. The cross street is noisy around the clock - bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and relaxing. Close to down town and a great deck for morning coffee. Had a great stay for a business trip!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WONDERFUL AIRBnB! This cute little place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Location is super convenient to everything and we always felt safe. The unit is small but was perfect for just the two of us. I know there are multiple units at this location so if you do have a big group, you could all stay at one location but have separate areas at a very reasonable price.
My husband and I were unfortunately sick most of the trip but Philip and his staff checked in on us & we greatly appreciated the thoughtfulness. Communication was outstanding."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Such a nice small space for a short stay. A bit tight for more than 2 people. Has everything you need.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Cute decor.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay. You have access to pretty much everything.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tina‚Äôs beautiful cottage was perfect for my writing getaway. She was very quick with responses and the area is absolutely beautiful. I plan on returning. Absolutely wonderful hosts.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot. Everything as described and thensome. Easy check in and great instructions. There were snacks, coffee, water etc available for us. Binder left with local suggestions and very handy ideas for things to do in the area. Tina was very communicative and easy to reach if needed. Everything was perfect! Thanks very much for a great stay in Colorado Springs! Would definitely recommend for any singles or couples in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, super cute, very comfortable and beautiful place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great stay. thank you Tina
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great guest suite behind a beautiful historic home. Easy to get to and has everything you'd want for a stay. The owners husband graciously had the driveway shoveled in the morning both days of the snow storm. Great stay and would likely stay here again when visiting CO springs.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet, helpful amenities (coffee bar, utensils, fridge) and great location!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina's place is great if you are traveling to Colorado Springs. My boyfriend and I have stayed in two of her guest rooms, both were private and felt like home. We enjoyed that all the basics were provided as well as a Keurig with coffee supplies, a few snacks, and some water. I love the antique furniture and the charm of the guest houses as well. Not to mention it is downtown so there are many walkable restaurants and shops, etc. We will definitely keep this place in mind every time we visit the Springs!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay close to everything downtown.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay for the holidays, everything was perfect!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was very clean and quiet. It is walkable to some nice parts of town. My only negative - there is no comfortable place to sit. The only choices are the bed and hard wooden straight back chairs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our suite in the cottage was perfect for 2 people! Although there is no kitchen, the room had provisions of a microwave oven, Keurig coffee pod coffeemaker, paper plates, plastic silverware, napkins, paper towels, tea, coffee pods, snacks, and instant oatmeal. We mostly ate out; however, in the early morning it was nice to have a cup of tea or coffee with a warm danish. The bed was firm and very comfortable and, although we did not need it, it was nice to notice that it was all handicapped accessible. The cottage is located in the heart of the historic North End district and there is a beautiful 1929 Episcopal church just behind the cottage. Everything is within walking distance. Parking is a little tight so do mind Tina‚Äôs directions for parking. We had a great stay and would love to come back again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay! It was clean and comfortable and instructions were very clear to get in and check out. There were also all of the amenities you could need! Very thoughtful host. I would definitely recommend staying here!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina's place is a gem. Great central location near Colorado College at the north end of downtown. Restaurant options from burgers and pizza to fine dining within walking distance or a short drive. Central to all of Colorado Springs.
The space between the main house and the Airbnb cottage forms a private parking courtyard. Your car is visible from the room. It feels secure and peaceful.
The room was spotless and showed great attention to details that make for a comfortable stay: wifi, coffee, snacks, coat hangers, luggage stands, comfortable bed, plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash. Everything was there. Everything worked.
I highly recommend Tina's place and hope to stay there on my next visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage at Tina‚Äôs was outstanding. Well appointed, clean, and very accommodating hosts. We had a last-minute reservation and had an extra vehicle with us. Tina and her husband could not have been more accommodating. I‚Äôd highly recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina's place was just as represented. It's a perfect location for exploring downtown COS on foot. The space is historic yet updated and very comfortable. I will absolutely recommend it to friends. Also, my mom wasn't traveling with me but she uses a wheelchair and I felt like the space was very accommodating for someone who may have physical limitations: ramp, wide doorways, handles/bars in the bathroom and an accessible shower."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina was an exceptional host! She responded promptly when needed (no issues, I just had generic questions) and was very nice. The place was exactly as described and had such great extras like a nightlight in the bathroom, power strip with USB and nightstand on both sides of the bed, amazing coffee bar with lots of coffee selections, and the TV had a guest mode so we didn't have to remember to log out of our services before checking out. The only minor drawback was not being able to control the temp. We were worried it would be too warm, but it was almost too cold at times! We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we come for a visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay! We stayed here for an event nearby at the Ed Robson Arena but it's also very convenient for any general stay in the springs. I never met Tina but I did meet her husband (forgot his name, oops) and he was extremely friendly and helpful. The Camden room itself is very cozy, great bed and linens, good amenities, etc. It's also very nice to have a reserved parking spot in the lot that they have. Definitely would stay again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Camden Cottage was a welcoming, cozy place to stay!

The cottage was very clean and had a comfortable bed. There was a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge. It had a nice sized bathroom with a walk in shower with good hot water.

Secure, comfortable and clean. Great finishing touches and extras. Tina communicates right away. Best host. Daughter is graduated but if we ever come back it‚Äôs always here first!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay, the location was exactly what we wanted and the furnishings were nice and affordable. I really appreciate how clean it was and for all the extra touches she provides. üíØ we will book again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice peaceful place to lay our head after 2 action packed days at the college. Walking distance to the college was a real plus not having to maneuver the parking meters. Tina was kind enough to extend out checkout so that we could explore the Garden of the Gods park which was absolutely fabulous. Colorado Springs has so much to offer. We will definitely return to CS and to Tina's place.

The is very quick to respond if an issue arises (which they seldom do), the accommodation is clean and has all the amenities anyone would need or want.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated the details at the Camden suite. Everything was great! Very clean and if you are someone that needs shower rails or a a small stool to sit during while you shower, this is the place for you.
Also, if you are forget like me for shampoo, conditioner, and soap, make up remover wipes, if you need some water, but forgot to bring some with you, or plates for your leftovers, Tina has them.

Check-in was a breeze, the place was comfortable and close to everything: Good food, entertainment, hiking, etc.!

The Camden felt luxurious - we were enamored with the attention to detail, from the light fixtures to the bathroom amenities, to the coffee nook with everything we needed to make simple meals.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very clean, comfortable, and convenient place to stay when visiting CO Springs! The Camden Suite is cute and well-arranged with many practical touches that are helpful and useful while staying there. The many windows afford the opportunity for much natural light during the day, but there are also blinds and curtains for privacy and to completely block out light at night. The bed has one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on. The location near downtown is just perfect for accessing all parts of CO Springs, and the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. The locking mechanism for the suite is secure and easy to use. It was also very helpful to use the available off-street parking space for my rental car; the size is best for small to mid-size vehicles. Tina is very responsive to any needs or questions. I look forward to staying here again on a return trip in the future!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Multiple units are available, but we stayed in the Cottage and had an amazing experience. The house is very centrally located and only a short walk to the Main st downtown.
The decor and amenities were very nice and the room had a luxury feel.
The neighborhood is very safe and they have reserved parking in site. Would definitely recommend this stay to others!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great for the value. Clean, charming, quiet and comfortable."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is not a better place to stay in Colorado Springs with everything you want. The location is a very short walk to downtown located just a block or two from Colorado College in a historic district. The spot is surrounded by other historic homes, churches, and small businesses. You can easily make your way to hip and cool restaurants, shops, and bars in a few minutes. Moreover, you are less than a 30 minute drive to any of the surrounding tourist attractions. It's very centrally located
The visible amenities are amazing. It's lovely space with a large dining room table, a spacious bed, a large bathroom, and lots of antique furniture. The windows come with both translucent blinds and shades to give you both privacy and whatever amount of light you need. Moreover, it feels very open and comfortable. There is also a massive television on the wall if you want to sit back and relax in front of the TV.
What truly takes this location to the next level are the hidden extra features and excellent details. The Internet is very fast and worked wonderfully for the work we needed to accomplish. There are also abundant power outlets and more than enough spots to plug-in all your devices. The room also had dishes, coffee, a microwave, fridge with freezer, snacks, water, and every other little item to make your visit perfect. Returning every evening to our reserved parking spot was a wonderful convenience. I also loved that the doors had a code for entry, making it convenient and simple to leave and return.
The location itself is very serene and quiet. While the front location of the main home is on a very busy street, you actually slip down a back alley to get to the cottage and parking. There are other guest rooms nearby but we never heard them other than a friendly greeting in passing. We never felt crowded or disturbed. The alley itself has no traffic and sits behind a very beautiful church. It's not only quite private, it feels very safe.
Overall, the cottage is really a perfect location with amazing amenities in a beautiful setting. This would absolutely be our first choice if we return to Colorado Springs. It was easy, comfortable, and exactly everything you want when traveling."

Comfortable bed, great shower, and lots of amenities. I would definitely recommend!"

I appreciated the closeness to the downtown area and to I-25. I'm a fan of antiques and older homes so the furnishings and aesthetics of the beautiful main house was a plus for me. The binder with tourist information, locals' favorites and hiking trails was a great resource. Tina was a great communicator and a great host! We travel to Colorado Springs often and will definitely check Tina's properties first for availability every time!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Tina was on it with communication when I needed to switch around my reservation. When we arrived we were able to park & access the cottage with ease. It was the little touches that really made me enjoy our stay; the mini fridge w/water & ice, coffee/tea and binder filled with wonderful information about Colorado Springs and surroundings. Location was very convenient as we were about 15 mins or so away from everything we had wanted to try (Garden of the Gods, Manitou Springs, Cheyanne Mt. Zoo, Cave of the Winds & downtown which is within walking distance). We felt very safe and comfortable I hope to stay again soon as we fell very much involve with COS and the neighborhood (such beautiful homes!)."

The space was extremely comfortable with everything you could need plus some for your stay. Perfect location, a great walk to downtown. All the main attractions we wanted to see were a 10-15 min drive. The church behind the cottage was a beautiful backdrop, especially in the snow."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A spotlessly clean place to rest at the end of a fun day of hiking. The coffee maker and fridge were great for a quick breakfast before hitting the trails and was within walking distance of fun dinner spots.

Great location. Walking distance to downtown. It‚Äôs safe and the nearby streets are nice for walking.
The owner is very responsive. Easy checking in and out.
Only thing to keep in mind when booking is the thermostat is preset because it‚Äôs shared with adjoining cottage.
Will definitely be back!"

The place is definitely worth a mention and stay when you are in Colorado Springs."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina's place is quaint, romantic, and while its in the heart of colorado springs, it has all the charm that comes with a Victorian home but with modern conveniences. We stayed 3 nights/4 days and appreciated all the extra touches such as the coffee machine with all the trimmings, fridge, microwave, electric blanket, and even couple's robes. This is the perfect little getaway and we cherished our time here. Thank you Tina."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was lovely! The location was perfect for my stay and the space comfortably accommodated myself and my partner. Tina was super helpful and responsive to my messages.
I have only one criticism that is more of a personal discovery so not something to hold against the hosts. I just thought I would share it as a heads up.
The listing clearly states that the thermostat is shared with the connected unit (duplex) so that the host controls the thermostat. I didn't have any issues with having the temp increased. Tina always responded quickly to my requests. With that said, it could be a bit inconvenient for me at times. For example, if I didn't return until late in the evening I wasn't comfortable messaging on a weekday at 11pm to ask about the thermostat. So I would wait until the next day. (The heating blanket was awesome though!)
If that doesn't bother you, then definitely book this unit! I enjoyed my week-long stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need and perfect location to many places around Colorado Springs. So close to downtown, we loved being able to walk to restaurants, coffee shops and support local businesses. Tina did a wonderful job of explaining in the details all we would need to know. We will definitely be coming back in the future."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy space! Wasn't aware it was only a booking for a single room but it exceeded expectations anyway! Had everything we needed, bathroom was beautiful and spacious, and kitchen area had enough to cook/heat basic stuff. Super big TV too!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful stay in Tina‚Äôs cottage in Colorado Springs! Within walking distance to bars/restaurants, super quiet, super clean, and very cozy. Would love to come back to visit again someday. Thank you!"

stay. I highly recommend it"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I can‚Äôt express enough how both our host, Tina, and her Camden Cottage Suite is like a dream!
The cottage is cozy, spotlessly clean, and beautiful in every direction and is reflective of how an amazing and warm person Tina is.
Tina was very understanding, patient, and accommodating to all our questions and requests which was very much appreciated as we got caught in the middle of Hurricane Sally and had to make a few modifications to our travel plans which made all the difference and was helpful in our trip being a success. We give Tina and her family our heartfelt thanks!
Tina‚Äôs level of care and thoughtfulness is apparent throughout the home from the comfortable bedding, a very thorough local information guidebook that she personally made, and ensuring a pleasantly well-stocked cottage with items and many amenities that aren‚Äôt typically offered at many BnBs which made our stay absolutely lovely and restful.
Our stay at the Camden Cottage Suite was the highlight of our trip. We felt so welcomed and comfortable. We will definitely book and highly recommend staying at The Camden Cottage Suite when visiting Colorado Springs!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the Cottage. Everything was impeccably cleaned and decorated so nicely. You could tell a lot of work was put into those extra touches that made our stay special.

The room was a bit on the warm side and thermostat was locked so could not adjust it."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and clean cottage with considerate touches like dish ware, coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. Loved how quickly Tina responded to messages too.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! With free onsite parking is a bonus in downtown Colorado Springs. Tina was easy to reach and responded quickly. The mattress was super comfy too. Nice to have toiletries provided as well as the coffee! This spot is within a 5-10 minute walk to every restaurant in the downtown area. We loved Four by Brother Luck and The Rabbit Hole! Thanks for a lovely stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best Airbnb we have ever stayed. The place was spacious, clean, and we loved having a dining room table to work at. Beautifully remodeled but still has ton of antique charm. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice room and extras like snacks, shampoo and conditioner, nice hand soap, sheets. Liked the location. I would stay here again for my work travels. Highly recommend. Easy check in process and she let me roll in my $4k mountain bike into the room to be sure it stayed safe. Very thoughtful. Never ran into another guest and she was always available if I needed her. Lots of cameras around the property which made me feel safe. Next to colorado college and great restaurants too."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great little cottage. Watch out for the hot water before you set in the shower. It could get scalding quickly. I love hot water so the fact that the water could get really hot was awesome! Loved all the little touches around the room. Memory foam bed was firm but comfortable. I really don't have anything bad to say. Would stay again and again.
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and easily walkable to downtown or the college campus.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderfully quiet yet right in downtown and it feels you are in a historic property. I loved it here and would return.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this sweet place: the location is great and the hospitality was wonderful. We appreciated the fact that even though we stayed in a bedroom/bathroom suite, there was a lot of space and amenities such as a fully stocked coffee maker, a fridge stocked with water and creamer for coffee, and a microwave. We were visiting a student at Colorado College, and the location was perfect for walking to campus and to downtown."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was larger than a normal hotel room. It was very cute and cozy, decorated with beautiful antique furniture. LOTS of light from numerous windows, all with easy pull blinds. . Host provided a large notebook with thorough instructions for everything from the locks to the TV remotes. Also a TON of info on what to do in Colorado Springs. Even a walking map to downtown. Extras included extra towels, plenty of soaps, shampoos, & lotions, Keurig with an assortment of coffees, a wide variety of teas, a variety of sweeteners & sugar, creamers and waters in the fridge, to go cups & covers, iron & board, even an electric blanket (my wife loved that). Dorm size microwave & fridge/freezer. Wi-fi had good signal. Extra large flat-screen on the wall included Apple TV. Bed was firm but comfortable, as was the bedding & numerous pillows. Location was easy to access, in the alley behind a big house a few blocks N of downtown. Communication was great. EVERY note I sent was returned within an hour. Tina even emailed me to warn me of a parade downtown Saturday and told me which way to get around it. We not only would stay here again, we ARE staying here again in 3 weeks when we are back in Colorado Springs. One more thing to note. There were power strips on both sides of the bed, and by the big dining room table, so plenty of places to charge."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous and clean space in a fantastic area! The little touches of a coffee and guidebook were very much appreciated!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tina‚Äôs place is excellent- private, clean, and the perfect location.
My only drawback was receiving a $7 charge for getting makeup on the white washcloths. Tina provides a black makeup washcloth, but as someone with sensitive skin, I can‚Äôt risk using a black washcloth that may be hiding stains, etc. (I wash the same makeup out of my white washcloths at home- would never have intentionally ruined hers.) Wasn't so much of an issue- just wanted anyone else with sensitive skin to be aware!
If this won‚Äôt be an issue for you then definitely stay at Tina‚Äôs!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quiet and homey, the space was clean and comfortable with lots of helpful information on restaurants, hikes, and other things to do in the area. Would definitely recommend staying here!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazingly clean and cute cottage! We had a great time and had everything we needed and more. Would recommend this place to anyone. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! The location is just as expected. It‚Äôs short walk to downtown, yet far enough away on a quiet street. The room is very clean and homely. It has everything you can imagine from a comfy bed, coffee, waters, shampoo, mini fridge, microwave, etc. Tina has a book with anything and everything you need know about the room and Colorado Springs. Very helpful for people who have never visited the area. Overall I feel like I‚Äôve been spoiled for my first Airbnb experience... looking forward to visiting again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay in Colorado Springs! Located behind a gorgeous Victorian in a beautiful and convenient neighborhood. Walk to the quaint downtown with a multitude of food choices!! I‚Äôd stay here again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, centrally located in Colorado Springs. Walking and driving distances from a lot of good breakfast/lunch/dinner spots and a few good bars (I recommend Bristol Brewing, the Urban egg, and Rudy‚Äôs BBQ). Beautifully furnished, comfortable bed, plenty of wall outlets, mini fridge/freezer, microwave, and Keurig with everything you need. She has Apple TV and a big TV in the room. We had no issues setting up our Netflix and Hulu accounts on it. Tina left an awesome Welcome binder in our room with a ton of great ideas. The cottage is maybe 20 minutes from Manitou Springs and Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. Only an hour south of Denver. We had an excellent stay and would definitely stay again if we come back to Colorado Springs! (Side note: she keeps the room at 73 degrees, and provides a small fan and a heating blanket. We like our house cold, but we had no issues! We turned the fan on and sometimes opened the windows and it was perfect üëåüèª)"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location with assigned parking spot - very nice decor and lots of extras provided in the cottage for a great visit

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Camden Cottage was also our first experience with the Airbnb model. What a great introduction! Our host, Tina, provided us with first class accommodations, clear and prompt communication, and a great value for our three-night stay in Colorado Springs. The location is perfect for those visiting the town, nearby Colorado College, and/or experiencing Pikes Peak and the many recreational and cultural opportunities in the area. Full marks for amenities such as secure parking to the beautiful antique furniture, as well as the quiet and convienent location."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, close to everything, parking and privacy 5 stars. Beautiful antiques...way better than a hotel. Tina thought of everything you would need. CLEAN!!! EXCELLENT AND WOULD RECCOMEND! Aloha from Hawaii ü§ô‚ù§"
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little cottage was perfect for our weekend getaway. It was sparkling clean and Tina filled it with little extras like coffee pods and granola bars. Sure makes a difference when you book an Airbnb to feel more like home. I'm not handicapped but I noticed this place is set up for ADA accessibility. They've gone the extra mile to make this comfortable for those in need from the ramp to the handles in the shower. I should note, the weekend we were there it was unseasonably hot and the house is temperature controlled. It was warmer than we wanted to be comfortable but the windows that surround the house would create a great breeze throughout the room in cooler temps. Overall, great place."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Every time I go to Colorado Springs, I stay with Tina. It's the best deal in the Springs."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and an easy walk into town. The space was a great size for two and has beautiful furniture. However, you will definitely hear your neighbors if the other cottage room is rented."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cottage in great location! We really loved our time there. The only very small downside was that we couldn't operate the airconditioning - we are not used to it and found it a bit cold. However, we still recommend to stay there because it is just so beautiful and conveniently located."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So far my favorite Airbnb Ive stayed at. Wonderful couple. Beautiful area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an absolutely lovely time in the vintage camper! The property was gorgeous, peaceful & very welcoming. The animals & meditation spot were our favorite!
Overall it was a wonderful experience & everyone was incredibly friendly. I highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cute vintage camper on a beautiful property hosts Terry and Debra were very helpful and friendly!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Debbie is a fantastic host! Super friendly, very nice to talk to, and very helpful. There was a nice little guest book in there that had a lot of recommendations and had a bunch of information incase you had questions. Pets and animals on the property were very nice. We‚Äôre glad we had the opportunity to stay here, we would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debra and Terry were such great hosts! My husband and I hadn't gotten away together in quite awhile, so we decided to go hiking at The Paint Mines and explore CO Springs. This adorable little trailer was the PERFECT place to relax at the end of our day. We grilled outside, we read, and watched Netflix.
It was so peaceful, and our hosts couldn't have been more lovely!
Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little camper in Colorado Springs. Debra and her husband came out to greet us and show us how it all worked, and let us come inside where they have another bathroom that you could use since the camper doesn't have a shower. Got to talk to Debra for a little bit, and she was incredibly welcoming and gave us great recommendations. Also this is probably one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in, I won't even lie. Definitely would be challenging to stay in that small space for a LONG period of time, but it was cute and romantic and definitely a nice little getaway."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a beautiful trip. Such a peaceful and pretty area, and the camper was super homey and comfortable. We had an amazing time!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful ambiance close to many trails including their property to stroll while on site-my time was short so was unable to fully enjoy their provisions but will attempt to stay again in the future to explore more. Very welcoming to both me and my dogs and made us feel like family. They fixed the camper up well while keeping the retro feel while also having everything I would need if I had planned more time to cook or do more on site.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy place, comfortable bed, very warm despite the snow on the outside, very friendly hosts who allowed us to see their puppies, wonderful place to stay 10/10 would recommend"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time in Colorado Springs and this was the right soot to be in. Everything was great, from the hospitality to the amazing views, i would come again in the future!!! I would recommend if you go, go with one person, the camper is cozy enough just for 2 without it being overcrowded. The place is just like how the pictures displayed it. It was beautiful and comfortable and felt like a little home on wheels. I went when it snowed and the views were awesome with the snow on the ground, like a winter wonderland. I‚Äôll have to come again when it‚Äôs warmer and enjoy the campfire next time!!! I would highly recommend staying here, Debbie and Terry were very accommodating and helpful, they are good people and I enjoyed speaking with them during my time there!! It‚Äôs a great spot for a little ‚Äúcamping‚Äù trip."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A peaceful stay and friendly hosts, Im sure it would be more beautiful in summer
Unfortunately there was a snow storm during our stay so we didnt get to have camp fire and walk around.
But the hosts are very friendly, informative and helpful"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra and Terry were wonderful hosts, so kind and considerate. The rural location was amazing and tranquil.

And Debra and Terry‚Äôs property is amazing. We walked our pup each morning, explored the acres behind the RV, and enjoyed seeing the projects they have going on. Debra and Terry were INCREDIBLY kind and accommodating. I appreciated that they gave us recommendations when we asked and wanted to hear about our day, but also gave us space to enjoy the getaway. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! Loved the goats and sheep.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Debra's vintage camper was exactly as described. We stayed for 5 nights. The forest behind the camper is beautiful and I spent a lot of time just wondering around looking at wild flowers and petting their goats.
The camper is about 20 minutes from most things in Colorado Springs.
This is a great place for a couple or maybe 3 but keep in mind the camper is small and cozy. Most nights are cool and you can just open the windows, but there is air-conditioning.
I highly recommend this place if you just want a quiet getaway to reconnect with yourself and nature."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Came back with a friend, and the two bed setup worked great! Strong wifi for our remote working, though it was nice to go to the local coffee shops, and also unplug at times with the forest surroundings :) Debbie and Terry are wonderful hosts!"

A huge plus to use the easily accessible bathroom/shower in the house in addition to the camper toilet. The description matches it perfectly so read through! Debbie & Terry are gracious to share their property. You definitely feel you have your own space, but it‚Äôs also nice to see them around, so friendly and accommodating. And wifi is great! Did an extended stay and was able to easily work remotely. Also a great cafe right up the road!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the vintage camper so much, that we didn‚Äôt want to leave! What a wonderful place to stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unique! Beautiful area!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great place to stay- absolute beautiful property. My favorite thing was the puppies right out in the front, they were like 9 weeks old an adorable. They had an issue with the gas and water though. So no stove or running water, kinda a bummer. Terry and Debra were absolute lovely though in trying to accommodate."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra and Terry‚Äôs place was lovely. We live in the Denver area and were really looking for a place to slow down and get away.

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"this was a really cute camper van, a bit smaller than expected but is very cozy and has so many furnishings! we were here for a day and were able to explore some parts of the black forest. we were pleasantly surprised by some of the thoughtful touches (s'mores, goat petting, etc!)
the only big problem we had was with the heating. the heating doesn't reach all the way to the bed area even at the highest setting, and it turned off in the middle of the night and it was freezing in the van. during the morning, the bed remained at a medium temperature between the heater and the outdoor temp, which was too cold to hang out. since our heads are right by the windows which don't do much for heat retention, we woke up with a head cold after the evening. we were under all the blankets but it still got super cold, so I would not recommend staying after the night temp drops below freezing!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had the best stay here! The hosts are so kind and welcoming and share their beautiful land with us. Would definitely go again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful accommodations. Great site-hospitable hosts. Highly recommend for anyone. Hope to bring my husband here one day

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your beautiful camper! We had such an amazing time and cant wait to come back. We loved seeing all of your animals and petting them as well as walking around your beautiful property. Couldnt recommended this place enough!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The camper was every bit charming as the pictures. I have yet to come across another listing like it so we feel very fortunate to have found Debra. My husband and I enjoyed meeting Debra and found River's companionship outside the camper to be a nice reminder of home with our pups. Best of all, we played our first game of Yahtzee together and cackled the night away. If you are wondering if you should stay here, stop and book it!"

Highly recommend this AirBnB!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was such a great stay! Perfect for my dog and I to just sleep in. We hiked all day and woke up early the following morning to hit another trail! I like how they personalize the stay by writing letters! Would stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a hidden gem! The camper was absolutely adorable and had everything that we needed. It was great to have indoor and outdoor options to sit and relax. The property is so fun, kiddos loved saying hello to the goats and exploring the forest portion of the property. Hosts were so communicative and thoughtful to ensure we had a comfortable stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a blast staying in the camper!

We loved walking around the property and the trailer was super clean and comfy!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Best and cutest camper I've had the pleasure of staying in! So clean and well decorated and organized. Beautiful location for a brisk morning walk to see hummingbirds and black squirrels just living life.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debra and Terry‚Äôs property is a gem of a glamping escape just outside of Colorado Springs. It was just the right size for me and my 8 year old granddaughter.
The vintage trailer is so charming and decorated beautifully inside and out.
The well-apportioned kitchen has all the amenities for a quick meal. The fridge is just the right size to hold drinks, eggs or leftovers from a day exploring the town. A small table inside is the perfect size for a dinner for two.
There is a small toilet inside the trailer and a large shared bathroom, with tub and shower, just inside the main house, which is several yards down the path from the trailer.
The bed is very comfortable and the space is sparkling clean.
Debra and Terry provide a portable fire pit for s‚Äômores or enjoying an evening outside under the stars.
The property is huge with lots of space for walks and visits with the resident goats and sheep. There are also a few great hiking trails just up the road.
Exploring Colorado Springs is convenient. The trailer is 30 minutes drive to Manitou Springs, Garden of the Gods, Pike‚Äôs Peak Railroad or Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.
After a day exploring, this cute trailer was a perfect respite in the quiet forest.
I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra and Terry are on-call if you need a fan or to borrow a bike or want to chat. Unfortunately, they were also there sometimes when I really needed some personal space. Note that the trailer is situated right next to the homeowners house and garage, so that there is no private outdoor area anywhere around the trailer. Inside the trailer is cute and the bed is comfy. Hopefully the ac will be working for you if you need it. I hope you have the option to use curtains/shades/blinds on every single window by the time you stay there. Please ask Debra if you can play with the adorable puppies outside if the weather is nice :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The location was awesome. Very close to uptown Sedona and many of the trailheads. The place was wonderful and just as described. Would definitely stay here again!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute and cozy camp experience. Bugs& moths is a problem at night so you need to be careful leaving the door open with the light on. Aside from that everything is great and convenient. There was a fire ban in the area but we were able to use the grill for some barbecue. Really chill.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a unique experience. Deb & Terry welcomed us and made our stay so comfortable. The camper had LITERALLY everything one would need AND MORE!

Terry and Debra were very accommodating to the snow and mud: providing extra blankets and towels, access to a washer and dryer for my soaked clothes, and a tiny heater in the camper that has a direct line to the sun. It gets hot, fast! The whole area was beautiful, quiet, walkable, dog friendly....a definite gem in the forest. I really wanted to give a bad review so I could keep this secret to myself. But Debra and Terry are just too nice! Kudos you two!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great little retreat. It‚Äôs perfectly located; not to far from town but far enough to experience the serenity of the countryside. I was there in a snow storm and it was gorgeous! Felt like I was in Heaven. Don‚Äôt miss this one!

Debra and Terry were so kind and gracious. Their property is gorgeous! (Go walk it all!) their animals were so fun and the drive to all the sights (which Debra has thoughtfully bindered all together) was perfect! We could go and explore the mountains and cities/towns and then come back to cozy comfort. Buy some groceries and cook on the stove or in the crockpot and enjoy camping 1965 style. Sit by a bonfire and look at the stars through the incredible trees. Go pet the goats/sheep (and maybe even some puppies if you‚Äôre lucky!) Children are welcome here and will have a blast! We cannot wait to go back! -A, E, & E."

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"While my plans changed last minute and was unable to see the place from the inside, it looked to be quite a nice place from the outside! The accommodations in the home (where the bathroom and shower area are located) were quite surprisingly cluttered and smelled of fresh litters of puppies. Not to say it's a bad thing, but important to note if you're allergic to animals. The hosts were very kind and accommodating to my requests, and also very understanding when I had to leave early due to some personal emergencies. Wishing you all the best, and can't wait to have a vintage trailer of my own! They are so cute!"

They have a large property with goats and sheep that you can walk around and pet. I've never used a camper toilet before, but they provide instructions and service it, so fear not first timers! Quiet and peaceful location with great conversations, definitely worth a trip!"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home's location was perfect for walking to the nearby restaurants and shops on Tejon St. The house was well stocked and ready for us to enjoy and it really perfect for a couple plus baby. Being that it is an older duplex, don't be surprised by squeaky floors or doors that don't quite shut. Also, being downtown and across from the police center, you'll occasionally hear sirens and trains going by. We used this home as our base to go hiking nearby at the Garden of the Gods and Seven Falls which worked out well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Kaitlyn‚Äôs. It was perfect for what we needed for the weekend, the kitchen was stocked with the essentials we needed to make our spooky pizzas too!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kaitlyn was such an amazing host. This location is right across from the police station; so it feels very safe for newcomers to the area. My wife loved to take long walks with our two children under two.
Anytime we simply just needed a little assistance - she was responsive quickly, EVERY time.
(We loved the back yard too!)
The amenities were so advanced and up to date.
Loved the shower and the choice of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Smelled really good, not cheap feeling.
My wife is trying to find something that smells like the products used in the store as we speak (lol)!
The choice of seasonings and cooking utensils/dishes/coffee/teas were great! You can even grill if you'd like!
We really enjoyed our time and missed the place on the way out the door (lol)!
Kaitlyn is a professional and efficient host; and my family and I appreciate her and the entire team.
Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was everything I could imagine. Kaitlyn was a great host and it was only a couple minutes of a walk for downtown I highly recommend

Absolutely spotless and very tastefully decorated, felt open and airy, even with its smaller size. Just a note, the bathroom is very cute, but also very compact, if you are a larger person, it would be challenging. We loved it and would come back if ever in the area again!"

The bed was a little stiffer than what I‚Äôm used to but that might just be my preference overall the best place to stay,will definitely be back in the future!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely, relaxing weekend at The Little House at RRCOS! Check in was easy with the keypad and they were extremely responsive anytime we messaged. Unfortunately, the weather put a damper on our plans, but fortunately the Little House was the perfect place to cozy up for a weekend and watch the snow fall on the absolutely beautiful view from their backyard. The location is super easy to get to, and really convenient to get to Downtown Colorado Springs or Old Colorado City. One thing to note is that the bathroom is very small. While Josh and Wendy do note that in their listing, the pictures didn‚Äôt quite do it justice for me. If you are a large person or have mobility issues, it may not be the right house for you, as there is very little room to maneuver and using the toilet might be a challenge. Otherwise, I would highly recommend if you are looking for a great place outside Colorado Springs, there is no way you would find a more peaceful spot!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10!!! I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking to book! Josh & Wendy are extremely kind, and their home is absolutely beautiful.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Josh & Wendy‚Äôs AirBnB exceeding all of our expectations. We sat out to Colorado to get a relaxing vacation away from the city and this Airbnb provided that and more.
We happened to catch Josh upon arrival and he was extremely nice and accommodating. The views absolutely incredible from the back porch. We grilled steaks our final night, and sat by the fireplace our final night and it was just unbelievable. We even saw some mule deer later in the night which was awesome. The living room was cozy with the indoor fireplace. The house was extremely clean and updated. I would recommend this airbnb to friends and family any day of the week. Thank you Josh and Wendy."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic spot, no complaints. Easy to access the GotG, so quick to get to a hike, and a beautiful and serene home to stay in. Easy to get to downtown C. Springs, Manitou, and Old Colorado City. The best AirBnB I have stayed in out of a dozen or so, across all metrics. If I had to gripe, it would be about wanting to take longer showers in a bigger bathroom; hard to make another criticism, haha. Loved our stay, even proposed to my partner here. We will stay here again if we ever get the opportunity."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection! Our favorite vacation by far! The view and amenities may make you want to stay in the entire visit but we highly recommend you head up to Manitou Springs for even more spectacular views, great food and shopping!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house holds a special place in our hearts. It was our 5 year wedding anniversary, we were welcomed with a personalized chalkboard welcome and a card with chocolates and sparkling cider. It was perfect.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this Airbnb! 5 stars is not enough. The house is so tastefully decorated and comfortable, and the views were incredible. Being able to walk down the street and get right onto a trail in the Red Rock Open Space was just perfect for us. And from those trails we got beautiful views of Garden of the Gods. A quick drive was all it took to get those views up close. Sitting around the fire table at night was such a relaxing way to end the day. The hosts were very personable and responsive. An overall fantastic experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This location was such an amazing trip for my wife and I! Josh & Wendy were great at communicating expectations while letting us have the flexibility with our arrival & departure. We felt right at home with all of the amenities. It was perfect for a couple! One of the best parts was the view- the back yard literally overlooks Red Rocks Open Space! Plus, you get a great view of the mountains and the stars at night. The location is close to so much being right between Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. Most of what we did on our vacation was a 30 minute drive or less from this place. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to any couples or small families looking for a great stay in Colorado!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at the Red Rocks Open Space Little House was perfect! The house is cozy, very clean, and artfully decorated. If you‚Äôre not an outdoorsy person, you can view the red rocks and mountains from the living and dining areas. For us, the deck was the place to be! Amazing views of the red rocks and surrounding mountains, the ever changing weather, and so many birds! You hear them and see them often. Two of our favorites were the black-billed magpie and the Bullock‚Äôs oriole. Both stunning birds that we don‚Äôt have at our home on the east coast. In the evening, the fire table adds a magical element to moon and star gazing.
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood off Hwy 24. You can hear traffic noise but it‚Äôs not super loud. We visited over Memorial Day so there were many more cars on the road. The Little House is minutes from quaint and eccentric Manitou Springs and minutes from Garden of the Gods and so many other CO Springs destinations.
Josh & Wendy are terrific. Many stars!"

Even with a handful of neighboring homes-you do not notice them from the back porch and the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. We met some very nice neighbors and the area felt safe. It‚Äôs a great location‚ÄîIt‚Äôs so conveniently located in the middle of everything CO Springs has to offer for tourists. The place was clean, sleeping areas comfortable. Everything is so clearly conveniently labeled around the house which is a huge help! Hosts were easy to reach and very friendly. Will definitely want to book here again on next visit to the area!"

The interior was clean, thoughtfully decorated, and exactly what I needed. They were so accommodating with my needs for an iron and ironing board. They went out of their way to purchase one for me to use.

For coffee lovers tip: bring your own special coffee and enjoy a pour over -over the gorgeous views.

Debra's cabin hit the spot so perfectly. It is tucked in a pretty little loop of small cabins. It felt private and cozy but was close to so many things. We hiked, explored, and returned to a well stocked kitchen to cook our meals. We watched football on the cozy couch with the fireplace warming us up. The bathroom? Gracious, that bathroom. The shower is ahhhhmazing. We loved the comfortable bed and the ease of washing laundry so we could go home without an extra chore. Everything was perfect at the cabin and we plan to come back!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When they say ""no place like home"", it's because they haven't stayed in this cabin. This cabin is exactly as pictured and was perfect for our anniversary staycation. It was private & woody enough to satisfy the cabin feel but only twenty minutes from food & fun. The fully equipped kitchen would have easily been perfect had we decided to stay in.

There's a soaking tub, heated floors, patio with heater, ceiling fans for relaxation. The kitchen comes with a lot of necessities for most meals! A lot of natural light throughout the day and no city light during the night so you'll see a bunch of stars. Although the cabin is on a lot with surrounding cabins, we still felt some sort of peace and privacy as the other guests were quiet and hardly seen. If you decide to go into town there are well known stores within 15 minutes."

The cabin had everything I needed to relax and the views were absolutely amazing!

Everything you need is within 15-20 mins of driving distance so you are still in the peacful atmosphere of nature. The house was immaculate, and I must say the heated floors was the best thing they could have done to this cabin, it was such an appreciated thing when it was down to 4 degrees one night. If you get to be around when it anows it was like a wonderland. The deer that roam the property are so relaxed and beautiful and seem to be there everyday. And if you get the chance to, you have to ask the story of this beautiful property, it's truly an amazing piece of history. We will be back for another one of Debras BNB's."

It‚Äôs beautiful decorated and located just minutes from busy Colorado Springs. The bed was very very comfortable; the soaking tub quite relaxing. We loved being close to BlackForest Park and enjoyed a 4 mile scenic hike. Check out the Honey, Tea and Me shop just down the road‚Ä¶ the bourbon honey was incredible. Our cabin hosts were quick to respond and very friendly and welcoming. We absolutely will be booking this cabin again on our next trip to Colorado."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was beautiful. It felt like a high class resort! The kitchen was immaculate and had all that we needed (except for a baking sheet, but we compromised and used the baking dish). The bathroom was so relaxing, the shower was amazing! The bed was extremely comfortable.
The property surrounding the cabin did not have the same extremely high class, pristine feeling. However, this didn‚Äôt affect our stay much as we were mostly out of the cabin during the day.
Very relaxing and very clean!"

I will say it was a tad hard to find at first, because I arrived after dark. But if you remember it is Cabin D, then just look for the cabin with a ‚ÄúD‚Äù on the side!"

,,,"Beautiful building in a great location; however, we ran into a few issues regarding cleanliness of the unit and a hostile couch that crumbled beneath us when my wife and I sat on it upon arrival. I will say, HOSTE was quick to rectify our troubles and refund us. Of note, the stove eyes were not cleaned and the fans stored in the closet were packed with dust. Understanding it is Colorado, so weather is generally comfortable, the loft remained quite hot as the A/C did not circulate properly in this area of the unit. For this reason, we attempted to make use of the fans provided, but these were packed with dust which coated the loft when we turned them on. The stairs to the loft are also quite narrow, so keep this in mind when booking if you chance to be over 150 lbs. Additionally, there were no blinds on the patio door, so anyone from the street could peer into the main living area (thus privacy was a concern considering the centrality of the unit to downtown). Altogether, the unit is artistically designed, but much work needs to be done for this to be a top-notch stay for any traveller."
,,,Tina apologized and admitted she didn‚Äôt inform me about construction scheduled for Saturday morning in the adjoining room. She did refund the 4 remaining days of my reservation per my request.
