One evening, the yard was full of deer when we came back after dinner! Highly recommend if you are coming to the Black Hills."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy side of a refurbished barn with a serene view of the Hills. The space was just big enough for me and my wife, room to relax and enjoy a meal together. The finishes were clean and modern, and the bed was so comfortable. Had an issue with the a/c but J&J were quick to fix it. Would recommend this location, or any hosted by J&J!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Mom and I really enjoyed our stay here at the beautiful apartment. The view off the porch is breathtaking. The apartment was quiet and lovely. Bed comfortable.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here with my husband and 2 small kids for 4 days. The place was very easy to find and adorable, but it was a bit of a squeeze for the four of us. Unless you travel extremely light, you may run into the same issue we had with clutter and limited space for all of your stuff. We shuffled furniture and personal items around a lot.
My favorite thing was the view! Loved having my coffee outside each morning and watching the wildlife.
Located in a very convenient area that was away from the bustle of town but not too remote that it was a haul to get anywhere. Very quiet and peaceful although the barn is located fairly close to the road."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cabin was perfect for our family of 4 (2 young children). It was close to all the vacation things : Rushmore, Adventure Park, Bear Country and Reptile Gardens. we loved coming back to a peaceful and quiet accommodation with a great view!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Location was situated with excellent access to Rapid City and also to the Black Hills, Custer State Park and just 50 minutes from Wind Cave. Being on the outskirts of Rapid City we were able to enjoy beautiful sunrise and sunset views of rolling hills from the front patio. While small, the accommodations were very comfortable and clean. We were there for four nights. The one downside was that there wasn't a lot of space to spread out, unpack and settle in but we weren't there to spend our time inside. We felt taken care of - J&J was very responsive and provided us all of the information we needed and asked for to make our time there spectacular. I would definitely recommend."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are wanting a place to stay that is quiet and clean with a beautiful view and a minimal drive, this is the place. J&J are great to work with and genuinely enjoy hospitality. Don’t take my word for it though. Book your stay today and find out for yourself."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was just as described. The view is gorgeous and the home was very comfortable. It was a quick drive to town.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean new looking place . Prefect for two people going 50 mins away to the badlands or less than 20 mins to Rushmore. 17 mins to Rapid city airport. White tail deer walk by as you enjoy the Blk hill veiw form the porch.

J & J Hospitality was always prompt in communicating instructions for check in and check out questions.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot…gorgeous views. The drive in was stunning as well.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here at the barn! The accommodations were exactly as advertised, clean, and in a great location relative to Rapid City. We especially enjoyed seeing the deer at sundown and hearing the coyotes/wolves howling at night from Bear Country USA or in the woods. I would come back to this property if I am back in Rapid City and highly recommend it for couples or small families.
The property host is top-notch, very warm and communicated frequently during our stay to make sure everything was up to our and their high standards. And when we had an issue (of our own creation) they worked with us to resolve the issue fairly and quickly, something I appreciated as a new Airbnb user. I would happily use this host again based on our experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a GREAT location! The barn was amazing and the views were great!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great vacation at this barn home in the Black Hills. It was centrally located to all main attractions but far enough to get away from the tourist areas. Coffee in the morning on the back patio was very enjoyable (especially since the hosts provided local coffee to try!) The hosts were very responsive and the next door neighbors were unnoticeable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a great stop . Owner was communicative & responsive, Home was clean & inviting. Location was excellent for some sight seeing & we even got to enjoy the view & the gas fire pit. So glad we chose to stay there - highly recommend"

Each and everyday was another adventure filled with much to do and the airbnb was the best place to go after such an exciting day, peaceful indeed. We loved our stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a true gem. The views are breathtaking and the barn is a perfect stay. We have two children- they slept on the pull out couch and were fine. A great place for families.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place to stay. It’s in a great location. I just wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the place.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication and accommodations. Wouldn’t change a thing about our stay, the lodging, or especially the views. Still within Uber/Lyft range from town, but feels very secluded and private. Will be staying here again next time through town!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great and very clean place to stay. We enjoyed staying here, has everything you need. Was very close to travel to your destinations of Mt. Rushmore, National parks, and the grocery stores. Enjoyed the relaxing evening on the patio with the fire pit and the view is beautiful,"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great accommodations in a really fun area! Super close to Mount Rushmore and other fun attractions and even caught some glimpses of wildlife right outside the window! Really appreciated the hosts’ hospitality and thoughtfulness with the provided amenities. Would absolutely recommend to everyone!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location. Short drive from everything plus the great view. Very clean and quiet.
The bed needs to be a queen size."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay! Loved how close it was to town, yet still on the outer skirts & quiet! Also close to some really great hiking trails in the Black Hills National Forest. Had everything we needed & the coffee was so great! I would say it’s perfect for a couple or couple + baby (us!) - it would be a tight squeeze for 4 people!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place that is close to all the attractions around the Rapid City area, this is a great place! Our host was responsive.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfy spot close to everything you need. Beautiful views and plenty of room for the four of us!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my husband & I while we visited the Black Hills and surrounding attractions. We loved being able to cook and have a space to relax when we weren’t out running around!
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful place with the perfect view! It was very much as advertised. It is on the smaller side, so just be aware of that if bringing food/luggage, and 4 people. Its half the size of the barn pictured. It’s very clean and the hosts are very accommodating! It’s nice and close to Rapid City, but you feel like you are in your own space! It’s so peaceful. We traveled all over and it fell right in the middle of all our adventures. We loved it and would have no hesitations in staying there again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay! Close to town with amazing views! Definitely worth a stay if I’m the Rapid City area!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome apartment inside an adorable barn! Great location and helpful hosts.
If you're visiting the Black Hills, we highly recommend staying here."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place in the side of a barn! It was clean and nicely labeled. Only suggestions would be that there was no light leading to the house or it side so check in was hard to find and get in. Another thing to note is low water pressure in the sinks. Last thing is just seems like a lot of cleaning for the guests to do (strip the bed, take out trash, do all dishes), so curious what our cleaning fee was for. Just felt like a lot."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful stay away from the hustle and bustle of in town. Breath taking views, along with clean and amazing follow up from the host. Making our stay even more accommodating."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Unique place, clean, and pretty location."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at the barn. Close enough to everything yet far enough away to be secluded and have a beautiful view. Anything and everything you would need/want to have a comfortable stay and feel at home is provided. We will definitely be staying again if we ever get back to the area. Thanks again
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gosh the Barn at Moon Meadows was just perfect! Pictures were identical to what I found when I arrived! Awesome communication from J&J! I was able to have my privacy, but was confident that they were right there if I needed anything!
Thanks again for an awesome stay!!!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay when visiting the Black Hills!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The barn was located perfectly on the edge of Rapid City and was a great home base for our travels. It was very nice to have a kitchen to cook in instead of eating out. I highly recommend this location.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I loved the place, out of town but also close to town and everything else! There was another house close by but the description was very transparent so we knew what to expect and we weren't bothered at all. Overall a great experience."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and a fantastic place to stay. I highly recommend you stay here, great amenities and beautiful location."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is so amazing and you definitely feel a sense of privacy. There were an abundance of towels and dishes to use. the bed and pillows were so comfortable. I like that you can change the thermostat setting in each room. Everything was so clean and perfect. I will definitely stay here again especially due to the proximity to all of my favorite places like Crazy Horse , Needles HWY, Black Hills Forest, and Mt. Rushmore."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My first airbnb experience went so well. My wife and I honeymooned here and loved having what we needed to not have to go out when we didnt want to and the convenience of being so close to everything in Rapid City when we did.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The barn was super clean and had everything we needed for our stay with our infant. The views were outstanding and location was perfect. Highly recommend staying here, catch the sunrise over the rolling hills and wildlife right out the front door!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet, quality unit with great location and a fantastic view.
We were so impressed with the accuracy of the description of this rental: quality linens, bedroom decor, kitchen items, cleanliness and hosts that stayed in contact daily. The personal touches of local coffee and treats was extra nice. We enjoyed nearby hikes and felt the beauty of the Hills while still minutes from the city. What a gem."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Sweet little spot with a great sunset view. Clean & tidy with great hospitality! Thank you!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and accurate description. Great location. Really enjoyed the gift of coffee grounds from the host.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here during our 1st Airbnb experience…it was perfect! For starters, the view is amazing! The location blends being secluded and being close to the city. All-in-all it was great stay and we would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn was a great place to stay! Super clean. Exactly what we wanted. It’s away from town but not a bad drive to the Badlands, Custer State Park, and Mt. Rushmore. The view from the sofa while drinking our morning coffee was amazing! We had a great time and would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Super nice!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place and close to Rapid City.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"J&J Hospitality is a wonderful location to visit Mount Rushmore and the surrounding area. It is a cozy place and perfect for a couple. It is a bit small for a family of four but if you are just sleeping, this is a great location for kids. We were gone all day so space was not an issue for us. J&J hospitality welcomes guests with local coffee, local chocolates, and a guest book with notes from previous guests. It was very fun to read! There are not a lot of lights on the roads and we arrived after dark. I would recommend arriving before sundown."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The barn on moon meadow was the perfect place to stay for my husband and I on our road trip west from the UP. We loved every minute! Couldn’t have asked for a better stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous stay at the barn! Super clean & comfortable! Loved sitting out in the morning watching the sun come up with a hot cup of coffee as deer passed through. Would highly recommend J & J and would stay with them again next time we are out here. Thank you for providing a 5-star experience.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing!
the location was perfect ( not too far or close to the city)
The walking trails just west of the cabin are a 5-10 drive.
the view from the back patio are so beautiful especially with the included gas fire pit! we had deer come the the patio eating grass every morning!
the Hosts were very kind and helpful!
My wife and I will be going back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"a wonderfully clean and peaceful place to stay. it was a perfect last stop on a cross country road trip before we made our way home. you can’t find a better, more comfortable place to stay!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A touch of paradise for the weary traveler--this space is truly an oasis--a place to land and rest in between all the adventures of the Badlands/Black Hills/Rapid City area. The place was truly spotless--and this is a big deal to my very picky wife who has a standard of expectation that is seldom met. This unit surpassed her standards and was delightful. The hosts are great to work with, the unit is well-equipped, and waking up to snow was like waking up in a postcard. Highly recommended!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean and cozy, close to many amenities! Views are beautiful!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice location, immediately adjacent to an occupied residential house. Note that there is a beautiful picture of a larger building, but this rental is about 1/3rd of the space as the rest is inaccessible garage and storage. The host communication is excellent, as they indicate they can be contacted directly via phone/text 24x7. The location is about 15 minutes drive from the historical downtown of Rapid City, and is a great launch point to the major tourist attractions. The couch is super comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped, and the view from the couch through the sliding glass doors is of a nice open valley. This is a great location to enjoy some quiet time between excursions."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and just as described. Hosts are great with communicating and answered every question we had quickly. Location was perfect for us!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was truly a fantastic experience. My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and couldn’t have been more pleased with our stay. The barn was clean, the views were beautiful and the location was centrally located to downtown Rapid City and Keystone. We enjoyed relaxing on the back porch by the fire pit and were visited by a gang of turkeys, a deer and a host of rabbits. The barn is perfect for couples who are simply looking to unwind. Josephine & Joseph are very attentive should you need anything or have a questions. They respect your privacy, and all communication was done via text/email. This property is highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved the view and location of this condo! It was so beautiful! The condo was very clean and the bed was very comfortable! We will definitely stay there again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Great views and location! I would definitely stay here again! Perfect for two people who spend the day in the hills and cook supper there at night.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place in the country and about 15 minutes from many of the main attractions. The bed is super comfortable and the hosts were so kind to leave treats and locql coffee.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This very cute converted barn was perfect for a couple to stay in. Just far enough from Rapid City to enjoy the scenery and close enough to enjoy the amenities.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay to be close to Rapid City and the surrounding sites. Ultra clean, small but efficient, hosts keep in contact, and the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What wonderful hosts. Such a clean & cozy little spot with added local touches that just made the stay so much more pleasant (local coffee sitting on the Adirondack chairs enjoying the peaceful view)! Jose & Jordan were quick to reply to my questions and generous with dinner suggestions!
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"When driving to this home we were so excited to have some peace and quiet and great views as the post says and portrays. Upon arrival we were instantly bummed. The backside of the property is right on a busy road. When sitting outside all you hear are cars driving by. When we walked around to the back porch that has the ""view"" there is a new build house obstructing the ""view"" that was not in the pictures. The owners house is steps from the porch. When we were sitting on the patio we could hear the owner doing dishes and see her standing in the window looking at us. On that side of the owners house is also a living room window and we could see them sitting on the couch. Another thing that caught us off guard was the Ring system they had installed to see every time a renter comes and go's from the property. We felt as if we were being watched and or listened to. The rental was clean other than the tub (it had a dirt ring around it that I cleaned before using) and some trash that was stuck in the bushes on the patio. This rental does not have a stocked kitchen like other rentals we have been in. So if your planning to cook, bring everything you need down to the spices and something to store leftovers in. Jordan was responsive and listened to our concerns about the property not being what was portrayed but Josephine never responded when reached out to. Jordan did offer one of their other properties for a night to try and make things right. This home is nice but if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not the property."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for exploring the area and excellent accommodations.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the place to stay at in Rapid City!! Josephine and Jordan are wonderful hosts! The place was clean, thoughtful, and close to everything we were seeing in the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is the perfect location for all the attractions nearby. The bed was so comfortable and they even bought us a box fan for the bedroom. The fire pit is a cozy place to watch the deer and bunnies play.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay! Everything was so clean, and well taken care of. It was absolutely perfect for my husband and I, the views out of the slider window were amazing! Such a perfect location too, we felt super comfortable! The personal touches like local coffee, bottled water, and snacks were so sweet! We will definitely stay here again if we are ever in the area!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice place with a fantastic view.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We traveled from New York State. The barn was super clean and a great location which was quiet but still close to town. Overall enjoyed the stay very much.
Thanks
Neil."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Close to everything. But you won't want to leave. Could sit on the patio forever. Views amazing. Very new, clean, updated, cozy. Bed is comfy. Highly recommend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gave good review
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,absolutely beautiful stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A terrific location with a great view. We explored the the Badlands, Custer State Park, Mount Rushmore & the Black Hills from this central location. Deer outside in the morning while having coffee, hummingbird moths and a Great Horned owl in the evenings. Our hosts were excellent communicators and reached out during our stay to make sure everything was satisfactory. We would definitely stay again."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location for us and our travels including Mount Rushmore. View out back was nice. Small indoor eating area if you have more than 2 people, but weather was nice so we ate at table outside."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were here with two adults and two kids (8 & 6). Hands down, one of the cleanest rentals we have ever stayed at. Pictures were very accurate of what was included. The location was by far one of the best features-close enough to everything we wanted to do (hike, Mt Rushmore, Custer, Badlands), but still remote where it felt like you were away from a big tourist town! ;) One caveat, this wasn’t a big deal for us but more of an FYI to others, while this can sleep four, this is definitely set up for two people (example: table has two chairs, porch has two chairs around the fire). Thankfully there was a picnic table on the porch where we had our meals, and with small kids this wasn’t a huge deal for us at all. Check in was easy and great communication. Would definitely recommend and would, without any hesitation, stay here again! :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful views and very clean! Owners are very responsive and communicate quickly if needed! Barn is in an amazing location! Highly recommend!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, clean home for our family trip."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and nice stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All I can say is WOW! you will not be dissatisfied staying at this Air bnb! they left snacks and water as a treat and everything is sparkling clean! we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend staying here. very convenient to all sights!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place is in a great location if you are looking to try a bit of everything the Black Hills has to offer. Clean and comfortable for a couples weekend away!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful barn stay! Lovely view, very comfortable, clean and spacious. The front porch has a great view for your morning coffee."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the barn! The location absolutely can’t be beat. We did Mt. Rushmore, Custer State Park, The Mammoth Site and Badlands in our 3 day stop in SD. This was centrally located and made it super easy. It was clean and well stocked. I was worried about the lack of central air but the unit in the bedroom combined with the ceiling fans kept it very comfortable on a 86 degree day. The host checked in a couple times to make sure things were going well. Our only critique would have been to have a small corner mounted TV in the living room as opposed to just the bedroom. There was a stormy evening and a movie in the living room would have been nice. This was also the first time we have been asked to leave the key in the lockbox at all times. My husband grumbled about that as it did get old opening the lockbox to get the key and then unlocking the door each time. Minor annoyances and overall a really fantastic place to stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josie and Jordan are amazing hosts. Everything was perfect, and the extra touches made our stay so much more. It was a super hot weekend, opened the fridge and there were cold waters waiting for us. The views are breathtaking and we enjoyed having breakfast out on the porch over looking the hills. Size was just enough for my husband and I. Super clean and Josie and Jordan were available at anytime. Looking forward to our next trip back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here for a week during our trip to the Black Hills. The location is ideal for visiting all of the main attractions (Custer State Park, Wind Cave, Mt. Rushmore and Crazy Horse, even Devils Tower) and the views were great to enjoy in the evening from the porch. The Airbnb is a good size for 2 people and pictures in the listing were accurate. Josie and Jordan were wonderful to communicate with, always quick and helpful responses. Would definitely recommend to others visiting the area!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The barn was a great little place to rest our heads at night after exploring The Hills during the day! It was exceptionally clean (which is so important to our family), was stocked with everything you’d need, and had comfortable beds (a queen bed and pull out couch for our 2 girls). It is small, perfect for 2 adults and 2 children maximum. We loved going into Rapid City’s adorable downtown area for dinner one night, and then touring the surrounding little Black Hills towns the other evening. The barn is located a little closer to Rapid City, but a quick 15-20 minute drive to all the tourist attractions, such ad Mt Rushmore, Custer State Park, Crazy Horse Memorial, etc.
It is only 5 minutes away from a few other attractions.
We enjoyed our stay at The Barn and would highly recommend to anyone heading to The Black Hills!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My kids and I enjoyed our stay and will be back! Great communication and location was perfect. Gorgeous setting. Highly recommended!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location with great views that can be enjoyed from the front porch. Not a huge place but it worked for my myself, husband and infant. Very clean. The host did a great job communicating as well."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place to stay, perfectly situated west of Rapid City for going to all the major sites. Peaceful and quiet, wonderful view of rolling hills from the back patio. Loved the fire table!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is very conveniently located in relation to just about everywhere you would want to visit while in Rapid City. The view of the hills is priceless; the covered patio and chairs make for great outdoor board game playing and reading in the evening. The neighborhood is safe and friendly. The barn, which is situated directly next to a primary home, was extremely clean and well organized."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I highly recommend this awesome place to anyone traveling to the Black Hills. The location is awesome. Beautiful views. The owners & hosts are great. We had a great stay. Perfect for a family of 4.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was so clean and spotless. Great host and beautiful home. We plan to be back soon!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you're looking for a great location close to many great attractions and a quiet neighborhood then this place is perfect for you! Great views from the front porch and very quiet. It is on the small side so best for a couple or a family with one or two small children. The bed is very comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked but there is no dishwasher. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay, the view was incredible and each night we got to see deer in the backyard. So peaceful!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view of the Black Hills and a quiet place to relax. We were grateful for the convenience to Rapid City and hospitable neighbors. We will definitely consider returning to this location next trip to South Dakota.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Airbnb for the first time ever and will definitely do it again. We had our own space on the top of a hill in Rapid City so it was really quiet. Plus, there was great scenery for sunrises and sunsets. It’s not too far from stores or restaurants which was nice if we needed anything. Management was always on call if you needed them, and were very friendly. The Airbnb itself was perfect for the two of us, though it looks like it could sleep 4 people altogether. It was very clean, beds were comfortable, and we had a blast! I’d highly recommend this place if you’re traveling in South Dakota!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean space. Perfect for a couple getaway. The view was amazing and was just outside of Rapid city dk still close to everything. The extras the host put into the reservation were thoughtful and appreciated, we loved our weekend getaway!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location; close to downtown, Mount Rushmore,Crazy Horse, and badlands.Very well maintained. Everything was labeled and easy to find.The shower had great temperature. Small touches made it feel very welcoming. Bed was soft and warm. The view was beautiful. The barn is behind a home but still felt very private."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and safe place. Would stay here again. Easy to communicate with and nice view out back. No problems at all.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place with a fabulous morning view! It was a great place to enjoy a long morning coffee.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great spot in Rapid City! We enjoyed our stay and the thoughtful touches of local chocolates and coffee. Just know the barn is on a busy street if you care about that (wasn’t noisy at all though) and the barn shares the same property as the main house (but you still have your own space). Overall recommend!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was a really nice place! Wish I didn’t have to go back to CO so soon due to certain things.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful space, clean, spacious and absolutely lovely view. Very peaceful. Special hospitality touches such as truffles and water bottles. Super comfortable bed. Many thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay on our journey from Chicago to Seattle!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful location and view of the Blackhills! Enjoyed seeing deer and turkey wandering by the property. We are also birders so enjoyed seeing different birds.
Very comfortable and host was friendly and accommodating. If you’re big on cooking and plan to cook big meals, this may not be your place. There is not a regular kitchen with oven/stove but there is a convection toaster oven and plug stovetop. So, planning to host Thanksgiving here may not be a good idea but it’s perfectly fine for simple meals. Overall, we would definitely book this place again if we return to Rapid City."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The walk out basement had a good view.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place truly shows the beauty of the Black Hills, comfortable and a great place to enjoy fun with friends."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Private neighborhood and private back entrance to the basement of the home. The space was neat, clean, and just perfect. The little kitchen area was perfect for us and had the washer and dryer in there which was super convenient! My husband never heard me while I was getting ready so that was nice not waking him. Host was very responsive as well!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean and private. A perfect place to have our family gathering. We enjoyed the darts and pool table, and the great view. I would definitely recommend for other guests."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean and an amazing view!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The space was prestine and welcoming. My wife and I enjoyed our stay here with our German Shepherd. Very comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptionally great place to stay. Great scenery in the back yard. Enjoyed the wildlife that showed up. Quiet neighborhood.
Slept great on that foam mattress. Instructions were clear. My stay overall was superb. Thank you."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it was great
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was quiet and clean. Only the kitchen-equipment, like the oven, could have been a little cleaner. The beds were a little bit too soft for our taste, everything else was very good. We loved the views, the deer in the garden and the pool table.
The apartment was easy to find and the communication was always quick. Thank you for a nice 3 nights stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Kind regards from the boys from Bavaria✌️
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome stay! Would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! The host was extremely accommodating for bad weather, and the place was spotless with an amazing view! Pictures don’t do it justice. Stay here if you want an amazing Black Hills experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful scenery. All the small things done right like coffee pods and laundry detergent provided. Shower had great water pressure which was nice after exploring the surrounding areas all day. Overall had a great stay even despite the snow storm that blew in!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay! It was very spacious and clean. The host was responsive and gave clear instructions.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. Clean and comfortable setting in the lower level of Ryan's home, with a beautiful view."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice Quiet peaceful place to just relax
Enjoyed the stay"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay near Rapid City. The view from the backyard is gorgeous! Nice secluded home if you’re looking to get away from the bustle of a big city! We stayed here to see Badlands National Park and Wind Cave National Park! Would highly recommend this home!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love the view!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place in a beautiful area, just like the pics"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"relaxed, slept, packed and left. It was fine for what we needed. The view is very beautiful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Even though the location was a little out of town, it was still close enough to lots of restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions. It was nice to have the convenience of being close to town, but having the surrounds of the Black Hills out the back door with wildlife coming by to say hi. Best of both worlds for sure!
The bedrooms were large and had comfortable mattresses. The bathroom was the perfect size and a great shower.
There was a variety of family games and a pool table to play."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is AMAZING: the deer out the window, the view, the peacefulness, the comfiness of the beds, you name it. I am already trying to rebook it for my next trip out there!!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our weekend. The views were great! And the wildlife were beautiful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view and amazing host! Ryan was very friendly and responsive. The home was very comfortable, spotless, and had an amazing view. Top 3 places I’ve ever stayed."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay, very quiet and cozy. We felt very comfortable during our stay, would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"TRUST THE 5 STAR REVIEWS!!!
I stayed for two nights and felt right at home! Cozy atmosphere, squeaky clean bathroom, comfortable beds, kitchen with more than enough utensils as well as ICE in the freezer😍 I would recommend Ryan’s place to anyone wanting to stay near Rapid City! Thank you for hosting us!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, beautiful views and just the right distance from town to a quiet peaceful accommodations!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location. Ryan does an excellent job as a host. Great touch with a Christmas Tree during our stay. Even though there was a blizzard on our last day, he went above and beyond ensuring snow was plowed and clean so we could get out of the driveway. Recommend to anyone and a great value."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable. Beautiful views.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay. Would love to stay again! Everything was labeled and easily understood. Very responsive to messages.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Good view.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Priceless Black Hills View is a wonderful peaceful stay just outside of Rapid City and about an hour North of Mount Rushmore and many other National Parks. We loved the open space and the large sliding glass door. It truly is a priceless view. The laundry washer and dryer really helped on our trip and we loved all of the kitchen appliances and utensils. There was enough heaters and blankets that the cold wasn’t a problem at all. We felt right at home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay for a visit to rapid city and mt. Rushmore.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love the neighborhood and closeness to everything. That view is the best. Love the amenities the kitchen has plus games and such to do. My only complaint is the beds weren’t as comfy, however, I would stay again because everything else was great. Worth it for the view and peacefulness of the neighborhood. Loved getting to see the deer and turkeys in the yard!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here. Great place. Comfy beds. Nice shower.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super nice apartment. Would highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous airbnb! Clean, great location, would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Only spent one night here but it was amazing. You have your own wonderful private view with large glass doors and windows. Super nice shower! The pool table and darts are a nice touch as well!
2023-11-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Overall very nice location! We felt like the ad was somewhat deceiving. This is a “private” basement in a house. Could hear the upstairs resident. Also not advertised that there is a dog on property.
Ryan was not as pleasant as we had hoped. The parking instructions was not clear. Because we were not aware of the housing situation, the specific keywords in the property instructions were misleading. Ryan flew in guns blazing, acting super “confused” on where we parked as the posting only described parking as “upper” and “lower” parking, with big vehicles and trailers to park in the upper area. Big vehicles or trailers should just park in the street."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place with plenty of deer around the neighborhood. Calm and serene. The apartment very comfortable with plenty of amenities. I recommend this place without reservations.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan's place was beautiful inside and outside with bedrooms 1 bah. Everything you need for comfort and even inside entertainment when you stay there. you can play billiards and watch satellite tv and more. I saw 5 deer when I was there and 10 more on the way to Mt Rushmore and Chief Crazy Horse.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and quiet place to stay with a beautiful view!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was just what our family needed. The house was spacious clean and well organized. The kitchen was well equipped and they even had plastic utensils that were handy for our little three-year-old. The beds and sofas were nice and comfortable. We loved playing billiards and dart board. Definitely would recommend it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ryan’s place was beautiful! Great basement apartment in the hills with great views all around. His dog is friendly and we had no issues with noise or anything. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place. Great location. Really cool to see all the deer wandering around the neighborhood at dusk and dawn.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan’s place was amazing!! Way better for my family then staying in a motel!! We will be back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great spot! Plenty of parking and a beautiful view of the trees - even saw 3 deer in the backyard when we arrived. Check in was easy.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan's place is great - super clean, comfortable and fun! has a great pool table, darts, TV. great views and very quiet. we enjoyed our stay there with our dog. would recommend if you need a place in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying here! The space was clean and felt like home. Kitchen & bathroom were stocked with essentials. The scenery and drive up to the place was wonderful, watch for deer! Far enough out of town to be quiet, yet close enough to still go to town quick and get Armadillos after the sun goes down. Super quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed drinking our tea on the patio every morning and taking in the view and serene sounds. Enjoyed playing pool every night too!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I'm
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"That view is priceless, many deer grazing in neighborhood and very peaceful!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were extremely impressed with the place and it was a great, safe location. The view was amazing and the wild turkey and deer were frequent visitors. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay while they explore the Black Hills!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan's place was BEAUTIFUL!! Everything was clean and comfortable just as described! The beds were comfortable and we enjoyed our morning coffee with a breathtaking view!
We traveled with our two dogs and they loved the walk through the quiet neighborhood!
We highly recommend a stay at Ryan's place!
Happy Travelers from Iowa"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful view, peaceful back patio. Made great use of the grill with lovely Sept weather. Very nice neighborhood to walk our dogs. Lots of wildlife right out the sliding glass door. Lots to do and see in the area; great central location for Mt Rushmore, Deadwood, etc"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location definitely lives up to the description --> Priceless View! it was so beautiful and relaxing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay, thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for a road trip overnight! Was especially nice to have some space to stretch out after a long day in the car. Beautiful view and really appreciated the access to laundry! Would definitely stay again if in Rapid City.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will be back!! Stayed for a family vacation with our 2 young children, so the community pool was a plus. Very clean, quiet place to stay with amazing views. Would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely incredible views of the Black Hills behind the house! Nothing better than spending the morning drinking coffee on the back porch. The house was incredibly clean and comfortable. We appreciated all the little touches around the house to make us feel comfortable and welcome!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This rental is equipped with everything that you would need long term or short term, so it felt like home. It was very quiet and private with amazing views. The beds, pillows, and linens are all very comfortable. It was also nice having the ability to cook our own food in the microwave and toaster oven. Loved the deer and wild turkey that we saw everywhere. We especially loved playing pool after our daily excursions, which were within minimal driving distance, and then settling in on comfy furniture as we relaxed to the tv. We loved that things were clearly labeled and included simple to follow instructions in the kitchen area. They have thought of everything from laundry to games. To top it all off, the hosts are wonderful to visit with. Very kind and genuine people."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the views are amazing…deer right out your patio door. Place was stocked with coffee, creamer and sugar as well as bathroom amenities. Large living room area with pool table and darts. Made for a relaxing evening before we left. Easy access to tourist places."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a find! Gorgeous setting and spacious homey comfortable accommodations. Great access to all Black Hills sites but in a pristine neighborhood set apart from all the tourist commotion. We enjoyed all of the amenities, including the pool and sports courts down the street. Pool table, dartboard and mammoth TV also kept us entertained. Thank you, Ryan, for sharing this property and your hospitality with us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 stayed at Ryan’s place during our South Dakota vacation. The location was clean, well kept, and beautiful as others have noted with a gorgeous open view of the Black Hills from the living room patio door/windows.
This location is the basement level of a larger home, but the connecting doors were locked, and we had a private entrance and parking spot. The bedrooms and living room had full size windows, and the floor design did not feel like it was a basement. We only twice in four days heard any noise from upstairs.
We were appreciative of the complimentary laundry, full-size refrigerator, and outside grill. The kids loved the pool table and dart board!
The pool and playground in the pictures are a short walk from the rental and were free. While the home and neighborhood are outside of Rapid City, we were still able to have Doordash delivered one night. There were also no stairs to enter the basement level which made it very accessible. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a blast at Ryan’s place! The description and pictures matched when we arrived for our trip. We seen hundreds of deer on our drives to and from Ryan’s place, enjoyed the pool table and the pool which was just up the road. All the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was just as described. The washer and dryer were also a nice touch as we came home with clean clothes. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay with Ryan if we ever visit the black hills again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, wonderful surroundings, and has everything you need when you are away from home. the pool table and dart board were a perfect extra for the nights when we just wanted to stay in."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay with beautiful views!!!! We definitely loved it and would stay there again!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We all loved it. Great location easy driving to the Bad lands and Crazy Horse, and the best stop Mount Rushmore. The second night after dinner 4 deer where in the back yard."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the place. We were drinking a glass of wine outside on patio when 2 deer came up grazing. We truly enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this place. Would stay again in a heartbeat! The unit is so comfortable and well appointed. Felt like home! My husband and brother loved the pool table while relaxing in the evening! We planned excursions every day to all of the RC sites, and so enjoyed coming back to this comfy, beautiful location. We travel with our dogs and we had a wonderful time walking in the neighborhood in the evenings. Tons of deer, beautiful homes and ranches! So glad we stayed here! Made our wonderful trip to Mt Rushmore, Black Hills and Badlands perfect!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous surroundings. Second time staying and will definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan’s house is beautiful. Just right for our one night stay. The view was incredible

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful it had everything you need to feel right at home with an amazing view and wildlife.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was quick to answer my questions in response to the ability for my hubs electric scooter getting into the home. It was just as he described. He was accommodating in letting us change our check in date a day later. The home is immaculate, very well decorated, the bathroom was large and the beds VERY comfortable. The kitchen suited our needs as we grilled our first night. The first morning we were greeted with 2 deer grazing in the yard!
Our only complaint was there was no thermostat control for us to control the heat to our liking. It was VERY cold and windy the night we arrived. We were freezing even though we had the electric fireplace. I contacted Ryan and he was able to adjust the temperature. The second night I had to reach out again and again he was quick to adjust the temperatures. All in all it was a great place to hang our hats as we explored many sites while we were in the area. We would definitely book again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous! The place truly felt like home away from home. Beautiful neighborhood, gorgeous views, and a private/quiet location. Very well appointed with everything you could need. Waking up, having a cup of coffee and looking out towards the mountains was a great start to our day. Very quiet hosts also! Great stay, would definitely stay again and highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We visited Mnt rushmore from wisconsin, and after a 10 hour drive we were thankful the place was very comfty and accommodating. AMAZING view of Blackhills right in the back yard. Place is as shown on air BNB. Pay attention to it. We didn't notice in the pics no television in bedrooms and we had 3 kids! There was a snow storm. We attempted to do a store run but got stuck in driveway. Owner was nice enough to come out with extra salt to help us back in!
Other than that we loved the recreations provided, great replacement for extra televisions. will stay again if need be!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful view. Comfortable Acommodations.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just like all the other reviews- super well-stocked with everything you’d need for a stay along with a beautiful view from the backyard! We had wild turkeys in the backyard in the morning :) great one-night stay for us and we even got a round of pool in! Just note you’ll need to clean any dishes you end up using and take the trash out in the morning. We would absolutely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Incredible place and the views out back were amazing! We were greeted by deer when we arrived and enjoyed a nice hike down the back hill. The place, itself, was great... hands down the cleanest and nicest place we've ever stayed. The pool table and dart board are a great touch, as well. We will definitely stay here again the next time we need a weekend in the Black Hills."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Good host made check in easy and the place exceeded expectations!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place on outskirts of Rapid City. Beautiful location. We had wild turkeys and deer right outside the patio.

Great all around place. We would come back"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time here, the amenities at the house were more than thoughtful, Ryan went above, and beyond to ensure that every guest felt welcome in the home. Perfect place for kids, people with pets, or even just couples. Cannot wait to stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at this scenic place! The views were beautiful and it wasn’t too far of a commute around Rapid City. It was pretty peaceful and a great experience for my first time staying in a guest sweet. You get the entire downstairs of their beautiful home to yourself with no cleaning fees! My only thing would be that you can hear people walking around upstairs occasionally but I’d still say it’s a good stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We chose Ryan’s place based on the description and it was just as he’d said. Peaceful, stunning view, wildlife, amazingly starry skies, clean and comfortable, and felt very private. It was a great place to stay for us while in Rapid City for outpatient surgery. With deer grazing just outside the glass doors, and gorgeous Ponderosa Pine trees dotting the hillside, it was the perfect, place for recovering from outpatient surgery and that amazing Black Hills Surgical Hospital. Thank you to a great host-Ryan!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic staycation spot with a beautiful view. I felt like I was home the moment I walked in.

The view was spectacular and we enjoyed the deer who would visit in the evening The place had everything we needed for our stay and we have rebooked because we loved our stay so much. Great host!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect! The only downside was that the unit was so cold! They had a space heater for the bedroom but the rest of the place was super cold and the thermostats were taped over so we couldn't touch them
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home and the view is awesome.
I highly recommend it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the best places I’ve stayed — breathtaking view and spotless bedrooms and bathrooms. I hope I could stay longer but had to follow a road trip schedule. Hopefully can stay again in the future!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description and pictures does not do justice for the comfort of this stay and barely scratches the surface of the gorgeous view. Amenties and nods toward guest comfort were above and beyond. The beds and linens were superb. Honestly didn't want to leave and can't wait to go back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous view- definitely as described!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! Exceeded our expectations. Perfect location, gorgeous views. Clean, comfortable and plenty of entertainment. Close to everything, yet feels like country life."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed during the homeward leg of our 7 week cross country trip. Could not have asked for a better place on a Friday night.

Highly recommend!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place to stay. Loved the location, well appointed space, the pool table and darts, the ""extra"" treats in the well stocked kitchen and the comfort and cleanliness of the entire home. Wish we would have been able to stay a bit longer and enjoy some outside time on the nice patio. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ryan’s home was amazing, everything we needed and check in was easy, was a great place to relax and feel restored, would definitely go back! :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful view, comfortable place to stay near Rapid but up out of town, which was very peaceful. Lots of deer visiting throughout the area. We enjoyed the darts and pool table, and appreciated having access to a full-size fridge and appliances for cooking. Definitely would recommend as a nice, comfortable place to stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ryan's place was absolutely like home. Quiet and cozy. We stayed when the weather was foggy. Which was like a added treat if you're an individual that likes the calming feel of rain and fog. Gave more depth to the scenery from our view out across the hills.
We had wonderful communication and comfortable privacy. Would definitely recommend a stay here. It is located perfectly in proximity to all the beautiful things to go see."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great view! Quiet and peaceful.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We don’t have enough good words to say about this place! It’s tucked back in some windy roads but it’s so private and well worth it! Between the incredible view from the backyard where we ate dinner with a few deer, super comfortable beds/sofas, bathroom and kitchen being stocked incredibly well, and everything being spotless, we were so glad to have had this place as a stop on our road trip. Most things (light switches, small directions, etc.) were labeled clearly and super helpful. This home is spacious enough for a couple to spread out or a small group to relax comfortably! Should we find ourselves in the area again, we would be happy to book this listing again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, loved the deers in the back yard. Very peaceful."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time here! Ryan’s place is so cozy and comfortable. We had everything we needed. The property is vert beautiful and we were able to see about 20 deers right from the windows.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place. Loved the wildlife and the beautiful views/neighborhood! Close enough to everything but far enough away to not feel like you're stuck in the city! We would definitely stay here again!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan’s home is absolutely gorgeous! It’s situated in a serene location, with plenty of friendly “pets”. Its quiet, peaceful, and surrounded by nature. You could say it was home away from home. It had everything we needed that we couldn’t bring. I definitely can say that the pool table was our favorite!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful accommodations and scenery. Immaculately clean. This is the basement area of a larger home but private entrance and very large space. Quiet and peaceful. We saw a fawn and a 4 point Buck right outside our window in the morning. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you for sharing your home!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, very spacious and comfy!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful place to stay! The great view, wildlife, pool access, and games made it a great place to wind down after all of the sightseeing around the Black Hills. The kids are already asking when we can come back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay! We wanted a place outside of town and this was perfect. It is in a neighborhood but it is quiet and stargazing was great! We had an issue with check-in but Ryan came and quickly rectified the situation. This is the bottom level of a home and there are people who live above. I didn't remember seeing that in the description but we didn't hear them. We will definitely try to stay here again when we get back to the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was amazing! Our 10 year-old grandson loved having a pool to jump into after a long day of activities. The house is beautiful, clean and convenient. Ryan is quick to answer questions if you have them. We hope to be back again."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The view really is priceless! It was incredible watching a doe and her fawn right outside the door the evening we arrived. This location is a beautiful one!
The property is beautiful inside as well! The rooms are comfortable and the pool table lots of fun! My kids also really enjoyed the Lincoln Logs that Ryan left out for us! :)
The details left around that were posted made knowing the rules super simple which was great! We only had a short overnight stay, but it was a great one and would be a lovely place to come again to so we could go enjoy the pool and playground up the street. Maybe next time! :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Views are amazing, we saw so many dear in the morning. The place was extremely clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with lots of wildlife around it. Ryan’s place is clean, provides tons of privacy and nice amenities. If we ever make it back to the area we will definitely consider Ryan’s place for a second time!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as advertised, the view is spectacular and amenities are great. Very nicely put together.
What a nice place for a couple with older kids, pool table, dartboard and tons of games.
Best AirBnB we’ve stayed in so far!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan's space and location were wonderful. It is located in a very nice neighborhood with the back of the property overlooking a steep wooded ravine. From a setting perspective it was magical with deer seemingly everywhere in both the wooded area as well as in people's yards. They looked at us with that look of ""What, you've never seen a deer before? Move along."" :)
The space is a very well appointed basement apartment with 2 large bedrooms, a nice kitchen area with laundry and a very well done bathroom with a shower with the highest mounted showerhead (fixed) I think I have ever run into outside of the ceiling mounted ones. It has nice comfortable couches and a large TV in a sports themed main room that has a wonderful pool table and a dart board.
Though unlikely we will be back this way again, if we did we would not hesitate to check availability and if we have friends heading that way it would make a great stopover on the way to Sturgis. Great experince overall."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot at the top of the hill overlooking black hills. Close to everything and a great host. Highly recommend this spot.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay while you check out the black hills.

2022-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is at the lower floor and is exactly as describe. One of the queen bed does squeak a little. I'm only around 160 pound and when I get on or off, it does make a sound. There is lots of deer's from the black hills . We saw a few at dusk and dawn.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences. No joke about the view! We saw so much wildlife, especially deer.

We had a blast playing pool on the really nice billiards table!"

Ryan is an awesome host, making sure every detail is taken care of and he left easy to follow instructions in case we had questions during your stay. The kitchen has everything we needed to prepare meals, the bathroom was stocked with toiletries in case we forgot something, and the bed was super comfortable. The bed did squeak a bit, but not enough to keep us from enjoying a comfortable night's rest. This place provided us with games (pool table, dart board, and other games) to help us pass the time. We were visited by the local wildlife twice a day. A family of deer stopped by to say hello. I can't say enough about this place. I would certainly stay at Ryan's place again and again. Thanks Ryan."

2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Super comfy bed and gorgeous view, cozy place to stop and rest mid roadtrip. Beware dog parents; there is no fenced in yard. I thought there was from the pictures so that's why I booked, my bad. Other than that, my husband and I had a lovely stay."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"After 2 weeks of travel, Ryan’s place was by far the most comfortable and most tranquil of all of our stays. I was so sad that we only had 1 night to relax and enjoy the peace that surrounded us. The home was very cozy with all you could need for a functional stay. My husband and I loved the pool table and the darts. Major bonus was that Ryan’s place is pet friendly. We enjoyed a lovely morning walk to take in all the beauty and reset before another long day on the road. If you find yourself in the area, I cannot recommend this place enough."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a real treat. I drove up to find deer grazing in the front yard and was greeted by wild turkeys in the morning. About an hour from all the tourist attractions. Ryan said “hello” to us and offered to assist with anything but then slowed us to do our own thing. We really enjoyed it. I plan to stay often.

Having Harriet and Oak right next door was an added plus! Their pastries are fantastic!
We hope to go back and definitely hope that we can stay at Aaron’s unit again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The apartment is exactly like it is in the pictures, if not better. Aaron was super nice and responsive.
We enjoyed the area and the apartment is located right off the main strip of Rapid City. For being “downtown”, the road traffic wasn’t too loud from inside the apartment. Our neighbors weren’t too loud either, and honestly it was a great quiet stay.
There are lots of little shops and restaurants walkable from the apartment. If you’re a coffee shop person, we would definitely recommend Harriet & Oak which is right around the corner.
We would definitely recommend staying here if you’re interested in the “downtown feel”. We look forward to the next time we stay here!"

Justin Warner's Bokujo Ramen is really good. Harriet & Oak, a cafe around the corner, has delicious coffee beverages. Just be prepared to wait especially on weekends! We waited 40 mins for our online pickup order only to be part of our order had sold out. We'd still go for the coffee!"

The beds were comfy, the kitchen stocked with lots of cooking utensils (and lots of coffee!) and the hot tub was well maintained. The neighborhood was beautiful and the house is centrally located to all major tourist attractions, markets, and restaurants.

Thank you Lana!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lana recently acquired this unit. She has made a number of improvements and we gather plans some additional items. We loved how fully outfitted kitchen and other supplies were. Lana was very responsive to our inquiries -- generally responding within a hour or two.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana’s place was a great little gem in the middle of Rapid City. The house is exactly as pictured and immaculately clean. There are details for all your needs in every room and it is an incredibly comfortable space. It is very conveniently located close to many restaurants and an easy drive to many of the parks and attractions. Lana is very helpful and answers questions very quickly. If we are ever back in Rapid City, I would definitely stay here. Wish all airbnb’s were as comfortable, clean and welcoming as this one."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming, immaculately clean two bedroom house. It is close to the center of town. Everything was in working order and well-thought-out. Lana has provided puzzles and games for all. Highly recommended."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house at an amazing price!
My husband and I came up for a long weekend and to see Mount Rushmore. Lana had some great restaurant recommendations and was very helpful. The house was very cozy and beautiful. My husband and I were also impressed with the small details that made the stay more pleasant. Full-size, plush towels and a comfortable bed created a special vacation. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"All I can say is woooow!! Outstanding stay!! Beautiful guest house. We woke up every morning to the horses and deer outside of our windows. Our dogs loved the horse and the stay as well. Incredible lotion!! So close to buy groceries, getting fuel and to all the hotspots in the area. Fantastic place!! Lana gets a 5 star from my husband and I… oh and our doggies too haha"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Lana’s!! The house was beautiful and clean, the furniture and bed were very comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked. The location is great, close to Rapid City and the hills, and the surroundings were absolutely breathtaking! We enjoyed seeing the horses and watching the sunset. We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was exactly as described. Nice view of the hills and horses. My 10 year old loved the candy left for us as a treat. Convenient location. Lana provided easy check in instructions and tips on where to find in house food for horses and fire starter for fire pit along with s’mores supplies. Literally only needed to buy food for a few days and we were set. Would highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful time visiting SD for the very first time! The house was in a great location we visited Mt Rushmore, Custer State Park, Wind Cave, The Badlands, Deadwood and Crazy Horse!
Lana thought of everything to make our stay amazing!
We LOVED waking up each morning to see the horses on the property and feeding them was the best part! The firepit in the evening was so relaxing and she supplied everything!
I can’t think of a better place to stay 10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I wanted to get away to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. We wanted beautiful scenery, a place that felt comfortable to spend cozy nights in, clean and luxe feeling to feel a bit pampered, and also close enough to restaurants to venture out for a couple of nice dinners. Lana’s place was just what we needed! It checked all the boxes! It was so nicely decorated, the bed was sooo comfy, bathroom was super clean, and having a washer/dryer was a plus. We had our 16 month old son with us as well and it was so awesome to see that there were amenities and books/toys to entertain him as well. The horses on the property were an incredible bonus. We fed them and watched them from the windows. We would absolutely book a stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lana's place was great! It's a guest house overlooking some fields with horses (that you could feed) and feels very private. There's a connected garage with a tall door, which our SUV that has a roof storage container was able to fit inside. The bed was comfortable, and the shades were effective at keeping the bedroom dark for sleeping in! Everything was very nice, and we loved the easy location for exploring the black hills, Mount Rushmore, and Rapid City. We would happily stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean and comfortable place out in the country. Beautiful horses just out the window. The place is out in the country but a short drive to Rapid City and Mount Rushmore and a good base to check out other National Parks. Nice kitchen, comfortable bed. I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those highlights to get to, absolutely perfect."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for us (and our dog) to stay when we visited the Rapid City area. We liked that the location was on the outskirts of town in the direction of the places we were visiting (Custer State Park, Mt. Rushmore, Hot Springs) and it was a short jaunt into downtown Rapid City for eateries. Lana's place was clean and quiet and we liked having a garage to pull into - made it very easy for unloading/loading the car. We will definitely stay here again when our travels take us to the Rapid City area.
(fyi - Two Cows Creamery in Hot Springs had THE BEST ice cream!)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely place to stay! So nicely decorated and was very cozy to stay. We loved seeing the horses in the yard and enjoyed feeding them. Would come back to stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best places we’ve ever stayed at. Right from the first night, we felt at home! It was very private (locked gate, and even an attached garage for our vehicle), peaceful (very quiet with a great view of the hills), and everything j was super clean! On top of all of that, Lana was an amazing host! She was flexible with our schedule and very quick to respond. Would HIGHLY recommend and we would be back in a heartbeat! Thanks again Lana!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was nice to stay there beautiful place Lana. She is a great host.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great home base for experiencing the Black Hills! It's centrally located from all the attractions in the area, almost everything is about an hour away.
Lana was a great host and very friendly. She's created a nice, cozy, get-away space with her guest house that quickly feels like home after you arrive. The property is gorgeous and seeing/feeding the horses is a lot of fun!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very well appointed and comfortable - bed, pillows and linens are very cozy. Lana provides a comfortable home away from home . This was our 2nd time here and we’d gladly stay again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Could not say enough great things about Lana and her beautiful ranch. Our stay was peaceful and stunning! Lana thought of everything and it was nice to not worry about rushing to the store for anything we missed while packing. Getting to feed the horses and hangout with them in the mornings was a major highlight of our stay! Would definitely stay again if ever in the area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my wife and I’s second time at Lana’s place. Exactly what we needed a quiet getaway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific stay at a beautiful property! The description is exactly how the place is, and it is a comfortable and modern stay. The kitchen is great with lots of pots and pans to cook, a garage to house your car during the stay, and a nice living/bed room that makes you feel (and wish) you were at home! Highly recommend, 10/10."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great central location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely fantastic. Lana is so polite and responsive. She made sure we had everything we needed through the app, but gave us complete privacy. The location is very convenient to Rapid City, yet still provides the serenity of being out in the country."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the moment we arrived, we were charmed by its adorable and cozy atmosphere. The cottage was absolutely perfect for us and had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay.
One of the highlights of our experience was the presence of horses on the property. They added an extra touch of charm and made the whole experience feel magical. Our dogs, who accompanied us on this trip, immediately felt at home and were able to roam freely in the spacious surroundings. Seeing them so happy and content truly warmed our hearts.
The location of the Airbnb was also a dream come true for us. Nestled in the heart of the countryside, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in the beauty of nature. The serene surroundings and peaceful ambiance allowed us to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It truly was country living at its finest.
Overall, our stay at this Airbnb was above and beyond!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay. We’ve stayed at many airbnbs in the last year and we both agreed this was the best one. It was gorgeous, homey, well stocked, inviting. We noticed so many extras that we didn’t even need but appreciated Lana’s extra touches! An incredible space, and we feel so blessed to spend some respite time here before our baby arrives."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here ! The accommodations are beautiful, and comfortable. Lana has it’s stocked with anything you could need. We would love to stay here again if we make it back to Rapid City !"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The locations is wonderful close to Mount Rushmore, downtown and other attractions! Enjoyed watching how she decorated her place every details such as kitchen appliances, interior items, furnitures I can tell she puts lots of efforts ! The fire place was awesome and my son loved playing with legos and some toys under the coffee table. It was so thoughtful for the family who has kids. I fell in love with the double glass mugs in the kitchen so I ordered some for myself and my mom ^^ home was cozy and clean. Gas station is 3 min very convenient. highly recommended if you want to stay in rapid city!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay. One of the best airbnbs I’ve been to.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The perfect place for a relaxing getaway! It is close to many attractions for day trips. Lana’s place is very cozy and peaceful!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect spot to be close to the city but still far away enough to feel isolated. Great location to see Mount Rushmore and see Deadwood. The guest home was cozy and had everything we needed. Place was very clean and had everything needed to feel right at home. Best part for me was getting to feed the horses, luckily they were there when I stopped by. The puppers on the property are very cute and sweet too."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Comfortable home. Very nice and clean. Well stocked with supplies. We loved how quiet it was and loved the pups! My husband was there for a surgery and the offices and clinic were 10mins away. It was perfect. And you just can't beat the drive time to go see the President's! What a site to see. If we are back in Rapid City, we will stay at Lana's for sure!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place to stay! We loved the privacy and beautiful surroundings. Lana has decorated and made this place so cozy and comfortable from furniture to bed. The convenience of having our own attached garage topped it for easy loading and unloading no matter what the weather. We felt right at home and would definitely come back again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a fabulous place - lived up to description, photos and reviews. Very comfortable, well appointed, quality everything - felt like home. I’d definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lana’s place was even better than the pictures. She went above and beyond as a host and her beautiful guest house was well worth the price. Check in and check out were both super easy too. We would definitely come back! Thank you Lana!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is absolutely beautiful and a great place to relax for a weekend. Very comfortable bed and great amenities. Tucked away enough for privacy and a peaceful get away for the weekend. Also centrally located for easy access to different trails to hike and also to get back into town to go the many restaurants available in Rapid City.
We loved staying here with our German Shepherd and our infant for a long weekend. We were sad to be leaving so soon."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lana was amazing! I’d definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Rapid City!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After traveling from Florida and being in some nice and not so nice hotels, Lana’s place was perfect! It is a beautiful peaceful property! Even though Lana and family are in the main house, you barely know they are there.
There was a fire-pit outside ready for us to use, however it was quite cold so we opted for the indoor remote controlled fire.
The place was decorated beautifully, yet very cozy and comfortable. There is not one thing I would change.
Thank you Lana for providing the perfect home away from home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lana’s farm house was wonderful and was truly better than we expected. This was one of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed at. Very peaceful and private and quiet. The decor is tasteful and cozy. This was a great hub for us as we explored all of Rapid City, the Badlands, Devils Tower, Wind Caves. It was nice coming home and relaxing next to the fire. Bonus - I loved feeding and petting the horses! I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As other reviewers have stated, we wish we could have been able to extend our stay. It was a last-minute booking for my husband and me which we are so happy we did. The location was convenient for all we had planned from hiking at Lake Sylvan to stops downtown. There’s nothing better than an Airbnb that feels like a home away from home, really appreciated being able to actually use the kitchen and cook our meals while having most of the supplies for it. Access to parking in the garage was also a huge factor of convenience from unpacking to the weather. The home itself is very cozy, and clean, and while it has a luxury feel to it, it is very tastefully done. We left our stay feeling inspired. Would love to and wouldn’t hesitate to visit again in the future. One of the best Airbnbs we have stayed in. Thanks for having us!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay went perfectly - from check-in to check-out. The home was beautiful, but more importantly it was immaculate. Our family of 4 (2 adults, and a 4 and 2-year old) stayed comfortably. Unfortunately due to a cold snap we were unable to take Lana up on her offers of feeding the horses and making s’mores over the fire pit! But that (and more) was certainly available to us. I am from the area originally so I didn’t require recommendations and we spent much of our days off property with family, but I would have loved to have had more time there actually. There were no tasks at checkout which was so convenient for us and made catching our early flight easier. Overall this was a great experience and I would of course stay here again if the opportunity arose. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Luxury Ranch was perfect. Spent 2 nights and saw all the things in Rapid City. The home was wonderful and exquisitely decorated. The kitchen made us stay in for meals in front of the fireplace. Our 2 little dogs loved the amazing outdoor space. Our nightly visit from the horses was magical. Would love to stay longer.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the best AirBnB stay we have ever had!! We will never stay anywhere else when visiting western South Dakota. Such a beautiful, cozy, clean place. It was exactly as described and the host is amazingly helpful! The horses were a huge bonus and what initially drew me to the house."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was in a beautiful location on the ranch! The home was cozy, comfortable, super clean and had everything we needed for our stay. We were able to come and go with ease. The ranch had horses on it that came right up to the fence and we were able to give them a treat! Lana and her family couldn't have been nicer! The location was ideal for visiting Mt. Rushmore, Custer State Park, Badlands, and the Crazy Horse Monument. We only stayed two days, but could have spent another few days. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and would love to visit again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would give 10 stars if we could. Absolutely wonderful stay. Can park car feet from front door and carry luggage in. Well furnished with super comfortable furniture. Kitchen modern and everything needed. King bed wonderful. Entire home spotless clean. Great communication with Lana. Easy access to the Black Hills. Had fun feeding the ponies. They know when it’s breakfast time!! Hope to return someday. Super nice!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great place! Very clean, comfortable, roomy and well decorated. Our stay was short but we will definitely be coming back to Lana's place. Host was very responsive and accomodating. The horses were of course the best part <3. Nothings better than waking up and seeing the horses right outside your window grazing or waiting for treats!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay at Lana’s guesthouse. The beautiful space was very welcoming and super comfortable after a long day of visiting all the Black Hills offered. The location is ideal, on the edge of town so it is super quiet with easy access to everything the region offers. All furnishings and amenities were top quality; the kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked with everything one would need. The attached garage was much appreciated especially with the varying weather conditions this time of year. Bottom-line: a great place, a wonderful host, a memorable stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Look no further…Lana is a great host. Every amenities you can imagine Lana has it. Beautiful guesthouse and gorgeous surroundings…. Loved feeding the horses each morning!!! A great landing spot to explore all the Black Hills has to offer.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, cozy stay after hitting the national parks, monuments, and state parks. Some notable perks: the home was gated, there was an private garage to park in, we saw deer right outside the house, house was stocked with a lot of things, and location made it easy to head in any direction."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if your going to Mount Rushmore. What we didn’t realize is there’s so much more then just that to do. I would definitely stay at Lana’s Airbnb again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location in between restaurants/stores in Rapid City and Mt Rushmore/touristy destinations. Enough space for our family, including the baby, who was able to sleep quietly in the large walk-in closet/laundry room. Lana immediately answered a couple questions we had. My kids loved the horses and getting to play basketball."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience overall. House was very clean, organized, and comfortable. Location perfect for Black Hills vacation. Lana was very easy to communicate with and was helpful in providing suggestions for the area. Cool to be able to feed the horses in the morning before starting our days. And last but not least - Indy the dog rocks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana's place was perfectly situated to all the things we wanted to do, Mount Rushmore, Custer State Park, Devil's Monument, The Badlands, and the Black Hills.
We enjoyed feeding the horses every morning and playing fetch with the dog in the evening.
I always choose a place with a washer and dryer and hers was one of the easiest to use.
Lana's place had all the little extras we needed and I would absolutely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most wonderful stay at Lana’s place. It is absolutely beautiful; feeding the horses was a definite highlight along with all the personal touches: s’mores kits with fire starter, candy and popcorn treats for a family movie night and a well stocked kitchen and bathroom with toiletry supplies. The house is beautifully decorated too. Highly recommend; we hope to be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,The stay was outstanding and garage was perfect for keeping a motorcycle safe and out of the elements would book it again for next year’s event!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place to stay, We definitely would have stayed longer if we could have!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was clean and very comfortable. Lana was very eager to please and made sure our stay was perfect. The property and house are amazing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place! The inside was clean, cozy and super comfortable. We loved the darkening shades for our kids to get great sleep. Big bedroom and bathroom and very nice kitchen. What put it over the top was having the horses (who were extremely friendly and gentle) to greet us in the morning and evening. Our kids LOVED feeding them carrots and watching them. It was a great stay and we would definitely recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lana’s place was the perfect home away from home for our family. We have two younger kids that we’re with us and one of their highlights from the trip was waking up and going to bed with the horses right out our door. They also loved getting to feed them and looked forward to it every day - such a nice extra that makes this place truly stand out. The bed and linens were top notch and so comfortable and the kitchen had bathroom had everything we needed during our stay. Lana was very responsive to any questions we had and was proactive, clear, and concise in communication. We would recommend her place to anyone looking for a stay in the area - especially those with little kids!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is magical! The location is peaceful and private. My kids loved playing with the dogs and feeding the horses. The beds were super comfy and the space was ideal for our getaway. The guesthouse is well-appointed and decorated so tastefully, it felt like you were staying in someone’s house. Lana provides anything you may need for your stay. We enjoyed the fire pit and s’mores on our last night. Great location to hit all the major sites - Rushmore, Badlands, Custer State Park, Spearfish. We would not hesitate to book again!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Lana is so kind and helpful. The property is gorgeous. The guest house was the perfect size for my family of four. It was clean, cute, and very comfortable. Everything is in great condition. It seems like she’s thought of every detail. We loved feeding the horses and playing with the beautiful dogs. I’d recommend this place to anyone. I felt at home and absolutely loved it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lana's place had everything we needed and then some. It was a lovely place to start and end our days while exploring the area -- and our kids loved the horses!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lana is a great host, friendly and welcoming. This is a beautiful, clean, modern looking place. The location is great, close to Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse Monument. The bedroom was very comfortable. The ability to park in the garage and directly get inside the house was great. The place was slightly smaller than what we expected, and the only exit is on the driveway shared with the owners, reducing a bit the privacy. However, overall it is a beautiful place with a great location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, easy access and very private with a wonderful host. Definitely the nicest Air BNB that we've ever stayed at. Highly recommend staying here if you're anywhere in the area. Only a few minutes to Bear Country USA and the Reptile Gardens."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family booked here for a night to break up our drive on a camping Roadtrip. It was such a treat to stay here! Our kids (8 and 10) thought it was so cool. Lana left a bag of carrots for us to feed the horses which the kids absolutely loved. Our daughter wanted to bring the horses home with us! The guest house was perfectly cozy for a family of 4 and well stocked. Kids slept on the pull out couch. Lana also left delicious vanilla ice cream and s’mores fixin’s for us to enjoy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay with our family of 4!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Lana has thought of everything. The house is spotless and fully equipped. She is very quick to respond to questions. We loved our stay there…..would highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very impressed. Had all the amenities you needed. Very clean. The use of the garage was very helpful, especially during inclement weather. The front remote entrance gate added security to the stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about this place is AMAZING! The house is beautiful inside and out. The decorative touches really gave you the full experience of living on a ranch. The horses greeted us every time we came outside. She gave us food so the kids could feed them every day. Once we knew their names we could call them by name and they would come trotting up to greet us. She also was kind enough to let my kids play with her two super sweet dogs and this alone provided HOURS of enjoyment and happiness for my two kids. She had an extra floor mattress that we used so that the kids could sleep in separate spaces, just to give them a little bit of their own space at night. Both were very comfortable for them! The extras in this place were amazing. Coffee, board games, card games, books for both adults and children, the list goes on! This place was so beautiful and serene, I loved sitting outside at night watching the sun set and watching the horses. We will for sure be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at the ranch! The place was beautiful, comfortable and Lana thought of everything! She communicated quickly and was very responsive and helpful- everything was super- clean and well-organized. Thanks, Lana!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were so pleased with our stay. My children loved feeding the horses and eating S’mores around the campfire at night. The house was clean, well-organized and Lana is an incredible decorator. This was our first Airbnb experience as a family and I am certain Lana has set the bar as high as it gets. I highly recommend this place! My family of 4 had an incredible experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely beautiful and serene place to stay! We loved it from the moment we arrived to the time we left. Lana is a terrific host and the luxury ranch retreat was exactly as described. It was a pleasant surprise to find K-pods, laundry soap and other toiletries stocked. When we arrived, we instantly felt welcomed and at home. The horses were really cool to see and getting to feed them was an added bonus. Lana was very responsive and accommodating to our request to get access to a water hose so we could wash our motorcyles, which got very dirty on our rides. The location was perfect for us and was centrally located to all the riding we wanted to do. Overall, the luxury ranch is all it needed to be and more! We will definitely be back and will stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Truly a wonderful stay in a beautiful area! We had high expectations that were met or exceeded here, and this is one of—if not the—best AirBnB experiences we’ve had anywhere. The house was well-stocked with all the comforts of home. The horses and sweet dog were very welcoming and our boys loved playing with and visiting them. We slept so comfortably in the King bed and our boys loved the pull-out bed as well. We enjoyed all the games, the comfortable living room, the fire pit with s’mores, etc. I truly can’t say enough! Our time in the area was full of great memories seeing sights, hiking, and enjoying this beautiful scenery—and Lana’s home was a peaceful place to come home to at the end of each day."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! We loved staying here during our visit to Custer SP. The place looks just like the pictures and had everything we needed. Super clean as well. Quick drive to the park or to the city. Will definitely stay here again if back in the area!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolute 5 star- wonderfully decorated with nothing but the finest! So comfortable and lovely!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lana's cottage was all that it was cracked up to be, and then some. Lana went over and above by providing ample supplies, including coffee, treats and plenty of towels, laundry supplies and a very friendly staff of animals ( dogs when we wanted them to play and horses to visit on our terms). The location was in the center of all of the sites we wanted to visit such as Mt. Rushmore, The Black hills with hiking, Custer State park with hundreds of Bison, the Bad Lands with magnificent views and hikes, plus some outstanding restaurants that served first class meals in unstuffy surroundings. I can""t say enough good things about our visit and would highly recommend Lana's cottage to anyone."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best AirBnB we have stayed at. We felt so at home and comfortable. It is beautifully decorated and so clean! If anyone was going out to Rapid City I would highly recommend this place to stay.
Lana provided us with details to access the property as well as local recommendations. We had a great time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lana's place was a great place for our family of four. It only had one bedroom, but it also had a pull-out couch which our boys loved. The attached garage was extremely nice for unloading and packing up. The house is very clean and Lana even left treats for our family which was a very nice touch. Our boys especially liked meeting and feeding the horses in the morning. They talked about them... a lot. :) Lana was a fantastic host and was super responsive to our questions/needs.
The location isn't walkable to anything, but it IS located close enough to coffee and restaurants. We did many of the touristy things such as Custer State Park, Bear Country USA, the Badlands, etc. For just about everything, the drive was no more than 30ish minutes away with the exception of the Badlands which was a bit of a trek. For most site-seeing needs, this location was perfect."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lana’s place feels right at home. You can tell she focuses on the small details to ensure a great stay! Beautiful place and area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if visiting Mount Rushmore! Amazing stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Lana’s place was perfect! We brought our 2.5 year old son and when he went inside instantly he found some age appropriate toys stored in cute bins, ran to look out the window for horses! This was by far the most accommodating and home-like place we’ve stayed at. Our first morning we woke up to the horses just outside our window eating, this was a highlight of our sons trip. The small details that were provided made staying here relaxing and enjoyable."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, Lana is a great host with clear communication. Private, very clean, spacious, well-stocked with things like extra towels, toiletries, extra bedding, coffee, etc. Beautifully decorated with lots of lovely touches. Loved the s’mores fixings, so sweet!
The guest house was very unique being on a farm property, but not “rustic” in the sense that it has all modern amenities, including a washer/dryer and a kitchen nicer than my own at home, 2 flat screen TVs, — and just a really fine place overall. Located outside of downtown Rapid City, but close enough by car & did not seem far at all. Would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The nicest air b&b j have ever stayed in!! Lana was amazing & we fell in love with the home. Would 100% stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay on a ranch near Rapid City, Custer State Park and Custer city, Mt. Rushmore and Crazy Horse, and the Badlands. Lana was a wonderful host who communicated clearly and often. She had wonderful recommendations for the surrounding areas.
The AirBnB was very clean and felt homey. We loved all the western touches! The stay has an attached garage and full kitchen. All other amenities listed were avaliable. Overall, this was our first stay in an AirBnB and we are so glad we chose with Lana. We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Lana’s place for our trip to the Black Hills, Mount Rushmore, and Badlands. It’s in a convenient location for all the tourist locations while also feeling like a relaxing get-away experience. We loved seeing the horses every morning! Lana also thought of everything to make sure her guests are well taken care of. I’d recommend Lana’s place to anyone looking to take a trip to this area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Perfect central location to all the attractions. Great guesthouse on a farm. The home was beautiful and was exactly what we were looking for.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay! Comfortable and quiet. Exactly what me and my wife needed.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Would definitely come back here for a future stay! Host was incredibly kind and welcoming! Stay was pristine, private, and comfortable! Watching the horses in the pasture every morning was a lovely bonus."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana created a lovely stay for us and provided very thoughtful amenities. The house is well kept, clean, and beautifully decorated. The house was private yet easy to access from main roads and only a short drive to shops and restaurants. Only 20 minutes to Mount Rushmore. Lana is a fabulous host and we would definitely stay there again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was absolutely beautiful! Filled with lovely decor and spectacular scenery. It was better than advertised and the photos do not capture the loveliness of the home.
The host, Lana, was very proactive and responsive! Our foster daughter loved the sweet treats and s’mores left by the host.
Would definitely recommend to anyone and stay again! Our pups loved it, too and did I mention the views of the horses from our windows? Wonderful! Thank you, Lana and family."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a fun stay on the farm! We loved meeting and feeding Peaches & Roanie, the horses! The guest house is superbly equipped and wonderfully comfy! Rapid City is a short drive away, as is the iconic Mt. Rushmore monument. A truly great spot and we will return! If you’re looking for a unique experience, book this and enjoy!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for some meetings and after driving in horrible weather I reached Lanas place and I was blown away the place was super welcoming and clean the kitchen the bathroom is equipped with everything I do a lot of computer work and the internet was fantastic you get your own garage as well I've stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this one is by far one of my favorites I will be back in rapid again and with out a doubt I will try to book Lana's place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Vjhyg jryuur gtg
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location out of the city but easy to get to everything. The house was the perfect size for my husband and I. Everything we needed was easy to find throughout the home and it was spotless when we got there. The no checkout procedure was so nice, not having to worry about a list of things to do while we were packing up. The only thing we didn’t love was the bed and pillows, just not as comfortable for us, but it’s such a personal thing so I’m sure plenty of people will find it very comfortable! (The bed is memory foam so it’s more on the firm side, there were 2 kinds of pillows, but both were more on the soft side- we prefer the opposite, again such a personal thing!) overall it was a great stay, watching the horses out our windows was fun and Lana was very proactive in her messages, knowing what info we’d need to know for that day before we could even ask! Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to explore Rapid City and the surrounding area."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb stay restored my faith in this platform. I am a longtime user of Airbnb, however, as of late I’ve gravitated away from using Airbnb and have gone back to regular hotel stays for numerous reasons, but I decided to take a chance and book an Airbnb stay for my wedding anniversary. I am so happy I did!!! Lana’s place was beautiful, spotless, well-appointed (they have everything you can think of), convenient to so many different local attractions, cozy, and peaceful. It was wonderful waking up to the horses outside, which we got to feed, Peach and Roanie!!! They were adorable. Lana was also such an amazing host who gave us tips on restaurants to try, and advice for how to feed the horses and use the fire pit. I would definitely stay here again, it was fabulous! Thanks Lana!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Lana’s ranch on our way to Montana. It was absolutely perfect! We couldn’t have asked for anything more!!
Hope to return for a longer stay really soon!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was wonderful! We had everything we needed to be comfortable for our long weekend. Lana was super responsive and fixed the problem with Wi-Fi we had immediately. Everything was wonderful and I highly recommend staying here!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing oasis! Beautiful home and perfect driving distance if you’d like socialization but also quiet ranch if you feel like staying in. 10/10!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay and we will definitely look here next time we are in town. The heated garage stall was a huge bonus especially with the snow that came during our stay. Super cozy and comfortable. Well stocked kitchen allowed us to make a few meals here and enjoy a couple quiet evenings by the fire instead of going into town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So many ways to describe Lana and her property come to mind, but phenomenal is the easiest adjective.
From the decor to the personal touches in the house, horses and Rosie the mini horse, her family dogs, etc etc, I could go on for days. This property is THE property to stay at. It is warm and inviting and we are already thinking about our next trip back here."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful and comfortable! This was actually my second trip to stay while I came out to visit my son at college. It will be my go to if its available on my return trips!
Lana is very responsive and super nice!
You won't regret booking this little gem that is located just outside if the city so you feel like you are in the country yet be super close to everything!
It felt like I was going to my home away from home!
Thanks!
Tammy"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! Lana was extremely helpful and was quick at responding. The guest house was beautiful, homey, and comfortable. The views were stunning, and Lana had everything you could need there, and everything was very clean. There were beautiful horses that we got to feed and pet, too! They also had streaming services available. We were sad to leave and are even thinking about returning!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great time! The property was beautiful and the host was always there in case of issues.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great guesthouse stay on the outskirts of Rapid City! This was one of the most well stocked and clean places we have stayed out in the hills. It really felt like a well kept home with all the decorations, quality linens, appliance amenities, garage stall and stocked kitchen that everything was in good shape & clean. The horses are very friendly and seemed to be very used to people and dogs! Lana, the host, was very responsive & provided early instructions for check-in & check-out. Definitely stay here if youre looking for a comfortable stay for a couple or small family!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lana's home was beautiful. It exceeded our expectations. The place looked beautiful in pictures but even better in person. She provided toys for our daughter and a Christmas tree as we were there during Christmas. Was very peaceful and felt like a home away from home. Highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous inside and out! Close enough to town but also private with beautiful views. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish you could leave a higher than 5 star review. This place is beyond beautiful, truly a gem. My daughter is absolutely in love with the horses that we can see from the windows! Host super kind and helpful.. thank you so much for your hospitality, especially with this weather!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a luxury ranch stay… and I mean luxury! The entire space was clean, comfy, and extremely cozy. We walked in to a lit Christmas tree and quickly turned on the warm fireplace! My husband and I felt right at home. From the aesthetic to the functionality, everything was throughly thought out and beautiful. The western flare was charming and seeing horses feeding outside our window in the morning was an added bonus. The location is a quick drive to downtown and other amenities. This is easily the best air bnb we’ve stayed in and we would love to stay here again if driving through SD. Lana was a great host, thank you for an amazing stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay!
Our dogs were very comfortable & the house was very cozy and fully equipped with everything you need for a comfortable relaxing stay. Walmart is about ten mins away. Beautiful hikes to drive to.
Home is more beautiful in person! Horses were great to look at in the mornjng. Book it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! Great location in proximity to Mt Rushmore, Crazy Horse, Custer State Park, and downtown Rapid City. Clean, cute, and everything we needed for a mini-vacation. I highly recommend. The house and Rapid City did not disappoint."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a very beautiful place with everything you would need. Clean and felt just like home. We would love to come back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I absolutely LOVED our time here and we never felt rushed or like we needed to check in with the hosts every hour in case we were caught up in local activities or anything. It was like we ending every evening at our own homestead.
The decor, the atmosphere, the scenery - every detail was genuinely thought through. Wife felt very safe since this is a gated area and she usually is very timid around animals but had the best time feeding the two horses in the morning.
Incredible stay, would highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lama’s place was our favorite Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Extremely clean, and she thought of every detail to make our stay as enjoyable as possible"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our first visit to the Black Hills was made even more special by our stay. We loved the cottage, the amenities, and the perfect location to experience all the historic sites."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay. Lana is a gracious host. It was clean and everything was nice. A very comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Check it out - we plan to stay there again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! Every detail was thought of and the location was great. The place was super clean and comfortable. We hope to be back someday!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Immaculate, beautiful and quiet with all of the comforts of home. Was great to be at a place with a view. Would definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a luxurious stay, close and convenient to Rapid City & other attractions - this is the place for you! This truly was the best Airbnb stay my wife and I have ever had. Not only was it absolutely stunning (inside and out) it had literally everything we needed to make our stay feel right at home. It was very safe, comfortable, well equipped and conveniently located to all of the places we wanted to go to while in SD. We chose to stay here for 3 nights after a busy road trip to CO and we’re so glad we did. Though we wanted to see and do many things in SD, we also really wanted some quality time to relax and unwind together, and this place was perfect for that. We spent most evenings in the Airbnb enjoying some wine, watching a movie and cozying up by the fireplace. We will absolutely plan to stay here again on our next trip out west! The bed is very luxurious and comfy, as are the towels… and the rest of the home! Thank you Lana for being such a great host, answering all questions, and sharing your recommendations. We loved our stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,This Airbnb is the nicest we have ever stayed in! You’re away from the city with a beautiful view of the rolling hills and farm. Lana has absolutely thought of everything you could possibly need during your stay and then some. We did have some issues with the well water but Lana was extremely accommodating by bringing us a water filter as well as a case of bottled water. If we ever go back to South Dakota this will be at the top of my list as a place to stay and would highly recommend! What a gem!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Close to Mount Rushmore and other attractions. Our kids loved feeding the horses. Comfortable and quiet. Definitely recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"All previous five star reviews of this location are 100 percent correct This was our first ever Air BnB stay and I think anywhere we stay from this day forward will be a lesser experience than we had at this location. We were also able to feed the horses each morning and enjoy a little time with them. It is perfectly located outside of town but close to many of the sites we wanted to visit. The amenities are beyond expectation. It is peaceful, quiet, and private. Treat yourself and stay here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful experience at the Meadows Ranch Guesthouse. The outdoor setting was pastoral with horses and cattle grazing in the fields, and beautiful sunrises and sunsets. The indoor setting was both relaxing and upscale – well decorated, immaculate, and private. The pillow-top bed was very comfortable, and the appliances (including a washer and dryer) worked well. The location was close to the conveniences of Rapid City and central to many attractions. We visited Mount Rushmore, Custer State Park, Badlands National Park, Spearfish Canyon, Devil’s Tower, and more! We were impressed by Lana’s hospitality and highly recommend a stay at her guesthouse. Enjoy!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, amazing hostess and the experience exceeded our expectations!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Property was amazing, clean, and very cozy. We were in town for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and it was very nice to get away from downtown and relax at a home away from home Airbnb. Lana was more then helpful, very easy to get ahold of, and just overall a great host! I would definitely recommend staying at this property."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time at the ranch! It was a nice big space for us and was very clean and well kept. The garage was an awesome added bonus as well! Lana was very helpful and provided useful information on the Black Hills area. We all would recommend this place, especially our kids as they called it ""the nicest place they have ever stayed!"""
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and attention to detail made it a great stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cannot say enough about Lana, her hospitality and the actual building. This is a perfect stay for a quick trip or a longer vacation! With a secluded feel but a safe, gated accommodation, you will feel right at home. I echo the remarks of other reviewers when I say Lana was accommodating, quick to respond and made the house extremely comfortable. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lana’s guest house outside of Rapid City is a perfect spot for a couple or small family to explore the Black Hills. The guest house was immaculate, warmly decorated and very comfortable ( including the bed!). Lana provided everything to make a wonderful vacation with no worries. The connected garage was a super bonus- so easy for packing. Lana was awesome to communicate with and her area recommendations were perfect. What a lovely house."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the ranch guesthouse was PERFECT! This was easily our favorite Airbnb stay yet. The setting is calm and peaceful. Our kids loved seeing the horses, and they were even given the chance to feed and pet them. The house is new and beautifully decorated. It’s very comfortable, and Lana has taken care to think of everything you may need (including some fun extras)! It’s easy to get to town, Custer State Park, Mount Rushmore and more. We are extremely satisfied with our stay!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place! My family enjoyed it! We were able to see Mount Rushmore, crazy horse, devil’s tower, and other attractions in a day and then make it back to enjoy the amenities. My daughter, son, & wife enjoyed the horses! It felt like we were on a farm! Nice, quiet, and with access to great things in western South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this stay enough! Absolutely stunning property, views, location & the hosts were incredibly gracious and thoughtful. Do not miss this booking!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lana’s guesthouse was exactly as described: clean, cozy, quiet, relaxing. Beautifully decorated. The location was wonderful…just outside of town with quick/easy access to everything. Check -in was smooth…Lana was even able to accommodate an early check in so we could get our little one down for a nap. Very kid/family friendly with games, toys, movie night treats, and s’mores supplies for the fire pit. Feeding the horses and seeing the animals each day were extra special treats for our toddler. Would definitely recommend and hope that we can stay again on future trips the Black Hills/Rapid City."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! The property and the house were beyond expectations. The guesthouse had all the amenities and tons of thoughtful touches. Communication with Lana was so easy. We woke up to horses outside the window and got to feed them! We were sad to leave and would love to return!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana’s ranch in South Dakota is a perfect place if you’re looking for an epicenter of touristy spots, a work from home retreat, vacation with family or all of the above.
The beds were comfy, so many amazing amenities.
If there was a Best of Airbnb award - this place should win it.
Lana was very prompt before during and after. Extremely good communication and very thoughtful of the guests."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Beautifully decorated and comfortable home. We wished we could have stayed for longer!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great kitchen/appliances for cooking, very comfortable bed, all around beautifully decorated and in a relaxing setting. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was everything that was advertised. If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay...this is it! Everything about this rental made it feel like we were at home. Close enough to everything we wanted to see while secluded enough for relaxation. The place had all the amenities that you could ask for and some extra little touches that put this place over the top. Lana was great for communication throughout the rental/stay. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will LOVE this guest home. Lana was there to greet us when we arrived. The place is beautiful. Like your on your own little farm. This IS the place to stay if your in the area for any reason, especially if your there to see Mt. Rushmore and The Black Hills. It is perfectly located within 20 minutes of the attractions. The house had everything we needed and more! Lana puts great care in having the extras to make a family feel welcome.
The Justice Family"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana's place was awesome. Great location in Rapid City and an amazing property. The interior was perfect, the pictures don't do it justice. If I am ever going to be staying in Rapid City in the future I will for sure be staying here."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the first time my family and I have stayed at an Airbnb and Lana set the bar high! We enjoyed staying at the guesthouse so much. Lana has thought of every detail to make your stay amazing! The guesthouse is updated and modern and we felt at home immediately! We loved how spacious it was, the privacy of our own area, the attached garage that was super convenient and the added convenience of our own gate/garage door opener. The location was perfect, as we were close to everything we wanted to see and do.
We didn't call upon Lana for any issues, but she was available to us if we needed her. She went out of her way on our last night to arrange for us to see the horses, which made for a great way to end a week long visit. If we ever have the opportunity to make our way to South Dakota again, we will definitely look to stay at the guesthouse again!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Ranch House wonderful! It had all the amenities of home, in fact we kept referring to it as “home”. It was so nice to come home at the end of a busy day and feel so relaxed. Lana is so sweet and replied promptly to any questions or concerns. The house offers everything you need and is supplied with extras, just in case 😉. The home was decorated so lovely and I had to ask where she got certain items because I just have to get some of my own! Don’t hesitate to book your own stay at the Ranch House, it is a great value and so much better than a hotel!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Way better than our expectations - would give it 6 stars if possible!!! We drove up and were blown away by the beautiful property. The house was decorated exquisitely with every touch you can imagine for our comfort - soft blankets to sit by the fire, extremely comfortable bed with about 10 pillow types to choose from and large walk in closet, well stocked kitchen with good quality pots, cooking utensils and dishes, even fresh eggs in the refrigerator, a high quality washer/dryer in a separate room and a nice shower and large vanity area in the bathroom. They even have a pasture with horses and cows you can feed. The place is conveniently located to get to all the major attractions in the area. Lana had great suggestions for hiking, restaurants and local activities. Would not stay anywhere else!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lana’s ranch is a relaxing getaway. Our experience was nothing but positive. From the cozy environment to the gorgeous views of pasture and cows/horses. Not to mention, Lana was INCREDIBLY accommodating and made for a great host."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing guest house!!!! Home away from home. Lana is a wonderful host, the house had everything you needed. Beautiful sunsets and scenery. My husband and I are looking forward to visiting again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a very lovely place to stay. The host was wonderful. She had things there that I didn’t think of ex.( extra toothbrushes, bandaids, alcohol for cuts, snacks for hike in case you forgot to pick them up and alot of other things too). You will not be disappointed. Very quiet too. You can see the beautiful sunset and the sunrise too. We seen the moon come up one night too. It’s a good location to go to mt. Rushmore, Custer park, the bad lands, devils tower in Wyoming just a couple hours away. It is centrally located."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property! The place is clean, comfortable and quiet! Lana is very responsive. Very impressed with the space and location. We will definitely be coming back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lana’s place is amazing! The outdoor setting is beautiful and the inside is just as lovely. Lana was communicative and accommodating. She was always willing to try and make our stay more pleasant. The house had everything we needed for our stay and Lana made checkout a breeze! We will definitely try and stay here again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"While looking for a long term stay in the Black Hill's, we came across Lana's place. It's a large, relaxing property on about 40 fenced in acres of meadowland with a gated entry. The property includes a spacious garage with remote and access to an outdoor water feature, seating and fire pit. Our 7-week (48 night) long stay was extremely comfortable. In addition to the convenience of the location from major and minor attractions, the home is 15 minutes from just about most places in the city.
Lana ensured that everything was in place for us to work remotely from home including two workstations, chairs, extension cords and very stable WiFi. Anything required for a long-term stay was made available such as electric kettles, a portable small cooler, a crockpot, all crockery and cutlery, baking dishes and pans and all kitchen and laundry equipment in excellent, working condition. The home was spacious enough for two people simultaneously on phone calls and remote meetings while the outdoor table and chairs allowed for extending the workspace as required. For those with young children, there is a pack-and-play, a diaper changing table, step stool, games, coloring activities. There is also an option to have a housecleaner come in at your expense for those staying for a longer period.
She was very responsive to questions and requests.
We enjoyed our work-from-home break in the Black Hills and meeting Lana and her wonderful family. If you like tranquil, well-maintained surroundings with stunning sunrises and sunsets,, extensive views of nature and mooing cows with all the amenities of home, this is the place to do that!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for your trip to Rapid City and the Black Hills. The location is far enough out of the city to make it very peaceful at night, but yet it is just a few miles away from a major highway that will take you anywhere in the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a pleasant stay at this beautiful ranch. The home was absolutely charming. It’s like a real home away from home. It was in driving distance for exploring Mt. Rushmore, Deadwood and Sturgis. Thank you to our hosts for being available when we had any questions. Loved loved this place."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great place, super clean !"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Five stars just does not do this Airbnb enough justice! Packed with everything a single family would need for a weekend or an extended visit to the Rapid City area.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gorgeous property! The views are breathtaking. The guest house was awesome. It was perfect for our family of four - we had plenty of room! It was amazing to have a garage to put our van in each night. The laundry was great to have especially with us being out and about in nature. The check-in was super easy. The host is very personable and easy to communicate with. The property is gated and host provides you a remote for the gate/garage. The host provided some bathroom amenities so there was no stress with what you may have forgotten. Check-out was super awesome, easy, and very focused on your family having a good and relaxing vacation! I will definitely look for this property again when we head back to South Dakota. We came to visit Mt. Rushmore, the Black Hills, and the BadLands. We were between 20-30 minutes away from those locations. You are an easy 15min away from Reptile Gardens."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place and Lana is an amazing host.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the most fabulous stay at Lana’s guest house! The location was ideal for hitting all the attractions in the area. The home is furnished beautifully and Lana provides the most comfy linens and towels. I appreciated the gated entrance and the option to park in the garage. The kitchen and bathrooms are well stocked for guests. Lana is such a wonderful host and provides excellent communication the entire time. I highly recommend the Meadow’s guesthouse if you are visiting the area! You won’t find a better Airbnb than this!!!!!!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous guest house on an amazing parcel of land. The guest house offered everything we needed, and then some. Lana was very attentive and answered a phone call immediately, after we arrived to the wrong house on the property. We loved that a single car garage was a part of the stay. We would stay here again, for sure."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana’s guest house is as inviting, comforting, and subtly beautiful of a home I’ve had the pleasure to occupy.
The lighting is calming, the decor is well planned and purposeful, and the bed felt like I was at home!
I loved everything about my visit. I loved relaxing after a day hanging out with prairie dogs and bison, knowing that the place I would return to was absolutely stellar.
In a society that is increasingly disconnected and transactional, my experience with Lana was authentic and genuine.
I hope to visit again sometime!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a fabulous place. There is so much attention to detail and devorated perfectly. Lana was so nice and thoughtful. Thank you
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best place to stay if you want to relax and enjoy the quiet of the country. The beautiful home provided everything one might need. It was cozy, clean, and comfortable. We will be back should our plans call us back to South Dakota."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful and private location in Rapid City and a straight shot to Mount Rushmore. We have enjoyed our stay while visiting with our son who is based at Ellsworth AFB ( It also was an easy drive for him to come over) .Lana was such a great host. The place is pristine and has all the details for a wonderful stay. Thank you so much for having us!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lana’s place is just lovely! Peaceful and relaxing, Lana provided all we needed and then some. Not only was there s’more fixings in the cupboard ( with the offer to build us a fire) but she brought us homemade ice cream when we mentioned it was our son’s birthday.
She offered plenty of family friendly suggestions and even provided water guns for our kids and an open invitation to use their spacious yard and small pond to fill up and run around ( with the added protection of a gate at the end of the driveway).
Extremely family friendly and really, just a beautiful spot. Easy to get to all the big tourist spots- Rushmore and Black Hills attractions.
Thank you to Lana and her family for a great stop for this road weary bunch!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet gated entrance that included garage for our vehicle. Privacy and 5 🌟 accommodations. Quick response and extra information on places to see and things to do.

Was a pleasure meeting both Marci and Mark while shopping in the stores below!
Will stay here again. 10/10"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at Marci’s loft. Beautiful loft in a perfect location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marci is an excellent host. Extremely quick to respond to any questions we had. The unit is spotless and looks brand new. The apartment is quite spacious and seems even bigger than the pictures show. We were surprised though that it didn’t have a King sized bed, as the bedroom is quite large and could have easily accommodated one. However it did have very nice bedding, a sound machine and a smart tv that were nice additions.
The downstairs coffee cafe was really nice to have so close too. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place will not disappoint. Location is great. Restaurants and activities are a short walk. Parking is easy. Host is very friendly and communicative. The loft is spotless and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. I couldn't find anything negative about this place if I tried. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"perfect home away from home! had everything I needed. slept like a baby with the bedroom sliding door blocking all light and white noise machine! had a lovely soak in the bathtub. didn't need to do laundry or cook, but everything was there if I needed it! loved the smart TVs in the living room and bedroom. ate amazing breakfast at coffee shop downstairs every morning. amazing Ramen place a block away. natural food store a couple blocks away. was in town for a conference at Alex hotel, and this was a much better place to stay, but in walking distance. thank you for a lovely stay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description is accurate and the place is amazingly spotless. The street noise on the weekend nights are noticeable but ends at a certain time. The kitchen space is convenient for a single bedroom unit. Coffee in the morning is nice at the counter. The living is very comfortable as is everything else. The best part of the stay was the location and hidden entryway off of a busy street. The parking was the only issue as there are free spaces but if you park longer than eight hours you will be ticketed. The host did offer to pay two tickets (we paid already). All in all a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marci was a great host, very responsive and helpful. Place was immaculate, modern and cozy. Would stay here again on our next visit!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Loved this apartment…. Amazing location
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was grateful to have a spacious apartment, a comfortable bed, big kitchen and on-site laundry at Marci's place. There's even a huge bathtub to use! I ran into Marci's husband one of the mornings I was there not long after he had shoveled snow off the sidewalk out front - he had even shoveled a path around my car for me! I was grateful and that was also just a good reminder of how kind people in Rapid City are. Plenty of restaurants, coffee and shops to walk to nearby. Such a great home base while being on the road! Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! We thoroughly enjoyed the pool/hot tub and all the amenities the house had to offer! I wish it would’ve been a little warmer in South Dakota when we stayed so we could take advantage of the outside spaces, they had a volleyball court and some nice seating options! The house was in a good location and most of all felt private, even though it was in town! The house is tucked back behind 2 others so it feels as if there are no neighbors which we loved the privacy! Our stay was great, thank you again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing

Jackie was so quick to communicate and our stay went off without a hitch. The neighborhood is so peaceful and wooded and we enjoyed the daily visits from the wild turkeys and deer. The house was centrally located to all of the main attractions in the black hills area, and being able to park our car in the garage on chilly mornings was so nice! The kitchen worked great for quick breakfasts and for warming up lunches and there is a ton of space in every room for stretching out. We would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a really fun home base for South Dakota adventures!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place for family to gather. Has all the amenities you could want. The pool and hot tub are amazing. Would absolutely stay again.

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Jackie has a great place and always responded very promptly when we had questions! All of our kids loved the place. It was very spacious and we spent most of our time at the house as the kids loved the swimming pool and then once done swimming they played downstairs with all of the games/air hockey/pool table. The large dining room table was super nice as well! We will be staying again and hope to make this a regular when we come to rapid again!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Fun House is a great place to stay with so much to do! The kids and adults were both sad to leave. Jackie and her crew did a fantastic job of making our stay comfortable and memorable. The Fun House was exactly that. FUN!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an outstanding time. Our family had two toddlers & four adults~not sure who had more fun!! The pool and hot tub is truly a spectacular feature. Massive bucks, baby deer & turkeys in the yard. There was not a missing feature in this home. Every room was a fun surprise & the location was ideal."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot for a family vacation. Pool, hot tub and games downstairs provided plenty of entertainment for our kids. Good home base for exploring the Black Hills. Jackie was a very responsive host as well."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The owners came within 1/2 hour when the stove had a problem. Super friendly and helpful.

My kids were either in the pool or downstairs playing the wii, pool, air hockey or basketball."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy gave really easy to understand instructions. She offered her garage because the weather was looking bad with possible hail. When I got there she came out to greet me and show me a couple things in the unit. Overall great experience.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so awesome I didn’t want to leave. It was Very clean, quiet and peaceful . The perfect setting to wind down and relax.

The space was great and was as described in the photo and write up also the outside property was beautiful and had a great view. It was super clean and very nicely decorated.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home from the beginning, was greeted by turkeys on the road before getting there, and a deer in the woods when we parked. Was able to use the washer and dryer, this was greatly appreciated. All furnishings were very comfortable. Thank you Kathy for having this available."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy went above and beyond as a host. My dad and brother stayed at this rental and when my dad had a bout of food poisoning she did a load of laundry for him to wash his clothes that were stained. She also took my brother to the airport when they were having difficulties finding transportation.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Kathy’s studio apartment was perfect for my husband and I. It was centrally located to all of the various attractions. The apartment was clean and Kathy and Blake were generous and friendly. I highly recommend this Airbnb!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was incredibly friendly and responsive with her communication. We showed up late on short notice and the place was perfect for our arrival. Her detailed instructions made it easy to find even after dark.
The location is a perfect spot in between the amenities of Rapid City and the adventure of the Black Hills. Inside the space is comfy and has everything you could need for a jumping off point for exploring the area. There's also a nice outdoor space overlooking the hills to the south with some comfy chairs, a fire pit, and a nice view of the vegetable garden.
As a bonus, there are some great mountain biking trails just West on 44 at buzzard's roost and the bone collector. Plus the great trails in Rapid City are only about 10 minutes away!
We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again the next time we're in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved Kathy place. It’s so peaceful and perfect for two. Kathy is very responsive and polite. she went over and beyond to cook my husband and I breakfast with fresh vegetables from her garden. 10/10 We highly recommend staying at Kathy’s!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Very clean, quiet and private. Listing described perfectly. Host was very friendly. Would definitely recommend and would return! Thank you Kathy for your hospitality and for providing a wonderful, relaxing place to stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect size for the 2 of us. Had room to spread out. it is close to all we wanted to see. Kathy is such a gracious host. Storms came through while we were out for the day. the whole area lost power. Kathy met us when we pulled in to give us candles and lantern. So sweet! We would definitely stay again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was friendly, had some ideas where to go and eat in the area, she and her husband even took us to play some pickleball which was great, did'nt except that , they were very friendly, very nice place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just got home from our trip and were marveling at how rested we feel even after the drive. This place is just what we needed, and provided us with both close access to celebrate a retirement/anniversary with our friends in Rapid City, but was also in a good location for us to visit various favorite and some new parts of the Black Hills! After living near Rapid while we were in school, and then living elsewhere for 40 years, it was like coming home! Kathy's place is very clean, comfortable, and with much more space than we expected. It is beautifully decorated, has the added bonus of being in the hills surrounded by trees, and Kathy was very generous in sharing some things from her garden. She is also a wonderful hostess who anticipates her guests needs, and is very responsive in a timely manner! It is a place we would return to on trips to this area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot say enough good things about Kathy and Blake’s place. It was the perfect location to spend two nights in while we toured the area with its many attractions. Blake met us when we checked in, and Kathy was so helpful with everything, even meeting with us one morning to help with our itinerary before we headed out for the day. Communication was perfect in every way, and the apartment was spotless and tastefully furnished. The bed may be one of the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in, it was hard to get out of in the morning. You can tell that much thought has been given to the space and amenities. The setting is idyllic, so peaceful to come back to at the end of a long day, but also not far from downtown Rapid City. Our only complaint is that we couldn’t stay longer! Do not hesitate to book this wonderful Airbnb, easily one of our favorites we’ve ever stayed in!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"MY WIFE AND I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME WHILE VISITING SOUTH DAKOTA. OUR STAY AT KATHY'S AIRBNB WAS FANTASTIC!!! I FELT RIGHT AT HOME AND IT WAS VERY COZY.

MY WIFE AND I WILL MOST DEFINITELY STAY HERE AGAIN WHEN WE COME BACK TO VISIT SOUTH DAKOTA."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home in the perfect location. Kathy was very responsive and made our stay even more enjoyable. We would recommend her home to anyone wanting a quiet getaway while visiting the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Let me tell you...if you are planning to stay in South Dakota stay with Kathy and Blake. Their house is the perfect location for all travel needs. They live 10 minutes from Rapid City which allowed for easy access to restaurants, etc. Their house was just on the edge of the Black Hills which was the perfect location for day trips driving thru the Black Hills to visit all the sights there. We also did a day trip to Devil's Tower. Blake and Kathy were the best hosts one could have. They were so polite and helpful with directions on how to get around. One day it was hot and they offered to install their room AC unit in our studio apt. It was very helpful that night for us to have that unit. On the day we went to Devil's Tower Kathy called us and let us know as we were driving back that severe thunderstorm was in the area and to be careful driving. We were so grateful to have hosts that care that much about their guests. Blake and Kathy were absolutely outstanding hosts!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Kathy’s place is a gem nestled in the Black Hills. The view of the Black Hills from the front door is breathtaking. The studio was pristine clean and cozy. Kathy was easy to contact and fast in responding. She was a great resource for local events.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,The host was very friendly and helpful
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathy and her husband Blake are helpful and friendly hosts. The stay is in the perfect location for exploring both the Badlands (1.5 hour drive) and the Black Hills (you are tucked away just at the edge of the Black Hills National Park). The location is also less than a mile away from caverns, Falling Rock Trail and Buzzard's Roost Trail! Kathy gave me a list of ""gems"" to visit and her recommendations were spot-on! The best part of this stay are the hosts, who are fast to respond to any question and make you feel right at home! Peaceful, private and secluded -- you won't find a better place to stay for the money to visit sites near Rapid Springs!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything is just as advertised! The accommodations were clean and comfortable and Kathy could not have been more helpful in answering any questions. The location is perfect for anything that you want to do in the Black Hills. We would definitely go back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathy was a marvelous host, making herself available to help us enjoy our time to its fullest. The apartment is very roomy, comfortable, and cozy, and a great value. Directions to Kathy and Blake's house were clear, check in was easy (Kathy even came out to introduce herself and make sure we were comfortably settled in), and communication with her throughout our stay was friendly and prompt. We used the washer and dryer, which is in the main house, and I felt welcomed to and at ease about using it. The location was central to all the activities we had planned, yet close enough to town to get coffee at local coffeehouses. And it was quiet! We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Kathy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location!Very clean and comfortable place to stay. I would definitely recommend this place to a close friend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, and comfortable. Great hosts, great location, we would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enchanted, romantic place. We could not have asked for a more beautiful stay or a kinder host. One of the best vacation spots, hidden in plain sight. Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay with Kathy. The location of her home was better than we imagined. It is close to Rapid City and has a rural charm! One morning we saw 3 wild turkeys outside!
Kathy was a great host and made our stay comfortable and us feel welcome. Check in was a breeze.
The space itself was very comfortable and the most “at home” we felt this trip!
Stop reading and book Kathy’s space!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect retreat in the hills! The decor is lovely, a calm, clean, quiet place to get away. The bed was so very comfortable, and the hosts couldn't have been nicer. They really went out of their way to make our stay perfect. We loved watching the birds! There is one couch perfect for relaxing and watching TV and another which I used for curling up with a book. We usually camp in the hills, but this was a quick trip for a funeral, so no time to prepare and bring the camper on the long drive from Texas. This was a wonderful place to return to at the end of each day's activites with family and friends. Thanks for sharing your wonderful black hills retreat!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This roomy studio is one of the nicest places we’ve stayed on our many travels! Everything was perfect! The place is in a beautiful location surrounded by towering pines. The air is fresh and at night we could sit outside and stargaze. It’s possible to access hiking trails and easy to jump on the scenic highway to travel to Custer National Park, the Needle’s Highway, and Mount Rushmore. Everything was so clean and nicely designed. The bed is comfortable and bath/shower water hot as needed. Kathy is very thoughtful and waited up for us to make sure we got there and into the studio without any problems. She also made sure we had everything we needed. She gave us great suggestions for sight seeing (the Needle’s Hwy is awesome) and made sure we had coffee and some treats. If we are ever in the area again we hope to stay here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy is a wonderful host and her listing is the perfect location! We were quite comfortable and had everything we needed to relax after visiting Crazy Horse, Mount Rushmore and many other great places.
Kathy was quick to reply, accommodating our late arrival and offered recommendations and even a map!
We couldn’t have asked for more."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Host was communicative (thanks Kathy!) and everything was as presented on-line. From getting great directions to having amenities, like the coffee station and a small fridge, the time spent was easy, relaxing and exactly as expected. We slept great too! Nice and quiet and located in a beautiful area. We would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay to recharge your batteries! Kathy was a wonderful host and was incredibly quick to communicate about anything and everything you could need. I travel a lot for work and even with my late planning Kathy was fast to respond and make it an easy check in and what a lovely property! Room was exactly what I expected given Kathy’s photos and their homes location was just a fantastic reprieve from the busier areas further into the city. I would absolutely return if I found myself in the area again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome! Just Awesome!! Kathy is a caring, thoughtful, generous hostess! She was very helpful with getting us there and recommendations for what to do, see and where to eat. Our first time at a BnB and it could not have been better!! The studio is beautiful and spacious. The woods around it are wonderful; our first time in the driveway, we saw a deer! The bed is beyond comfortable!! We were near Rapid City but it felt like a cabin in the woods with nature all around us!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5 stars all around! Great comfortable cool space
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathy's beautiful space in the Pine Trees made my break from the hectic heat of Texas an incredible gift for my soul. While I have no idea what SD winters are really like I will return to this lovely space in the trees.
It does not have a full kitchen, so I got to eat in special places around the city instead of cooking.
What a treat to find Independent Pizza and all the other treasures in and around the city. Be sure to check out the other communities in SouthWest SD. Just don't tell anyone else. It is a treasure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home off the highway just outside of town. Kathy gave us great directions so nobody got lost and also shared info on the good local spots hit while we were visiting. No complaints whatsoever
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a neat, cozy place in a peaceful setting. Kathy was a very friendly and accommodating host. You can't beat the fresh air and it's proximity to some really great Black Hills trail heads. We would definitely stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Kathy, I would recommend this place. Kathy is very knowledgeable on things to do in the area, she has a beautiful AirBnb and she greeted us at the front door and offered to take our bags in. It's a very lovely home in a wooded country environment with a walkout basement.
The pictures you see, it looks small but it very large and the decor is very nice, bed is very comfortable and that's an understatement.
If our company sends us back to Washington that's the place we will go on the way.
Kathy recommend 5 things we should do in the 2 day period we stayed in South Dakota.
Spearfish Canyon was incredible (take a picnic lunch) sit and listen to the water.
Custer State Park was so peaceful, I loved the one way bridges and if you look on your way down the mountain going through the one lane bridges you can see Mount Rushmore.
Mt. Rushmore is something everyone should experience.
Thanks so much for making sure our stay was comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute little cabin was very comfortable. Everything was tidy and clean. We will definitely stay here again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice cabin! Great location!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this beautiful cabin was everything we wanted for our adventure to South Dakota! It was easily accessible to Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, and Spearfish Canyon. After a long day of sightseeing and hiking, we loved getting a drink and a bite to eat at the campsite bar and talking with all the other guests. We were able to meet the campsite owner and manager and we felt that they truly cared for our experience at the cabin! Although the bathrooms are not connected to the cabin, they were in great condition and much nicer than any other bathhouses we have seen at campsites. We would definitely stay at this cabin again - especially as the owner and manager shared that they are continuously making improvements based on feedback! Absolutely loved this place and the peaceful nature surrounding it :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved that all it was was one room, its all we needed. We were going to spend most of our time hiking, so we didn’t need much. The bathrooms were very close too. And there is a coffee shop just down the road, and a coffee food truck on Sundays."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for me as a hub for visiting family in different parts of the hills. The restrooms/showers were brand new with a remote control heater. The cabin was wonderful with plenty of bottles of water.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our cabin was well-appointed and seemed in nearly new condition. The bathrooms, in their own building nearby, were extremely clean. Both cabins and bathroom had climate control (heat and A/C). We appreciated the responsive and friendly communication and check in was fast and easy. During our stay, we could hear freeway noise from our cabin (it was closest to the freeway) but it did not bother us; we appreciated being close to I90 to be able to hop on and go. This was a very convenient location as a base from which to explore the northern part of the Black Hills, Sturgis, etc. Definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This air bnb was a great place to stop on our cross country trip! The hosts were VERY flexible
