2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was absolutely phenomenal! We travelled for a two night stay with our three kids ranging in age from 12-4. The home was spacious and homey. The three rooms are very large in size providing plenty of space for each guest! The basics are provided making your travel lighter such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash and lotion! Our kids truly enjoyed the near by train tracks and loved walking outside to see the trains! The train noise was no issue we barely heard the frequent trains! Pedestrians passing by were very friendly and welcoming! We enjoyed breakfast at Commercial Street Diner and it was delicious! We will be traveling to the area more often to visit near by family and this will be our first check on availability for our trips!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Cute, open concept house with everything you could possibly need. There is a train that runs nearby, but we did not hear it at all. Very clean and comfortable bed. Enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and nearby. Very safe with easy access to coffee shops and cute downtown shops. We were visiting for a graduation at Emporia State University. Perfect location! We highly recommend and would happily return."

Kitchen had everything we needed and more, abundant towels and bed linens, lots of cozy blankets for movie nights‚Äîand even a fun welcome basket of goodies when we arrived. Friendly, attentive hosts nearby for any help. Great stay, thanks!!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"For 18 years now our group of guys has been taking a road trip to play disc golf, so we‚Äôve seen all manner of rental homes, and this was hands down one of the best. There were plenty of beds, all the amenities were present and worked as advertised, the common rooms (and the rest of the house) were well furnished to meet our every need, and the outdoor space in the back was fantastic! What really made the difference were the little things, enough towels for everyone and bars and hooks to hang them, tissues and toilet paper, and extra blankets in the closet. It just felt like a house that you could live in instead of those rentals where you can tell they just bought a house and threw in the cheapest furniture they could find; this ain‚Äôt that. Finally, anyone with a framed Avett Brothers poster is good in my book!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was beautiful! Everything was fully stocked! There was a wonderful welcome book detailing everything from the home to thr surrounding area. Best place I've ever stated!! Better than a hotel!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location was great and the size was perfect for our family of 5 adults visiting Emporia for my daughter's master's graduation ceremony. foldable bar height stools would be a great investment so all 5 guests could enjoy aeal together around the kitchen island. All other aspects met or exceeded our expectations.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice. Easy to get in and out of and clean when we arrived.

I Can express how beautiful and new this place is. I definitely recommend to anyone needing to come to Emporia. We hope to stay here again in October! <3"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"great place, nice and clean in a quiet neighborhood."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a good experience and would recommend staying here. Just needs a few finishing touches.
Pros: Host was informative and made checking in and out very easy with a private driveway for parking. Home was cool and inviting upon entry. The remodel of an older home was done well with a very nice kitchen and well stocked, clean bathrooms. Centrally located for ease of access through out Emporia.
Cons: Needs more furniture and a better Wi-if option. It is in a neighbor hood so, unrelated to the home or host was substantial early morning noise from a dog barking next door and a neighbor across the street who seems to be running an auto detail service with loud music and a pressure washer going. There is also a lot of train noise over night, but that would be the case most anywhere here."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Laura‚Äôs place. It was my third time staying there. It‚Äôs peaceful and quiet and has everything you need. Laura is a thoughtful host who communicates well and cares about her guests. I definitely will be back!

The host was quick to respond to any message via the app. The house was very private and a short drive outside of town. The fire pit was a great evening spot to relax. The stay was very pleasant!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place is truly one of my favorite BnBs. it's perfect for our visits to Emporia. close enough to town to get out and do things, but so tranquil when you wanna headback in the evenings to unwind under the stars around the fire pit, away from the town."

Laura was quick to respond to questions and gave great suggestions on a few places to eat. Will stay again if ever that way and need a place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed at Laura‚Äôs farm. It‚Äôs such a peaceful getaway from Kansas City and the proximity to Emporia allowed us to enjoy the charm of a smaller town. Very comfortable accommodations for a big family.

There was lots of space for the kids to wander, a nice little patio and fire pit with excellent lighting, a swing set that my kids couldn't stay off of anytime we were there, and goats all before you made it into the house! The inside was just as thoughtfully arranged, even including a long list of staple pantry items to utilize! However, the best thing about our stay was Laura. We had some issues come up, and she was very understanding and even helped us sort out a way to extend our stay slightly without too much hassle. We are very grateful and immensely enjoyed our stolen moments of peace within the chaos of our adventure found inside the walls of this lovely home and its surroundings."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice host with a beautiful farm home!! Lots of space to spread out and completely enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to future guests!!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A tribute to Kansas rural life and comfort. A beautiful setting guaranteed to make you slow down and relax. A quick drive to town in case you need to do any shopping. Once you're here, you'll find it hard to leave. We only stayed one night, but were able to listen to music on the patio, do a few loads of laundry, play Uno, share a family dinner, and finish the evening with a movie. And guess what, all of these amenities were already there! Laura made the check-in process super simple and was great at answering any questions I had."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not be happier with Lyons Den. Not only is the house well stocked with thoughtful additions, it has touches and comforts and is on the most beautiful property.

She had lots of great amenities -- some we were still discovering on our second, third and fourth days there! The place is wonderfully decorated with amazing local touches. Our young kids were constantly delighted by fun things to look at and play with! We let the kids stay up late each night so we could watch the famous, ranked-top-7-in-the-world, Flint Hills sunsets, and it never disappointed! The country setting was so quiet and peaceful. The drive ""to town"" is easy and takes less than 10 minutes. If we needed to rent a place in Emporia, we would definitely rent from Laura again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location‚Ä¶seems like you are in the middle of nowhere but everything is close by. Wish I could have stayed longer. Definitely if you are looking for a peaceful getaway or a girls trip this is the place. You will not be disappointed.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Laura is a great host. She accommodated us on a few things that really made our annual girl gathering a hit. The house is charming and quiet out on the prairie.

The place is immaculate and well stocked with everything we needed. A welcome retreat on a cross-country trip but also a place we could hunker down for several days! Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A warm and cozy place to stay. Easy to access from the highway, yet tucked away for a private getaway. And inside it has every modern convenience while still keeping its rustic charm. Just a very cute getaway! And Laura is very responsive and helpful!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura‚Äôs place was nothing short of spectacular. My parents, wife, and children all stayed there for several days. We loved how secluded we were from everyone. It was extremely clean with a sense of Laura‚Äôs style. It feels very homey. If you‚Äôre coming during a cold season, don‚Äôt worry because the heater works amazing. There‚Äôs lots to do inside this home. You wake up seeing cows outside from afar. Definitely coming back the next time we go to Kansas!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was great, very clean and private!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Superb experience. Fantastic, authentic plains farm with comfort and nostalgia. Best AirBnB We have had."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place was awesome. We stayed for a week long Hunting trip. Laura was an amazing host. I highly recommend staying here
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Lyons Den is a wonderful place to stay for a couple or a family! It is accurately represented by the photos online. The farm life was an added bonus‚Ä¶we really enjoyed the calves! We were here to visit our son and his family who live in a nearby town, but they don‚Äôt have room for guests. It was the perfect answer for all of us to be together!
Laura was the perfect host! She kept in touch prior to our arrival, giving us pertinent information about the weather, where to park, step-by- step directions to the house, etc. She had OJ, fresh eggs, and bacon in the fridge, which we fixed the first morning! The kitchen was very well stocked. There was a dishwasher, which was nice since we cooked every meal. No Keurig, but a Ninja Coffee Maker that worked well.
The TV room has recliners on the couch and loveseat, as well as a single recliner, so there was plenty of comfy seating for the family movie we watched and some episodes of ‚ÄúI Love Lucy‚Äù with my granddaughter! The Roku TV made that possible‚Ä¶nice feature!!
The beds were comfy and it was nice to have a king in one bedroom. It was a little challenging at times to have just one bathroom to share for 4 adults and a teenage girl, but we made it work. üòâ
The back room has no ductwork for heat or a/c, but the heater Laura has in there kept it plenty warm. It wasn‚Äôt warm while we were there, so I can‚Äôt speak to the efficiency of the fan.
There was a plethora of games to choose from. The two recliners off the kitchen were so comfortable and were wonderful for visiting while others were cooking. We especially enjoyed the Bose Stereo and the eclectic CD collection! One of our favorite features was the fire pit outside. We only got to enjoy it one night due to high winds, but it was great!!
We will definitely be back to the Lyon‚Äôs Den to enjoy the farm life with our family again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place isn't just one of the best BnB's for visiting the Emporia and Flint Hills area but one of the best you'll find anywhere in this country of ours. it's so incredibly tranquil and serene. As someone who lives in a city, her property is literally perfect for getting out of all the noise and relaxing in the countryside while still being close to Emporia. I can't wait to stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura‚Äôs farm house was great for our family of four with children age 5 and 1.5. We were impressed with all the details and found the place very comfortable. We spent so much time playing outside on the swings, and with the croquet set and nerf toys. We loved watching the cows and meeting the barn cats. Will definitely stay here again next time we come to visit our family!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Nice and peaceful! Very clean.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura's place was really wonderful It was immaculate!! It was quaint, charming, sweet, comfortable and fun all at the same time.
If you want a place that is away from it all yet close enough to enjoy anything, this is the perfect place for you. The open space was so welcome. The sky was wide open and the horizon stretched forever.
Waking up to a pot of coffee and the cows grazing outside was so calming. the stars and the moon were right there at night.
Great location and lovely host!"

Wonderful house with lots of space and a great kitchen. Laura is a fantastic host that goes the extra mile for those renting the Lyon‚Äôs Den. My wife and I spent more time at this air bnb than any other we have ever rented because we just loved the esthetic and environment. Great for a romantic getaway or a larger family or friends trip. Highly recommend to any and everyone looking at these reviews!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home with a beautiful landscape. The kitchen was stocked, the beds were comfortable, and everything worked well.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, we really loved our stay. We were only there for one night for my daughter's graduation, but the house was great! The personal touches made us feel more at home. It is close enough to Emporia to be very convenient, but feels like being out in the country. I am certain the sunsets would be beautiful because you can say see so far, but it was unfortunately raining during our trip. The outside area was very comfortable to sit and read (before it started raining) and the house was clean and cozy. The beds were very comfortable too. Overall, this was a fantastic experience! I would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beyond what I expected! Comfy beds, lots of space, and everything you need while there! Like the area around the house also! Wish i couldve used the fire pit. I will be back when in the area!!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura provided a nice clean and well stocked house for our stay. We came for the Dynamic Discs open and she added a couple of added touches with that in mind including a nice welcome gift. If we come next year I will look to see if this house is open first. Nice job Laura!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed being just out of town but close enough that it made things easy.
There ended up being only two in our party but there was plenty of space for four people if need be. Laura made sure we were set up with some breakfast staples which made the experience that much better!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very roomy, fun games, lovely decor, great views of the country!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn‚Äôt of asked for a better first house everything was clean and very homey.

The king size bed was super comfortable, the house was stocked with everything we needed and was sparkling clean. Laura, our host, even left us a gift card for a wonderful local restaurant and a bottle of wine. We loved how quiet the place was but was still only 10 minutes from town. We‚Äôll be back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The location of the Airbnb was also perfect. It was conveniently situated in a vibrant neighborhood, with easy access to public transportation and a variety of shops and restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the area and immersing myself in the local culture.
However, what truly set this Airbnb experience apart was your exceptional hospitality. Your prompt and clear communication prior to my arrival ensured a smooth check-in process. Moreover, your willingness to go above and beyond to accommodate my needs during my stay was truly remarkable. Whether it was providing valuable recommendations for local attractions or promptly addressing any concerns, you were always there to assist."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location next to Peter Pan park. The trains in Emporia are quite loud here but nothing the owner could do about that. Bathrooms were immaculate and home was tidy. The only issue we faced was that none of the chairs/stools fit the table or breakfast bar which rendered those largely unusable. With that fix we would gladly return and highly recommend this stay!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I never meet Jolene the whole week I was there, although she lived next door. I wish I had. She and here family were very respectful of my privacy. She left a note in the kitchen that if I needed anything at all to come over and see her. I was stunned by the amount of amenities in the house; more than any other place I‚Äôve stayed. Truly, everything you need is right there. It‚Äôs obviously an older house but it has been professionally remodeled. The bed was very comfortable with very soft pillows. I was by myself but Jolene‚Äôs place will definitely accommodate a small family. I will be checking its availability when I return to Emporia."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emporia has a lot of old houses and this one is a great example of how they can be updated and modernized and be a really nice place.
One thing I noticed is that this house is good for anybody with mobility issues. There are no steps from the driveway into the house, the house is all on one floor, it looks like all the doors are wider than standard, and the shower is a large walk-in.

I do a lot of cooking and baking, as we rarely eat at restaurants. The kitchen was completely ready to meet our needs! We enjoyed grilling too! I spent part of each morning and again late at night drinking coffee on the back porch while watching the birds. AHHH. I have nothing negative to say about the home! We will be back when visiting our son/DIL. The location was perfect for us too. As a sidenote: I wasn't bothered by the constant train whistles, but I advise light sleepers to bring earplugs or grab some at Walgreens like my hubby had to! If I could give a higher-than-perfect rating, I would! I've traveled and rented airbnb's a lot and this is by far my favorite stay!"

We come to Emporia a few times a year for Fraternal events, and we have definitely found our new 1st choice for accommodations. I'm sad it's already book for the next time we're in town. Very roomy and spacious with both private spaces and gathering spaces for the 4 people in our party. Located in the heart of downtown, it was a few blocks from our event, and allowed us to discover some new restaurants we weren't aware of. Found some new favorites there too.
We arrived in the evening after work and Paul had everything ready for our later arrival. He stopped by to say Hi, during our visit and was very friendly gracious.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy to find location with a good host. We were just passing through, but I think this would be good for an extended stay or business trip given the open space and office available."
2023-02-01,2,Stayed one night,"We were there all of five minutes and saw a roach in the bathroom. Yuck! Told the host and got a response of they've never had bug issues before and thought I brought them. I came from a sanitized and very clean mansion. There is no way we could of brought any type of bugs. Smh So for the host to assume it was us, when he said they had a party for him in there before we arrived, is just ridiculous. Then on top of that it was soooo dusty in there my nose kept clogging up because I'm allergic to household dirt and dust. So we stayed two days, one day longer than I wanted. We left on the second day, when my son saw another roach in the living room. That was enough for me! Just gross, and the response was quiet upsetting. No real apology, or discount. I would NOT recommend a stay here."

Some trash was left in the kitchen trash, the shower was dirty and had several hairs (near drain, on shelf, on wall), dust pan left out, and there was visible debris on the floors in several rooms.

The place could use a good deep cleaning in the bathroom, kitchen area and the living room furniture but not enough to keep us away for the price. Paul is very nice and easy to communicate with. Its an eclectic space that worked well for us while we were traveling to and from our New Mexico trip. We did feel very safe, nice place to park, handicap automatic door for carrying stuff in and a nice little sitting area outside to enjoy the downtown scene. Located in a great location next to lots of shops and restraunts down town. Very quiet space, occasionally faint train noise can be heard but once in the bedrooms we couldnt hear it. There is a fridge, microwave and hot plate but not many utensils or pans so if you plan to do light cooking you will need to bring those. Overall decent stay for the price and location."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great downtown location close to ESU and downtown activities and eateries.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Paul is a great host. He communicated effectively. Checked in on us upon check in. The space is an eclectic one. We had the basics for our over night stay. The space needed a good deep cleaning but the beds were comfortable, the sheets, bedding and towels were clean. The space has plenty of room and a nice big TV with piped in surround system. We felt very safe in the space and chatted with some of the neighbors and locals while we sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather. Overall we will come back on our way through Emporia again. Paul's Bunker is a unique find and we greatly appreciated his hospitality and answering all our questions promptly and personally checking us in."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The bunker is a cozy and quiet place to stay. It's located right on Emporia's main street (Commercial St.). If my wife and I go there again this summer, and the place is available, we hope to stay there again.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very comfortable and cozy stay. My friend and I enjoyed the living room area and large screen tv. Both bedrooms and beds and the bathroom were comfortable and well appointed. The kitchen was great for an overnight stay. Paul was quick to answer questions, even before I was prepared to book the trip. The neighborhood was a mixed bag. It felt a bit sketchy but also offered walking access to all of Emporia‚Äôs downtown restaurants and shops. Try Sweet Granada!! Delicious."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location, and very unique space. We loved the environment and the common area where we could unwind after a long week of travel. Emporia is a great city, and this is right in the center!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Driving from Minnesota to Arizona. This was as far as we made it night one. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better stop. Paul was great, he met us even though it was a late arrival. The Airbnb was clean, the beds were comfy and we got a really good nights sleep. Thank you Paul."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location and tons of space! Parking a few steps from the outside door and the area is very walkable. It‚Äôs a former office space, however, they‚Äôve done a great job converting to an apartment. Lots of little touches to make it very homey feeling. I only stayed one night (middle of a road trip home), but I could‚Äôve easily stayed longer in this space. LOVE that it‚Äôs pet friendly‚Äî my dog loved it too! Definitely recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Bunker was very clean, spacious and felt like home away from home! Location is very convenient to local stores, restaurants, and the interstate! I‚Äôm originally from Emporia and to have something like this available, is an awesome feeling. You will enjoy staying there."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,A real find!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Bunker is a safe and clean place to stay. Paul is very proactive with communication and is easy to contact!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great! The location is right downtown. It's a nice roomy place. Very clean. Paul is very responsive and helpful.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Bunker is an ideal place to stay to experience Emporia, and is well suited for a big group. It was big, clean, and just as pictured."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Get place to stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place. Great host. Very accommodating.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Good communication. Stay was just what we needed. Plenty of space. Comfy!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the space very much! I loved the great downtown location and will stay again if I return to Emporia. It is exactly as described, old office space converted to living space and it works well. Surprising treat‚Ä¶old stereo piped throughout in ceiling speakers. Take your CD‚Äôs and have a blast! I played the ones there and loved it! Paul is a great host and came and visited with me at check in."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bunker is a perfect spot to stay, highly recommended! Great host"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Bunker is a wonderful place to stay! It‚Äôs in a great location in downtown Emporia. It is very Comfy & Cozy. Paul is a wonderful host. I would recommend anyone to stay here for a nice relaxing get a way.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Good communication and a solid setup.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This space is accurately listed on Air BnB. The studio is in a basement of an office building. It has a clean shower, two beds, washer & dryer, and a large sitting area for guests.
As a host Paul is very responsive, easy to communicate with, and offered us a late arrival within minutes of my private message to him.
Caution: at the time of this review, the main entrance to the office building is not locked and remains open to the public at all times. The second floor which appears to be under construction is also accessible via the unlocked main entrance. ‚ÄúThe Bunker‚Äù itself has a door that locks at the entrance to the space that is not very secure either. I do not recommend staying here if you have any concerns about being in an unsecured space overnight.
This security information was sent directly to Paul in a private message. Based on my first impression of him, this security issue will be addressed properly, but is important enough to make this issue public."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is the weirdest Airbnb I've ever rented but it was pretty great. Weird because it's the basement of an office building and was obviously once an office itself. That being said, the beds were comfy, it was clean, the shower water pressure was great and Paul was a joy to deal with. My only suggestion is maybe some plug in air fresheners as it did smell a little basement-y. I will definitely consider staying in the Bunker again next time I'm in Emporia."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Roomy & clean! Unique and great location!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay. The location right in old downtown Emporia is very unique and is on close proximity to anything you would want to do in the area. If you are coming for disc golf, the Dynamic Discs shop is directly next door and the local courses are close by. If you are in Emporia for other reasons, then this place is the right place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and a really nice place- spacious and clean! We enjoyed our stay here even though we stopped over only briefly. I would recommend it!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bunker is perfectly located, whether you‚Äôre there for events happening in Emporia or at the University. Being where it is at, you‚Äôd expect to be able to hear the commotion on Commercial Street, but never once heard anything."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hospitality very comfortable. Favorite place I‚Äôve stayed in a long while.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, great Airbnb"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is located in the spot. Most places we visited were in walking distance of The Bunker.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The Bunker is very convenient for activities downtown or at the college. I like how Paul has repurposed the previous office space. The living room space could have used more lighting in the evening but the sky lights offered natural light during the day. We enjoyed a quick stay while in town taking care of other business.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great. It's repurposed out of (what appears to be) an office building. It has a very unique and fun feel to it. The location is perfect, right next to campus and within walking distance of just about everything. Highly recommended."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the nice place to stay. I enjoyed it very much.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The property is exactly as it's listed This is a great place to stay. It's clean and nicely furnished. The beds are super comfy. The water pressure strong and we had plenty of hot water. It has all the practical things you could need while you're out of town. We were there for work so this didn't apply, but the location is excellent for the many activities and events downtown. Paul is an excellent and very friendly host. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""The Bunker"" is a GREAT place! Clean, convenient and quiet! A great deal on top of that! Paul is a great guy and has turned this former office space into a great getaway! Wish I could have stayed longer! I will definitely return and check out more of Emporia while staying with Paul!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect location. Walk to downtown shopping and restaurants. Just a short stroll from the Emporia State campus. Walk to basketball or football games.
Lots of space to relax in. Paul is very hospitable and accommodating.
Highly recommend The Bunker for Emporia stays."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay and convenient to downtown and ESU.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you are visiting downtown Emporia!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location. Walking distance to all downtown Emporia has to offer.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This spot is in very convenient location. we enjoyed our stay here. lots of room and very comfortable!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Paul‚Äôs was awesome per usual (our 3rd time staying) will be back for sure. So convenient and reasonably priced. Paul‚Äôs a wonderful host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, just 5 mins walk from the college campus."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This is a great house. Nicely remodeled interior. Very clean and comfortable. Jordan was super easy to communicate with.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We were very pleased with our stay, the house has a great charm."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This house has plenty of space for us who stayed there and for our family members who were in town to come for a visit and share a meal. There was plenty of room. The basement was great for the teens to enjoy.
I'm disabled so I was challenged with the stairs and the poor condition of the driveway and rocks.
Overall, we enjoyed our 2 day stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint older home.
Nice back yard.
Lots of parking.
Great host."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved staying here. The house is adorable, and the host is incredibly friendly and willing to work with your situation. We stayed the night here as we were travelling across the country to our new home. Very few places will let you stay with multiple pets, but this is one of them. I can't thank them enough for working with us and our situation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jordan was a great host! Responded to me very quickly an any questions I had he didn‚Äôt hesitate to answer!
We walked in an loved the feeling of the place. Kid friendly! Great back yard for the kids to play and sit around the fire pit! Kitchen is well stocked with dishes, pots and pans and utensils. bedrooms accommodated everything we needed! Plus the ping pong table was a hit!
We will def come back when we come to visit the area again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Pros: Great location; backyard was perfect for the dog; will definitely stay again, if available
Cons: Some areas of the house were quite dusty."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Made me feel like I was back at home. I missed those older Emporia Kansas homes with all of their charm and the kids really enjoyed all the neat games the home offered.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great central location in Emporia. Great front porch for morning coffee or just hanging out.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house. We had a group of 5 adults (2.5 couples) and four kids along with a Boston Terrier and it worked out great for us as a homebase as we were visiting family in town for a graduation. We were able to play card games around the table and the dog was able to use the partially fenced in yard. She‚Äôs not a runner or we may have been worried about it not being all the way fenced.
The beds and rooms were comfy. The main floor bathroom opens into the hallway and master bedroom so best to be comfortable with whoever is staying on the first floor with you. :)
The front porch made a really nice place to hang out as a group for morning coffee. The neighborhood was very peaceful and within a short distance to cafes and coffee shops."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place to stay. Easy access to Interstate and downtown. Kitchen has all the items you need to cook almost anything!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay! There was plenty of room to spread out in this house. We especially enjoyed the large dining room and the big front porch. Having multiple living areas was a bonus. The yard was not fully fenced, but that didn't impact our stay. The house is centrally located and offers so much at an affordable, reasonable rate. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Very spacious! Casey was excellent with communication!
Would highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm giving an honest review. The good and the bad. I‚Äôll start with the good:
The Good
- Casey‚Äôs place is clean, centrally located, and fits all descriptions. The house is large and while you can tell it‚Äôs an old house and makes old house noises, the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean.
- Casey‚Äôs place is a straight shot from downtown, something I didn‚Äôt think I was going to value as much as I did since we were not passing through for any specific disc golf event.
The Bad
- I‚Äôll say I could have gotten a hotel, but based on previous AirBnB stays I preferred the experience. We were charged a fair per night rate, but an EXORBITANT cleaning fee for only staying for 2 nights. We left the house clean, took out the trash, used no dishes, and were charged more for cleaning than it cost for the total nightly rate.
There was not any coffee grounds, but there was cream and sugar and sweetener.
In summary,
Probably should‚Äôve gotten a hotel. Perfect home for longer stays"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed there during a trip to Kansas, it was me and my five children, the house was beautiful and spacious, would recommend to anyone!! Hopefully we will get the opportunity to stay there again soon"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice peaceful place and very spacious would stay here agin if i worked in the area we used it for work and have zero complaints!
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,"This home was okay, but not exceptional. There was everything we needed, but some common items we are accustomed to finding in most places were missing: paper towels, kitchen towels, toaster, doors that close tightly, functional doors on closets and showers, salt & pepper, seating for the number it advertised, extra blankets, and usable internet TVs. In addition, the number of messages received from the host with extra instructions not included in the house rules after booking and while we were there was excessive. Overall, we were not pleased and will not be returning to this host or space."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the place was just fine thanks for the stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was a perfect stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The bathrooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"There was plenty of room to have 5 adults around. It would have been great with even more.
Casey was very good about making sure we were accomodated very well. The neighborhood is safe and clean. The home is located very centerally with easy access to all parts of the city. We highly reccomend the home for anyone. Thanks, Casey for the use of your home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Casey will go above and beyond to accommodate any issues and is very understanding. He‚Äôs an amazing host and shows outstanding hospitality
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"awesome place not far from restaurants, i travel for alot for work and its nice to have the garage available i was able to park my trailer inside the garage. would recommend Casey's place to enyone passing by or just looking for a weekend stay."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Make sure to read the cancellation policy.
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,The stay was good. The pictures represent a pretty accurate description of the place. The hosts were super good at responding in a timely manner and friendly. Would recommend this place to others.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Guys!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute house but over priced.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,It was very close to the event I went to while staying in Emporia so it was easy to walk to the event and not have to worry about parking. The hosts are very responsive and willing to help in any way possible.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, good space."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was just what we needed, a large place for our family gathering."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I enjoyed our weekend stay for my daughters graduation! There was plenty of space for our guests in the open dining and living room areas! There were a few minor issues with the bathroom and kitchen, but overall a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay very comfortable and clean. Quit neighborhood great location.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house was a wonderful location for our family to all get together for our Thanksgiving celebration. My six year old granddaughter even calls it the Holiday House. The house had a lot of room for our big family with lots of room for entertaining. Thank you Casey for your hospitality!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious, clean and comfortable home. Owners were very quick to respond to any problems, although they didn't resolve the problems, just thanked us for letting them know. A drawback for our group was the lack of kitchen supplies, no working coffee pot, no sheet pans or baking dishes and not enough utensils or cups and plates for the whole group to eat at the same time. Also, there are no heavy blankets or comforters in the entire house, only very lightweight quilts, which is great in summertime but not in November. Overall, it is a comfortable & clean place to stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love are stay , really comfortable house nice quiet neighborhood.."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean, affordable and excellent Host! 5* stay"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,the house was nice and clean. had everything we needed. it is close enough to the train track to hear the train throughout the night. but other than that was a nice house to stay at.
2022-10-01,3,Group trip,Spacious home and very clean. Drawback is location due to the train horn blowing all night long was difficult to sleep at times. Each night train traffic was different some nights more than others. It is not located near train tracks however you will hear the train‚Äôs horn so plan ahead and bring white noise machine or earplugs.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, lots of room. Has a k cup coffee maker and pots and pans."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was great for our family while on Emporia. The central location made it easy to be with our family at the hospital, the neighborhood was quiet and the house easily met our needs. Casey was a wonderful host, was attentive and responded to messages quickly. We will definitely consider staying in this house again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay in Emporia! It was just me and my dogs, but still a great value. Excellent location close to downtown and Emporia Country Club (I was there for a disc golf tournament there). Nice and quiet neighborhood. The house was super clean, and they even had the tv on with a tranquil video on when I arrived. It was super easy to get in (keycode pad on the front door) and they provided keys to all the doors too. The house was comfortable, and I stayed in the main bedroom downstairs so I can only speak to that bed, but it was great! Everything I needed for my short stay was included. Casey was easy to communicate with through Airbnb and very responsive. I would highly recommend this house for the location and the value. Already planning my next trip there!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Short notice stay and was exactly what we needed!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful experience. So many small but numerous amenities were

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect house for our family! House is spacious, very nicely remodeled and clean! Had great personal touches like phone chargers, Toiletries, breakfast bar and coffee. Enjoyed the backyard space and available parking in attached garage during a storm. Steven was easy to communicate with and seemed happy to help. We would look forward to staying again if in town!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Honestly, this is one of the best AirBnB's I've stayed at.
Everything was very clean, the host was incredibly helpful, and the home was stocked with everything you might need on your stay (milk, phone chargers, toothbrush, pads, etc)."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My wife and I enjoyed our stay. It was a very clean home with lots of amenities. If I ever go back to emporia I hope to use this location again. The owners are fantastic. They were responsive and made it clear they would do anything to help if needed. This is a wonderful location for traveling families as it has lots of space.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karla's place is a hidden gem! We were in town for Track Nationals at Emporia State and her home was convenient to everything we needed to do. Karla is an amazing hostess and you can tell she truly wants you to be comfortable and happy. Everything was clean and she left amazing extras like breakfast food and things for the bathroom you may have forgotten. Not sure I will ever have the need to be back in Emporia, but if I do I will definitely try to book with Karla again!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this little house on Garfield street! It is very comfortable and cozy and the owner Karla is fabulous! She was very helpful and all instructions were available and spot on. We had no issues at all, enjoyed our time there. We highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karla was very responsive, warm and accommodating. I had a really nice time relaxing at her place while was at a gravel camp and gravel bike race. Perfect location near downtown Emporia. Excellent home base for a visiting athlete to cook and have excellent downtime. I felt very comfortable relaxing at her place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and at an amazing price! Karla‚Äôs place had everything you‚Äôll need for your stay. Highly recommended!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karla was an awesome host! Quick to communicate and respond, helpful with our situation, and the house was perfect for our group! Would 100% book again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved our home away from home! The decor was awesome! Country cosy and ever so comfortable. The kitchen was large and very easy to use. Everything we could want and more (snacks and food) was provided. The patio furniture was perfect for sitting in the sun. Appreciated the air mattress in one of the downstairs bedrooms. The sleep number bed in the other downstairs bedroom was extra special. Great hot water and water pressure."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay and also great communication between the owner and I. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone staying in Emporia. Greta location to get to campus, places to eat and downtown. This was an awesome place and would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place just described and Karla was extremely responsive and helpful. Would absolutely stay at Karla's place again. It was warm and inviting.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Karla‚Äôs home was perfect and so accommodating! Would highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband & I were in town for family events and needed a place to stay. We reviewed the local hotels and found Karla‚Äôs Airbnb listing. The location is convenient to everything.
We felt welcomed by Karla as soon as we booked our stay. She provides helpful tips leading up to your stay and is friendly and responsive.
When we walked to the back door to enter, we first saw the cutest patio and backyard ready for activity or relaxation.
When we walked inside, we were greeted with information displaying WiFi, reminders about the property, and welcome treats. She offers so many special personal touches to welcome her guests.
The decor is the mid century modern and it is apparent she put thought and care into her property. We felt comfortable in every room and space during our stay.
I recommend staying here, especially if you are traveling with a family or another couple or friends. Everyone will feel comfortable here. We would love to stay again next time we stay in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was absolutely incredible to stay at. Karla is an amazing host and went above and beyond in every way possible. The space was super welcoming and made me feel at home instantly. At the time I requested to stay here I mentioned that I was coming to celebrate my birthday and she had birthday cake pops waiting on the dining room table for me. I didn‚Äôt think there were hosts that thoughtful and caring!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to downtown! House was clean and well stocked with supplies. Nice quiet neighborhood. Great response to messages! Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karla‚Äôs house in Emporia was the perfect place for us to stay over thanksgiving. We hate staying in hotels in Emporia, just because they are so variable and it never feels comfortable.

If you visit, be sure to go to Tallgrass Prairie! It is a must see! Overall, a wonderful stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at the Little Pink House with my wife and our 2-year-old. I was working during most of the daytime hours, which I would say might be my biggest regret to the trip.
Leah helped my wife and little one get settled while I worked, and even offered some extra amenities we might need.
I arrived after the sun was down to a much needed respite from our busy day. Peaceful water under an open sky. Comfortable bedding and darkness all around.
The bathroom is a short distance from the Little House and nice with a shower included. Easy to find with the string of lights guiding you to the door.
Waking up to the sunrise and sound of birds next to the pond was perfection. My daughter and I counted the cows in a farther pasture. Looked at the geese swimming under the brush. And soaked in as much as we could before we left.
Thank you Leah for your hospitality!! We will come back just to stay here again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"they list a lot of amenities like a bathroom, yet it is a long walk to use the bathroom attached to their house, especially when it's cold out like last night/ this morning
tiny home needs insulation work done, the inside got below 60 degrees overnight it was frigid
there are no blinds for the majority of the windows, so cars headlights illuminate the room from the nearby road
interstate/ highway/ road traffic is noisier than expected
surprisingly no microwave, when they cost 10$ at walmart. I'll bring my own next time i guess
host did offer/ bring an electric kettle over which was nice and i was able to make tea
kcup machine requires water, this is a dry cabin, and no water provided walmart: 2$ for 1G water or just fill up the machine?
tl;dr-
definitely not what i expected, they do list some of the ""issues"" in their description and photos are mostly accurate, host could be more proactive but it seems like a side hustle for them not an actual service
better airbnbs for less $"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect cottage getaway ~ loved the attention to detail and sunsets on the kayak !

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"So glad we found the Little Pink House for a brief overnight stay! I wish we would have had more time to take it all in! The Little Pink House was so cozy, warm, inviting, clean & sweet ‚Äî just as expected from the listing‚Äôs pictures. The fireplace made it nice & warm & cozy. The bed was so comfortable & we slept so well. It was all adorable, but also perfect for my fishing husband to be able to wake up & walk right out to the pond. Oh! And the kitty was the sweetest cat we‚Äôve ever met in our lives haha! The hosts & their family seemed so sweet. We had enough privacy, but also felt like they were available if we needed anything."
