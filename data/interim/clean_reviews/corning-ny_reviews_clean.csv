2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were hiking at Watkins Glen State Park and nearby waterfalls. Our 2 night stay was really pleasant with Denise and David's apartment. There was enough space, everything was thoughtfully provided and the internet was truly very fast. The location was 30 min away from WGSP and was really close to the Corning Musuem. Their recommendation for 9 Elephants was amazing, we went there twice. Parking was easy and plentiful. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for the wineglass half and it was a great location- far enough away to not be blocked off after the race but an easy drive or walk to the bridge you walk over to get to the start/finish line. Super close to all of the shops and restaurants and the owners are great at responding with tons of suggestions!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Denise & David's four nights and had a great stay. The apartment was in a location that allowed easy access to the grocery store, Corning's downtown, Corning Museum of Glass, and highways leading to other towns including Watkins Glen (the famous gorge) and Seneca Lake (wineries and breweries). The apartment was as described and the hosts were friendly and responsive. We bumped into the hosts while checking in and they greeted us warmly, answered a few questions we had, and suggested a few local restaurants and attractions."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're debating booking this place... Stop and book it now.
Great location, cute and clean apartment with everything you think you may need and more! The host is extremely responsive and helpful, and so is the manager that lives one door down. Everything is within walking distance. The town is absolutely adorable. Must visit Marketplace and visit the local shops. Corning Museum is a few blocks away. 20-30 minutes away from great hiking trails. Watkins Glen State Park is a must-see as well! I am so glad I booked this place and so will you!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denise and David were very pleasant to talk to! Thank you again!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We visited for the glass festival. It was a 10 minute walk to the museum and a bit further to get to the restaurants and grocery store.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is lovely and conveniently located. We were in search of an iron and there was none. That would have been helpful. Also TV was pretty difficult to use. I have lots of apps but could only get netflix
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,The location was key for me and it was great to have a clean private quiet space to rest between visits to local attractions.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at this place for about a week while waiting for the moving company to move our furniture to town. During our stay, we had to adjust the dates for our trip a couple times. Denise and David responded quickly to our request and were understanding. The check-in check-out process was smooth and great. The little apartment was clean and neat, and was a great size for two of us. Kitchen had many tools for basic cooking. We made a few meals while we were there. I also stayed at the apartment to work at day time as my work is remote. The apartment is comfortable for work, though the car sound was a little distracting if I sat by the window. Overall the place is a great cozy apartment. Denise and David are friendly. We highly recommend this place!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a budget friendly place to stay near the Corning Glass Museum.

Walk up exterior stairway to second floor apartment. Bathroom is good, although it does take a bit of patience to master the shower controls."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Easy driving distance to everything Corning has to offer.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful apartment literally 1 block from everything amazing in Corning. The apartment was clean the beds comfortable, loved the snack bowl he left. We will be back as we barely saw half of the Corning glass museum."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert’s Corning apartment was clean and beautifully decorated. Way more than enough storage in the bedrooms and kitchen. The kitchen was nice with a water cooler, coffee, tea, and snacks. It had the most adorable mini gas stove. The beds were fantastic! We had a wonderful nights sleep! The bathroom is small but the water pressure and temperature was awesome.
Robert himself is responsive and accommodating. The price is a little above what I normally go for. We were splurging on a girls trip to corning. I would absolutely rent from Robert in the future."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very clean and Robert's parking instructions were very helpful. The living room furniture was comfortable. The only drawback was the bed was a little firm for our tastes.

We also appreciated the great price, especially since we only booked for one night and didn't have to pay high cleaning/service fees. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at roberts place was great. Just what we needed. We didn’t use the kitchen so cannot speak to that functionality. Great walkability to market street and market street itself is easily walked. The apartment was generally quiet with minimal noise from neighbors, clean, and tidy. Robert was very responsive when we were checking in and as we were leaving."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean apartment. The kitchen is very well equipped and we cooked dinner one night. Bed was super comfortable…..very nice linens and super thick towels. The location could not be better….short walks to the quaint downtown, Rockefeller and Corning Glass museum. This is THE place to stay when coming to Corning."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, just a short walk from everything in Corning. Definitely would go back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a standout with regard to responsiveness, and an immense desire to assure I had everything I needed for a great stay.
Anyone having the opportunity to stay at his property will be treated to a very pleasant and comfortable visit as a result of his attentiveness to details and desire to accommodate guests.
The apartment was decorated very tastefully. Linens, towels, kitchen items were all new and neatly organized. There were snacks, coffee, laundry supplies and even a bottled water dispenser.
Only regret was I had to leave unexpectedly half way though the stay and unable to enjoy his hospitality a little longer."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Would definitely recommend
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, walkable to lots of stores/restaurants"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 minute walk to Corning Main Street shops and restaurants, 10 minute walk to Corning Glass Museum. Great apartment, entirely suitable for long-term stays. Wegmans also within walking distance. The building is a bit worn down, but the apartment is newly renovated. Very functional kitchen - even tea and coffee!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place in the heart of the gaffer district. 5 minute walk to restaurants, museums, shopping. Apartment was well furnished with full accommodations."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Only made a quick 1 night stop but my group and I are already looking forward to coming back in the fall! Great clean place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful space. Felt calm and spacious enough for our party of three. AC worked great to cool space. We barely used kitchen but it looked nice for extended stay. Best part was walkability to nice area of Corning with great restaurants and museums nearby. Robert was great host and very responsive.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robert’s place in Corning was clean and right near the Main Street with plenty of restaurants. He has installed two air conditioners in the bedrooms and it helped keep everything comfortable. Super easy to find and was a great stay. Thanks for hosting!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert’s place is in the perfect location! We could walk to market street and all the fun shops and restaurants. The apartment was clean and spacious. Thanks, Robert!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was clean and in a great location (walkable to the town). Pictures and description were accurate. When booking I had asked Robert about air conditioning since we were traveling with a baby. He was upfront that there was none, but stated the apartment typically stayed cool and had fans. Unfortunately, it did get very hot in the evening (85 degrees). A few of the windows did not have screens and were unable to be opened which added to the intense heat. I made Robert aware, but understood there was not much he could do at that point. He was responsive and apologetic - he indicated he would look into it for future bookings.
That being said, aside from the sweltering heat, it was a cute and clean place in a convenient location. I would not hesitate to rebook in the cooler months (or if air condition was installed for the summer months)."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert was able to accomodate us on short notice (3pm, the day of). The location was easy to get to, and Robert left us a bowl of snacks and bottles of water, which were very welcome after a long day. It was my fault for not reading more closely that there was not an AC in the unit, but the fans were great at keeping the air circulating. We look forward to stopping by in the future when we need a place to overnight in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robert’s place was ideal for us on a long drive. Easy access to downtown Corning and easy to find and access!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very well set up for children, although we didn't have children. The place was homey and comfortable and the hosts were very friendly! Including their wonderful dog."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful and comfortable stay!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Great location.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This quiet, spacious, welcoming guest suite is in a perfect location to enjoy Corning and near to family for us.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Perfect location for us. Very spacious
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious suite atop a beautiful Victorian 5 blocks from the center of Corning.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The attic apartment was just as described, with four sleeping areas ranged around the large living room and other shared spaces. The welcome instructions gave a real feel for this historic house and its quirks. The neighborhood was quiet and charming. We ordered a hot breakfast one morning, and it came promptly and was a good value. We felt quite at home and would gladly return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host with a wonderful apartment!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exactly as described: Up three staircases, lots of bedrooms spread out enough for the three generations we had staying here, books and games (and foosball!) Residential neighborhood close to the main commercial district."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As always Frances was a great host! Will definitely stay in this apartment again. Great location and ease of access.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Frances was helpful, friendly and flexible on our late checkout due to my running time in the Wineglass Marathon. The space was both historically interesting and attractive. Lots of space and well stocked of towels and amenities."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As always Frances was a great host. We stay frequently and will continue to do so. Really nice apartment and Frances is very attentive to our needs while staying.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Frances and the place were great!
Everything was smooth. The place is a nice quick walk to the areas of Corning that we wanted spend time at. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely Airbnb. Although upstairs apartment, the square footage was larger than some houses. We really enjoyed reading about the history of the house and the local recommendations. As others noted you do have to walk up a couple flights of stairs, as it’s on the third floor, but very comfortable stay. Pay attention to the city parking regulations (helpful diagram also posted) Pristine towels and linens and comfy beds."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacy and quiet appartement in a beautiful old house and very nice neighbourhood. A very good place to stay with shops and restaurants nearby and just a short drive to Watkins and the Fingerlakes.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another bathroom and a laundry room would have been nice, but it was a great place to stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and would definitely return! Best sleep we’ve had away from home. Quiet and cozy. Beautiful home and neighborhood close to downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay while me and my staff were in town for the Finger Lakes Wine Festival. We will likely stay again next year if available. Definitely worth the stop thank you from the Woodbury Wine Team
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Lots of stairs to climb but being a top level suite that’s expected. Also being an old house insulation is tough to deal with so it gets very hot in the summer however they battle that with A/C units in every room that work very well. In theory it’s walkable to downtown but it’s on a hill so it’s a workout getting back. All in all a fantastic stay.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,You couldn't find nicer or more considerate hosts.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfe
Spacious accomodations in a beautiful historic neighborhood. Wonderful!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying with Frances, and the place feels like my home away from home! Plus, the homemade ginger snap cookies were delicious! ;-)"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,The Southside hill in Corning is one of the most beautiful locations in Western New York. To be able to stay in an old historic house there was really a treat. Each bedroom has unique character and spectacular views of the neighborhood. Dodger the dog greeting you every time you return was an added bonus.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very spacious and homey place, with multiple, private bedrooms- perfect set-up for several friends who want a little space. The Third floor of large Victorian house with lots of character. Private entrance and stairway. House is in a beautiful , quiet residential area several blocks from the restaurant district and museums. Place was clean and well stocked with linens and cooking supplies. It is not air- conditioned, but there are fans provided and ample openable windows."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So charming! We loved our stay. The views are amazing and the historic feel of the place was awesome. Cozy beds, lots of space, and perfect Corning location near Market st."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay with friends while in Corning. Plenty of space for multiple people and conveniently located within a short walk to Market Street. I'd recommend anybody visiting stay at France's place!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very comfortable for four people. The kitchen was well-stocked and the living room was nice for relaxing. There were plenty of blankets for some chilly weather. All rooms were organized, things were labelled and directions given which was helpful. There was also some information about the history of the home which we found so interesting. We plan to return!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed twice at Frances' home away from home. Both Frances and Tom work well with requests and are responsive. Tom even shared Christmas Cookies with us which were just lovely. There is parking on the street, the neighborhood is walkable. I probably wouldn't walk down the hill to town, only because I would have to walk back up the hill to the house. We will definitely stay there again when we go back to Corning."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful arbnb, in historic home, a few blocks from Market Street, peaceful lovely neighborhood, homey, view of the city lights and lots of windows, sunlight, charming, very comfortable. It is obvious that Francis has put a lot of thought into making stays enjoyable and welcoming, with lots of extras; even a paper shredder and a work desk; charging units, books, games, nice living room decorative heater. We loved the place!!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Frances is a great host and even greeted us when we arrived from the airport around midnight the night we checked in. The space is large and very functional with everything you need for a pleasant stay in Corning. It's walkable to downtown and that's super nice!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous weekend. We loved all the crooked floors and creaks. The house is beautiful and location was perfect! 4 bedrooms were perfect and it was fabulous coming home to a comfortable home to cook and have wine after a long day of adventure. Perfect for a girl's weekend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful place to relax in Corning with amazing views, especially in fall to see the fall colors"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is so nice and has a great character to it. Comfortably fit 7 people. Location is perfect for a weekend getaway for Corning and super close to the main street. The host, Frances, was extremely easily to contact and was VERY quick to respond. I recommend this place and would happily stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had everything we needed for a weekend away. Great neighborhood!!!

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Perfect for what we needed. Dodger is a sweetheart.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay, great location!!! Within walking distance to all that downtown Corning has to offer. Frances and Tom did an amazing job with the place! Super comfy and cozy. With the added bonus of an extremely friendly, beautiful dog, Dodger, to welcome you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great and unique place to stay, tons of history for sure.
lots of room for many guests if you need it, we had 3 of us here for work and more than accommodated us. the only issue to consider is there is only 1 bathroom however it had the fanciest Duvet I've ever seen or used, it had a heated seat and water temp controller and could aim it haha almost had me looking forward to using the restroom haha
overall a really cool experience and don't forget to be mindful of the parking rules per day!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay. Lots of space with everything you may need. Lots of games, tons of books, and the charms of the home. It's just a few minutes from Corning Glass Museum, as well as Rockwell museum. About 20 minutes from Watkins Glen State Park. We will definitely return."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This home was amazing! It was a perfect location, very friendly neighborhood and just a short walk from the downtown street. It even reminded us of our grandparents’ house! Frances was a wonderful host with great response time. We would stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Good location - not at all a bad walk down to the river and Market Street. Beware the hill on the way back; we found it a good idea to zigzag a bit! The kitchen was well supplied, and we cooked many dinners in - definitely check out Butchers Son at the Wegman's end of Market St. Being from the land of ranch houses and central air we had some trouble managing the summer temperature of the third floor. The beds are pretty soft so be aware if you need a firm mattress. The hosts we good about texting when they wanted to pick up the trash or wash towels and were very unobtrusive. The switching of parking from one side of the street every day was weird for us Southerners - we did see someone who got a ticket. At least in Watkins Glen it is sensibly limited to Nov-Mar!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will come back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in Corning. The suite is as described, quiet, very spacious, and stocked with all basic necessities. The location is a quick drive or 15/20 minute walk to the Gaffer District (with great restaurants) and the Corning Museum of Glass. Check in and communication were a breeze. The history of the home can’t be beat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful apartment, full of character and history. It was the perfect spot from which to explore Corning and the surrounding area, including a short 10-15 minute walk to the gaffer district with its appealing selection of restaurants and shops. Frances and Tom were wonderful hosts, with great communication and a wealth of information about the area and its history. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,What a great place for a party of 7 to explore on Memorial Day weekend! The house was perfect and the very organized with essentials for the stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Frances and Tom are wonderful hosts and the house is perfectly located on a quiet residential street, but only a quick few minutes walk to the main strip. We took advantage of local restaurants, museums, and did a quick drive up the mountain for some great hiking! The space itself is pretty big, with gorgeous views of the city and surrounding hills. For us, the history of the house was even more exciting! Finding about who built it and who lived there was very cool! We are certain you will have a lovely time if you choose to stay with Frances and Tom, we certainly will be doing so again in the future!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A delightful spot! The location is fantastic and this upstairs set up is really cute and well-setup. Would recommend any day!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Generous hosts with so much historical knowledge to share about the beautiful home and the area of NY. We travelled with another couple and the suite provided everything we needed for our stay, and was very comfortable. It is very convenient to the Finger Lakes, especially Seneca and Watkins Glen State Park, and close enough to also enjoy the splendors of Letchworth State Park. Thank you for a wonderful few days."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't recommend this place highly enough. Frances and Tom are wonderful hosts. Friendly, helpful, and quick to respond. The pictures don't do justice to the suite. Very roomy, super clean, thoughtfully appointed. Kitchen is fully equipped, coffee beans and grinder are also provided. Neighborhood is quiet and convenient to Corning attractions. Great jumping off place for a Finger Lakes vacation. We had a great time."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spacious apartment in Corning's historic Southside neighborhood is clean, comfortable, cosy and well-equipped. Easy check-in and good communication. We loved it!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Frances and Tom are great hosts and responsive. They addressed all our questions and issues very quickly. The house is conveniently located in downtown Corning.

The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and well stocked. We enjoyed our stay very much."

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Frances’ home was beautiful and in a v
scenic, quiet area. Very spacious and close to town. Had everything we needed to make coffee in the morning. We really enjoyed our cozy stay and all the little unique touches throughout the house. Just be forewarned that there is no smart TV but there is a DVD player and a selection of DVDs to choose from if you’re planning a movie night in the large living room area. The couches are super comfy!! Also the shower is on the small side but the heated toilet seat and bidet make up for that!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Real nice place to stay; the place is way bigger in person than what I thought it was. The place was nice and clean, stocked with everything we needed. My wife and I brought our 10 month son (more of a warning than anything) knowing we were going to be staying above their home and it didn’t seem to be a bother. Real close to Market Street in Corning and had any question already answered in the provided binder. Would highly recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at Frances' house! The space was a lot bigger than it appeared in the pictures, which allowed us to spread out. It was nice to stay in a quiet neighborhood that is still within a 15 minute walk to downtown. Note: this house is at the top of a long, steep hill; the Corning hills are not for the faint of heart! But we enjoyed the exercise. Frances and her family were incredibly kind, communicative, and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again next time we visit Corning."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful old house, with all the amenities that made it comfortable home for my family for a week. Absolutely wonderful stay, great hosts, perfect location. We could not have asked for more."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not sure what I found to be the neatest part of our stay, the extremely clean accommodations of a vintage house, or the serene neighborhood where people walking by cheerfully greeted you. This was a unique stay for my boys and I, who were intrigued by the old time feel of the rooms and house in general as well as how neat the area was. We liked the proximity of the center of town and all the neat restaurants and shops. Frances was super-communicative and quick to answer questions. In all, easily one of our best stays anywhere in all our travels."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,This home is packed with a lot of history and such a gem! The neighborhood is friendly and beautiful and there are many good places to eat nearby!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment- spacious, comfortable beds, great character, good coffee provided. Great stay."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place in the Corning area for larger groups
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"The place is wonderful. Historic and charming. Four great bedrooms, especially the round room. Cozy, clean - I would recommend this highly. It was central to everything we wanted to see, however, the hills are steep. My friends and I loved this aspect as we were looking for great exercise options. Restaurants in town are wonderful and so friendly!!! I loved Corning, New York!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"The apartment was clean and well equipped, with thoughtful touches. A binder with local tips was very helpful and Frances was very prompt with any questions we had."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well thought out and great for visitors!
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Ideally located and walkable, just blocks from lovely downtown shopping, eats, & grocery. It’s still a quiet retreat away from the activity. Hosts have put much thought in the space and eagerly share all that it offers. Spacious with all that you need (and didn’t think of!), we are happy to make a positive recommendation for this home-away-from-home. Thanks!"
2020-10-01,4,Group trip,Cute guest suite very close to everything in the town of Corning! We loved it
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"This charming, spacious, comfy and cozy suite is centrally located to the various Finger Lakes and a few minutes to downtown Corning. An extra option to order breakfast in was convenient and very good (opt for the home fries)! The hosts were very friendly and communication with them was quick and easy. The highlight of our stay was being greeted every day by Dodger (their very friendly and gentle furry friend)!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend Frances’s guest suite for a stay in idyllic Corning. Clean, organized, superb location. Just what we needed. Will definitely be staying here again."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our small group (three adults and an infant) had a great time exploring the Finger Lakes on a recent weeklong stay at this historic apartment in Corning. It’s a bit further driving out to the wineries and parks for hiking, but the spacious, comfortable and well-appointed apartment more than made up for it. The small town of Corning was also nice to explore in its own right - several solid dining options in the Gaffer district, a nice small farmers market on Thursday, and the local Wegmans has everything you could possibly need. And definitely check out the glass museum.
The apartment is the top floor of the historic house in which the family resides, but it’s a separate entrance and it all feels very private. We cooked several meals in the well-equipped kitchen and there were plenty of extra towels and toiletries available (plus some bottled water and snacks). Frances was very quick to respond and helped coordinate some special requests (regarding kitchen equipment and some infant care items). It is a third floor walk-up and larger groups should note the single bathroom, but we can’t but fully recommend this apartment. Thanks for hosting us, we would definitely stay again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Frances and Tom are both lovely, hospitable hosts. Their guest suite is a nice size and is very homey. They provided suggestions on what to do and restaurants to go to especially during this time and their place is very close to Market Street."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed all the amenities and amazing hospitality offered by Frances( the host). The attention to detail was astounding and even extended to the history of the house. Not to mention a private entrance that helped to prevent any awkwardness. Definitely five stars!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place was amazing, it far exceeded our expectations. We met Frances and Tom and they were so nice, friendly and caring. The place it’s big, it was 5 of us, we each had our own bed, it has many thoughtful touches. The kitchen is well equipped and the whole place is sparkling clean and spacious. Highly recommended."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were traveling with our 3 grandkids and this very spacious, separate, nicely appointed space was just perfect. It is in the top floor of a Victorian home on a quiet street yet close to downtown Corning and exhibits all the charming features of that era building. From the comfy couches in the living area and the nice sized table to the roomy bedrooms, each with its own particular charm (our granddaughter loved the circular room - she felt like a princess!) and very comfortable beds to the games, DVDs and foosball table we were well occupied. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with all the necessaries as well as thoughtful extras -- snacks and candy and toiletries. Our hostess was welcoming, responsive and informative.

2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is so impressive as well as the owner. She supplies every thing we need and very detailed instruction. This gives our whole family a good memory.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Prompt responses. A nice quaint little place. We went on one of the coldest day but the hosts and house were incredibly warm. Minutes away from corning. Nice view from the balcony.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is in a great downtown location. It's a steep walk down (and up) the hill to Market Street shopping and restaurants, but easily done for our group. The guest suite has many comfortable beds, but only one bathroom. (Very comfortable for 3-5 people.) The home is as you'd expect from a historic home, some uneven floors and such, but is very well kept, clean, and tastefully decorated. The kitchen is not eat-in; you have to carry your food to a table in the living room, but this is no big deal. Lots of instructions for operation and finding things, and the host is available for any questions . She even offered to pick us up from downtown, which we didn't need, but it was a very kind offer. Would definitely stay again."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax in Corning. Beds are very comfy. We stayed there in cold weather and we were all cozy and warm. A happy stay for our family. Thanks Frances.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a lovely house and the hosts were terrific.
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"This unit is a gorgeous space within a breath-taking historic mansion. There is plenty of space to accommodate a large group and the location is perfect, just a few blocks from Market St. and the Corning Museum of Glass, but set within a quiet neighborhood. The third floor walk-up is charming and warm, offering a cozy feel that may make it hard to even leave the house while on your trip!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Frances was a terrific hostess and her place was great! I would definitely go back and I recommend it highly. Her responses were quick and she was very helpful whenever I had a need or question. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen well stocked.

2018-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Place is enormous with plenty of space for our kids. Little warm without central ac, but fans help. Hosts were fantastic."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela’s apartment is exceptional in every way, and she is a welcoming host! Check-in was easy, and the snacks and water upon arrival were welcomed since we had a long day and didn’t have a chance to get to the grocery store until the next day. Beyond that, Angela’s apartment provided everything we would have expected and more. She doesn’t skimp on towels and bedding, and if anyone in your group is especially tall, they won’t have to duck to get under the shower head…it’s the little things. Angela even provides basic toiletries which was a nice touch. Her space was the perfect landing each day of our stay. We even made a fire in the ring late one afternoon. We chose her place because we were spending 2 days at Corning Glass Museum and 2 days hiking at Watkins Glen and Buttermilk Falls before continuing on to Niagara Falls at the end of our stay. I highly recommend Angela’s apartment if you plan to be in the Corning/Watkins Glen area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love the place! The design touches were really outstanding. So much thought for the guests. Maybe my fav air bnb I’ve stayed in. And I’ve stayed in a lot.
Beautiful modern design and very clean. Highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela and Joshua's place was the weekend getaway that went from a normal weekend getaway to unforgettable memories made! We were lucky as the Glassfest festival was happening in Corning and thanks to her recommendations on hiking, itinerary of the festival, and wineries, I was able to provide my wife the birthday weekend getaway that she'll never forget.
Angela and Joshua are one of those rare hosts that make you feel at home in their location any that you're part of the town you're visiting. We can't thank them enough for their generosity and communication to make us feel at home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Angela and Josh thought of everything! The place is gorgeous and so cozy. I loved staying here and will definitely book again next time I’m in Corning 🙂
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Angela’s place was a very pleasant and well thought out home away from home place to stay. Our daughter loved it so much she was ready to move in permanently. Very hospitable and great communication. Very close to Corning and all of the activities you can find there. Highly recommended and hope to stay here again if our adventures take us that way again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a wonderful gem in the area! Looks like it was right from an interior decorator magazine! Gorgeous and super comfortable. Every amenity you could think of and more. I wish we stayed longer!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friends and I absolutely loved staying at this cozy getaway right outside of town! Angela went over and above to make our stay comfortable by providing local recommendations, water and snacks! We had absolutely everything we needed to make our stay super comfortable including tea, coffee, all cookware, nice shampoo/conditioner etc. The decor was that perfect mix of modern/luxe/rustic that made us feel like we had stepped into a design magazine! We wished we had booked for longer than one night!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay - a cozy space that was perfect for us. It was neat and clean and beautifully decorated. We felt right at home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Angela’s place was like a high end boutique hotel in a private peaceful country setting.
Upon arrival I could tell this place was going to be above and beyond the pictures. It even smelled good from right outside the door.
Each and every space was well thought out to be welcoming and comfortable.
Planning to stay here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place! We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful stay at this charming Airbnb! The moment we walked in, we felt right at home. The interior was beautifully designed, with a warm and inviting atmosphere that made us feel cozy and relaxed. And the fireplace was the icing on the cake - there's something so special about curling up by the fire with a good book and a cup of hot tea. The perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We can't wait to come back and experience it all again! 5 stars isn't enough - we'd give it 10 if we could!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay at Angela’s place! The bed was honestly the most comfortable bed that I’ve ever slept in. The furniture was not only cozy, but gorgeous! The water pressure in the shower was also great! The amenities she provided were second to none. There was little to no wait time in responses from her either! We were very impressed and look forward to staying there again! We can’t recommend this spot enough!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Angi and Josh! We had a great girls’ night! Will highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Love staying here!! It’s such a beautiful space with everything necessary to feel cozy and at home! Angela is a sweetheart and we’re so glad we found this gem!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Angela is always an amazing host and I just love taking a little personal getaway to this cozy, inviting, hideaway. It’s always clean, comfy, and just what I need to rest & reset. Angela takes the time to check in that I have all that I need and to make sure the place is ready when I arrive. This is my 3rd stay and I can’t wait to book again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really really thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it's about the best use of space you could imagine! very close to all corning restaurants and museum!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in Corning, this is your place! Beautiful home, close to so many good restaurants, and all around beautiful.
Thank you!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, comfortable and cozy house, exactly as described by the hostess, who welcomed us and communicated very well. The location is just minutes from West Market Street. Recommends the stay and would come back other times."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable and clean place. Would definitely stay again in the spring or summer to enjoy the view and take advantage of the fire pit. The apartment had everything we needed and wanted.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Angela is a great communicator and the process with her spot is seamless. The loft is clean, cozy, and well decorated. We were just passing through but it would be a great home base for checking out the attractions in Corning. I really appreciate her allowing pets."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft is lovely - modern, bright and sparkling clean (probably the cleanest AirBnB I've ever encountered), with thoughtful little touches and attractive decor. Angela and Josh were attentive and very responsive hosts, and the keypad access couldn't be easier.
Although there is a large fridge, toaster, microwave and oven, it would be a challenge to cook more than an omelet given the available pots, pans, & bowls. However, there are a variety of nice restaurants in Corning and a big Wegman's in town where you can buy tasty ready-made dinners to eat at ""home."" It's a quick ten minutes into town, so great on location.
As of early April, most of the land surrounding The Loft has been dug up by large machinery. The trees were all pulled out and it's bare, torn-up land all around. If you're just interested in interiors, then two-thumbs for certain! If you wanted to sit on the little porch and enjoy nature, then not so much..."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Angela’s loft during our time in Corning. The space perfectly matched the photos and was spotless when we arrived. Angela was communicative and happy to share local recommendations. The space had everything we needed and the bed was very comfy. We would be happy to stay here again next time we’re in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute and cozy spot!! Angela and Joshua are quick to respond, kind and always helpful! Will continue to book in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a big WOW! It looks and feels like a designer space! It is immaculately clean with very careful attention to details and thoughtful touches, such as: two tv’s, a beautiful fireplace, a modern kitchen, a pristine bathroom with high end soaps and body wash included, beautiful outdoor spaces including a porch and a fire pit area with wood included. Every detail is carefully thought out. It is an excellent and efficient use of space with great ventilation and air flow with operable windows. The decor is impeccable! We felt right at home as soon as we arrived. We really appreciated the open communication and recommendations of local restaurants that deliver. The snacks you provided were kind and appreciated! This place is a definite 5/5! If I could give more, I would! We hope to return in the fall to enjoy the changing colours of the leaves. This space is a peaceful and private oasis that we didn’t want to leave! Thank you so much! We will be back!😊

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I needed a last-minute place to stay with my pup Oliver, & Angela was more than willing to accommodate us. The loft cottage was cozy, comfy, and private, which is great when traveling with a dog. The cottage was decorated, so you feel like you are at home. The furniture & bed were very comfortable, & the cottage comes with a variety of lighting options where you could make it bright for a workspace or quaint for relaxing. There are two flatscreens with many viewing options. I loved the wall fireplace insert that offered both heat and lighting colors for mood and ambiance. Angela provides everything you need in the kitchen and bath with quality products as well as a washer & drier if needed. I look forward to staying again & seeing how the yard renovations turn out. The location is great & only a few minutes from Market Street in Corning as well as a short drive to Watkins Glen. I was very happy with my experience as was my pup! :) Many thanks to Angela for getting us in last minute."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I needed a getaway.....to see his sister and family in Corning and to get away from our normal routine.
The space was wonderful! So much more than we expected. It is a small space, but yet spacious and comfortable and so welcoming. I loved that Angela had plenty of super warm blankets to use on the comfortable couches and the fireplace was amazing.
The bedroom was spacious, the bathroom cute and clean and the kitchen was great.
Every time we went out and then came back in, it felt like we were returning to a wonderful sanctuary away from home.
Also......Angela and Josh were great hosts. We had several questions when we were first settling in and every question was answered. Coffee pods were getting low so more were delivered to our door.
Beautifully designed and decorated. We loved it and are sure that others will too!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at this airbnb during out valentine's getaway in the finger lakes.

They were so friendly, welcoming, very responsive, and super accommodating. They made sure we knew we could reach out to them for anything.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was absolutely amazing! It was secluded and peaceful but still close enough to town that we didn't have to drive far. Angela was awesome and brought us something extra that we needed. Everything was beautiful and so clean!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was exactly as shown in photos- beautiful! Just a five minute drive to downtown Corning. I came to visit family in PA and do a college tour in Ithaca. We traveled 5 hours away and when we arrived the place was lit and we felt instantly comfortable - its a bit secluded and surrounded by woods. Stayed here with my two children and we all loved it. I will absolutely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This loft is so cozy, the pictures don’t do it justice. Well exceeded our exoectations. So clean with such cute decor. The bed is soft and comfortable.

The bed was absolutely comfortable, especially for Brent being 6""11. I brought my service dog & he was absolutely loved & spoiled with pets & love by Angie, Josh, and the neighbors!! It's all around a very comfortable & beautiful home!! There was a really good amount of storage space as well as different things to do inside of the house such as board games, puzzles, video games on TV in the living room, music, as well as snacks when we 1st checked in. Anytime we're in the Corning area, we will definitely stay here just about every time because we felt more comfortable & more like a family here than any hotel we could've stayed at!! Such a loving & cozy place to stay for sure 110% would recommend🥰😇"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Corning - my husband and I live in Ohio and my best friend and her husband live in Connecticut, so Corning has become the perfect halfway spot to meet up for a long weekend. Last time we stayed in a house that was less than a mile from Market Street, but staying in this unit right ON Market Street was so much nicer! Super easy to walk to shops and restaurants, and the apartment was a great hangout space. Will definitely keep this unit on our list for future visits!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this Airbnb was a delight! The apartment was even more beautiful than the photos, spacious and clean, making for a comfortable stay. Its prime location on West Market Street meant easy access to shops, restaurants, pubs, galleries, and museums. Highly recommended!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at many VRBO and Airbnb rentals but this one Kathryn really did a great job at making you feel at home. Getting in late and not able to go to the store. Kathryn had snacks and coffee pods available for your use. This was very generous of her, and a first at any place that I have ever stayed thank you very much. the Kingside bed was very comfortable and we loved the pool table also. Every restaurant or bar was great and loved walking to everything. We hope to return some day"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful property in the perfect location. Everything was great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was a perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway. It was beautiful inside and made you feel right at home. We loved how close it was to restaurants and shops. Would highly recommend this apartment!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathryn’s place is adorable! Very clean - the accommodations match the pictures and description perfectly. Kathryn was a great host - she was very friendly and always quick to respond. The unit is Walkable to everything you want to do in Corning. Highly recommend the Corning Glass Museum. Restaurants are all adorable with tasty food - Just beware that everything closes around 8pm. We also made a trip to Watkins Glen state park - that was absolutely gorgeous and well worth the 30 min drive. Stay with Kathryn and Have fun!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We echo all of the previous reviews of Kathryn's great place. It's a fantastic location in a lovely little town. Great restaurants and bars right outside your door, easy access to the Corning Glass Museum, and lots of fun day trips throughout the Finger Lakes region for hiking, wine tasting, or any number of festivals and farmer's markets. Highly recommended is the Glenn Curtiss Museum in Hammondsport if you enjoy the history of flying and motorcycles.
Parking was mildly confusing at first, but there's plenty of easy parking right behind the property in a city lot. You just have to remember to pay for weekdays between 9-5, but it's very affordable. Highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing space on a lovely street. We couldn't recommend enough!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location and apartment overall. Highly recommend. A super responsive host. A 5-star rating totally deserved
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing! The perfect place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Kathryn's place was just as described. It's in a great location and easily walkable to everything needed - from the Wegmans grocery store to the Corning Museum of Glass (CMOG) and many restaurants, shops, a farmers market (Thursday) and more. This place is more than spacious and sparkling clean. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathryn’s place was even more impressive than advertised! Spotlessly clean, perfect location right downtown, and spacious. There was plenty of room for our family and Kathryn was very helpful and responsive. I’d recommend this location to anyone visiting Corning, and we’ll definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great! It was so nice to be able to walk outside and go to restaurants and we were even able to walk to the grocery store (might be a far walk for some but close enough if you do want to walk). Apartment was super clean and we appreciated the snacks. Close to the glass museum and Watkins Glen.
Parking in the evenings and weekends is free in the back lot, which worked out perfectly for us as we arrived at 5 pm (when the fee for parking ends) on Friday night. The parking lot does get very busy after that, so walking around town is highly recommended to keep your spot.
The pool table was a nice touch and was a fun activity to wind down the night."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome loft space in perfect location. Super clean, beautiful space. Walk right outside to market street filled with bars, restaurants, and cute shops. Kathryn was nice very and communicative. We went to Watkins glen state park for the day and this was a perfect location to stay if you’re looking to do that, about a half hour away. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to visit Corning!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area for a funeral, and I’m not a fan of Hotels or Motels, so finding this Airbnb in the location we needed was wonderful. The place is exactly as described and is walking distance to many wonderful restaurants…we would love to go back someday!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time. Great place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! We got rained in on one of the days and between the hot tub and the pool table, Kathryn's place had enough to keep us occupied. Very beautiful space! Thank you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing space in the heart of Corning. Footsteps away from the best bars, restaurants, and mediums in the area. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! Perfect stay! Lovely well appointed loft apartment right in the middle of town! Walkable to the Corning Museum of Glass and so many other places! Loved it!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walkable downtown."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying at Kathryn’s! It was a great location - we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go (except the grocery store, which was just a quick drive away). The apartment was beautifully decorated and when we needed help checking in, Kathryn was quick to answer the phone and help. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathryn was very responsive in getting us our code for the door to enter. We were greeted with snacks that were very welcome after a long road trip. Location was right in the middle of town, many restaurants and and coffee shop half a block away, and coffee was provided for the Kurig machine for an easy morning cup. Apartment was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was well stocked with salon shampoo, conditioner and many clean towels. Washer and dryer were welcome as well. Parking was easy during Christmas holiday but was a bit more challenging as town came back online especially during peak times in the evening (5-7pm) though was always able to find a spot with some looking. Overall a wonderful spot, would be a great place to bring few friends to hang out for a weekend, pool table in the apartment and many walkable restaurants would make for a great spot."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathryn's apartment was great! It was even bigger than it looks in the pictures, and the location can't be beat. Would recommend to anyone!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really loved this place. Modern updates but old-school charm. Super clean, well maintained, and fully stocked. The kitchen is beautiful and functional, and the bed is cozy and comfy. The location is right in the heart of Market Street. Highly recommend."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I very much enjoyed the apartment and the location couldn't have been more perfect. You walk out the front door and you have an abundance of restaurant choices plus shopping. The location was perfect for side trips to both Watkins Glen State Park and Ithaca. Kathryn was easy to reach and answered all questions that we had.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was awesome! Would stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Kathryn's place is very spacious (bigger than it appears in the photos) and is very stylish. The air conditioning works very well. The location is extremely convenient. Be aware that the parking lot behind the unit costs about $6/day on weekdays. But you can avoid that by moving your car to a lot across the street during the day.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely apartment in a great location in central Corning.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is nice, great location. So many places to eat on the main road. Would stay again"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't imagine staying anywhere else when in Corning. This place was gorgeous and convenient. The pics don't do it justice. It's so spacious, yet cozy if that makes sense. Simplistic style made it relaxing. Pool table was fun. The walkability of this apartment was EVERYTHING. We walked everywhere including the glass museum. I wish I had booked another night so we could have explored more of the town. Parking was so convenient- apartment has a back entrance that goes right to the lot. When my kids had a food craving, we just walked next door to Mooneys. I will definitely book here again. Can't say enough great things about it."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Great location!!!! Within walking distance of several restaurants, shops and the glassworks factory museum. The town is wonderful. It is also an easy drive to the finger lakes. Thanks so much."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Check-in was seamless and the location is perfect. We stepped out onto Market Street and immediately felt like locals. The loft interior design is cool and we enjoyed the pool table that fit beautifully in the space. Plenty of fluffy white towels in the bathroom and we appreciated the double-sinks! Communication with the host was super easy and response time was immediate. We would definitely come back next time we're Corning. Thanks Kathryn!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great placr
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! VERY spacious and comfortable. The sectional and master bedroom are both very cozy. The kids loved the pull out mattresses! Kathryn is a great host and there were many thoughtful touches throughout (e.g., fresh flowers, snacks, coffee, professional shampoo/conditioner, etc.). There isn't much seating beyond the sofa, so make sure that works for you. Also, there is no microwave (which we could have used to heat up the awesome mac-n-cheese from Mooney's!), but the full size oven did the trick. Location is so convenient! Aniello's pizza and Dippity Do Dahs homemade ice cream are a definite must. :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had such a great stay here! Its truly a hidden gem. All the beds were so comfortable. Kathryn was a great host and answered very quickly when asked a question about parking. Such a convenient place and will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Kathryn’s place.
The apartment is located in the center of Corning, with many restaurants and bars close by.
The place is very clean, spacious and nicely designed and has almost everything you need.
We highly recommend it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kathryn’s place was amazing! It was very clean, comfortable, and gorgeous. Corning and the nearby lakes are beautiful this time of year. The Corning Museum of Glass is a must experience. Do not hesitate and visit today! We hope to be back soon. Thank you, Kathryn."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommended. For a price that was only a bit higher than getting a hotel, we had a much bigger and more beautiful residential space with the best of both words--right in the historic part of town with tons of shops, and an easy walk to the Corning Glassworks. Downtime was easy with entertainment easy to stream in master bedroom or common living area. This lofty space is welcoming and it is quality, there isn't that underlying blandness some rental spaces can have. The space was perfect for our family (our kids are older, 10 and 13, so we've long outgrown worries about stairs and ladders). Totally the right call."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was great, clean and close proximity to all restaurants/bars. We were at Watkins Glen the whole weekend and only used the apartment for sleeping.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this place for a birthday weekend getaway and I honestly couldn't have more amazing things to say! The space was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. It was in the heart of downtown, within walking distance of EVERYTHING I had planned that weekend:) Kathryn was so kind and easy to get ahold of, we had some issues getting back in our first night after dinner, and she answered right away and was able to come and meet us immediately.

The place is just as I remembered, clean, bright, and stocked with everything you need. It is an easy walk to the glass museum and just a few more minutes to downtown!
Only drawback this time was we had very noisy upstairs renters this time around. Not anyone’s fault. Between kids crying and dogs barking and then the adults yelling over everyone it wasn’t as peaceful this time around. Again not anyone else’s fault, and won’t deter me from renting this place again and again!!
Thanks for another wonderful stay!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Short but sweet visit! Don had everything set up for us when we arrived. Parking and access was a breeze. Place was comfortable and clean. We requested use of the high chair and he included an adorable stuffed animal for my daughter to sit with while she had her breakfast. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space for three adults and baby. Location can't be beat. If we'd been there longer I think a walk to the Gaffer District would have been perfect. Corning is a cute area and I hope we'll be back!

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was very nice. We enjoyed our stay
It was clean but not as immaculate as other reviewers mentioned. There are some stained towels that should be replaced. . The unit smelled of a
strong cleaning product and there was a lot of soap residue on the floor and surfaces which caused them to be sticky. The owner offered to send his cleaning crew in to fix it but they didn’t have Masks and he doesn’t provide
them with any so we declined his offer and cleaned up the best we could. The kitchen has a full size refrigerator and stove. There is a bunch of mismatched plates and glasses and silverware much of which is heavily tarnished. We stayed August 2022 and there was extensive street construction which started every week day at about 7:15am. The beeping and drilling etc woke us. Overall a very nice but not exceptional stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice Airbnb. Exactly as advertised. Very neat and clean and lots of small touches to make the stay comfortable. Three minute drive to the Corning Glass Museum. Great for a couple or for a family with two kids who don’t mind sharing a bed. (The couch could also be made as a bed) Kitchen is well stocked and bathroom is newer. Host is great and communicative. If you like the ad, you’ll like the place. I would stay here again for sure."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute place, very clean and comfortable, nice kitchen and comfy beds, perfect for 2 adults and 2 teens. Just spent 1 night passing through, had a too-short visit at the glass museum. Would have been happy to stay longer and take advantage of the nice backyard
and fire pit. If anyone in your party has any tendency to trip, they should probably not stay in the fireplace room as the floor is a little uneven near the fireplace."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was great, Don was communicative and reactive. It is very comfortable with a lot of amenities."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don’s house was a wonderful place to stay. It was extremely clean and comfortable. It came with just about everything you would possibly need. The location couldn’t be better if you want to visit the Corning Glass Museum and downtown Corning. Everything is within a 5-10 minute walk.
Don contacted us the day before letting us know that something had broken but he made immediate accommodations and came in to fix it as soon as possible. Don, himself, is a great guy. Someone I would like to have as a neighbor. He recommended a few places for us to visit and see in our brief stay.
If you are considering visiting Corning I would definitely check and see if Don’s house is available."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,My wife and kids and I really enjoyed exploring Corning from Don’s place. It’s located close to everything and a good value. Don was also extremely responsive when we reached out to him - he’s a great host.

Overall I highly recommend and would absolutely stay here again.

It was less than a 10-minute walk from the museum. The house was spacious, very nicely renovated and furnished, in excellent condition, with lovely bed linens and towels. We didn't use the outdoor area because of the weather, but the back yard with picnic table seemed very nice. There was some minor noise from the upstairs guests walking around at night, but that can't be helped in older houses.
Don was a great communicator, answering texts and emails very quickly."

The house is lovely, super clean and really nicely decorated. Both bedrooms were comfy and inviting, the kitchen fully furnished, the bathroom large and comfortable. Don adds a ton of great amenities from toiletries to smart tvs and an Alexa speaker in the hallway, and having a washer and dryer was also very nice. Adjacent parking behind the house or in the street.
Check in/out and communication: electronic lock codes sent the day before, Don was very responsive by email and regularly checked in with us to make sure all is well.
location: The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe, a 3 minutes walk to the glass museum and also really close to central market street with restaurants and some shopping, a large Wegmans is also near by if you feel like grocery shopping and cooking.

It was very clean and the thoughtful amenities that were there to use - were perfect - not often found all AirBnbs. Don was wonderful with communication and we would recommend The Cellar - a restarting in walking distance!
You do not need to hesitate to book this place- you’ll love it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s place is fantastic! We stayed with another couple, had ample room, a comfortable place to lay our head at night and were down the street from some of the best bbq we’ve had.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best AirBnb stays I have ever had. Everything combined for a lovely stay for our daughters college
Graduation fromElmira College. If I could give ten stars I would. The space is terrific, the beds and pillows comfy, and attention to details like shampoo, plush towels and organic coffee K cups plus smart switches and TVs I. Three areas ensuring elimination of any viewing arguments!!!! The location is quiet and lovely, but. Lose to
Everything! We even did an afternoon of wineries! Even though our daughter has graduated I love the area and am a runner and may come back for the wineglass marathon, even though I have already done it once. Don was a very attentive host who made sure our stay was seamless. Fabulous communicator and great digs. Highly recommend! Thank yiu!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were happy to be within a 5 minute walk from the Corning Museum of Glass, which was the focus of our trip to Corning. Bonus was that the town itself is small enough that we could easily walk to the Gaffer District for dinners and some gift shop/antique browsing for the two nights that we stayed.
The apartment itself was very clean, bright, relaxing and spacious. It fit our needs as a family of four very well. TVs in both bedrooms, and the living room let everyone choose their watching pleasure. Lots of good natural light. The kitchen was functional for breakfasts/lunch prep, but we ate our other meals out. We did not use the washer, but were happy to have a dryer for our jeans & jackets after we got caught in a downpour. Altogether, a great stay!"

We had two couples (4 ppl total) stay for a long weekend and we had everything we needed!
I was especially impressed by how immaculate the home was upon arrival. This should be a given but Don goes above and beyond. Everything was spotless and linens and towels smelled fresh. The additional little touches he added (items to accompany the coffee bar, Brita full with fresh water in the fridge, lovely scented soaps, and cleaning products) were so thoughtful and appreciated.
Parking was easy and clearly communicated re: street parking as we had two vehicles in our party.
Don was an excellent host; offering a link to his detailed guidebook with fantastic recommendations for food and activities. We tried several of his restaurant and bakery/coffee suggestions, which did not disappoint. We spent a few hours at the Museum of Glass (a must experience!) and hiked local Watkins Glen. Don was extremely friendly and responsive; ready to help as needed.
If you find yourself considering a visit to Corning; stay at Don’s! It was truly lovely; and a real gem in the area. We look forward to a return trip."

All communication was very clear and efficient, and the apartment is lovely.

He also has a great guide to area restaurants. We had an enjoyable and comfortable stay!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Why get a hotel room when you can get a private apartment on a tree-lived street with two big bedrooms, three TV’s, a huge bath, a full kitchen and laundry, and plenty of living space?
Don’s place is bright and cheerful and spotlessly clean, and everything there - mattresses, sheets, pillows, lighting, security, towels, shower head, even toilet tissue - is the highest quality. There are lots of thoughtful touches throughout the home.
The Corning Museum of Glass, a great wine shop, a brewery, and several restaurants are within a few blocks, and right across a charming bridge is a full grocery store, plus shops, taverns, and more restaurants. Don provides lots of information about local things to do, and is always available if you have questions.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m almost tempted to downgrade my rating so as to be assured availability the next time I come... but that would be unfair to Don, who was just amazing!
From the moment we entered the outside hallway, we noticed how wonderfully the place smelled.
The apartment is lovely, stylish, with considerate and cool touches everywhere. I kept photographing different rooms to get decorating tips to incorporate back home.
Everything was immaculately clean, always important, but never more so than now.
Don checked in on us regularly to see how we were faring, and gave suggestions how to improve our experience.
The apartment was perfectly located, easy to get to everywhere we wanted. Close to the highway, but quiet And peaceful. We loved coming back to it at the end of each eventful day.
I could go on and on, but I’ll stop here. All I can say is that I’m already planning my next visit. And the one after that."

Also a block away from local micro-brewery that was the highlight of the trip.
Don was extremely kind and responsive. He provided some great recommendations for food in the area. The welcome/check-in was seamless and the house was the was charming and chic. Modern and spacious with great comfortable furniture, well equipped kitchen and touches of technology that really made the stay easier!
Everything was extremely clean and there was a feeling of comfort as soon as we walked in the door. Parking was a breeze.

There’s a nice porch to sit and relax on. Parking spot available in the back is great but street parking is really easy there too. Museums are walking distance as is the historic downtown.

We also enjoyed sitting on the front porch, taking walks and visiting with neighbors.
Don was attentive to our needs and more than willing to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I have high regard for good communication and Don was an excellent communicator and followed through quickly when a question was asked or a request was made.
We will definitely make Don's place our first choice for future stays!"

2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Don is an excellent host! The apartment was extremely clean and contains every basic living item that a family would need. I especially appreciate the fast reply when I messaged him. We liked the decoration so much that we took photos for the main bedroom. I highly recommend Don’s place when you visit Corning. It’s located minutes away from downtown and glass museum but still a quiet neighborhood.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Mike’s. It’s very cozy and well thought out. However, we didn’t realize the parking was on street and there were more stairs than I realized. It’s getting hot and Mike was thoughtful to have the place cooked when we got there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very relaxing place to stay. It's very close to the Gaffer District in Corning.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was cute and comfortable! Everything was quite clean and neat. The bathroom is on the small side, but has everything we needed and was clean.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious. Great value for the money."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay....Mike worked with us on late check out. convenient location to the things we wanted to do in the area. We were only in the room to sleep, so didn't require a lot of space. A washing machine would have been nice to have, otherwise, it was great."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a lovely little place for my friend and I! It was super close to market street so we were able to walk there easily. It felt private enough where we had our own space as well. The place itself is so cute and cozy, a perfect place for a trip with a couple of people. It was so affordable especially for the high quality it provides. I would absolutely come here again if I was to visit Corning once more."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean and spacious apartment, perfect to use as a base to explore Corning and the Finger Lakes."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mike’s place was awesome. We walked all over the neighborhoods and to town. It felt private, clean, and accurately described. Great price for place. We would definitely stay here again."

The apartment is adorable - it was ideally located, cosy, and had everything we needed.
We enjoyed the Museum of Glass and dinner at Sorge’s in the district. The time flew by. We definitely plan to come back again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would happily go back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot for our stopover. Shower is great. Kitchen is sparkling clean. Appreciated the lack of scented products used to clean the linens and the apartment as we're extremely sensitive to perfumes and tobacco.
Bed was comfortable and we really liked the available extra blankets.
We'd come back here next time we're in the area and happily stay at Mike's."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Mike’s place was as exactly as listed. Exactly what we needed for our short stay. Would definitely stay again!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was the perfect place to unwind and relax after exploring Market Street and the Gaffer District all afternoon. Had it not been a little windy and rainy it would have been the perfect short walk to and from the apartment to the action of downtown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy check-in and instructions. The apartment was exactly as pictured. We were welcomed by a nice warm apartment, that was clean. The linens were obviously freshly laundered, something I find you don’t always get at other Air BnB locations. Anything we could have needed was provided, as well as a binder full of local suggestions and instructions for parking, etc to help our stay. One minor draw back for me was the outside path did not have a handrail and there were steps leading to the home. I have limited mobility in one leg, so that is something to keep in mind. When I stay here I again, I will bring my cane to assist the walk. But definitely not enough of a drawback to effect a five star rating or recommendation for others to choose this location. Our host was very responsive with questions and our stay quite comfortable. We would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a must-stay! If you want to escape for a weekend, it is a cute, quiet, and private location. The place was in amazing condition, very quiet, and very clean. I recommend this to other travelers who may come into the area. I would stay here again! :)"

If you’re thinking of visiting Corning, stay here! Walking distance to market street & perfect location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mike’s place was perfect for our overnight stay in Corning. A few minutes drive to Market Street, the rental was in a great location. I was concerned about the parking, but it was very easy and there was plenty of room for our vehicle right outside. The space was clean and the neighbor was very quiet. We would stay again."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"House is close to restaurants and bars, the room looks like the description. Its not a big place but it has everything.
But the host was not fast in responding. I sent a message in the morning and only got message back in the evening. And the message did not answer my questions so I had to ask again.
The AC was very loud. My friend was a light sleeper and couldnt sleep well because how loud it was.
Overall, if you just want a night to sleep, this is not a bad deal."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with an easy check in. Everything was easy and comfortable!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location and walking to soulful cup every morning! Thanks guys! Perfect place for a small town stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice stay. Centrally located. Would stay there again. Make sure to check the house manual instructions regarding parking. It is not too much of a hike up the hill, through the door into the back porch, and up the stairs. Good value."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great! Very clean and accurate description. Pretty well stocked in terms of pots/pans/kitchen things. Very quite neighborhood but was a 5 minute drive to the downtown. Parking was a little confusing (it’s all described in an info binder) but we didn’t seem to have any trouble. Info binder has everything we needed to know about stuff round the place and even had lots of local recommendations (we enjoyed Rico’s pizza and Poppleton bakery while we were there). Mike, the host, was very friendly and communicated clearly. Many of our activities got rained out so we’re hoping to make another trip and we will definitely book this place again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our place was cozy and clean. It was within walking distance of downtown, though uphill the last block returning home. We had all the amenities and we both found the bed very comfortable.
The Corning Museum of Glass was even more interesting than we expected and downtown had a variety of shops and restaurants, including 2 yarn shops.( I'm a knitter). There was a market downtown on Thursday.
We thought our time in Corning was well spent and our accommodations were a good value."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great option for a beautiful autumn weekend. Good size for two people. In a cute residential neighborhood, very close to the Gaffer District and glass museum. The apartment was clean and well stocked, with nice attention to detail in the bathroom and kitchen. Mike was very responsive. Thanks for a cozy stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike’s place was just as listed. Enjoyed my stay. Had a few minor issues that Mike took care of, very kind and responsive. You do have to climb up a steepish hill to get to apartment so be aware if you have any stability or walking issues."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for the Wineglass Race weekend and really enjoyed Mikes place. Easy walk to town, nice neighborhood and close to plenty of food options. Definitely a convenient location for us.
Make sure you read the book as the city’s first parking rules are a bit different for upstate NY. 😬 Thanks again Mike!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike’s place is very walkable to Restaurants and shops if you don’t mind steep hills and only a quick 10 minute walk. Also, you have to carry luggage up a small slope and a few outside steps to get to the inside so might not be good for folks with mobility issues. Mike has alot of kitchen items which were nice as well and he is a very responsive host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect little place to stay the night at Corning. It had all the basic amenities, clean, and close to the street with all the cool restaurants, bars, and shops! The only thing I would prepare people for is the hilly roads you may have to walk on if you plan on walking from the market street to the Airbnb. It was a workout but it was still fun! Also, the glass museum is a must see!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely, quiet, comfortable place to stay in Corning. Very easy access, had everything I needed, was very clean and pleasant. I’d love to come back and visit again. Highly recommend!"

I have stayed for 2 weeks at Mike’s!
Mike’s place was really cozy ! Comfortable , on a quite neighborhood and close to all you need !
I had a rental car what made it easier to reach supermarkets and school.
The place is exactly as announced , all you need is available !
Mike was always available and responding very fast to any question or doubt !
I would surely return !"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found Mike’s place to be cozy, comfortable, clean and convenient. Very walkable to restaurants, etc. on Market St. and the Corning Museum of Glass. Mike’s communications were really clear and check-in was easy."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and comfortable this place is in easy walking distance from Corning's charming downtown and the Glass Museum. So many important details are attended to such as a nightlight in the bathroom, a cutting board and pots and pans with matching lids. An easy spot to have a great get-away."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place provided a clean, cozy, quiet, comfy haven for my boyfriend and me as we explored Corning and nearby Ithaca. This little apartment is very centrally located - I was able to get to great locations such as the Soul Full Cup in a less than 10 minute walk and within only a few minutes driving. The amenities are excellent and as described. Would highly recommend this option if you want a full apartment experience while checking out this area of NY."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy apartment is a gem!!! It is in a great location, ""on the hill"" in Corning, which is a great part of town. Safe, within walking distance of Market Street shops and restaurants (downhill on the way to town, uphill on the way back so be advised of that). If you don't mind getting some exercise it is within walking distance of the Corning Glass museum and other downtown attractions. Very cozy and clean place, well-appointed kitchen and nice amenities included. Very welcoming. We loved it and look forward to returning!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy access, quite , very clean place ."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed July 11-16.This quiet, residential, 2nd-floor AirBnB is located an easy 15-20 min walk via the Centerway bridge to the Corning Museum, maybe a 5-min walk to the Gaffer District, and 5-min drive to the Wegman's grocery store. I also used this AirBnB as my base to go visit the Gorge Trail - Watkins Glen and Keuka Outlet Trail.
The weather was hot and humid so I really appreciated the window ACs in the bedroom as well as the livingroom, which has also a ceiling fan.
As a solo traveler, I did not go out to restaurants. Rather, I used the well-lit and functional kitchen for my meals. I used the gas cook-top, microwave, and fridge - no real issues. (Did not use the toaster.)
Comfy bed. I always travel with my own pillow but the pillows looked good. The room has a side-table lamp and a ceiling light. I would like a less bright lamp bulb as I am winding down my day - but that is just my personal style.
Shower head gives a great spray & do not have to wait long for the hot water."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"a new favorite if i am in the Corning area...exactly as described...spanking clean, quiet, nice layout, great linens with no chemical scents or deodorizers...perfect for my one night stay during a long drive...will definitely book again in the future and highly recommend"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really appreciated working with Mike to stay at his place! Quiet, close to downtown, very clean, and he was flexible with check in time so I could make some commitments while in town.
If I ever come through Corning again I would not hesitate to book again. Thank you, Mike!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying at the apartment. Perfect little place to stay and a great walking distance to downtown Corning.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Mike has a convenient location and was amenable to hosting our cat so we enjoyed our stay because of that. The building is in poor condition but the accommodations were fine. W appreciated him moving our check in time up to 1PM from 3PM.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! Quick walk to the main street in Corning - but the street definitely goes uphill!
I really enjoyed Mike's place - it was upstairs, nice living room, kitchen and bedroom. bathroom is small but has very good storage space. Great WiFi as well.
I was here for work and only stayed one night, next time I'll stay longer!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"A very cute apartment close to the downtown businesses in Corning. Happy that we could stay one night, as we were on the road from VT to OH. The bed was very comfy!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was just a short layover on my back to Ohio but after arriving, I wish I was there for much longer.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy place, small but perfect for what we needed. We were only there for one night. It was as described. Mike was very quick to respond to any questions and gave recommendations for places to grab dinner. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was just perfect for our overnight in Corning. Unfortunately we arrived late but my husband took the time in the morning to walk to the cafe for coffee while I worked. Window AC cooled the place nicely. Very comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mike was a great host. House was perfect and had everything we needed and more. Will be back!
Thanks Mike!
Also glass fest happened to be going on the weekend we went and it was awesome.
Check out forge cellars 45 minutes away in Burdett, fantastic wine!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cozy apartment is located within walking distance of Corning’s Market Street area that has numerous shops and restaurants. We enjoyed a great meal at Slamming Jammin Bar-b-cue. We like Bar-b-cue a lot and this is some of the best we’ve ever had. It was moist and flavorful and portions were very generous. Mike pointed us toward this are when we inquired about general recommendations for restaurants and said it offered many good options. He was right! It is also close to the Corning Glass Museum and only a 20 minute drive from Watkins Glen which was our destination for Sunday.
Everything in the apartment was clean and comfortable. We were a little concerned when we noticed there was no onsite parking available but there is plenty of street parking ad vacant parking lot across the street that has no posted restrictions so we needn’t have worried about that at all!
Thanks Mike for sharing this great little place, we’ d definitely keep in mind for future visits in this area."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"If your interested in the historic district, the location of Mike’s upstairs apartment is for you. Compact, comfortable and convenient. Good communication and easy self check in."

2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Overall had a great stay and time in Corning, this place was cozy and intimate. Spring came early in New York this year and no AC was set up in the apartment and got as high as 84°. Mike was very helpful and offered to come put in units into the windows though."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little apartment about a 7-10min walk to market street. Very easy to find and has its own private entrance at the back of the house. Room was clean and welcoming.. absolutely everything you would need/want for a trip to the lovely town of Corning. I loved being able to walk to the center of town where the bars and restaurants are and the surrounding neighborhood is friendly and beautiful. I was taking a class at Corning glass so it was maybe a 5 min drive to the studio’s which made the morning commute very easy. I highly recommend this apartment because it really did have it all. Thank you Mike!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Corning location within walking distance to Market St. Also nice to walk in the neighborhood on the hillside with all the historic homes. The place is small but not cramped and perfect for two. Nice living and work space and separate bedroom and bathroom with doors. A great value in the Corning area!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike is a great host and the only one I go to when I visit Corning!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came down from Rochester NY looking for a possible place to retire to and needed a place to stay while checking out the various neighborhoods. This place worked out really well for us. It wasn’t very expensive, but was well kept up and satisfied all our needs. Very comfortable and quiet. It has all the amenities you would find at a 5 star hotel suite (TV, sink, stove, microwave, full size refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee), but at a much lower cost. There is also a door to the bedroom so you can still use the main room while someone is trying to sleep. Ok, so maybe the TV screen is a little smaller than you might find at the Hilton, but who cares? How many hotel suites include a gas stove with oven? Worked out perfectly for us. Mike was a responsive host and the check-in / check-out process was seamless."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cute place and the hosts go out of their way to make you feel welcome. It's well-maintained, easy walking distance to town, and has everything you need."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"With a quick overnight in Corning for a concert I couldn’t have asked for a better accommodation than Mike’s place. Minutes from Market St with all the stores and restaurants and likely walkable in the summer.
Comfortable space with cute furniture and decorations. Mike was a kind host and very responsive. Great price for the space and location!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at Mikes's place. The apartment is walkable to the main street and has a lot nearby. It was exactly as described as in the listing.

We got our check out date confused and missed our check out time,he was understanding and flexible which we really appreciated. I'd happily stay with him again. It's just a short jaunt into downtown Corning, and the Gaffer District has lots of cute shops and great restaurants. We loved it!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about Mike's air bnb. It was so quaint and cozy. It was so peaceful, too, and the bed was so comfy. Mike's was very attentive to keeping the sidewalks clear of snow and ice."

It feels like Mike and Linda really want your stay to be as good as it can possibly get. We’ve been travelling for a few days and stayed here for one night as we were passing by, and thanks to the very comfortable bed we got the best sleep this far on our trip.
Make sure to read the welcome binder, as there is important information about street parking in there (and also other good info!)."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. It was a great ‘home base’ while we were in Corning.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"well cared for apartment, and everything looked almost brand new. Short walk to downtown (steep hill on the way back up!). Good value compared to hotel options.
In the interests of transparency, i have to mention that unfortunately we didn't have a good check in experience and had to contact airbnb to contact the host (after failing to contact him ourselves). But looking at all of the hosts other extremely positive reviews, I should imagine that this was a ""one off"".
Ultimately, would be happy to recommend"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here with our dog for 2 nights while we hiked around the area. This cozy little apartment feels more like a home than apartment. The entrance was a little hard to find (it’s around the back) but it has a great location near the main street and museum without being noisy at all. The place is clean and bright, with thoughtful touches throughout. Bed was comfortable, the A/C works well, and the shower has great water pressure. Lots of towels etc. Great communication with the hosts as well. We were so happy to have experienced this place - great value for money."

It was super clean and tidy and it felt like I was right at home. Upon opening the door you can already tell that it was freshly cleaned right before your arrival. There's even a desk setup in the event you needed to work. Lots of warm touches that make you feel welcome and wish you were able to spend more time there. It feels like home away from home. Check-in and out was very easy and Mike is quick to respond. If I come back to the area I'll be booking here again for sure! Thanks so much!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The AirBnB was very clean and comfortable. The rooms were spacious. We were only a few blocks (1/2 mile or so) from Corning Museum of Glass, the Gaffer District and a grocery store. We enjoyed walking into town for dinner.

Only issue was we could hear some people shouting from the street quite clearly in the house during the night and some knocking on the walls probably from a homeless person which gave us a slight fright. Discussed with host and it was attributable to proximity to downtown.
Overall satisfied with our stay."

2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Mike’s was a good show pace to sleep and break up our drive home
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Good budget-friendly choice for Corning. Mike was super responsive.
Pros: Walking distance from the Museum of Glass. Cornell restaurants and shopping are across the river, about a 4-minute drive. Clean and spacious. Well-equipped kitchen, full-size fridge, comfy beds.
Cons: HVAC system is noisy. You notice when it goes on. 2-hour parking right in front. You need to find a spot around the corner for overnight. Bathroom feels a bit dated, but good water pressure. Building is shared, so you occasionally hear muffled voices from next door."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Mike’s quirky apartment while exploring the area. The apartment front looks like a business, but when you enter it’s really cute. There are a couple odd steps in the unit, just an inch or two, but enough to trip you up in the dark middle of the night.
A storm hit while I was there and a window leaked. Mike responded immediately when I messaged him.
If I’m in the area again, I’d definitely stay again. Thanks Mike!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Mike’s place. It was perfect for us. The glass museum was within walking distance and so were great restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay

When we decided to stop there on our way back ( because it was amazing and we had made some glass items we had to pick up) we contacted Mike. He was kind enough to immediately block the date for us so we could spend another night at his amazing place. So perfect! He was a great host and the place is a great value. You won’t do any better in the area. Thank you Mike!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was just a quick overnight from Ohio to Upstate NY so unfortunately no time to visit the local restaurants, museums etc. but the location of this apartment would be perfect for that. I can say that arriving after 10 PM was not a concern at all because the lighting was outstanding making lockbox access and entry very safe.
I was traveling with my dogs and found the neighborhood to be extremally walkable and very safe as well with schools and churches in close proximity.
The interior of the apartment is just as described and I definitely appreciated Mike providing the makings for morning coffee. The apartment is tastefully decorated and would be a great home base for exploring the area. I will definitely add this apartment to my repeat stays list."

Super clean, quiet/walkable location, nice hot shower, speedy Wi-Fi, firm bed, plentiful coffee, and tasty Lindt chocolates(much appreciated!).

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I said this in a previous review of another Airbnb hosted by Mike in Corning, but the location of these places is just fantastic.

We would very happily stay in either one again, and hope to do so. Clean, comfortable, great price."

We didn’t meet Mike in person, but he was very responsive to messages through the AirBnB app.
The apartment itself has everything you might need, though we didn’t make much use of the kitchen.
Note that the windows in the living room let in light but aren’t transparent and don’t open to let fresh air in. However the window air conditioner in the bedroom and the floor unit in the living room kept things comfortable.
It was a good place to stay for our short visit to the Southern Tier & Finger Lakes region of NY. Thank you Mike!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect location for our night's stay as we had come to visit Corning's famous museums.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Convenient location, near the Corning Museum of glass and a short walk across the bridge to restaurants and shops.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Mike's place only for one night, as a halfway stop on our road trip to Toronto, and had a very nice experience. Mike sent us clear instructions, so self check in was easy. The apartment is clean, neat, and has all the necessities; its location is perfect for a pleasant walk across the river to the historic downtown, and of course, for the famous Museum of Glass. We felt comfortable and rested at Mike's place, and can definitely recommend it to solo travelers and couples."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location for a visit to Corning. Right in the historic centre of town surrounded by many restaurant choices, walkable to museums and shops. The loft was impeccably clean and cozy, artistically decorated and many thoughtful amenities provided that made us feel so welcome. Neighborhood was quiet during the evening and safe to walk around. Unique and memorable place to stay as a couple."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mallory is wonderful. Very responsive and helpful. Her place is just as it looks …loved it!! Electronic keypad for easy access. Great hosting book loaded with all type of activity, shopping and restaurant recommendations. The lication could not be better with access to plenty of shoppes and eateries within feet. Their has been comments about the bar across the way but it did not bother us a bit. We brought earplugs did not need them. The town had such beautiful architectural buildings!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful apartment in downtown Corning. Well decorated, comfy and stocked with all you could need. Will definitely be suggesting Mallory’s place to friends / family. 5 out of 5!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for 2 nights in April and the place was fantastic! Loved the rustic and colorful styling of Mallory’s place. It was very clean, easy to get to, had everything we needed for a couple with a dog. Mallory is a great communicator and was very helpful to make sure our stay was great. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This super cute apartment was easy to access, and very conveniently located. It looked just like the photos. It was very walkable, lots of little shops and restaurants. We ate at 3 restaurants nearby, each a 5-10 minute walk. The Corning Museum of Glass was a 15 minute walk or less than 5 minutes to drive.
Mallory was easily accessible with good communication.
Parking was a bit confusing at first. Read the signs and look at Mallory’s instructions. We parked overnight in the public lot just around the corner.
We were there on a weekend and there was some late night noises from people going home from the local bars, I am a light sleeper so wore ear plugs and couldn’t hear it after that. This was the perfect place to stay for our visit. 5 star accommodations!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cute, clean and in the perfect location! Loved it!! 🥰"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The apartment was in a great location, clean, and cute! There were very thoughtful touches like a welcome gift and book that showcased the local area. When I travel I can be particular about water pressure, and it was great!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great hotel alternative in Corning! I highly recommend. Immaculately clean, great location, bright and sunny, high-quality sheets and towels. The candle gift at check-in was a nice touch. The evenings were a little noisy due to the location on Market Street where there are lots of bars and restaurants, but that is to be expected in this location. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Responsive host and cozy atmosphere. We would absolutely stay here again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mallory is the ideal host. Since booking the Airbnb she has been more than helpful. During the stay she was just as helpful. The loft is beautiful and spacious. It has all of amenities you could need while staying away at home. The town is so cute. Tons of amazing restaurants and things to do around. Mallory was so nice to have a binder filled with these places and activities ready for us. OH! Let me mention how amazing it was that it was dog friendly! That can be hard and usually very expensive to find when wanting to travel around. Overall it was an amazing experience, we had a great time. We can’t stop telling our friends/family about Mallory and her wonderful loft. Thank you again, maybe one day we will get to stay again. :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great. The fenced in area worked pretty well, however you had to go out the house then into the gated backyard. It worked, just not as convenient as a door from the house to the fenced area. Still it was a nice tiny house."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was perfect. Cindy was very responsive and helpful.
beautiful tiny home"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just as described, this ‘tiny’ house was perfect for our family’s quick spring break getaway to check out the Museum of Glass. While it is might be on the smaller side, this house had plenty of space for our family of 4 and 2 dogs. The fenced in yard was great too. Cindy had everything we could need on hand for a comfortable and easy stay. Everything in the area was so accessible and centrally located to Cindy’s house. We will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great visit. This was our third stay at Cindy’s and would stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What was billed as a Tiny House” exceeded our expectations in a big way as there was plenty of room to stretch out, put our feet up and feel right at home. Kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots and pans, dishes, cups and glasses, an assortment of coffees and creamers and there was an abundance of fresh linens and towels. The location was great, close to everything we wanted to visit. Hosts were gracious, quick to respond and provided info to access the property with ease. Everything was squeaky clean! We will be back for sure."

She also responded very promptly after we left to help find an item we thought had been left behind!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s place was perfect for our short stay in Corning. We visited the glass museum and the local breweries and it was the perfect place to relax after a long day.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"lovely place . My friend and I even had a discussion if we should also purchase houses like this there , lol. My dog loves the place too . It has a very decent backyard. Perfect location if you plan to visit Corning or on your way to Niagara Falls .
Oh, also, the owner is super responsive , even during the late night . I could not find the hairdryer at first and the owner just ordered a late night Instacart delivery and sent a new one . We actually found the hairdryer later in the main room, but still, super appreciate the quick action the owner took ."

Easy drive to the Finger Lakes and local attractions! Would highly recommend!!!
We hope to visit again soon! Thank you Cindy for your wonderful accommodations!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nestled inside a quiet neighborhood in the middle of Corning, NY, the place is ideal for visiting the nearby Finger Lakes region (about 20-30 mins. drive) and of course, Corning itself. Ideal for couples with dogs, who can enjoy the large fenced backyard."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This “tiny house” is larger than it looks. The house provides a very private, clean, and comfortable stay in a nice neighborhood. The location is perfect for touring wineries, Finger Lakes, and local museums. All of the expected amenities were perfect. Cindy is an incredible host. We will book this place again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at Cindy's place. it was a great base for a few days allowing us to drive to a number of different lakes and see the state parks. If we had friends coming to the Finger Lakes we would recommend that they stay here.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny house is exactly what we needed. It was very easy to go on vacation with our dog and have him stay with us and go out for hikes and outdoor restaurants. The house was very clean, and the hosts were always reachable with questions."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was great being able to stay in the tiny house on this trip to Corning. Everything went perfectly and was as described. I used to live in Corning, so it was awesome to be on the Northside so close to what was Northside Blodgett (I can't believe it's gone!) and walking distance to Wegmans and Market Street (It's about 0.8 miles away which is walkable for me). I was able to walk my dog around the neighborhood and by the homes of friends where I used to hangout. A great place to stay and a great location!"

Corning Glass Museum was spectacular and Letchworth State Park was well worth the drive.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first time using Airnb and we were pleasantly surprised at the ease and how well our host accommodated our stay. It was nice that Cindy considered extra things like towels, coffee machine and coffee/tea. All appliances were clean and full sized and worked well. It definitely, was a very quiet street and loved the fenced in area for our dog. The house is very close to the major attractions, restaurants, and etc. We had plenty of room and we would recommend it for anyone or a couple of small families wanted to explore the area."

Cindy’s place was spotlessly clean, and comfortable. In a quiet suburban street, very pleasant, and close to the Glass Museum and Downtown areas, so plenty to do and see. Good water pressure and temperature, full house AC/heating, comfortable furniture and a cute functional space. Clean and comfy bedding, good quality memory foam mattresses.
Overall it was excellent, no problems at all, would stay again and recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house didn't seem tiny at all, but then again I do live in NYC. The bedrooms were large with Queen size beds, the living room with a Queen side pull out/couch bed and a great size kitchen. it was a 5 min drive to the museum of glass and 10 minutes to downtown."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really adorable Airbnb! The host was great and the place was exactly as described. Will definitely book again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cindy’s was place was perfect. Cozy, Comfortable and Clean. It was exactly what we needed and the fenced yard was a huge perk for traveling with fur-babies. It is very reasonably priced and we felt right at home. Cindy was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to questions. Ideal place for your stay in Corning."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cindy's place was just perfect for a little birthday getaway and two dear friends to catch up over drinks and dinner prepared in the beautifully renovated kitchen. The house doesn't feel tiny it feels warm, cozy, and inviting. If you have furry family members the backyard is a joy and the neighborhood super walkable. I highly recommend a stay at Cindy's Corning Cottage!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an adorable little house. It’s not “tiny” but right sized. The kitchen is well furnished and you could definitely cook a meal there. My dog loved the big fenced yard, but somehow squeezed himself through a tiny hole to get out and then run up the steps , so if you have a Houdini dog keep an eye on him! Nice quiet area in a fun town!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and beautiful place to stay! Close to many of the finger lakes and other attractions! Cindy was super helpful and we were super happy with her place.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming little house was exactly what my wife and I needed when we were in Corning the week of our grandchild's birth. We brought our older grandchild to our little house to play every day and made lots of memories there.
The kitchen was small, but well stocked with baking supplies. The three of us enjoyed sitting at the little table and eating together.
This house sits on a hill, providing a great view of the neighborhood. There was some snow and ice while we were there, and we were grateful that the sidewalk and steps had been salted. For anyone with mobility issues the stairs and sidewalk could be difficult to navigate safely due to the uneven terrain.
The TV and wifi served us well. There were plenty of streaming services available.
The house was cozy and clean and we plan to return."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,During a snow storm was for sure hard parking and getting off the hill .
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very quiet location, comfortable beds and pillows, and clean. Great rental!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"lives next door, great host and a great place; could do better on the cleanup in between guests, stepped on a couple thumb tacks and push pins during our stay but that's water under the bridge. very responsive and knowledgeable on the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The street is very beautiful, the house is very comfortable and clean, very cozy, very suitable for two families to travel together, the kids love it here, there is also a small yard, there is also a washer dryer, very convenient, very convenient to all attractions, the Corning museum of glass is very beautiful"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it! The place is really beautiful. The location is really secluded but close to the main part of the town. The house is well equipped for a fun night with your friends or family! Wish we would’ve stayed longer.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for the Wineglass 1/2 marathon and this was a good close spot.
We probably spent 8 hours in the house.
The house was very clean and comfortable and suited are purposes.
Too bad we didn't have more time to spend, but that's how it goes when you are racing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here twice now and I think this place is just perfect. I came to see a concert in Hammondsport, but chose to stay in Corning because this Airbnb was available. The place is very comfortable, clean, and has plenty of amenities. The Wi-Fi was ridiculously easy to sign into, unlike many other places with a handwritten password that you try to decipher. The location is great, you can just walk to downtown if you want to have a few drinks and not worry about driving. There’s plenty to do and see in the area. And of course Lucas is great! I strongly recommend this place if you’re staying in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect cozy home that had everything we needed. Lucas was very responsive to questions we had about the surrounding area, would stay here again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Decent accommodations but must climb steep stairs to get to it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time. We went to Watkins Glen State Park, Taughannock Falls State Park, Seneca Lake and other roadside falls. The house was the perfect size. It felt very cozy and it was very quiet at night. Will surely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Lucas’s guest house. It was super comfortable and had everything we needed. We appreciated that he uses unscented laundry products as the home, linens, and towels did not have a scent and I am sensitive to synthetic fragrances. Lucas was very responsive and accommodating."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this home. My family enjoyed staying in this place. Super close to the Glass Museum and stores. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The picture of the backyard catched my eyes when I searched for for a house in Airbnb, but it was the biggest disappointment - instead of what I imagined as an isolated and calm place, turned to be dirty, untreated and in proximety to other houses. A huge spider even came to visit in the bathroom. In addition, I was afraid to use the washing machine, that seems a bit old & full with limestone and there was no dish dryer to place the washed dishes.
Other then that, Lucas is a wonderful host, he turned the AC and the fans ON before we arrived, the commiunication was great, he even gave us a great tip for breakfast and there is a Roku for the TV that preloaded with Netflix and YouTube TV, that was a great bonus.
Overall I think that this house is a good option to consider, when staying in Corning and although the negative issues that I wrote I'm not sure that the other hosting options in the city, at this price level, are better"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with a great host! Close to everything in Corning but far enough away you have your own privacy. House was clean and had everything you need.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean, cozy, welcoming, close to attractions, in a beautiful neighborhood where I felt safe, amenities all great, stocked supplies, including spices and things to bake with if want. I liked the k coffe cups, and the throw blankets in the living toom. I appreciated the AC being on so it was nice and cool after a long drive to get there. Only suggestion is if you have someone with not so good balance, the stairs and low railing going to the entrance may be tough. All good. Highly recommend booking here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend staying here! The home itself is beautiful and well maintained. Our host provided so many things that made the home feel so cozy. The home is in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. It’s close to many beautiful parks and great restaurants. We enjoyed our stay so much!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A great little place to stay while exploring Corning!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lucas was a great host, and the place was great! Super clean and comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. The house is small, cozy, and comfortable. Everything was provided, from sheets, towels, and dishes, down to shampoo. It was a good central location for exploring the finger lakes, in a quiet part of town but within minutes of restaurants and shopping.
Lucas was great. Communication was great and the house was perfect for what we needed!
It was far enough from downtown where we had privacy but very accessible and a quick drive down the hill to every place we wanted to go to! It was very clean and comfortable! Would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lucas’s place was cozy and felt like home. Lots of little touches that made it stand out — individual bars of soap, variety of k cups and creamers, plentiful linens, fans and extra blankets if needed, fully stocked spice rack, etc. Lucas also went out of his way to make us comfortable by leaving lights on when we arrived later than planned and setting up a baby air purifier and sound machine when he found out we were bringing our newborn with us. He was very friendly and communicative throughout our stay. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quite, clean place that had everything we needed for a short weekend away."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Lucas's house was convenient and well priced. The windows don’t open and the bedrooms don’t have air conditioners so it got a big stuffy at night but otherwise we enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and well appointed home. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The listing was exactly as described. Lucas was an incredible host - extremely accommodating and friendly. Lucas responded promptly and gave clear and succinct instructions. It made for a very pleasant stay!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been returning guests and are always more than comfortable. As soon as we walked in the door I noticed the update of new flooring and the fresh flowers on the living room coffee table.
It has a neat and tidy cottage feel and provides us with everything we need for our extended stays.
Attention to detail is important to us and Lucas has been a very attentive and responsive host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lucas provided a very cozy, well supplied, comfortable

Close to the downtown area where we could find good food and ice cream (very important!). The beds were comfortable and the bathroom clean. The kitchen was stocked with the essential cookware and plates/bowls. The back patio looked nice and there is a grill and fire pit but we didn’t use it.

Beds were comfortable as well. Very pleasant and peaceful neighborhood in general. The description accurately states there are some steps to the front door that must be climbed.

We would stay here again and highly recommend it."

Very close the the Corning glass museum
Great indoors. Rooms were very clean and loved the house layout. The fact that all the rooms had television was an added bonus.

We had towels and places to hang them, a coffee maker that was easy to use with plenty of coffee and creamers available. There is a washer and dryer which always is a plus in my book. Also, the master bedroom has a tv in it for evenings when you feel really lazy! We were there during some cold rainy weather and had a great day visiting the Corning Glass museum and coming back with friends and turning on the little electric fireplace. All in all a very pleasant stay."

I took a class at the Corning Museum of Glass and was able to walk there everyday. Additionally, as a host, Don was incredibly communicative, professional, and caring. He was very quick to answer and solve any troubles throughout our lengthy stay. We had last minute issues with our car that prevented us from leaving when planned.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. The home feels like home, with careful attention to details that made us feel so comfortable and welcome. We were greeted by the smell of CLEAN, which was the best welcome we could ask for. We so appreciated the Funky touches and artwork from NYC. Our host was super responsive and we enjoyed his recommendations for things to do in the area. We couldn’t hit them all, but we plan to come back and will definitely stay here again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s place is in a great location and was exactly what we needed to enjoy some hiking and wineries only 30 minutes away at Watkins Glen. There are some great restaurants right in Corning and the Corning Glass Museum was much better than I expected. As far as Don’s place it was so clean, well kept and welcoming. We had no problem settling in and feeling comfortable. The check in process was easy and Don was so quick to respond and help us with local recommendations and just check in to see how we were doing and if needed anything! We would definitely recommend Don’s place in Corning and would love to visit again one day."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend staying here, very clean and everything you need. The coffee was a nice addition so we didn’t have to go out early and look for some. Very comfortable and relaxing. We walked into Market street and Seneca Lake was just a short drive."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don was an amazing host and very receptive to questions. In such challenging times of renting a space, he was able to explain the current cleaning protocol in detail which made me feel at ease. Upon arrival, you could see how clean the space was and it smelled like fresh cleaning products (not in an overpowering way but evident that cleanliness is of concern). The decor was modern and fun, a cozy and cool place to be. Thank you Don!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"You can expect to not only be comfortable in this space, but to have a home-away-from-home kind of feeling with the lovely touches and welcoming amenities. Since we were the first guests in this newly remodeled and freshly painted apartment, we were very pleased to experience the same 5 star experience as we recently did in Don's first floor apartment."
