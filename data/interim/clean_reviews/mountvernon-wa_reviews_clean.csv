2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic! Super easy to get in! Huge water fall on one of the nature paths that was unexpected and also easy to get to. Beautiful place and perfect glamping set up.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay loved the area
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! There was some confusion between the listing and the information inside the rental between whether tea, a s’mores kit, firewood, and other items were included in the price of the stay. Otherwise, the place was private and the bed was so comfortable!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The company is super responsive and the views of the forest from bed are magical, the only misleading thing are the prices for the additional goods. There are signs indoors related to what the firewood & smores cost but some of the items are free for Airbnb guests. Overall would love to stay here again it was a very peaceful gateaway!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing love this place! :)
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough good things about this experience - have already recommended to friends and family!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Getaway! The cabin was cozy, peaceful and perfect for a weekend away. The other cabins were closer than expected but still private. Would love to stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my time in at Getaway. The cabin was cute, private, and the surrounding environment was beautiful. Neighbors were all respectful and quiet. Would visit again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is clean and a good location in Ballard. The host is super kind and offered us home made kombucha and a coffee in the morning. They were very responsive to questions as well. Would 10/10 reccomend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I chose to stay at the Getaway when in town visiting the North Cascades NP and I could not have been happier with my choice. This airbnb is, by far, one of the nicest places I have stayed. The location was absolute perfection, secluded and peaceful yet not too far from town where there were several food options available. The hosts go above and beyond to supply everything you could possibly need to enjoy your stay here, including all campfire amenities. Extremely well thought out and put together. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to return again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect cabin for a peaceful getaway for the weekend! Whether you are inside or outside it feels like you are right in nature! Everything was spotless and the perfect size for a weekend getaway! I’ve already told all my friends and can’t wait to come back again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute. Never made a fire before and even though I used a fire starter I still put the logs there left feeling very skilled and independent
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a lovely time in a more private setting and a great view ! It was so peaceful waking up to nature right outside the window. Very minimalist and had all the essentials.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as pictured and described. The map at the entrance is important to note, and the one-way drive paths make it easy to navigate. Helpful to arrive during daylight to see the signs. We have AT&T and cellular reception was not an issue. Easy to get to Mt Vernon and Skagit Valley for great restaurants."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view from the window!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect place for a getaway.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Its a nice romantic place to get away! I will def come back again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love this cozy, clean, well appointed place! Great job!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The check in and out was so easy and was beautiful out there. Definitely recommend
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing. Everything was clean, directions were thorough! Everything was stress free."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved!! We have already planned on making this a yearly vacation
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay in the middle of the woods
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible getaway with high quality amenities. The only thing is that it is not entirely private with many other cabins and guests around the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely little home in a peaceful, beautiful location. We enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cabin in the middle of the woods. Love the possibility to get a bonfire.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the tiny getaway cabin and giant window by the bed that let in plenty of moonlight! Well equipped with cookware and utensils. Only downside was charging for items like teabags and s’mores….and the fact that the cabins are all very close to each other. Love the overall concept.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and secluded
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely gorgeous cute place and spectacular views. I small toaster would have been nice. Also think at the price range/Coffee, water, smore kit and some wood etc should be included and not a separate list of extra costs as this is part of cabin experience (especially if you’re from Canada = can’t bring wood) and nothing really around so it’s not like you have options.. lots of other attention to details tho and would definitely recommend if you look to disconnect quickly from civilization. Lovely place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was such a great location, 10-15 minutes from mount Vernon, we stayed here during the tulip festival, perfect location to be close to the tulips. Also, short and sweet nature walks throughout the complex with a small stream and waterfalls for viewing."
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was advertised as a woods private getaway, but was more a parking lot, with views directly onto neighbor trailers, as well as onto a mostly dirt lot. The trailer itself was nice, but had the amenities advertised in the listing available for purchase much like a minibar."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The view behind the window was less cool. Some bushes instead of big pine trees. You have to pay for bottled water and even for teabags. Better bring yours. 2,5$ for a teabag :)
Place was clean, with shower and heater, pretty quiet, instructions are understandable, lots of kitchen supplies. Seems like they do care about their guests. So I would advice to visit after all"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful! Easy to find & great little stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cozy cabin/tiny home. Love our stay there!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little getaway! I really enjoyed my stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the most amazing stay at Getaway Cabin. Communication with the host was great, extremely responsive and instructions were given accurately. Every information we needed were given and check in process was extremely easy. I couldn’t say enough good things about this stay. The cabin was everything we needed and more. We felt safe and at peace. The cabin was pristine, modern and squeaky clean. There was even s’mores kit, water, tea, hot chocolate, coffee that are available for purchase and firewood that we used for a nice bonfire at night. The little kitchen has everything you’ll need to cook a meal from pans, utensils to cutleries. It was nice to disconnect and reconnect with nature. We felt recharged and felt really good after our stay. I couldn’t recommend this place enough to people who would like experience the beautiful cabin and disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city for a bit. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much Getaway Cabin!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,the other cabins are very close but it still feels secluded. A perfect place to stay for the evening.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful! A lovely, comfy spot surrounded by trees and beautiful stars :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was amazing, we had a great time. Everything was clean and well stocked with everything you need. Beautiful area and everything is as advertised. I’d give this more than 5 stars if I could- we’ll definitely be returning."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to come and disconnect from phones and work-life.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"was a little tough finding the cabin, but then again it was after dark when we arrived. apart from some slightly loud neighbors, everything was perfect. there was even a surprise babling creek. will book again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Comfortable, clean and peaceful with everything we needed. We’ll be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my first time staying at the Mount Vernon location and it was the perfect time with the Tulip Festival going on which is only a 20 minutes drive away.
In comparison to the one I stayed at in southern Washington (drive through Portland and back up north into Washington) the bathroom door swings outward rather than inward giving the bathroom a little more space which was a plus.
Location, sleep, pictures are all just as listed. I’ll be staying with TheGetaway again for sure."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, clean and comfortable cabin. There are plenty of places to go within a 10-20 min drive, but I really enjoyed the on-site nature walks too. I was a bit confused about the cost of the ""provisions"", but they clarified that if you book on Airbnb that all provisions are included (they are not if you book on the website)."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a quiet, cozy, and relaxing stay! Just what we were hoping for. Will definitely go back to reconnect and be in nature!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this property is perfect for you!! The area is secluded enough for some peace and quiet but close enough to other units that you could easily come out here with the whole family! The unit was extremely clean and well stocked with all linens and kitchen utensils you need! There is also a beautiful nature trail that leads to a waterfall on the property! Cannot recommend this property enough!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was a great experience! The cabin was so cute and the atmosphere was serene. Just what my husband and I were looking for for our weekend getaway, we would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My escape to Getaway was an absolute delight
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was nice little weekend getaway with mom.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"had a great stay here. very peaceful and in a good location. cons were that the view wasn’t great for our cabin— we were mainly looking out at invasive himalayan blackberry bushes.
enjoyed the fire pit, clean cabin, and comfortable bed. would do it again and hope for a better view from the cabin!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,-
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay here— a great place to get away for a bit.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time and loved being able to have our dog with us. The cabins were closer than expected to one another and most guests also had dogs. If you have a reactive pup, may be tricky. The space was beautiful, I loved doing the nature paths, they had everything needed to build a fire, etc. Great getaway from seattle!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great and the area was beautiful. But, the cabins are a bit closer together than they seem on the post. I was under the impression that the cabin would be a bit more secluded than it was. Overall still really enjoyed our stay, just wish the description had been a little more forthcoming."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. It was peaceful and relaxing. The host gave some good recommendations on local hikes and eats, too. I laid in bed by the giant window and read my book the entire weekend :)
FYI: the description says “as part of your stay, you’ll receive firewood, a s’mores kit, coffee, and bottled water,” but once you get there, you find you’ll actually be charged if you use those items."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a relaxing break, we really took the opportunity to disconnect."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Really nice cabin and the view was amazing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Hard to locate the cabin but fascinating place. My girlfriend keeps asking to go back. Definitely worth it
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inside better than most hotels, outside is literally a forest. What more can you ask for"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Initially call the number from cabin, but no one answered. They only communicable through airbnb messages. There are little messy in bathroom + hot water wasnt working 🥲
But as always good view + good place getting away"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous place, cozy and modern. View was very peaceful and the entire experience felt private. The addition of the campfire and chairs was very pleasant and overall the experience was more than worth it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The definition of glamping! We loved cooking s’mores on the fire and looking out at the view of the woods from our tiny cabin. We hiked around little mountain which is only a short drive away and full of great trails. Would come back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fantastic stay at this charming tiny house nestled in the woods. The hosts were super accommodating, adding personal touches that made the experience unique. Loved the big window with forest views and the cozy vibe. Making smores was a delightful highlight. Perfect spot for a peaceful, nature-filled retreat. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I love all the details in the Getaways lodge! Amazing amenities and getaways tips!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and quiet stay. The cabin matched the description, equipped with your basic needs. Would definitely stay again"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"Maybe the problem was with air BB.. I don’t know. But I specifically put two adult males comming on a motorcycle and need to check in early. They did accomplish that after a couple of attempts. However, my mate had to sleep on the floor and was soo unhappy. It’s literally the size of a large tent. I don’t know how o could have been more clear. Two hours recovering at a masseuse.$250. Buyer beware.."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and perfect for what I was looking for!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I love the idea of this complex. The effort that went into planning and constructing the whole neighborhood is fascinating. The pods themselves are stunningly beautiful and simple. Everything needed to be comfortable and relaxed is right there. So impressive
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"well designed, camping-lite. lots of thoughtful touches, felt private."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing communication from Getaway, great included amenities, very peaceful and stress-free. Would return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,worth it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Getaway was perfect for the weekend trip. It is a very peaceful and private location. The cabins are cozy and well kept. Recommend going and will return in the future.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place to do a getaway. Very comfortable place to stay in wilderness with all facilities. A bit expensive to what it is in terms of size. It's not a cabin but very well designed truck with everything you need. Best is that they allow pets. No activity place nearby to my knowledge, the forest is not very dense so doesn't give great views from the window.
Overall great place for a glamping experience."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a lovely little gem! the Skagit Valley has so much to offer and this was such a peaceful home base.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location. Beautiful window to look out at the trees. Bed was very comfortable.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so peaceful. The perfect clamping expieence and such beautiful surroundings.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, enjoyed our stay. Loved the huge window looking out at the trees. Be aware that the complimentary items in the listing (e.g., firewood, coffee) actually have an additional price/charge attached--based on item menu located inside the cabin. Also, while we generally experienced quiet during our stay, there were a few hours one evening when noise from a neighboring group could be heard from inside the cabin. That being said, it's a beautiful and convenient location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This secluded cabin offers cozy charm in a serene woodland setting. Cleverly designed, it maximizes space without sacrificing comfort. Perfect for unplugging and reconnecting with nature, it promises a tranquil escape."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great experience, very cozy place🫶🏼
Bonfire was on top!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Super quiet. A great way to spend some time way
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We so enjoyed our stay! The cabin had everything we needed. Truly had one of the best weekends staying here with out pup. They were so accommodating and there was lots of activities.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our weekend at the Getaway cabin was WONDERFUL. I will definitely be back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small cabin with everything included. The firewood was included in the price, which was nice."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great escape from the busy city life. The area was nice and quiet, and it was very relaxing to be in nature."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was absolutely enchanted by this tiny minimalist magical getaway in a beautiful, wild location. Everything from the well designed tiny home with plain, uncluttered walls, clean linens ,the thoughtful books and guides, and minimalist, functional amenities, such as dish-ware, first aid kit and even organic olive oil, tea and coffee was perfection. I didn’t want to leave, and I stared out the window of my little cabin for hours, this was a very peaceful and safe place for me to process my emotions and I am so grateful for the people who thought up and helped make this space. I will be returning as soon as possible. Thank you so much.🖤🌲"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and beautiful
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great escape for a weekend trip! It was a quick drive from Seattle, and it was tucked away so you can’t hear traffic or any city sounds. The cabin had everything we needed so we didn’t need to pack a lot. Would stay here again 😊"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication, easy check in. We really enjoyed our stay."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"A calm and beautiful place, all you need. Privacy and quiet."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabins and area were all around beautiful. The cabins were fairly close together but still allowed for privacy. Definitely recommend for a peaceful getaway.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great setting and setup. I thought it was overpriced for what it is. However I’d definitely recommend it and go back especially if I found a good deal on it.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Camping experience with all modern amenities!
Cabin matches online description. Quiet and relaxing.
The only minor inconvenience was that the cabin does not have a hand-wash sink in toilet."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can't say enough positive things about this place! Was totally taken aback but how nice the actual cabin is - heated and with up to date appliances! I felt so comfy and cozy. With a few groceries I legitimately had everything I needed in the cabin to be able to be a recluse and stay inside. Was so quiet as well and their nature path is very cute. Will definitely be coming back as a getaway from the city!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place and the waterfall it’s gorgeous. We loved how comfortable it all was and the cabins stay nice and warm. Also, I was on call with work and I had service there. (Verizon and T-Mobile)
I would go back again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay!! Definitely recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Skagit Valley Getaway Cabins was beautiful and peaceful. Perfect place to get away from the noise and enjoy the scenery around. Really enjoyed the nature paths and the cabin’s large window. We will definitely come back or explore their other locations!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just the getaway I needed! Will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wanted to spend some time away from the city. Nice and quiet. Loved the phone lock box and the dog friendly atmosphere. This place is a gem. It was clean, safe, and relaxing. We stayed for a short time but it was enough to get the job done. Will plan to come again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is a spectacular getaway. just beatiful scenic site and amazing cabin.. very well designed. loved our stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a two night trip! was able to enjoy the flexibility of check in as i had to work until 6 and we live almost 2 hours away.
was able to enjoy the nature paths and its neat little secrets! definitely a place for one to unwind from the stressors of work ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,the place was exactly as listed. super quiet and beautiful area surrounding the cabin. the cabin was also the perfect size and stayed warm perfectly. getaway was also very responsive and made the experience flawless!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing break enchanted in this listing! It has everything you need for a quiet, relaxing stay as close as possible to nature! Everything is very clean, and there is really everything you need! Wood is very enjoyable! The bed is very comfortable! If we didn't live thousands of miles away, we will definitely be back! Probably one of the best Airbnb we've ever done! Thanks!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,new fav spot :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location for an escape from the city. Private, quiet and clean!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Was nice and quiet, peaceful."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin, such a wonderful experience in these adorable, well-equipped tiny homes that were well spaced out for privacy.
Although, the only problems were the outdated advertising with what is included in your booking such as complimentary firewood and smores...that actually weren't complimentary as we found out when we saw the listed prices in the cabin. It was also disappointing that they didn't bother to answer the questions we asked, I don't know if it was just automated messages we were receiving for our welcome and not a real person (likely).
Other than that, it was a wonderful escape and we do want to come back again. And we really appreciate the extra touches for our dog."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little retreat away from all the craziness of the city. Would 100% recommend for those who want to unplug and enjoy some peace and quiet.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was so adorable and lovely! Definitely would come back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect getaway which is just 2 hr drive from the city. The cabins are perfectly oriented keeping privacy and solitude of the guest in mind.
Cabin is well equipped with daily essentials and also has provision for camp fire along with its instruction. Bedsheet and linen were clean and well maintained. Bathroom were clean with all the required necessities - towels, soaps etc.
Good part is it has both AC and Heater. Service staff were prompt, helpful and amicable.
We will definitely visit again. Thanks."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great new year weekend spent at the cabin!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we live just 30 minutes from the Skagit location but felt we were so far from home. it was a perfect relaxing weekend ""away"". we will be back for sure!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time at this getaway location. The waterfall nature walk was a delightful surprise. The staff was very welcoming and responsive. It was an amazing and relaxing end-of-year getaway. Will be coming back again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and a great place to getaway
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Returning to return to the place is very nice and quiet, I love it, I recommend it...
A perfect get way from work and relieve stress, great window view and love the clear glass shower ☺️"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little tiny house cabins.
Someone obviously put a LOT of thought into all the extra details, like hand written notes that were specifically personal.
If the goal was to provide a cute, cozy getaway that encourages you to unplug... They nailed it 100%."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing tiny place nestled in the woods. It felt very private and secluded from the other cabins and the trails were lovely.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Great time to get away from the city, the noise and the routine! Very private and peaceful! Love that they have items for sale there, like wood, fire starter, tea, coffee and more!!! Highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderfully surprised by how well prepared everything was for our stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful place to unwind and get out of the city. We only stayed overnight but could’ve stayed for another night :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to disconnect from the world and enjoy the peacefulness of being in nature.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin I was assigned wasn’t as tree lined as I thought it’d be, but it was such a beautiful stay regardless! Really didn’t feel like it was only 15 minutes from more populated civilization. What I appreciated the most was the small details (s’mores kit, firewood, hot chocolate, deck of cards, analog speaker, lamp!). They really thought of everything for you to unplug and ‘getaway’! Also super responsive team. Would book again. :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and very safe cabin. Everything was super clean and the bed was really comfortable. Recommend for a quick getaway
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Getaway cabin for our wedding anniversary. I wanted to do something different than usual, where we could relax and unwind, and Getaway gave us exactly what we were looking for. We loved our time in the cabin. The best part for me was exploring the nature trails nearby and sitting by the bonfire.
The only thing I feel was missing was a microwave oven. Otherwise it was the perfect ""getaway""."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome little getaway for a quiet weekend. Some hotel vibes (add-on purchase in unit for S’mores kit). Overall a great trip.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here! Just 10 mins from Conway off of I-5, super pretty drive. It was so quiet and peaceful with gorgeous views from every window in the cabin. After spending the day shopping in downtown Mount Vernon we came back, made dinner, and played games while listening to music on the radio provided. The cabin was so cozy and cute I didn’t want to leave! We will definitely be back again for a longer stay in the near future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"They were so responsive and friendly. The place itself was very clean. My only issue was trying to find my cabin in the dark. I tried following the map I was sent, but it was still a tad difficult to find. I probably circled around 2-3 times. I think the pictures make the space look bigger than it was but I still loved my stay. Overall I wish I could have stayed longer!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place was great! we felt safe, we loved the trails and nature!! great design and great views!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was very peaceful, my significant other and I enjoyed the view from the windows especially with it being very private. We loved that the trails weren’t too long to walk and they beauty of them both. I definitely will be recommending this stay to friends and family and we will be back! Thank you"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was so beautiful and a nice little spot to just get away
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Getaway cabins in Skagit Valley was so cozy even in the rainy Washington winter! It was so peaceful listening to the pitter patter of the rain on the roof & waking up to the giant cedar tree outside. Heating worked great & kept the cabin cozy. The hot water tank was small, so be sure to take quick showers in the winter if you want it hot! Would highly recommend & we will hopefully return!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super relaxing! Great way to unplug
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For it being so isolated from everything and the limited space, the price was high for being a trailer. Though it was a very nice trailer, it was still a trailer."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great spot. Beautiful location, the cabin was super well stocked and exactly as described. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"clean space, private location, pretty view - all worth the money and we had the great time, thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded my expectations. The complimentary fire wood and smores was a nice touch. No wifi of course, but T-mobile 5G seemed to work just fine."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great - only thing was quite loud heating system
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We’ve been wanting to stay at a Getaway cabin for a while and everything about it was perfect. A great way for my fiancé to start off her 28th year.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice tiny cabins!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,great place for a getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,beautiful space. great way to relax.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny home is AMAZING!! I walked in and it was exactly what I was looking for. It was private, peaceful, absolutely beautiful inside and out. The huge back window was wonderful seeing nature. I went there by myself to have a get-a-way with some me time. It was exactly what I needed and wanted. They have a great book to read to help relax. The inside of the home was exactly what the pictures showed. There are some homes around that were not as private, good for a group gathering, but the other homes that were extremely private, like the ones I had. I will be back and will recommend this place to everyone."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredible! This was my second stay at this particular Getaway. The cabins are at once luxe and cozy, providing near instantaneous access to the natural world around you. I’m already planning my next stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Stopped here on our way to north cascades national park. Great halfway point between the park and Seattle. Very cozy and clean with beautiful views.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with easy access to North Cascades National Park. Wonderful books were stocked in the cabin to truly enhance the Getaway experience. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved it! Beautiful setting and cozy cabin. I would definitely go back!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great time at the Getaway Cabin! It was super cozy, functional, and private. We loved how peaceful and quiet it was here. Best of all, there were numerous activities surrounding the area that kept us busy outdoors!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was wonderful, great location and would recommend. However please be warned that almost anything used in the cabin will be charged. Coffee, wood, s’mores, tea. There is a list of items that I’d you use will be charged at the end of the stay. Again, great getaway, would recommend. The AirBnB fees are getting out of hand though."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I love the cabin! It has everything I need. But the heat was not working in my cabin. I contacted Getaway, got a response that their team member would come to check. They did not come until the following afternoon. So the cabin was freezing for a day when the temperature outside was 34-40 degrees. Other than that, our experience was great. The cabin area was quiet to relax and unplug. We had decent signals but did not need to use our phone."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Love the area loved the mattress and pillows...
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"These cabins are adorable, clean and functional. I stayed for the weekend with my stepkiddo and pup and we had such a nice time crafting, playing games and listening to music in our cabin. We campfired and night - the firewood and s’mores packs were much appreciated. It was so nice to be in nature but not have to pack and lug all of our camping gear. I also appreciated the bluetooth speaker in our cabin as well as the book collection. All in all a fantastic trip!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,awesome nice and quiet there's fire pits ..dog likes it there..enjoyed my stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice little get away. Clean, everything you need, fun camping style experience, with a decent amount of privacy. We had a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely getaway in the woods! We had such a peaceful and relaxing stay, the tiny home was very quaint but fulfilled all our needs. Will definitely be back :) Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,So peaceful and beautiful. We had a wonderful stay
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was a beautiful stay. Would stay again if we go travel that way again. Person next door didn’t respect the be quiet rule that was clearly on the tables but otherwise it was amazing and totally worth it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cool place great weekend getaway!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Dreamy - loved being able to watch the stars from the large window.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet and clean. Good use of a small space.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place ! Would recommend 100% ❤️
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Very well designed and thoughtful space!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was soooo relaxing!!! Amazing!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved it, thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the Getaway. We appreciated every little attention and detail. The place is small but very well done so nothing is missing. Our host was very responsive to messages and helped us fix an issue with our booking, we’re very grateful for them!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little mini cabins together on a sprawling forested property. Neighbors aren't too close, window positions were well thought out in that they allow for maximum privacy. we didn't close the blinds to the massive bedside window and didn't need to! never saw a sole through it! We enjoyed the rain, trees, meadow, and had ourselves a beautiful little getaway from city stress, sirens, loud people, car noises, etc. Very small space, but very well designed space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was the perfect first stop to our road trip! After a long flight from the east coast, staying at Getaway was a refreshing bit of northwest nature and hospitality. It’s the perfect mix of nature and comfort: we are not typically “outdoorsy” people, but we felt completely comfortable thanks to all the small touches (clear instructions, encouraged activities, books, phone lockbox, and more). Overall, it was a perfect way to unplug and connect with nature."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to have a small gate away !!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this little cabin, great view and easy instructions! Would recommend staying here and would stay here again! Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing! Go for it!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this cabin! It felt so cosy and the big window let nature in. Super comfy mattress too. The cabin was really well designed, just wish we had been there for longer!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and cozy spot!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super quiet, great place to stay in the woods. The cabins are super comfy and functional - everything you need within arms reach."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time staying at a Getaway cabin after we’ve always wanted to and it was well worth the stay. It was so cute and peaceful- it’s exactly what we wanted. I would stay at a Getaway cabin again in a heartbeat!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay!! We will be back again soon.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a very relaxing time!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this place! Had trouble getting in initially but had such a quick response from the host and she quickly got us in! Perfect dream location
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful getaway! The place looks exactly like the pictures and felt very private. While there were other cabins around, trees obscured your view of them so you felt like you had the whole forest to yourself! The hide-away was a little hard to find the first time (it was in the third ring of cabins) but after an initial search, it was simple and easy to get to. It definitely fits the category of tiny home, which was great in promoting the feeling of escape. It has everything you need for a great get-away. It even came with a phone time-out box to aid in disconnecting. Cabin was well stocked with what you needed and we were even able to cook a full meal! It had everything you needed to feel comfy and at home in the woods. Mornings were spent eating breakfast outside, enjoying the sun and scenery. Overall, great place to stay and would recommend it for anyone hoping to escape the ""real world"" for a few days!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, I loved it. The space and amenities were great. It was awesome to know how dog-friendly and inviting it was. There was a wire ""leash"" you could use outside for your dog and they provided treats (which my dog loved) and poop bags.
Few things I'd tell others: Be mindful of reception. I have g.oogleFI and my service wasn't affected much. You might have neighbors. The cabin I got was decently away from the other one so it wasn't bad. If you have a dog, they'll be able to see each other. The cabin you get and its view may be very different from what's on their photos. I was content with mine because there was a huge tree in front and provided the feeling of being surrounded by nature. Though based off the images, I was expecting more of an open view. Few food options around without driving 20-30min so prepare accordingly.
It was great escape and would definitely be open to visiting again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing place to get away from the city and enjoy the quiet green space. The view from the window was incredible and we were both in awe the whole time. Highly recommend to couples who want to unplug + be present with each other + enjoy a peaceful time together in nature!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, communication was effective, I would just keep in mind this is not a completely secluded place. At first we enjoyed not being completely alone for safety, but we did have some noise coming from the families around us which made it less relaxing than we would have expected. Overall we really enjoyed staying here and would still recommend it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"They were super responsive, and the place was exactly the respite we were looking for. Wonderful!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tiny homes in the woods, far enough apart to have privacy. Very peaceful and quiet, a great place to unplug and unwind from the daily grind. Looking forward to checking out some of their other properties in other locations!
Thank You"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I didn’t like that there was no mirror in the cabin. There is a big space on the wall when you enter that can hold a beautiful mirror for getting ready in the mornings. The shower curtain had pink at the bottom of it.! It didn’t look washed. Other than that, it was nice and clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice, quiet, and quaint. The area was full of wildlife and had nice scenic nature."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great concept for “glamping”. We prefer day hikes that are technical and afterwords a comfortable bed and hot shower is just what we needed. The small space is perfect for two, with the ability to use the height of the shelving to tuck away our gear and keep the space less cluttered. The bed and bedding was comfortable to recover for the next days adventures.
One thing about this location, do not expect a scalding hot shower. It is warm, not cold, but not a steam shower. Again, this was not an issue for us, just informing.
Due to the burn ban, we had to grill on propane and the skillet inside. We had all the necessary kitchen utensils for prep and eating. The little packets of olive oil was such a nice touch.
Looking forward to finding more of these across the US and stay in for our next hiking vacation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay and amazing host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at the Getaway cabin. Waking up to the beautiful scenery was one of the best parts of our stay! Wonderful host and super cute cabin. We would love to return!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place to sit back and relax. Also very fun to walk around the property with many little trails to explore!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such an amazing time at the Getaway! We will be recommending this to all of our friends and family. Every detail was thought out (s’mores kit, bug spray wipes, olive oil packets, etc.) The cabin and bed were clean and comfy! We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was great ! it was definitely glamping. They stocked the kitchen very well! everyone in the campground was very respectful of the rules. The large window inside facing the woods was private. There was lots of signage to help with any issues you might encounter. I was impressed by the hot water heater. It was like a hotel on wheels. Great option for camping but without having to pack everything onto a plane.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Only complaint is that the inside smelled like campfire smoke from the previous tenants.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"very cool. very swag, will come back"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time getting away! Thanks for a great experience :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was our second awesome stay with Brad & Eileen and will not be the last!
The location is 'in the country', but a very easy central location to tulips, Mt Vernon, Conway, La Conner, Bellingham, Anacortes etc.
Nestled in the Skagit Valley, there are fields on all sides, with mountains surrounding, the vistas are amazing. The studio is filled with light from windows on three sides, but the shades are totally adjustable up and down to sleep. One can watch sunrise out the kitchenette window, then sunset in the opposite window, or both from the outside deck. It is georgous.
Depending on the season, there are snow geese, multiple varieties of ducks, bald eagles and other wildlife all over. In the summer, there are wild blackberries to pick along the roadsides. Being 'in the country', there are crops in the fields, or farmers preparing for planting or harvest (at enough distance to enjoy watching, not to disturb the peace of the surroundings).
Thank you for a wonderful visit!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are the guests that Brad and Eileen can't get rid of. We love coming here, again and again. Feels like home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An extremely welcoming experience, and a great way to spend the weekend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are in Skagit Valley for the place’s beauty, this place is hard to best. Also, the unit is one of the classiest spaces we have ever stayed in… perfect for readers,writers, art lovers,?nature lovers, and if the weather cooperates- anyone who sppreciates sunsets snd sunrises and mountain scenery.
Note: there is no dink in the toilet so guests mustvwash hands innthe same sink used for dishes. Wonderful coffeemaker. Hot plate but no full size stove. Brad gave us terrific tip on finding smow geese."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love our stay at Brad and Eileen the place we’re fantastic very cozy for the occasion had lots of instructions to places we could eat, places we could visit, we will recommend to our friends and others to visit anytime."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Brad and Eileen’s studio loft; perfect for our needs….quiet, gorgeous views, lovely interior, comfortable bed, super thoughtful hosts (we happened to stay during a deep freeze in the weather- they provided an ice scraper for our car and offered extra clothes). They provide suggestions for interesting sights and activities to do in the area (bird watching is phenomenal - in our short stay we say eagles, snow geese, short eared owls, great blue heron). We hope to stay again this year."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Brad & Eileen’s and we were equally as happy with this visit as we were before. This location can’t be beat if you’re a fan, like me and my husband, of bird and nature photography. It’s well appointed with everything you might need to make for a fantastic experience. If you find you didn’t bring warm enough clothing, they have you covered with hats, clothes, boots, you name it. We spent New Year’s Eve here and it was quiet, peaceful and the sunrise as well as the sunset was wonderful. And you have an amazing view of Mt. Baker from the kitchen window! And their cat is as friendly and welcoming as Brad and Eileen. Note: I’ve shared this listing with numerous friends only with the understanding that they don’t dare stay here when we want it! 😁"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time coming and it was just as lovely as the first. It is a beautiful area for biking!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My third time here. Fantastic place for bird watching. You can watch eagles fly from the windows and listen to the geese as they fly over. Mt Baker from view on one side, the Olympia on the other. The apartment has everything you need. Great place to stay"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the rural setting and the vistas! We were able to hike, explore LA Conner and watch the farmers harvest potatoes. Great quiet place to unwind!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic!!! Heaven on earth.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location of Brad & Eileen’s Airbnb. The views are endless with fields for days to the west and Mount Baker across the fields to the northeast is a gorgeous view to wake up to. The studio was warm and comfortable, very inviting and felt like home. We enjoyed exploring the area with its numerous farm stands and gorgeous parks for hiking. Brad & Eileen were super responsive to messages and also offer the use of their Level 2 charger if you drive electric, this was definitely an added bonus. We’d certainly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's place was even better than expected. It was very tastefully decorated with attention to every detail. Extremely comfortable place to stay, relax, and to do day trips from. We highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect spot for some peaceful down-time. Gorgeous views of Mt. Baker and glorious sunsets. Lovely rural setting; cornfields, chickens, lots of wildlife (birds….heard great horned owls calling right out side the window the last night I was there). Tastefully appointed with everything one needs in kitchen and bathroom. Definitely my new go-to when I need to be in the Skagit area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This above the garage fully furnished apt literally had anything you could think of. Forgot something? They likely had it stocked. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs and you can tell who put thought into their guests and who treat them like numbers. I really felt at home and appreciated the responsiveness of Brad and Eileen. If I’m in this area, I would definitely stay here again. Great location for a wedding we attended nearby. Comfortable bed, and great water pressure in the shower!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brad and Eileen were welcoming and kind. Their place is peaceful and relaxing. I would happily stay here again!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad & Eileen's place is even more beautiful than the pictures... windows on three sides meant we could watch both sunrise and sunset, it was drop dead georgous. We have already booked a return visit during the Tulip Festival next year!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we love this place! very quiet and restful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved Brad & Eileen’s sanctuary in the woods. The views and vibe were incredible. Quiet. Conway is one of the most beautiful places I’ve been. Thank you for your hospitality. I’ll be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place for a retreat! It is quiet and beautiful inside and out. I loved the views of the farmland and mountains. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely consider staying again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! Just spent a week here with my partner and explored the surrounding area, including Seattle and North Cascades National Park. Brad and Eileen’s home was the most serene and peaceful place. We had a very active and busy vacation and were thus very grateful to have such a restorative space to come back to at the end of each day. The sunsets are outstanding! Already can’t wait to come back 😊"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful and relaxing place in the middle of the fields. Room is big and comfortable, with big windows all around so you can see the fields and Mount Baker from your bed. Also has a great desk for working. Just 10 minutes from downtown Mount Vernon. Recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our third stay at one of our favorites. So many considerate and carefully thoughtful things: extra pillows and blankets, plenty of towels, good TV, night lights, clever kitchen options, fan and air conditioner and more. Brad and Eileen are great hosts in a lovely peaceful location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Brad and Eileen were away during our stay, but checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed and to make sure our stay was going well. They were very quick in responding to our original questions. They provided clear and thorough instructions and suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed. The area is beautiful and there is a great view of Mount Baker from the window of the unit. The studio was just as advertised and was a very fun place to stay. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful place. Very clean. Thank you to the owners, for this little treasure."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great stay! Lovely little, quiet spot. Just what I needed to rest and refresh and perfect spot for exploring the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen’s studio is very peaceful, private and comfortable. There is a notebook with suggestions for everything you’ll need. I wish we had been able to take advantage of the walk/hike suggestions but maybe next time! I recommend staying in Brad and Eileen’s studio, especially if you’re a nature lover. Lots of birds, geese and bunnies in the area. They have a dog but I never heard a peep out of him: so well behaved!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is great! I got an awesome view of the sunrise! Brad & Eileen were also gracious with allowing me a late checkout
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Brad & Eileen provided an oasis away from home. The near 360 degree view of the Skagit Valley was a breathtaking view that changed daily. The lodging provided all the amenities I needed. The hospitality offered by Brad & Eileen exceeded my expectation & I look forward to staying with them on my next Pacific Northwest trip.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home away from home! Favorite hosts, favorite Airbnb, will continue to visit over and over."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a repeat guest, Brad and Eileen's space is starting to feel like a ""second home"" to me. I enjoy solo getaways, and their place is very peaceful, quiet and clean. The bird life is magnificent, as are the views. The location is perfect for either staying put and just relaxing or taking day trips: La Conner, Bellingham, Camano Island.
Brad and Eileen are wonderful hosts and great communicators. Everything I could possibly need is in the space, and I can't wait to go back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as comfy & peaceful as I remembered!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here multiple times, and over the years the cleanliness and comfort have never wavered. Terrific location for birding, with hotspots in all directions, from two minutes to thirty minutes. Plus in winter there are swans and bald eagles all around the property."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The studio was clean, cozy and had everything we needed. Brad and Eileen were timely in responding to questions. We hope to come again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my 2nd time at Brad & Eileen's, both have been perfect. I lucked out with crystal blue skies, a view of Mt Baker in one direction, the Olympics in the other. Thousands of snow geese flew right over. Was able to watch swans & eagles out the windows. The place has everything you need, the hosts are very nice & accommodating. I'll be back again & again :)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing quiet and serene place with all amenities provided. The hosts are amazing to talk to and we loved our stay. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location!!! Bob & Elaine’s studio is not only immaculate and well appointed but in the best location possible for bird photography. I only wish we had stayed here in years past. The complimentary home pressed apple cider and honey made this studio even sweeter. Will be watching for openings again in the near future."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just returned from an excellent long weekend at Brad and Eileen’s studio, using it as a home base for all the amazing hiking in the area as well as a nice respite from the rest of the world. It had everything I needed, nothing I didn’t. Don’t hesitate to book if you’re looking for a getaway to Skagit Valley."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, cute, quiet country setting."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the peace and beautiful setting - great sunsets! Loved hearing the train and doves. We had everything we needed. Very cosy and close to town.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a lovely little place, perfectly situated and close to everything. Quiet and private, homey and safe. I highly recommend and I'll be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was perfect. It was extremely clean, organized, and well planned! The view from the kitchen window was worth the trip alone!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a wonderful place - the location is serene, and the studio is very well thought out and clean. The hosts are kind and welcoming. This was one of our best Airbnb experiences. We highly recommend Brad and Eileen's place, and hope to come back again!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second visit to this dandy studio in a magical location on Fir Island. Easy access to all of the natural beauty nearby as well as the fun towns of Conway, La Conner, and Mt . Vernon. The studio is comfortable and cleverly well equipped with everything you might need. And such nice people! We will be back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean with everything we needed. Delightful!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say anything but good things about this place! It was so cozy, clean, and exactly what I was looking for. I was able to work remotely during the day and travel to North Cascades in the late afternoon. The scenery and sunsets were beautiful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the best Airbnb I have stayed at. Glad I was able to get 8 nights to soak it all in. Great quiet country roads to bike right from the front door.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Brad and Eileen's while we were in Skagit County for our wedding. The studio is very peaceful, with large windows that look out onto farmland. We wished we would have had more time to enjoy the place, especially the deck! It was perfect for our needs - space for two people to spread out, simple kitchen set up, and very reasonably priced. Brad and Eileen were very responsive and gracious hosts. Thanks again and we hope to stay there again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room is so airy and light with a wonderful view. Brad and Eileen are such gracious hosts. Thanks for the great stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely wonderful! We stayed for a week and it’s a beautiful property with lovely views. Perfect for a relaxing, peaceful and quiet getaway with easy drives to gorgeous hikes. Brad and Eileen were very easy to communicate with, available for questions and just nice people. Definitely recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mountainview Studio, as a B&B location, has set the bar of excellence so high that other B&Bs will find it extremely difficult to match the location, cleanliness, comfort, accommodations, and service that the hosts provide. We would recommend Mountainview Studio to anyone and we intend to return at some later date. You can't go wrong with Brad and Eileen's, Mountainview Studio in Skagit Valley, Washington."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was lovely! Communication was great.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and the best sunset ever! Brad and Eileen's place was very comfortable and peaceful. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brad and Eileen were wonderful hosts. The studio was perfect. I will definitely return in the future!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit was very nice. It was super clean and very well supplied. I will definitely stay there again when I am in the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in quite a few rentals over the past 6months, but this space tops them all. It has views, comfort and relaxation, nearby activities/shopping/food, and wonderful hosts!
You can view Mt Baker through the window while in bed, and it is stunning. The bed itself is one of the comfiest I’ve slept in. The unit setup is practical, with all necessities at hand, but there are also many personal touches to make you feel at home.
Nearby are ample outdoor activities if you enjoy hiking or biking. In less than 5 minutes you can drive to the Skagit Wildlife Recreation area, which is an easy walk filled with nature and mountain views. I can do it justice with words, but just know it’s worth it. Also close by is a neat shop/cafe, Snow Goose Produce, and the charming town of La Connor. I could spend weeks here and never get bored.
While the unit is extremely private, I also had the pleasure of getting to know Brad and Eileen and their sweet pup, Hugo. They are such warm and welcoming hosts and I look forward to visiting with them again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Peaceful retreat. Thank you!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great view from all windows. Quiet peaceful spot.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, tranquil slice of heaven! We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing here - it was so quiet! Great place to get away from it all. We enjoyed wandering the organic farm attached to the property, seeing the chickens, watching the bees, viewing the birds, and watching farm fields getting worked.
Brad and Eileen's place was super cozy with so many thoughtful details that was very tastefully decorated. They had games, blankets, binoculars, books, as well as all the small kitchen appliances you'd need.
They were very prompt to reply to messages, and were kind and caring hosts.
I Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was delightful - the apartment is beautiful, with views on all sides and a very comfortable bed. The apartment was clean, directions and check in were super easy. The owners are very friendly and kind.
We will absolutely stay here again!
The only note we have is that you can hear people in the garage workshop, so if you are a light sleeper and you are planning to sleep in, you may want to bring earplugs.
Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, comfortable retreat, easy access. This would not be for you if you wish to be in a city but if that is not the case this would be for you! Great communication!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brand and Eileen have the most quaint and peaceful Mountain View loft nestled in the beautiful country side of Skagit Valley. We found it to be perfectly positioned near tulips, La Conner, Mount Vernon, and Anacortes to enjoy the experience of many adventures. They are perfect hosts with a spectacular view of Mount Baker with many birds to watch as well. Such a gem!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful studio, centrally located to explore the area. Looking forward to our next stay with them!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly what I was looking for. I only wish the weather had made enjoying the balcony an option!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and clean, centerally located for all Skagit valley. Will definitely use again."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a repeat guest here. Brad and Eileen are gracious hosts. This is a very special place, and the location is a slice of heaven! I enjoy taking day trips to La Conner, Camano, Bellingham, and also enjoyed hiking up Little Mountain in Mt. Vernon. Everything is super close, but I also recommend not leaving at all!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and pretty

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an easy stay. The Drama Majors in us loved the decore. Super quiet and very comfortable. Amazing peaceful views. Do not hesitate great place. Will be our go to place to stay
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the studio. It was perfect for what I went for, a getaway alone for some peace, quiet and reflection. It was just as described and pictured and very comfortable and spacious for a studio. It's a good idea to bring some food with you otherwise you have to drive into LA Conner or Mt Vernon which aren't that far but far enough that you can't go out real quick to grab some food because there isn't much around there. Communication with hosts was quick and they provided detailed instructions for checking in etc. I would definitely go back for another getaway. I was able to see the sunrise and the sunset both from the windows as they said."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot and gem of a find for us as my husband is a birder. Great views of Mt Baker and swans and all sorts of migrating birds all viewable from the Airbnb. 5 min drive or bike ride to more WDFW birding spots. Unique to be out in the farmland with few homes around, perfect for us! And the rental was lovely and cozy with plenty of thoughtful touches. Great hosts easy to communicate with and gave us privacy as well."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen’s place was an awesome respite for us. We were there under challenging circumstances, and it was great to have such a comfortable place to come back to and just relax. The views of the farmland were wonderful and with windows on 3 sides we could see in all directions. Bed was great and the little tv sitting area was comfortable. We would definitely come back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's studio is charming, immaculate and in a great location. I enjoyed day trips to Bellingham, LaConner, Bow-Edison and Camano Island. However, it would have been just as fun to cozy in and stay at the studio.
The studio is well designed, super comfortable and quiet. The small kitchen is cleverly appointed and suited for easy meals.
The views from the studio are spacious. I enjoyed watching the bird life (eagles, heron, etc.)
Everything was wonderful. Communication, directions, check-in. Brad and Eileen are lovely people. I'm so happy that I found this little gem and hope to be back soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, lovely space with beautiful views, quiet retreat away from the city. Brad & Eileen are kind and thoughtful, and very considerate of guest privacy and needs."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and wonderful place to stay! Brad and Eileen were great hosts!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen Are amazing hosts and the Studio is so great! I couldn’t get enough from the stunning sunsets and sunrises! So peaceful and beautiful.
So grateful for those two to share this place with the Airbnb world! Definitely coming again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little loft space! Very comfortable and very clean. Brad and Eileen were great with getting us set up and making sure we had everything we needed. In the spirit of full transparency, the hot water for showering does run out fairly quickly, but as long as you don't plan on a long shower, it was great!
We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, well maintained. Super peaceful and quiet, good escape from the city noise."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a very cozy studio space to come back to while exploring WA. We truly felt like we were in the middle of a little slice of heaven. They ensured we had everything that we needed during our visit and felt welcomed. The space (besides being cozy) was very clean and well stocked. And access/entry to the studio was contactless and easy, and felt like it was its own separate enough space, that felt almost like it’s own private getaway. Brad and Eileen are excellent hosts. They ensured we had plenty of privacy and places to enjoy the beautiful outdoors on their property. And although we saw them briefly and at a distance, it was so lovely getting to know them and their knowledge of the area. We truly enjoyed our conversations, and wished they had been a bit longer."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mountainview Studio. It was perfect. Very cozy and well appointed. It was well situated; a perfect place from which to explore La Conner and Anacortes and the surrounding areas. You can also see Mount Baker out the window! It is well-stocked with helpful items (even a telescope and guitar). There were even many board games to choose from. Brad and Eileen are great hosts.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful getaway for our anniversary!
The studio is spotlessly clean and well equipped.
We were there on a particularly hot weekend and the fans did well to keep the place relatively comfortable until the cool evening breezes come in to finish the job for extra comfy sleeping.
Eileen and Brad are absolutely wonderful hosts. Perfect combination of friendly and respectful of privacy.
We will definitely be returning, perhaps in the fall/winter for the snow geese!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An immaculate, lovely and well thought out studio with everything you might need: clever little kitchenette, ""view"" balcony, lots of electrical outlets, good lighting, comfy bed, good WiFi and TV and even little things like kleenex and cloth napkins. A beautiful and quiet location."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brad and Eileen were very responsive & great hosts! The studio was very comfortable and we had a great stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This farm country studio apartment is very comfortable, private and clean. We enjoyed morning walks to the river, the country air and mountain views when the skies allowed. The location is perfect for visits to La Conner, Anacortes, Bellingham and surrounding communities. You will most likely enjoy your stay here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen have a very nice, clean place in a beautiful area of Washington. We highly recommend staying here."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen’s place is super clean, communication is excellent, the view from the room is gorgeous, the drive to nearby town are convenient, the drive to North Cascades is about 1-2 hours depends on which trail you choose. I will recommend this place."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place with beautiful views of the mountains. It was very private and had quite a few restaurants within a short drive. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely clean place. Even had ground coffee available:))
Nice walking right out the front door."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my fourth time at Brad and Eileen's. If you're looking for a comfortable accommodation filled with light and serenity, this is the place. I'm an avid cyclist, and the riding opportunities from Brad and Eileen's are fabulous. The 15 mile ride to La Conner had almost no cars to fret over. I just keep coming back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful. The views were amazing. Perfect retreat. Response time was very quick. All around great place to stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home! We loved staying here!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely and relaxing property. Located on Fir Island, the property is on a farm with birdsong and mountain views. The hosts could not have been more nice and we had some fun conversations.
The space is not really conducive to full on cooking but that's not really a problem as there are so many brewpubs, bakeries, and restaurants in the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Didn’t want to leave this peaceful, bright, comfortable home with great hosts! The setting is beautiful and away from the (quiet) road, feeling secluded. I needed a quiet space with no distractions and was very happy to only hear sounds of nature and distant farming. Plenty of birds to watch from the big windows overlooking fields/garden. Really appreciated the private balcony with chairs/table to eat outside in sun or shade during the record-breaking heatwave. It was great to know my hosts were next door if needed, ready and willing to help, providing electric fans and checking all was well via Airbnb messages - excellent communication - and I was blessed with privacy! Best balance! The large studio space was homely, beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Many interesting objects, art, books, games, and a file of useful info. I found the kitchenette to have all I needed for basic cooking and a beautiful view of Mount Baker. Great shower with quality products provided. Wondered if I would miss having a bathroom sink but it was not an issue at all. I really appreciate good quality bedding, towels etc and had more than I needed to feel at home. Thank you so much for thinking of the details!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barb and Eileen's studio is tranquil and in the most beautiful location. The well appointed space has big windows all around that look out on the lush Skagit farmlands with a straight shot to Mount Baker. I would love to be there when the snow geese visit the region! Our stay coincided with unprecedented heatwave which was a challenging without AC but the open screened windows and fan helped immensely.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our time at this garage apartment studio in the Washington countryside. Brad and Eileen were very respectful of our space, and had prepared our room to be very clean and welcoming prior to our arrival. We did catch the tail end of a “heat wave” that was rolling through, but it cooled off nicely with windows open and a fan going once the sun went down. Plenty to do within a short drive of here, as well as board games and TV in the studio space. Lovely place, and we would love to stay again next time we are in town!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen have an awesome space in a beautiful location. We were easily able to explore the Skagit Valley on up to Bellingham while staying there. The rental had a lot of space and was very comfortable, with lots of thoughtful touches. The views were outstanding, and the hosts were friendly. Highly recommended."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen have a great place and are very attentive hosts! The suite is really its own little sanctuary with wonderful views and everything you might need. The setting is very rural, but within an easy drive to many cute shops, great restaurants and other amenities. If you're looking to get away for a bit on your own or with a partner, this is the perfect spot :-)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me see, where should I start! Mountain View is an incredible, peaceful, enjoyable, relaxing place to spend your time away from home. Every morning we awakened and looked out the inviting windows and watched the rabbits hopping around on the grass, birds flitting everywhere full of song. Two mornings we caught sight of the duck family, mom and six little ducklings, as they swam in the canal that wanders by. I looked out one afternoon when we’d popped in to regroup and there was a bald eagle in the field!
The room itself is very well appointed having everything to make your stay comfortable. The decorating is very tasteful and inviting, the bed comfortable, the kitchenette conveniently stocked.
The location is great. You can be to freeway and several towns in just minutes. Ideal!
And Brad and Eileen are warm, welcoming and pleasant to visit with should you get the chance.
We look forward to returning."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's place was beyond what I expected. The studio is even more beautiful and cozy than the photos can portray, the views out both sides are spectacular, and everything was in impeccable condition. Even my clients on video calls remarked on the lovely decor behind me! Brad and Eileen were extremely welcoming, warm, and communicative, yet also unintrusive as they knew I was working while I stayed there. I felt totally peaceful, comfortable, and at home there. I would gladly return."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The serine location is amazing. such a peaceful place. Great use of the space.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, quiet, clean, easy. Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and lovely accommodations! Only thing to be aware of is there is only one sink for dishes and bathroom uses. It was no problem for me as a one person stay but couples may want to know. Truly a lovely spot and Brad and Eileen were gracious and respectful hosts. Would come back again!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were taking the NOLS Wilderness First Responder course across the highway in Conway and were so lucky to find this pastoral oasis that we could retreat to every lunch and evenings. The birdsongs were spectacular every morning as the mist rose from the fields below the splendor of Mt Baker. Warm, inviting, and calm welcomed us home every day to catch up on studying, enjoy a meal by the culvert, or walk into town for a tasty burger at the Conway Pub. Take a run along the river, a paddle in the waterways, and meander around this verdant gem of land, the Skagit Valley. We stayed for 10 days and were ready to stay longer, great hosts, kitchen supplies, and a very comfy bed!"
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Brad & Eileen provided such a clean, quite and private space for us to enjoy this year for the Tulip Festival! The property is beautiful and shows how much they both care about hospitality and value the natural preservation of Skagit Valley. We hope to stay here again in the future, only suggestion is to possibly replace the mattress in the room-otherwise can’t beat the location and beautiful farm views of this place!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apt over the garage is a very well thought out space and was a delight to stay at. The big picture windows showed off the lovely Skagit Valley. The kitchenette had everything you needed. The bed and linens were cozy and comfortable and the shower perfect. My husband was delighted to see a heron, 2 hawks, and an owl from the deck as the sun was setting. It was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday and view the tulip fields."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileens place is a quiet clean studio equipped with everything thing we needed. We packed a lot into everyday and having a quiet place to come back to important and this location didn’t disappoint. It might look remote but we quickly found it to be a beautiful drive and close to all the places I had on my list. We are already planning a return trip!
."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little space!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third time at Brad and Eileen's place in four months and it's a quiet and peaceful home away from home!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay. The views are lovely and I loved seeing so many birds. I liked being able to make some small meals. The bed was comfy and I appreciate the cozy blankets.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's place is wonderful and one of our all time favorites at this point. It is very peaceful and calming, a great place to get away from the hustle of our daily lives. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings with birds chirping, ducks in the fields, and we even got to see a spectacular migration of snow geese. I am not exaggerating when I say we saw miles of them flying across the sunset horizon. We couldn't believe how many there were and how long it went.
The studio itself is beautifully appointed, super clean, and very comfortable. And with views out every window. We said we'd put these finishes in our own home. Brad and Eileen were available to answer any questions we had, but left us in peace otherwise. And it is a very short distance to everything we wanted to check out; the Tulip Festival in Mount Vernon, Anacortes, and super cute La Conner. We'd definitely come back even if just to relax and get away from it all."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet, natural getaway not far from the city - perfect for our anniversary weekend with beautiful nearby hiking and great restaurants. Brad & Eileen's studio is cozy, incredibly clean, spacious and in a lovely setting we viewed from all-around windows. They are kind and clear hosts. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brad and Eileen are incredible hosts! They are extremely responsive and flexible. During our trip, we experienced an unexpected snow storm that prevented us from making our trip up to Mt. Vernon. Brad and Eileen kindly offered to postpone our trip at no extra cost. I have never had such kind and thoughtful hosts before!! They were also very attentive to landmarks we wanted to visit on our trip and provided us with a special itinerary filled with our requests."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen’s place could not be more ideal! Lovely place, comfortable furnishings, fantastic hosts, and everything you might need. Perfectly situated for bird watching or exploring. The hosts provided maps and information as well. We can’t wait to go back."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a magical place. Fall asleep to an owls hoots, wake up to an eagles trill. View of mt baker out one side, the Olympics out the other (if they choose to peak out from the clouds). Perfectly located on fir island for your bird watching fix. The spotless apartment has everything you need for a lovely stay. Enjoy!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway for bird enthusiasts. Clean, comfortable!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second time staying at Brad and Eileen's in less than a month. It was fantastic!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderfully cozy space with so many thoughtful touches. My boyfriend and I spent a quiet NYE here and it was the perfect escape. I loved getting to see al of the geese and walking around the nearby slough area. Check in was very easy and communication was good. I’d love to go back sometime! Oh, and this is not a big deal but just so you know there is only one sink in the kitchen (not in the bathroom) which could be a thing for some people, but we found it workable!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came for a solo retreat away from family responsibilities. Loved it! Views were amazing and the place was spacious for one, quiet, and had everything I needed. Self catered some meals and ate outdoors for others. Be aware that some of the birds outside can be very loud, so bring earplugs!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely lovely! If you’re looking for a cozy get away, that’s exactly what you’ll get. I highly recommend staying ❤️"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent a lovely 3 day weekend at this lovely studio. It is so very nice. The pictures are very accurate - however it doesn't catch the little thoughtful details Brad and Eileen have provided.
The location is very close to the tulip fields near La Conner. It is extremely restful. Laconner and Mt. Vernon are about 15 minutes away.
I would highly recommend this studio for a lovely, quiet, restful time!!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my third time staying at Brad and Eileen's, which should say all about their studio. It epitomizes privacy, charm and romance. Well removed from the master house, the studio offers real peace and quiet, with wonderful views of the surrounding farm country and Mt Baker. The studio, moreover, is well appointed, charmingly decorated, and spacious, equipped even with a powerful telescope for star gazing. If you like the Skagit Valley, this a great place to stay."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The suite was VERY beautiful. Super clean and smells really good! I loved all the furnitures and displays. Really felt like home. We were also fortunate to have good weather during our stay over the weekend. I loved waking up in the morning and putting down the window blinds to see the magnificent views of the mountains, clear skies and also the vast fields. Such a sweet escape from the busy city life in Seattle. Will definitely come back if we get the chance!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time both enjoying the view on sunny days and holing up with a book on a rainy day. It is a charming space with a great location and a world class view.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"CLEAN. Very clean space, smelled so fresh as well. Pictures are great but 10x better when you actually arrive. Views are awesome, quiet spot. Studio has a lot of character, great designs, great selection of board games and books, the layout was perfect. We’ll be staying here again. Thanks again, Brad and Eileen!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Brad and Eileen’s place! Thoughtfully decorated, and beautiful views in every direction."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing people, quick responses, great stay!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed at Brad and Eileen's place, which says everything. The space is very private, very comfortable, and quite romantic."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen’s place is such a gem. Where to start? First, the views across the picturesque landscape are spectacular. The space itself is quite generous and there are tons of personal touches that make it feel like home. It's so pleasantly quiet but not too far of a drive to La Conner or Mt. Vernon. Brad and Eileen also gave us some great tips on nearby farmstands and restaurants. We can't wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Mountain View suite is a gem. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The views from the suite are wonderful and the rural location is stunning, relaxing, and quiet. Don’t let the rural location dissuade you - there are restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It’s only a couple miles from I-5. Historic La Conner is a quick drive 15 minute drive and Anacortes is less than 30 minutes away if you are heading to the San Juans."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location.....quiet and peaceful. Close to downtown La Conner for dining. The apartment is stylishly decorated, the bed is very comfortable, and the apartment smells wonderful. The grounds are beautiful. I really enjoyed my stay, I will return!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Its a beautiful clean spacious studio lovingly put together. Views out the windows were an expanse of green farmland on both sides of the home. The surrounding area has few or no cars, it is very level so its a perfect place to bicycle if you are needing an relaxing easy place to ride. There is a park nearby with a boat launch to the river. Its a short distance to Mount Vernon with a wonderful food coop, a huge used book store and a variety of eating spots. The hosts were thoughtful folks and due to Covid they kept to themselves although were responsive if I had a question. There was an info booklet giving area tips and restaurants. Quiet and peaceful."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's studio is fabulous! The views are amazing and the location is peaceful, yet close to fun restaurants and shopping. We felt comfortable and very safe, particularly during the current pandemic. The bed was so comfortable! Everything was lovely."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous Airbnb! Dying to return! Thank you so much.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cute! Very comfortable, great views and great people! Will be going back!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location. Excellent space. Wonderful hosts. I cannot recommend highly enough.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a relaxing atmosphere.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad and Eileen's studio was wonderful. The studio itself is spacious and well appointed. The location was isolated, in the middle of beautiful Fir Island, so the only sounds heard were those of nature, including the honking of wild geese. The views from the private balcony were lovely and serene. I spent a lovely three day cycling holiday and enjoyed myself thoroughly. Last, Brad and Eileen were great hosts, interesting conversationalists, while, at the same time, providing me with as much privacy as I wanted. I thought their listing was a great find."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location! Quiet, private, clean, and comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer. Just a great place to relax and unplug."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed with attention to the little details that made for a great experience. The views from the room were picturesque and it was easy to get to. Brad and Eileen were very communicative and even helped recommend some hikes for my husband and I to go on. It was a great place to relax and we would definitely stay again. Highly recommend!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a gem! Pretty close and easy to get to from I-5 and has a phenomenal view of the countryside. We loved their decorations (lots of old play props - so fun!) and taste in books and games (a few of my favorites were there)! The space was spotless and their communication was excellent. The toads were loud because of the warm summer nights but otherwise it was very quiet and relaxing. 5 stars for sure!

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very lovely calm and quiet place to get away. We really enjoyed our time in this little studio, sitting by the window and sipping warm tea while watching the sunset. There was a helpful packet of tourist tips provided by Brad and Eileen on the coffee table which was nice. We would definitely stay here again!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a clean and peaceful place! It's very private and nicely separated from the main house. The view is great and there's lots of wildlife to see. The location is very close to the freeway, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. Super happy with our stay!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable spot surrounded by farmland and lots of birds. If that sounds as good to you as it did to me, you'll love it as much as I did."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A winter birding and quiet retreat paradise! I'm a novice birder...and with the views of the valley from the studio, I saw so many birds just from the windows. I counted 12 species within the first hour of waking, including water birds because of the slough just on the edge of the property. It was a true delight to have a flock of thousands of snow geese fly over the studio nearly every morning and evening and land in the field across the way. There are also several nature preserves and hiking spots just within 10 miles of the property. If you are in need of quiet, solitude (or a coupled get-a-way), this is quite the spot. I didn't want to leave.
To note: it is a kitchenette, without stove. I managed to prepare simple meals for a few days stay just fine with the microwave."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"All around great experience! Amazing views, host and accommodations"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very convenient location to the North Cascades National Park (~1 hour) and close enough to still have accessibility to restaurants shopping. Will be a future preference when in the area again.

We would definitely stay with them again and you should too - Enjoyed meeting them both as well Hank 😁"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brad and Eileen’s place was a great spot for the personal retreat I used it for. The studio is open and very light, even when it’s gray and rainy outside thanks to all the windows. It’s quiet and the space was clearly well thought out when designed. I didn’t leave this sweet spot until I had too and Brad and Eileen granted me a bit extra time before check out as they were able to.
I had a hard time getting a strong enough signal to use the WIFI there, but my computer and iPhone are on the older side."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views with the big windows are great! We felt safe here with privacy, and it is a comfortable stay away from the city."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On my second visit, just as terrific an experience as my first. Stylish, clean, comfortable, quiet, and in my favorite corner of Skagit County.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great space. It's quiet and rural with gorgeous views of the surrounding farm land and mountains.

Their place is quite a retreat complete with a guitar, small niceties (decaf coffee, water, hand cream, etc) and it was beautifully decorated.

Paradise for birders in every direction. And if you like classy, clean, quiet and well-equipped, you will appreciate this suite. Extras include windows in every direction, trumpeter swans flying close overhead at dawn, and river otters in the slough below."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am a repeat customer with Brad and Eileen! Always crisply clean, lovingly appointed, feels like a real home.

It's bright, clean and quite comfortable (especially the bed!) and well equipped with everything I needed. There's no stove, but there's a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker and hot pot, a sink with a great mountain view, great linens and a comfortable sofa. Access is easy with a keypad, there's parking available and Eileen was quick to respond to queries. There's a packet of local information provided that's very helpful. It's quiet and comfortable. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Valley."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Brad and Eileen's place is well described and well photographed. No surprises except the beautiful views and super quite night. Everything was so comfortable I hated to leave for dinner. Next time I will bring a few food items. Communication was excellent. Brad was there when I arrived and very welcoming.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A small, cozy apartment with lovely views, a comfy bed, and peace and quiet. Brad and Eileen made the whole process easy. Short drive to La Conner or Bow-Edison for food, shops, cafes. Dreamy to have it all to myself for a night, a good get-away. Fields, an orchard, barns out the windows. Stay here and see the flocks of Snow Geese in the winter."
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, relaxing and peaceful accommodations. The studio is nicely decorated and the amenities provide an enjoyable stay whether for a day or a week. A really great location. It is in the country yet close enough to everything you would want to see in the area. Check-in is self-managed and easy so we never felt our coming and going was an imposition to our hosts. Definitely would recommend."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would highly recommend it for a couple. The only negative is that there isn't a sink in the bathroom so one must use the kitchen sink to wash hands, shave etc."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is super calm and cute. We were there a very short time for our wedding night, and they left a thoughtful congrats message on the welcome chalkboard. It was perfect to relax after our busy wedding!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, relaxing retreat! Cute studio with lots of windows and amazing scenery even with the hazy weather we had. Definitely would recommend if you’re looking for a quiet spot outside of La Conner (about 20 min drive). The bed is a little firmer than I prefer but not bed. Everything felt clean and welcoming"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and hosts. I will return!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our 2nd stay and it was just as great as the first!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My Girlfriend and I stayed for 4 days and absolutely fell in love with the place and the surrounding environment. The goats on the property were really interesting and the barn cat Trixie was extremely friendly and affectionate . The inside pf the BnB had everything that we needed and more. The place was really clean and had a very comfortable bed with a very beautiful view of some mountains in the distance . This place is easily a 10/10 hidden gem in my book . I will definitely stay here again if im ever back in the area. We loved it here
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much Marie and Alex for hosting us!
My partner and I stayed for two nights for our anniversary and felt immediately like we had just arrived in heaven. The property and location of the unit is perfect in that it feels extremely private as there is nothing for miles in front of it. The hot tub was divine, especially during the rain. The goats were so sweet and friendly and we watched them for hours. Trixie is the sweetest cat I have ever met and she immediately climbed into my lap and fell asleep. If you are a cat lover, you will be pleasantly surprised.
The unit is a short drive into a cute little town with everything you need. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked and there were plenty of extra linens. The bed in the loft was extremely comfortable. One note is that the staircase up the loft is extremely steep. We left a light on to prevent any mishaps during the night.
We will for sure be returning. Thank you for leaving us tea and a bottle of wine!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a relaxing, romantic getaway. Peaceful surroundings, great view, and comfortable place. Also enjoyed bonding with their goats and cat :)"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was absolute adorable. Something that I think doesn't seem to be mentioned prominently enough are the goats. The large wall of windows that look out from the living room faces the goat enclosure. There were several very young goats frolicking about. It was essentially Goat TV. We spent a good amount of time just watching the baby goats bouncing around. It was surprisingly entertaining.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful area, cozy space, and responsive owners."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and amazing views. Will definitely come back again if we’re in the area

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful romantic getaway….I’m sure you will too :-) Thank You Marie & Alex we appreciate your hospitality :-)"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay. Only for one night but wish we could have stayed for more.
Super easy to find. Marie and Alex provided easy to follow instructions for how to get in. There was also a folder of a bunch of things to do in the area. Super clean and spotless. The hot tub is clean and great. The place felt super private. The bed was very comfortable with nice pillows and the view from the loft was AMAZING! You could see fields that stretched onto the mountains. Quick word of advice, bring a sleep mask if you want to sleep in!Would definitely recommend for a quick trip out of town for a night or for a weekend.
The goats and cat were an added bonus!"

So many fun things we didn’t get to do. We want to come back soon!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at the Granary! It was quiet, private, and I loved being out in the farmland.

The location is great - it's just down the street from Roozengaarde and is a quick trip into town. I'd absolutely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful little house

Also makes it very easy to get to La Conner, the flower fields and surrounding area. We enjoyed being greeted by the goats each morning. Hosts were very responsive. The granary was very attractive - nice place to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a private place with a private view, clean hot tub, and access to animals like goats (and for us, a cat), then this is the place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was quiet and peaceful. Enjoyed the hot tub under the moonlight.

Marie and Alex were very proactive and responsive with check in instructions making everything very easy and concise. The granary was an absolute dream. It is so quiet and has a very well stocked kitchen. We made all our meals without any issues here. Temperature was always perfect and the hot tub was such a bonus! We loved saying hello to the goats and Trixie the cat each morning when we woke up. The space was spotless and had all the amenities you would need. Would love to come back and stay here anytime we need a quiet space that feels like home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay!
2024-01-01,2,Stayed one night,"Don't be fooled, the stairs in the photos are actually a ladder. I cannot recommend this location to mobility impaired individuals. The pull out couch is not comparable to a comfortable bed.
They were nice enough to offer to get the bedding down from the loft for us, but we couldn't sleep here."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie and Alex's place was wonderful. We had a great time in the personal granary space, with the cat Trixie being the highlight of our stay. The goats were super cute, and the feel of the space was very farm-like, making us feel relaxed over the course of the 2 nights we spent. Marie and Alex were great hosts, responding to our concerns promptly. The hot tub was good too."

Would love to visit again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place! Beautiful view beautiful sunset extremely private so personable . Trixie Trixie became a quick part of our family.!
Who is Trixie you ask? The barn cat!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A peaceful getaway that felt very private. The full spice rack was an unexpected bonus. Overall, a great chill spot to get away for a night or two!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Granary was a slice of heaven on earth. The pictures are accurate. The setting was beautiful with gorgeous sunsets. The hot water supply was warm enough and lasted a long time, no rushed showers here! The home was stocked with the basic provisions needed to make my stay comfortable and easy. Some of my favorite parts of the stay were the goats and the barn cat, Trixie. These adorable furry friends greeted me each morning I left and each evening I returned. The hosts were friendly and available but not intrusive. I genuinely enjoyed my stay and hope to return very soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Definitely recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for a couple days and thoroughly enjoyed our visit! Truthfully Trixie the cat was the star of the show. She greeted us every time we got home and even hung out with us while we used the hot tub. It was painful to leave her outside! The space was cozy and the shower was warm and powerful. Great after a day of exploring. The location was quiet and secluded but we had easy access to restaurants and shops within a couple minutes of driving. The thai spot located in an old diner in Mt. Vernon was hands down the best Thai I've ever had BTW.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful time. The space was quiet and relaxing and we felt right at home. Everything we had hoped!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Modern, clean and well-furnished loft cabin, just as described. Convenient to I-5. Lovely property with a beautiful old barn.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This airbnb was so amazing. It’s the cutest little place and the aesthetic is beautiful. It’s right behind a barn with little pigme goats.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very relaxing and private stay, enjoyed the space and amenities immensely. Would definitely visit again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"""I don't even know where to begin expressing my feelings about this place. Right from the beginning, you receive an absolutely awesome welcome from the most adorable cat, Trixie. She is incredibly friendly and beautiful. Spending the night in the hot tub under the stars with her company was a moment I'll cherish forever. The interior of the place is even better than the photos depict. Waking up to the sunlight streaming through the large front windows with a view of a super clean and slightly foggy field was amazing. Yes, I wholeheartedly recommend this incredible place; it's absolutely worth it."""
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful stay at the granary! It was the perfect spot after our adventures in the North Cascades National Park. The space was unique and cozy, and surrounding areas are serene. Being able to enjoy the hot tub with the amazing views after a strenuous few days hiking was a highlight. The hosts had some great recommendations for food and activities that we really enjoyed - adrift for dinner, and mount erie for sunset. The wifi was good for 2 of us to work remotely. Maybe our favorite part - the barn cat Trixie who would hang out with us on the deck. She was the sweetest cat we have ever met.
Thank you so much for a great stay! We really hope to be back one day!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed here the night of our wedding due to proximity to our venue. It’s a beautiful and peaceful space. I wish we got to spend more time here. It is a bit on the pricy side.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pasture view from the hot tub was exactly what we wanted, and even though we didn’t see the goats we fell in love with the barn cat. Spotless house, modern finishes, such a comfy bed! The hosts were great, very responsive when we had an issue and needed to check in early. I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is like a home away from home.
We really enjoyed our time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing place. The sunset right in front of the porch makes for a relaxing night. The whole place was extremely clean. Definitely recommend turning on the fan sooner than later, the upstairs gets pretty toasty on hot days. Other than that, amazing stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! Super cute space, comfortable bed, and beautiful views!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful, peaceful, relaxing stays ever. The very private back deck with hot tub and amazing views of the countryside and Mount Erie on San Juan Island was spectacular at sunset. The kitchen was well-stocked with all the basics to cook full meals. I went to the grocery store and made every meal there. The AC was powerful!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fantastic! Gorgeous location, very quiet and relaxing. The house itself is wonderful too, and we really enjoyed the hot tub on the back deck. We were just passing through but wished we had more time to stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at Marie and Alex's place. It was the perfect amount of space for two people. They were very responsive and allowed us to receive packages a few times during our stay, even getting a package that ended up in their mailbox and delivering it to our door within minutes of finding out it was in the mailbox. We enjoyed evenings in the hot tub while watching the beautiful sunset and the funny antics of the goats. The inside space was lovely and the outdoor space made the trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie and Alex's small barn is a wonderful space to relax in.
You have a wonderful view over the fields to the mountains in the distance.
In the apartment you will find everything you need. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Surroundings are very quiet, so you can sleep excellently and explore the surroundings during the day.
Seattle or Vancouver can also be reached for a day trip.
Once we plan a trip to the Seattle area, we will surely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! Friendly and responsive host. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, loved the interior design and modern touches. Peaceful location. Watching the goats play was very entertaining and the cat was very affectionate."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Granary was a wonderful anchor point for anyone wanting to explore Skagit county. It is only a short drive from Mount Vernon and a 14 minute drive to La Conner. Both towns have boutique shops, restaurants, and other activities to try out. Also, this is just minutes away from a wide number of trails and parks for you find a stroll through nature or curiously investigate some tide pools.
The Granary is comfortable, airy, and spacious for two people. It was quiet and relaxing. The sunset overlooking farmland and the mountains in the distance was stunning from the porch (or even the hot tub). While we didn't use the kitchen, it was well equipped for people who like to prepare their own food.
Marie and Alex were incredibly communicative and helpful in their responses. I highly recommend this as a retreat to the countryside."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marie and Alex’s quaint Airbnb is spectacular. It is only 10 minutes from bars, restaurants and breweries but when on the property you feel a million miles away from civilization. The home was extremely clean, vaulted ceiling with stunning floor to ceiling windows overlooking the farmland. The hot tub is a great addition to spend the evening. Steep staircase from the main floor to the bedroom loft just as an fyi. Would highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a comfortable place that we booked/stayed for one night on our way from Whistler in BC to Mt. Rainier in WA. Everything was great. We didn’t do anything in the area because we got to their place later in the day and left fairly early the following morning.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little spot! Beautiful interior, rustic exterior as described. You do share the yard with others (including goats), so not completely private or secluded, but very workable, and you can close blinds that direction if you want to feel more alone!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Granary. The surroundings were peaceful, and the hot tub was the perfect day to end a long day. The bed and linens were comfortable, and the place was overall very clean and comfortable."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at the granary, it’s a really cool place. Alex and Marie were very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is a peaceful view across farm fields to the coastal hills. This unit sits at the back of the property near the barn, so it's quiet, and pleasantly dark. Everyone mentions the cat... she is an absolute love and will climb all over you if allowed. The goats add a touch of comic relief.
Compared to other Air BnB places we have stayed, this one has a very nice kitchen. There are spices, pots and pans, cooking knives and utensils - everything you need for this kind of stay.
The loft is pleasant, and the upstairs windows continue the view to the west very nicely. The bed is very comfortable. But if you're someone who makes a lot of trips to the bathroom in the night, it's not the most convenient to climb down the ladder.
We enjoyed the little hot tub, even in the rain. They keep it at 102, but as they point out it heats up very quickly to 104. The jets don't do much, but its a good hot soak.
Really nice hosts, and we loved it!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area! Lovely house and a great view. Super friendly goats and cat :)

The granary itself was beautiful, spacious and clean. It was well stocked with things one might need, and very accessible.
Marie and Alex were wonderful hosts! The check in and check out guidelines were very clear and simple to execute. They were prompt to respond, and offered lots of great suggestions . I highly recommend staying at the granary, especially if you’re looking for a magical getaway. We would love to stay again."

The bathroom even had body wash that includes retinol!
The area is very peaceful. The host was very responsive and helped answer my questions.
Some things to note is that though we pay a cleaning fee, we are asked to clean up the dishes and linens before leaving."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A chic farmhouse getaway complete with hot tub and great natural lighting from spacious windows. The privacy was wonderful, just us and the goats and view of the horizon over beautiful farmland. The loft bed was fun to climb up to and also has a beautiful view in the morning. It does get hot at night because heat rises, so I would recommend using the fan next to the bed and/or turning off the heat. Shower is spacious and nice. We really enjoyed the thoughtfully curated assortment of furniture and decorations. Perfect place for my sister and I to enjoy a glass of wine at night and use as a hopping off point to Deception Pass and Bellingham."

We finished the day with a glass of wine and the sunset, watched a movie and slept over 8hrs on one of the most comfortable beds ever."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent Airbnb experience! The setting was quiet and peaceful. The back porch was a highlight, with great sunset views and also being able to watch the goats. The interior was extremely clean and well appointed — a good mix of modern and heritage touches. Wifi was solid, and I had decent cell phone reception (T-Mobile). The kitchen was stocked with essential equipment and tools, so it was easy to cook meals. I think the property has a couple of rentable spaces but I didn’t notice anyone else while there, so it felt pretty private. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing spot! Waking up to a beautiful view and the sweet faces of the goats. Marie & Alex didn’t forget anything! We were welcomed with a delicious bottle of wine and snacks! We’ll be back!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here for a long weekend! It's a great spot for working remotely and being nearby town amenities. Definitely recommend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay with Marie and Alex! Their place was beyond cozy and we felt spoiled for the time that we were there. We also fell completely in love with the goats and the farm cat, Trixie. What a delightful addition to a beautiful space. We would highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this cute house for our son and his new wife. Marie and Alex were wonderful hosts and helped arrange to have flowers and champagne delivered. Our son said everything was great! It was clean, nice amenities and good communication with the hosts. We would definitely stay here on a return trip to Mt Vernon/La Conner."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Marie and Alex’s place. The location is great - close to town but far enough away that it’s very quiet. The place was very clean and updated with modern amenities. We’ll stay again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully cozy home with the cutest goats! Exactly as described and close to everything we wanted to visit in the area. Great communication and a clean, comfy space."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little weekend getaway! Quiet and relaxing, looks exactly like the pictures. The place was exactly what we expected. Watching the sunset from the hot tub makes for a perfect night!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely idyllic and thoughtful space. We loved the layout of the space and the goats and hot tub were a fun bonus. Not to mention one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in. Can’t beat the sunset + Mt Erie views on the porch! Will definitely make a point to stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this place based off the previous reviews and they were spot on. This place was awesome, had everything we could need, and was spotless when we arrived. It has a full kitchen setup with anything you could need, even down to the spices and chopsticks! It also has a very big fridge that can hold a lot of food if you are needing to cook there. The bathroom was large and fully stocked with amazing smelling shampoo/conditioner/ and body lotion and comfy robes that fit curvy girls very well. The living room was set up beautifully and the couch was super comfy. The loft upstairs was a dream! The bed was very comfy and had felt like it had a memory foam topper on it. There is a window above the sliding doors that is perfectly aligned with the bed, so the view in the morning was amazing and probably my favorite part. They back deck has some rocking chairs that made watching the sunset perfect. The hot tub was awesome as well once the sun went down and it got chilly. The goats and the barn cat Trixie were an added bonus and so much fun to interact with. The hosts were also very good and quick with communication. Whether it be getting us an iron and steamer upon request or giving us recommendations for a place to get great seafood. They were awesome hosts! All in all we loved the Granary and our experience with the grounds. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be staying here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for those looking to escape the heat and sound of the city (as we did). The place stayed nice and cool even though the tall windows faced west and got direct sun. It was also pretty quiet except for the distant sounds of the road and the goats nearby. The goats were fun to watch and the barn cat is very friendly. There are also some great farms nearby for those looking for fresh produce.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW we loved this stay! Not only is the home incredibly well decorated, but you can't beat the view at sunset overlooking the farm. The animals were such a fun cherry on top of an amazing stay. I highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic experience: comfortable bed and well-stocked kitchen along with beautiful views, especially from the deck and hot tub. The Granary is a really stunning space and super clean. The goats and the sweet barn kitty were additional wonderful features. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands down the best Airbnb we have stayed at! The house was beautifully finished and decorated. We loved sitting on the back porch watching the sunset. The best part of all was having goats out your back door and a lovely cat that came to say hi every night. If we could have stayed longer, we would have!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The granary was great! Spacious, bright, and comfortable. Close to lots of amenities in Skagit County but nice and quiet. The goats and Trixie are the icing on the cake."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very tidy and more spacious even then the pictures looked. Marie and Alex overall had good timely communication, and even had an air mattress all set up for us when we got there. Our wedding was down the road so this house was a great location for us. Besides some farm animal noises which was expected the property was very private and quiet! The house had everything we needed for a stress free wedding weekend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best air bnb’s I have stayed in. Super clean, cute and in a great location. Place was extremely well stocked and had everything we needed. Self check in was easy."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful weekend getaway here for our anniversary. The house is very nice and cozy. The views of the farmland and mountains in the back were so lovely—-waking up to that view each morning from the loft bed was the best! The hot tub was also an added bonus! We thoroughly enjoyed the goats just outside our deck as well as the farm cat. Definitely looking forward to another visit here.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this stay for a quiet, peaceful relaxing experience. Can’t beat the views and four legged company"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay. Enjoyed watching the sunset from the hot tub every night! The goats are very cute, we loved watching them playing! This spot is a great location for exploring the cascades while still being in a town with creature comforts. Quick drive to the ferries as well. Highly recommend this place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 would recommend Marie and Alex’s place!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was incredible! We rented that farmhouse, barn, and granary all together to have our wedding party stay at for the weekend. Everyone commented that the space was ideal, with a huge kitchen for eating together, and plenty of space outside for social distancing if needed! The hosts provided a bottle of wine and chocolates which was just extra special! Communication was extremely fast when we couldn’t figure out how to turn on the shower or when we the power went out (county wide issue!). We couldn’t be happier with the stay!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The granary was spectacular. Perfectly clean, modern and the hot tub is perfect after a long day of hiking. The goats and cat (I hate all other cats but trixie) were the cherry on top. Would absolutely recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for our 20th Anniversary
Absolutely 💯 Loved it !!
Beautiful, Peaceful and Serene
The Goats & The Barn Cat Trixie were the best"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Location was perfect for my needs. Everything was clean. Kitchenette was tiny and I needed to request some little things for my stay. Azu responded quickly. I wish they didn't only leave plastic ware. It's not expensive (better for the environment) to just supply a pair of real silverware. Not a fan of not having control of the heat but she provided a variety of blankets, mini heaters and fans so it wasn't really bad.
I would stay again and recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Azucena's place was very clean and cozy. Neighborhood was peaceful and quiet and a short drive from anywhere in town, was a very nice stay."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Azucena’s place was perfect for the two of us for a quick weekend stay. It was true to the listing, very clean and all of the extra pillows and blankets were great! Thanks for sharing your home with us!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! We were in town for a pickleball tournament at Skagit Valley College which is just down the road so it was a super convenient location for us. the neighborhood is nice, it was clean, our bed was super comfy and she was easy to communicate with. Our only negative was that it doesn't have an oven or stovetop, but that was my bad for not looking closer at what I was booking, NOT a misrepresentation by any means. There is a fridge and microwave so we made it work! It was awesome and I would absolutely recommend this place :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great all the way around. Very comfortable and was perfect for my stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Azucena and Carlos have successfully made the single best private offshoot in a home that I have ever stayed in. Everything was well thought out in the space that they had to work with.
Clean, convenient, and perfect for a one-night stay."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good, homely place to stay in Mount Vernon. Lots of little things taken care of like a home. Very responsive host.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was wonderful and comfortable, We definitely Enjoy our stayed. Thank you 😊"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment is spotlessly clean, and beautifully furnished in a minimalist, very classy style. I especially enjoyed the beauty of the large bedroom.
The location is great, still in Mount Vernon, but in a quiet, residential neighborhood.
Communication with the hostess was excellent, and both she and her husband were very prompt in helping us out when we needed them.
Something that ought to be mentioned on the website, but isn't, is the fact that one needs to navigate three fairly high steps between the living room (with kitchenette) and the bedroom/ bathroom, and that there is no rail to hold onto. It would not be the right place for people with mobility issues."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great neighborhood and Azucena was so nice and helpful. Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a great deal in Mount Vernon!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with Azucena's place! It looked just like the pictures and was very clean. Her decor is super cute and it had many extra touches that added to a pleasant stay. It was very comfortable, cozy and quiet. It was easy to locate in a nice and pretty neighborhood.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Azucena's instructions were perfect, and the property description was very accurate. The space is extremely private... even though it is attached to the main house. We never heard the host, and it felt like we had our own private property. The living area is very comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom are very well decorated, and the bed is super comfy. It is on a private cul-de-sac with almost no traffic or noise whatsoever. It is a 10 minute drive to lakes, golf courses, and dozens of restaurants. We would absolutely stay here again. ---Shawn and Angie."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice and clean cozy place, warm and comfortable.
Great host, very responsive.
Would recommend this place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Yost really went above and beyond to make sure that I was taking care of, if I needed anything extra, communicated quickly, and were kind, helpful especially in unique circumstances. I have a lot of trust in them, and they really helped when I was coming from a big event with lots of supplies, busy schedule, limited capacity/extra stress, they made my time there so much easier.
The location is perfect with the easy side entrance in a quiet cul-de-sac with great nature lives in the neighborhood, which was quiet and peaceful. It was such a great value, I was almost surprised, and they accommodated me when I asked for an adjustment on my time there, and we’re really fair with pricing when they could have accepted more money, which makes a big difference for me. i just trust people who don’t just take the more money because They can, like a lot of profit-based operations. I had a faux paw I felt bad about and they were so gracious/understanding. Highly recommend :)"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I attended a wedding local to the area and preferred to stay in a more quiet place rather than a hotel. Azucena’s place was not only a great deal in price but their casita was just perfect for an overnight stay. The hosts were extremely helpful and responsive with any questions I had.

There was ample space and each room was set up with attention to detail. There were very comfortable beds and linen. The house was spotless. Things were easy to find, and our group was not wanting for anything. The thoughtful touches made everyone feel at home. Christine was helpful with her communication and was very timely with responses. It was helpful to read comments and recommendations from other guests in the guest book and there were helpful resources. We would definitely book this space next we visit because of the three bedrooms with comfortable and quiet rooms and a fully equipped kitchen. We were thrilled that we could use the laundry facilities. Would highly recommend this listing if you want comfort, quiet, and to have a home away from home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay. It was a pleasure being one of the first people to enjoy this space. It was beautifully decorated and plenty of dishes so we could have silverware for a day’s worth of meals. I would use this location again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, had everything we needed. Comfy bed/pillows. I was worried because the Airbnb is listed as a room with private entry that we would be hearing the hosts in their place next door, but the set up is perfect because the shared wall is in the bathroom. We hardly even heard the hosts which made us feel like we had the place to ourselves."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a nice overnight stay here while attending the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. The studio is well kept and cozy for two people, and Julienne was very kind to provide a lot of local recommendations for us to try.

My only qualm was that the apartment had a very rustic vibe to it which seemed well loved."

Both she and Clint were so welcoming and kind, and had lots of great suggestions for the area. The property is a perfect serene getaway but close to town and the Cascades, the suite is well appointed and cozy (the shower is amazing, especially after a long hike in the Cascades!), and all of their adorable animals were the icing on the cake. 12 out of 10 rating from us.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was comfy and the shower was amazing - large, good water pressure and hot. I enjoy ""mini"" items so finding them in the ""mini-manor"" was a treat for me - from butcher block to cooking surface. I especially appreciated the lighted extension cord plug-in.

It is attached to the host’s main home, but we never ran into the family (if privacy is your thing) but knew we could contact them if we were interested in doing things like riding bikes or using the fire pit. Their little farm was so cute and had an amazing view of the mountains! We enjoyed petting the cats and watching the ducks/chickens/guineas run around. We chose this Airbnb to have a place to stay while we could make a day trip out to North Cascades National Park - it was approximately a 1 hour drive to the park from this Airbnb, which was perfect for spending the whole day at the park and then coming back to clean up and rest. We enjoyed our stay!"

What you see in the pictures is what you see in person, even better! It brought me and my boyfriend so much comfort when we first entered the place. And it was so nice/made the stays so much better when we spoke to Julienne and her husband about the place, their animals, nearby locals, etc. They were the most kindhearted people I ever met.

*Otherwise,* this was a nice stay. I loved the cut dahlias in the room (end of September), and the shower was spacious, even luxuriant, for this price range. Also a legit old Nintendo Excitebike game! Julienne was communicative and welcoming.
Thank you!"

We loved the extra touches like the yogurt, granola bars, and detailed instuctuons on how everything works was awesome. The linens and towels and cleanliness were excellent with comfortable beds. It does not get a lot of light but the front room has a big sliding glass door to let some sun in. Would visit again!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well-located place. Not a lot of natural light but if you are out and about most of the time taking advantage of the area, as we were, that's not an issue. Overall a very well-appointed place."

We traveled 2.5 hrs to see the Tulip festival. Their Airbnb was spacious and they thought of everything. We lacked nothing. Super clean. Beds were very comfortable. Coffee/tea station and breakfast lite items were a nice touch. Additional instructions were very helpful. If we are ever back in the area, I would rebook with them in a heart beat. Thank you for a lovely stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was pretty out of it because I was spending one night after a six hour surgery but my cousin was with me and she confirmed that the place was clean. Other than the train, which goes by multiple times at night, it was quiet. The hosts were very responsive and messaged to let us know it was ready for check in an hour early (surgery lasted an hour longer than estimated, so we didn't need early entry but appreciated their willingness to allow it)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"really enjoyed this stay, it was a great place to stay with friends"

When we asked about wheelchair accessibility, Susan and Jim gave an accurate description of the level unit, but were honest about it not being ADA compliant. It worked perfect for my husband who uses a manual wheelchair. The neighborhood was perfect for walking our dog and very close to great food options. We would definitely stay again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This a extremely clean 🧼,lovely little place. t was suitable for our adult son but due to the beautiful breakable things I wouldnt bring a toddler. I was a little worried because of reviews about the noise, and yes, you can hear people walking around upstairs but it stopped promptly at 9:30/10 and it was perfectly quiet after that. House was very clean and the hosts were delightful. Beds were so comfy and I loved the signage to say what was softer and firmer. I felt very much at home. Well worth the money."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely trip, the beds were amazing, it was serene, clean and easy for us to get around, we had a Kuerig and no K cups but there were snacks and good instructions, and we liked it so much we would love to stay with Susan and Jim again."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, 5 minutes to a very quaint downtown area. Rental was clean, but bedding was disappointing, the sheets and pillowcases had a strong musty smell and the bed did not have a blanket, only sheets and a quilted bed spread that under normal circumstances I would have turned down to sleep but in this case I had to use it as a blanket and found it uncomfortable. That was our only disappointment though...it really was a nice stay for the two of us and we would stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was clean and spacious. It had all the amenities listed and then some. The bed was very comfortable.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and unique structure. very comfortable and cozy. the layout felt roomy and relaxing. one caveat is that person #2 had a hot shower for the first 4 minutes. Give time between showers for watertight hot again. Suggest they put screens on windows- weather was beautiful and I'd enjoy nobugs. Great experience with Shaun too. Helpful and accommodating.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at The Loft for 2 nights during our trip to see the flowers during the Skagit Valley Tulip month of April.

I had all of the amenities I needed plus things you would never get in a hotel. The train nearby was loud during the day (because…it’s a train) but I could not hear it at all while sleeping.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This space is wonderfully crafted. It is a very clean and well maintained. The hosts are very communicative through the application as well as in their instructions for your stay. One small but very helpful amenity was the labeling of the mattresses in each bedroom.

Microwave, electric kettle but no stove and washer/dryer.
The beds are a bit too soft us, even with the firmer one.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this Mt Vernon daylight basement home. The owners live above and you do hear them off/on but they are quiet during normal sleeping hours. We enjoyed the location and the great patio. Although it was very hot outside, the patio and the house stayed quite cool. We only turned on the A/C very briefly a couple of times and it cooled quickly inside.
They do supply some breakfast items like yogurt, nutrigrain type bars, and instant oatmeal. Also some good coffee, tea bags and half and half. The house seems very new and clean. Chairs were comfy and TV worked great.
We would stay here again in the future!
Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I were in town for a wedding, and we had a great time at Susan and Jim’s place! We had plenty of space, were incredibly comfortable, and check-in/out was a breeze; we also appreciated some of the small details (extra pillows and blankets, snacks in the pantry/fridge, and general decor) that made us feel at home and not like we were in a rental. If you’re ever in the area, I would highly recommend staying here!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay and Susan & Jim's was exceptional. Everything was perfect!
The apartment is cute and immaculate. It was literally spotless and everything you might have forgotten was available. Susan and Jim even left snacks which was greatly appreciated!
The bed was literally the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, as were the pillows. The furnishings are comfortable and beautiful.
There is off street parking right in front of your doorstep. I felt very comfortable leaving my car with my kayak on top outside unlocked. The neighborhood is quiet and quite lovely and very peaceful.
There are basic TV channels available and strong WiFi.
Because the hosts live above the apartment, you will hear human and dog foot steps . (no barking at all). I happen to love dogs and found the footsteps endearing.
If you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in, earplugs might be helpful. (I noticed even earplugs were available for guest use in the bathroom. They thought of everything!).
This was the nicest AirBnB I have stayed in and I highly recommend it if you're a thoughtful guest who would appreciate all the personal touches put into this lovely place.
I would definitely stay again if I am in the area."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Susan and Jim and it was just as great as the first one. We were in Washington state for work and our stay was longer than last time so this was the perfect place for us to stay with having business in Anacortes. The airbnb was clean, well kept and the added bonus of the snacks was a great touch. Communication was clear and concise on things and we could not have had a better stay. I will hands down stay here anytime I have business travel in that area."

Their place was extremely clean, very cute and updated, and they were perfect communicators. We loved their nice appliances, coffee and snacks available to us, and basic dinnerware and cookware. My little girl kept saying, “are we going back to our Airbnb.” So sweet. It was a lovely place to spend time.
If you are sensitive sleepers, it might be good for you to bring a sound machine because you can sometimes hear walking upstairs in the am.
We would recommend their place for a lovely stay in the Mt. Vernon area."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Great onboarding.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"LOVED THIS HOUSE. Oh my goodness it was cute! It was clean, comfortable, spacious, beautiful view, great deck, the largest television I have ever seen (my daughter and her friends watched a movie, it was like their own private theater). I admit that I opened and closed the refrigerator a few times just to watch the light show. For some reason, I got the checkout time wrong. The young lady who came to the house was very nice about it, which I appreciate. Such a lovely, well thought out home."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our four-day stay. Hill Cottage was immaculately clean and very comfortable--the perfect place to unwind after visiting family (in-laws!). We hope to return on our next visit. Some random details that might be helpful for future guests: the one bathroom is on the first floor and both bedrooms are upstairs; coffee is made with an electric teakettle to heat the water and a pour-over coffee maker; keyless lock convenient (but did glitch on us). Jane is incredibly responsive and friendly!

P"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for our needs!
We stayed two nights and had spend one day at Deception Pass, and the other at the Tulip Festival.
Jane's communication was fantastic, she responded easily within 5 minutes at various points to answer a few questions that i had. I'd stay at this location again, and would recommend ""The Trainwreck Bar and Grill"" if you're looking for some awesome cocktails and food."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for our family group of 3 people. The house is spacious and well-appointed. The house was clean and the yard was green and blooming. This was a good home base for exploring the Skagit Valley and Bellingham. I feel it's worth noting that the bathroom is on a different level than the bedrooms. There are plenty of lights you can turn on to light your way at night, but it might be challenging for someone with vision or mobility issues. However, this wasn't a problem for me and I would definitely stay here again."

Dishwasher.

The bed was soooo comfortable.
I can’t say enough.
So very grateful for such a nice place to stay."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful little old house that was remodeled. The stairs when you go down you have to be careful not to hit your head. Not a issue for us. And then the door when you go to leave you have to bend down to open. Again not a big deal. Nice kitchen. Nice bathroom. Comfy beds. Great place to stay for a night or two. No driveway parking other than on the street which was surprisingly busy. Would recommend staying at this cute little old house

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy to check in, super cozy and clean, no hassle or lengthy check out. How airbnbs should always be. Would definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jane is a great host and goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is a great one.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place and I especially loved how she had a pour over option for coffee and not just a keurig. We loved staying her and would do it again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice accommodation. The king bed was so comfy and each bedroom had its own air conditioner so you could sleep comfortably. Bedrooms are upstairs and there is only one bathroom on main level. Bathroom was spacious and super cute. Kitchen was adorable and came stocked with everything you would need. Would stay here again.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jane's cottage is clean and homey. Loved the plants and paintings. Comfy couch for lounging in the evenings to watch the huge screened TV. The beds were comfy too. I do recommend, if you are a light sleeper, to turn on the window units before turning in for the night. There are trains running nearby and frequently blowing their horn."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jane was very friendly and responsive. She was flexible with helping us check in early so we could make it to a wedding on time! Her helpfulness relieved so much stress.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The house in Mount Vernon was really conveniently located for us! The house was exactly as advertised and even better. We really loved the little touches like the hand made ceramic mugs and bowls and the art work on the walls.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place
Probably the best AirBnb I've ever stayed in"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Location was fine. Easy to get to. Did not have central air. The kitchen did not have blinds or curtains so it got very warm in the afternoon. No safety bar in the shower.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is top equipped and very cozy. TV is huge and really different. Always did a cinema in the evening.
The place is a little boring. As a starting point around the islands, but fine. Towards Seattle, another good outlet.
The honking of the trains is really not nice. Feeling like freight trains are just getting started in the evening. But after a few days you get used to it. For a long time. 😅
But at the end, the owners can't help it. The train in the US has probably hardly evolved since the 70s."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jane was very responsive and welcoming! This little cottage house was so adorable. It was perfect for our one night! Plenty of space for 4 people!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Convenient location, comfortable home, and great host - definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cutest house, clear instructions from host. I knocked one star because there was a train that passed by multiple times throughout the night and it was super loud from in the king bedroom. Bring ear plugs!! Other than that- great place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty close to train tracks and could hear them all night long but it didn’t bother us.
Space is nice. It’s a flipped house but it’s nice and modern and has every you need to feel at home.
Gets a little warm downstairs but the ac units upstairs blasted nice and cold air."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely two bedroom property in a pleasant, quiet neighborhood.
Wonderfully furnished with a huge, modern TV and extremely comfortable beds and a sofa. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in, and Jane was extremely helpful with instructions and further information.
Would highly recommend booking!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home with beautiful upgrades and great linens!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jane’s place was absolutely lovely! It was very clean and comfortable.
Our travel schedule changed a bit and didn’t allow us as much time as we’d hoped to explore the neighborhood, but will definitely be back again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly as described. Clean and stocked well for everything we needed. Quiet neighborhood and close to everything.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable stay at Jane’s place, photos match the accommodations."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Newly renovated home. Everything was pristine. The main bedroom was unique and a standout. I would have stayed there a month just because of the bedroom! The king bed was surrounded by three walls with windows covering most of the real estate. The breeze at night was heavenly. New extremely comfy bed and with quality linens and pillows.
The downstairs TV has the largest screen we have ever seen with good optics.
Neighborhood was nice - nice next door neighbor. Felt very safe. Parked two cars out front.
No AC downstairs. Needed to open windows and house cooled nicely. New BR AC units upstairs.
Would definitely recommend this home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Jane's place! It was clean, quiet, comfortable, and peaceful. The kitchen had everything we needed, and the outside space was beautiful.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Came for WWU graduation with immediate family. The downtown is within walking distance or a 3 minute drive. There is a corner store down the street to grab water or a snack. The home was comfortable and very clean.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was super clean and maybe the first Airbnb where I felt the cleaning fee was being out to good use. We had our 4 month old with us hence the emphasis on how clean this place was. There was a pack n play for us to use, a giant tv for us to use when our baby was sleeping, and AC units available despite the house not having central AC which was appreciated because was particular warm (rare…) the days we stayed. Those were the highlights but we would definitely come back to stay here because it really had it all!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not quite sure if there’s anything to complain about. If there was anything, there was a distant train that was barely audible. The place was nice and spacious with all the amenities that were described. Thanks, Jane!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful! The pictures don't do it justice online. Jane thought of everything. She even provided robes and little snacks on the bed. The added personal touches made all the difference.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay before heading out to San Juan islands! It was very conveniently located around Mount Vernon to drive around and check out the area.

Great place to take a rest from your travels. Nice back deck with firepit. I would definitely recommend to anyone for a restful and quiet stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,James place was easy to find and easy parking out front always free and easy for my mom who’s 80 could get inside to visit. It was extremely clean. The television was huge and fun to watch with Netflix and prime and a bunch of other options. The beds were comfortable and had memory foam and air conditioning in both rooms. There were robes for each bedroom. The kitchen was large and light. The whole house was light and decorated comfortably. There was a convenience store at the end of the road. The towels were fluffy and there were plenty. They had nice shower gel and shampoo and conditioner and a great sink and kitchen utensils. The bedrooms were a bit bright with blinds. All the windows had beautiful blinds. There was a train occasionally but the neighbourhood was quite and sweet. They had a nice deck and picnic table and yard not fully fenced but cute for my kids to play with me. It was easy entry and exit. I hope to stay again in a place great for my kids.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would give more stars if I could! This home was perfectly set up for an Airbnb. So conveniently located, comfortable and clean.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We where there for a day trip to visit the tulips and Jane really worked to let us check in early and get out and enjoy the afternoon. The house had all the little touches that make a rental house a home away from home. The kitchen was very well stocked with everything you could need from a cork screw and wine glasses to some extra staples tucked into the cupboards, a kettle and tea, even decaf coffee. We didn’t have time to use the BBQ or fire table but they looked nice. The beds where comfortable and even though you could here some road noise and the train it didn’t keep us up. We would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely neighborhood. Felt safe. Easy access to the Tulip Festival and nearby activities. Very clean and cozy space.

The new barbecue was very much appreciated and we especially enjoyed the sunny afternoons spent outside on the deck."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was in a easy to get to location with lots of street parking. Both beds were comfortable, the decor was clean cute and simple with bathrobes and cookies!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: The house was so comfortable, cute, and clean! The description was perfect and accurate! Perfect layout for cooking, game night, and relaxing.

The shades on the windows are adjustable from both top and bottom to offer privacy when necessary while still letting the sunlight in. It was close to local shops in the historic downtown. The hosts were quick to respond to any questions and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jane and Duncan!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage Hill is a cute, comfortable little gem on the hill. The whole house has been updated and the bedrooms have a great views. The location provides easy access to downtown shopping and the freeway entrance and Jane is always quick to respond when you reach out to her. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jane has a beautiful, very nicely decorated 2-bedroom home in Mount Vernon. The kitchen was well supplied, and the TV in the living room felt like a movie theater! You could tell Jane put in a lot of work to make the place feel like home. The one thing to note is that the house is located near train tracks so if you're sensitive to noise at night, like my friend, it may be difficult to sleep. Otherwise I'd stay there again any time! Jane was easy to communicate with and a great host."
