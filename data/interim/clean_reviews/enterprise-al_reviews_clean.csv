2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I liked it
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Hosts are very responsive however the parking is super tight for stay. The neighborhood and parking lot is very questionable. The lights in bedroom were very dim hard to see for makeup, eye contacts, or even locating jewelry. Had to use cell phone flashlight to see. The shower head was eh- water control was hard to keep normal either burning hot or to cold. Very small bathroom
There was a cat urine smell inside through out rooms along cheap cleaner smell inside kitchen. The instructions for AC was very unbearable and not comfortable at 70 in Alabama. My son developed a cough and asthma attack on our stay due to temp that was “allowed” and cat urine smell in house. Lots of dust bunnies in master room under dresser. We couldn’t wait to get out. Nice decor but wouldn’t recommend"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sylvia was the best host I’ve had on Airbnb and the listing was absolutely A-mazing- we even stayed an extra day. There were commodities available from hygiene to cooking to cleaning. She made sure check in went smoothly and that there were no issues during our stay. If I ever am back in the area- Sylvia will be my choice- not to mention she has more than one listing available so that makes it’s even better. If you’re looking for a great experience- she is the one.

When I look at a place, one of the first things I take notice of is if the bathrooms are clean….never once did I have to clean the bathrooms or anything else prior to using.
I ask a question or two through the Airbnb app and received a response almost instantly.

Well done, Sylvia! I would stay again!
5 Stars!"

Everything you needed was already in the airbnb to accommodate you with your stay.. It’s very quiet you could literally walk out and hear a pen drop. Whenever, I visit again I will most definitely be booking with her again. We have no regrets an we were very pleased with our stay. We drove 6hrs from Memphis ,Tn for my sister’s baby shower. We loved everything. It felt so cozy, peaceful and we were able to relax with no worries.
Thanks Sylvia for everything !!!"

The place was in great conditon, and perfect for our visit to our kids, who are stationed at Ft. Novosel, AL. The 2 BR, 2.5 BA was big enough, and private enough for a quiet peaceful stay. The unit was freshly updated had everything we needed to make it a comfortable stay. We appreciated the map of where people had come from to stay here, as well as the guest register for a special touch.
We can't wait to stay here again in about a month when our first grandchild arrives! We can't praise her enough (-:"

---
I had the most wonderful stay at Sylvia's Airbnb! From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home. Sylvia is not just a host; she's a true gem who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a fantastic experience.
The accommodations were immaculate, and the attention to detail was remarkable. The cozy bedroom, well-equipped kitchen, and charming living space made my stay incredibly comfortable. Sylvia's home is a true oasis of comfort and relaxation.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart is Sylvia herself. She's not just a host; she's a warm and caring person who genuinely cares about her guests.
I can't thank Sylvia enough for her hospitality and kindness. This Airbnb experience exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait to return!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and close to the Base Gate, the purpose of the stay. House was easy to find and easy to access and was nice not to have to carry keys around with us during our stay. Kitchen had everything we needed, as well as the bathrooms. Bath towels were plenty and clean! Beds were comfortable and a TV in every room was really nice! We even enjoyed the pool one day. Morning walks through he neighborhood were glorious and relaxing with the beautiful vegetation and foliage as well as the wildlife. Would highly recommend a stay at this property! We loved it!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sylvia was delightful and very helpfull. She let us check in much earlier than the shown time and remotely let me in after I made a mistake with the entry code. The place itself is exactly as described and very well kept with lots of supplies for guests like condiments, board games, coffee and toiletries. It really felt like a second home rather than a rental. Loved the ""cinema"" themed living room. Much obliged!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I love staying at Sylvia’s place. It’s also super clean and has everything you need.

She even had out a high chair and pack n play for our youngest to use. Will definitely use Sylvia's again on future trips. Thank you so much!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have become a regular at Sylvia's listings. She's always very polite and quick to respond. I wanted until the last minute to book for the 4th and had to book 2 of her properties. They ended up being next door to each other. Instead of me having to leave and come back, she accommodated me by cleaning the second property first and allowed me to stay at the first property until cleaning was complete. The second night's stay at this property did come with a small problem with ants in the bedroom, which made me have to sleep in the other bedroom with smaller beds. It's the south and we've had a LOT of rain. Even if you think your house is air tight, they somehow still sometimes find a way in. Sylvia was quick to respond and even refunded me for the incident. I will continue to be a regular."

From the house upgrades, to the cleanliness, fast communication, amenities, and perfect decor…. you are really able to feel like you are right at home in this Home Sweet Home air bnb! Places that allow dogs can sometimes not be as clean or have a smell or minor damages here and there, but this was not the case at all. The fenced in backyard is perfect for your fur baby to go outside with ease and safety. It was also SUCH a pleasure for my husband to return to the Fort Rucker area where he attended flight instructor school.

They really have thought of so many little details that combine to make it a great experience. I travel frequently and I use Airbnb and Vrbo a lot. Since staying in Randy and April’s properties I find that they have become the standard by which I judge other hosts, and the others are coming up short."

The houses in the neighborhood are close together but it was quiet and didn’t seem to be an overly active area so it felt like there was privacy.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! The home was perfectly laid out. The master bed was a little too soft for us but wasn’t too bad.

We enjoyed ourselves. Nice touch with providing board games. The grandkids loved them!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"It was a great place for us to stay. Clean, plenty of room."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the experience was okay, but I was not impressed with the communication.
There was evidence that large dogs have been there and the home and the floors should be professionally cleaned.
I asked about having the lawn mowed and was informed it would be the following day but it did not occur for the remainder of our stay (5 more days).
During my stay , I repaired their vacuum (brushroll was inoperable and full of string/hair), replenished their clorox wipes, coffee, bleach, etc but when my kids broke two wine glasses by accident I was asked to pay for them and I did so immediately. A week later I was questioned when I would pay for them and I had to show that I had paid them a week prior. I could be in the wrong, but it bothered me that they asked me to pay for them to begin with considering the things I did and bought out of common courtesy.
I would still stay here again and this home is still much cleaner and nicer than the majority in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"I really enjoyed the home. It was very child safe, had phenomenal amenities to include coffee and creamer selections.

The kitchen had everything plus a few extras (coffee, tea, hot cocoa, oatmeal, etc.) The only thing I wish that the home had was tvs in the smaller bedrooms and table to sit outside in the backyard.

We arrived after dark but the entryway and front door was very well lit which made our entrance to the house very easy and safe. The whole property had only small steps at the thresholds which was great for my octogenarian parents with limited mobility. We had access to the double door garage which was very nice and rare. We were happy to be able to park in the garage for added security. Also, the hosts have a treadmill and weight bench in the garage which was nice as an option for those dedicated to working out or walking/running even on rainy days. The house and furnishings were immaculate and tasteful. The home has a supply of games and activities for kids and families. The neighborhood was very walkable and clean.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This property was without a doubt the best experience we have ever had with a short term rental! I wish I could give them 6, maybe 7 stars. The owner communicated incredibly well, was extremely helpful, and obviously knows what they're doing when it comes to an Airbnb. The property had so many extra amenities, they thought of everything you could want. It was impeccably clean and well maintained. I've never seen an Airbnb look so much like a magazine cover, yet still make you feel at home the second you enter it. We absolutely loved the property and the support from the owner. 10/10 would rent again and recommend to anyone who needs a great place to stay in Enterprise!!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We weren't really there much to explore all the amenities but if we wanted to use the kitchen it had what you needed to stay in and cook. The kids liked it and it was comfortable. We were there for a pageant that kept us from sun up to sun down, we opted for the air bnb because it gave our daughter a break from the pageant she wouldn't of had If we'd of stayed at the host hotel. So it was perfect for our needs and is about 15 minutes from the Enterprise Civic Center."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a tad bit congested in this area with people parking on the narrow streets, however the area is extremely quiet. I suspect that there are a lot of military due to the close proximity to base, which is most likely the reason for the congestion. I really enjoyed the stay. Loved having access to the garage remote! My last place didn't have one and I had to keep getting in and out of the car in the cold. The place was extremely clean, plenty of space. Sylvia is very responsive, and does so in a timely manner. I definitely recommend and look forward to booking again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an outstanding townhouse and location. Several things all played into the 5 star rating. First the townhouse: it was clean, tidy, well appointed and everything was as promised. Two very large bedrooms and large actually doesn’t describe their size well enough. A small but well stocked kitchen and dining table was perfect for breakfasts at the house. We were fortunate to have access to the garage and that was such a plus. Second the communication: absolutely outstanding. Not just timely communications but everything was followed up with another note. A question we had was replied to within 30 minutes. We really felt that anything we needed would be accommodated if possible. Third is location: if you are there to access Fort Rucker you are less than 5 minutes to one of the gates. We were there for our son’s graduation from flight school and this was PERFECT. Plus we were closer to downtown Enterprise which was nice since it’s such a quaint town. We HIGHLY recommend Sylvia’s AirBNB!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Sylvia's! We stayed for 5 days, to see our son graduate from flight school, and to help him move out.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel a lot, and I've entered many Airbnb. I long to be able to enter then relax. Unfortunately, because of my work in the construction industry, my eye for detail and workmanship keeps me from just being. I tend to see everything(bad). I'm sure its mental. Entering this home gave me a unique opportunity to both relax and respect great workmanship. Everything from the rustic log cabin interior to the floor elevation change in the kitchen just so a set of stairs wouldn't look out of place reaching the second-floor kid's loft. Trimming every nook and softening every angle. Knock down ceilings with a flawless 45-degree corner bead. Little lanterns hardwired for accent lighting. Ductless splits installed level and tight to the wall. As one old timer told me years ago. ""If you have no pride in what you're doing, you'll have no shame in doing it poorly."". This home is unique in that way, (forgiving the tile, lol) and it was a pleasure to stay in. Quiet, cozy and relaxing. Thanks again!."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Larry was amazing. He met us when we arrived. Very helpful. We will be coming back.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"10/10 would rent here again! The place wasn’t hard to find. Larry provided great instructions on how to get there and how to get inside the apartment. And provided us with a pack n play for the baby! When we walked in we were all pleasantly surprised to see how nice the apartment was! My kids absolutely loved the bedroom space and were so excited about the way it was set up. The pictures don’t do it justice, it looks so much nicer than what you see in the photos. Larry is also a very courteous host and made sure that we were okay with activities he would be doing before doing them. I definitely recommend choosing him for your stay and we absolutely loved the clubhouse!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 4th stay (at least) in Larry’s Clubhouse. It’s perfect for me, my husband, and 10 year old to stay. The pictures do not do it justice at all. Well kept, clean, and my daughter LOVES the games and the upstairs loft and secret hideaway. We stay here twice a year or more and it remains just as clean as when it was a new listing! Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was very clean and beautiful. It was a pleasure staying here, definitely will be back again. We saw Larry a few times and he was very nice and spoke everytime. A extra plus for the elevator, saved me from bringing the groceries and luggage up and down."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Clubhouse was an absolutely amazing place to stay. It was beautiful inside and out. Our kids fell in love with the loft and the secret door. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"‘The Clubhouse’ – An Absolute Must See!
I have had the good fortune of staying at all 3 of Larry’s properties, which are uniquely beautiful in their own way. BUT, I must say that this is, by far, the most well-thought-out and creatively designed rental property that I have ever stayed at. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing with its woodworking style, creativity, design and layout, it is also fully functional / equipped, modern, elegant, comfortable and clearly focuses on the needs of the Guests, by providing a much appreciated attention to detail, in order to ensure all the comforts of home, and then some.
The carpentry, rustic, yet comfortable, furniture and décor, coupled with the modern and elegantly styled kitchen, with all the amenities and appliances (small and large), make it an ideal accommodation, which can be appreciated by both men, women and children alike.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Clubhouse, for both short and long-term stays. You’ll be glad you did."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, clean, and comfortable place for my wife and I to stay while visiting family. Everything was as expected and true to listing."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Larry was a great host, the Clubhouse was a really, really nice place, super clean, exactly as advertised. Would definitely recommend even if it were priced higher than it is but it is an awesome value at the current rate. If I return to the area, Larry’s Clubhouse will be at the top of my list."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for three nights with my family of four (five and one year old). The place exceeded my expectations, very clean, comfortable beds, and friendly host. Great place to stay if you are in the area for any training or graduation at Fort Novosel."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our third time to the “Clubhouse” and it is perfect for us! Still just as new and clean as when it was a new listing. The description is accurate so everything is clear as far as parking (which is very easy) and stairs, which is not a problem for us. The pictures don’t do it justice. Everything is clear, labeled and a lot of thought is put into every detail. We will stay here anytime we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For what we do and where we go in Enterprise, this place is perfect."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing and affordable! Stayed in 2 of Larry’s apartments and absolutely the nicest in that area in my opinion. Larry is a true professional and very responsive.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as described and it was very clean! The instructions were clear and everything was labeled. The beds were super comfortable!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved Larry’s place. “The Clubhouse” was extremely clean upon our arrival. It smelled even better. I was amazed at all the details that were thought of in the making of the space. Lots of kitchenware to make delicious meals. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was super clean. Complementary make up remover wipes were a personal touch my girlfriend loved. 5/5 would definitely recommend to a friend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for the family to stay
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Larry was extremely responsive and the place is very much so worth the rate that is charged. I had a last minute cancellation for my hotel and was so happy to find this place to rent. If I were you, I'd book this versus a hotel every time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved it.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! My husband and our teen son stayed 4 nights while visiting family. The apartment was spotless and beautiful! The attention to detail in the layout, the decor, and amenities really stood out. The owner takes great care to provide all the things one would like away from home. It was only a few minutes from town which we didn’t mind at all! It was much better than a hotel room. Enjoyed visiting the sweet cat and hummingbirds in the morning while having coffee to! Larry thought of everything, we will be visiting a few times in the next year and look forward to being repeat customers!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to The Clubhouse, as our last stay instantly made it one of our favorite rentals. I was in town to visit family with my daughter, and it was just as we remembered it-clean, well-appointed, nicely decorated, and extremely peaceful. The rental provided everything we needed for our stay and was super-convenient for everything we did in our time in the area. Also, as before, Larry communicated with us the check-in and check-out details and any other pertinent messages in a timely manner. We will be back again on our next visit to the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Clubhouse is one of the cleanest air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. You can definitely tell Larry is invested into every last detail in the Clubhouse. Larry was super nice and his response time to messages was almost instant. His instructions were very clear. He even had a binder with local places to eat (with the best comments listed underneath). He also has a cat named Lucy that loves to come around and say hi, especially in the morning. If I ever go back to Enterprise Alabama I will definitely be looking to stay in the Clubhouse."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay.

It was also immaculately clean and the beds were very comfortable. Larry had a tourist booklet of all the local hotstops. He was very prompt with any questions that we had. The shower was relaxing with hot water and strong pressure. We highly recommend his place as well as his other listings he has available!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cozy and clean place! Would definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can really tell how much Larry cares for his craft. Every little detail is paid attention to… from the light fixture on the sink for late night water, to little hatches in the wall to see down onto the first floor. Probably the cleanest air bnb I’ve ever been in, and Larry was very friendly. Can’t beat the price either."

The first thing that struck me about the Airbnb was the warm and inviting ambiance. The rustic decor was tastefully done and added to the place's charm. It truly felt like a home away from home.
The amenities provided were top-notch and everything a guest could need was available. The kitchen was well-stocked with all the necessary utensils and appliances, making cooking and preparing meals easy. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels and toiletries.
The bed was comfortable and cozy, and I slept soundly throughout my stay. The linens were soft and luxurious, adding to the overall comfort of the space. One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail. Everything was thoughtfully arranged and the small touches really added to the overall experience.
Overall, my stay at this charming Airbnb was truly exceptional."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was coming to Enterprise with my daughter for the weekend and was looking for a fun, peaceful, and comfortable place for us to stay. We found that in spades with Larry's rental. From the moment we walked in, we were struck by the excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail that he put into creating it. The woodworking, lighting, and decorations were amazing, and all weekend long, we were finding new ""little surprises"" to marvel at. The place was extremely well-appointed, and it was super convenient for everything that we did. The setting that it is in is wonderful as well. A quiet and beautiful country surrounding as viewed from the porch, was the perfect setting to start my day with a cup of coffee, and the tv with surround sound in the living area was the perfect place to finish it. We came away highly impressed and happy with our time spent here"

I highly recommend any of his places and would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I stayed here for a week during Christmas. Larry could not be a nicer host. He was right there if we needed him and was friendly to interact with. The apartment was so clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay there again.

Incredible workmanship in the wood, thoughtful touches in the kitchen and bathroom, and even electric lanterns throughout the unit that can be dimmed. Also has a/c units in each room, including the loft, that are controlled separately. Kids especially enjoy “the jail” (loft) where they feel like they have a secret hideaway. Conveniently located 5 minutes from a nice grocery store and a few restaurants, about 20 minutes to the Ft. Rucker Visitor Center in Dalesville. We would definitely stay here again!"

All the comforts of home were thought of and appliances and electronics were top notch. There was every kind of pot or pan you could want, all kinds of utensils and even a blender! No need was overlooked. It was by far the cleanest Air B&B we have ever stayed at. Even the trash can was spotless! There are a couple steps up to the kitchen/bathroom area and then a couple down to the master bedroom. Not a problem but just wanted to let folks know as I didn’t see them in the picture. Would definitely stay in any of Larry’s properties again. It was excellent!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Larry's cottage is very quiet and comfortable. He went above and beyond. we were greeted with a friendly handshake and he gave us a quick tour of the features of the cottage. He promptly responded to questions and took care of any issues that came up. the cottage is close enough to town to make a 5 minute grocery trip but far enough to have a country feel. Would highly recommend to anyone.

This is my 3rd time staying at one of Larry’s properties and it never falls short of amazing!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Clubhouse was perfect for kids! Our 7& 4 yr olds loved the loft area/ beds! It was cozy and intimate but also had plenty of space. Kids were within earshot without being all up on me. Haha. I loved that dish soap and a couple of detergent pods were left out for our use. Everything was thought of! Fully stocked kitchen, even a few spices and Tupperware. Great place to stay, I hope I can incorporate some of the design quirks into our future home!"

We were searching for the perfect place to film and found it on Airbnb! I messaged Larry and told him what we were wanting to do.. make a short film and he immediately worked with me! Once we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Larry with a smile! He and his family participated and it was wonderful! I never could of imagined such amazing hospitality from any Airbnb! The apartment itself I immediately felt comfortable and relaxed when I walked in. It’s a beautiful place and very clean! You definitely get your money’s worth and more! The location is so nice!

VERY clean both times, it is both welcoming, unassuming, and unique. The owner is very easy to communicate with, quick response times to questions/requests. The place is custom built, beautiful wood work, with well thought out placement of everything inside.

We’ll definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone looking in the area."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Lodge was very nice and the value was on point. We had a great time and even got to the beach in Santa Rosa which was about 2.5 hours away. Would highly recommend this spot and will be visiting again in the future. Well deserved super host status.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great and expedited communication. Clean, cozy, safe and comfortable stay. The amenities available were everything we needed plus more. The home was pretty cool and unique from the sliding barn type door, the swinging cafe/saloon doors, convenient washer and dryer, and more. The stairs are steep inside so keep that in mind for small children. My 7 year old thought inside was pretty cool and wanted to “stay forever”. We truly enjoyed our visit and would consider booking again if ever in the area. It certainly was worth it. Thanks Larry for your warm hospitality."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property blew my expectations away! The pictures on the site are great, but really didn’t do justice, it’s MUCH nicer than I thought it would be, and I already knew it was going to be very nice!"

2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great space for singles or couples. Located away from the hustle of town, it's very quiet and the host respects your privacy. The space is clean and well equipped. The parking is a little tight for larger vehicles, but manageable."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very convenient location for family to stay while visiting for my husband’s flight school graduation! Beautiful back yard space, and overall very comfortable. I will mention that if you’re planning to cook/utilize the kitchen, bring everything you’ll need. Utensils and cookware are stocked, but essential kitchen items are not (besides s&p). About 5 minutes to Enterprise, and 20 minutes to Fort Novosel :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was great and convenient to restaurants and grocery store. The only negative was that it was facing a main busy road
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay while we waited to close on our house.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We spent Christmas weekend. My wife ,two daughters ,son ,son in law and 88 year old mother. We had plenty of room. Everything was just as described and look just like the Photo’s . It was just minutes from FBC Enterprise where we enjoyed a Christmas Eve Service and historic downtown where the girls went shopping.
It was perfect for our annual Christmas trip to Enterprise. Maria was quick to respond when we had a question. Highly recommend and we will stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was good, the house was clean, good communication."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a large home for all our family & we felt extremely comfortable here - 4 bedrooms, two full baths, full kitchen, large living room & laundry room. We were able to cook many meals in the kitchen & hang out as a family all under one roof. The home provided many thoughtful & helpful touches like a work desk, warm blankets & extra pillows, coffee & filters!!!, 2 smart TVs, toys & corn hole for the little ones, tasteful decor, well-lit entry, extremely comfortable beds to include a trundle bed for one of the grandkids, highchair, baby tub, playpen & outdoor/firepit chairs for both the adults and kids. Although we did not need anything pet-related, we noticed a nice pet bed plus food bowls & dry food for both cats & dogs. The carport allowed for easy entrance to the side of the house & a circular driveway allowed for easy parking & entry to the front of the house. The fenced in the backyard was large, pretty & private - the grandkids really enjoyed playing in the backyard!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Second time we stayed at the house. Has every thing we needed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host. Very responsive The place was beautiful a spacious. The beds were the best yet that we have found at an Airbnb. It was perfect for our needs and very child friendly.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful home, very clean and comfortable. Maria was super helpful and my family enjoyed having a safe and homey place to stay. Absolutely recommend this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific time at Maria's. Not only was she a fabulous host - communicating with us well, but the house was perfect. Great location. Beautifully decorated but not cluttered. Such a comfy home. Would totally recommend this house"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Maria for allowing us to stay in your house. It was very nice and clean and the location was great as well. We didn’t have any issues. I would definitely recommend this book g to anyone!!!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The house is comfortable and spacious. It has a huge patio, it has a bonfire outside. It has everything you need for a stay. The rooms are comfortable. For a short stay, this is perfect."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Exactly what we needed.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here! Great clean spacious Airbnb!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was exactly as described! Beautiful, clean and well stocked with necessities. It was perfect for our party of 8! (4 adults, 4 children) Easy to find and the neighborhood was peaceful. Will return when traveling through this area again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, relaxing environment, place was nice n comfortable"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Property was easy to find and Maria was easy to reach when the digital code did not work. Inside the home was very clean and inviting with all the amenities and cleaning product available to clean after ourselves. Backyard is fenced and peaceful there is a large amount gap underneath the fence for small dogs to potentially get outside the compound. Also I dislike most dog owners since they can clean after their pets. My daughter cleaned multiple dog feces (not all) from the backyard so she and her brothers could run outside without stepping in poop. She did (as always) go outside with her dog and clean her dogs mess as to not contribute to the left behind messes. The street in the front is also busy with high speed traveling cars and trucks and would not recommend small kids or pets in the front only the back. Plenty of space to park vehicles as we had 5 with us for our military PCS move. Overall very satisfied with our stay even with the previous slack dog owners trying to ruin it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a perfect house! It was just me & 1 sister this time, but we will stay here again, with our whole family. The house was great for us & our 4-legged friends!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for my daughter's wedding. Had a hiccup getting in but that was quickly resolved. No problems after that. If we had questions Maria responded quickly. All of the bedrooms were nice size. The bed in the master bedroom is quite low to the floor, this is only a problem if you have mobility issues like I do, I just slept in another bed and our toddler granddaughter slept in the master bedroom with her Pepaw and the 1 year old slept in the travel playpen provided at the rental house also in master bedroom and still left plenty of room to walk. Bathrooms are nice, the toilets are a little low, again not a problem unless you have mobility issues like me so I carry a raised toilet seat for that reason. The house is child friendly but not child proof. There are cleaning supplies in the cabinet under the kitchen sink that is not lockable. The house had everything listed in amenities. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing quit stay with beautiful back yard and comfortable beds.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,While visiting relatives my family and I had the most comfortable stay here! We felt just like we were at home! The accommodations were perfect and all the beds were comfortable! We made some fun family memories sitting together in this home! Even my dogs enjoyed their time roaming in the very large backyard that was lined with beautiful plants that made it so peaceful! Maria went above and beyond to make sure every detail of our stay was warm and inviting! And communicating with her was like talking to a friend! We definitely will be booking here when we visit again!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Had a pleasure staying at this airbnb with a few friends this past week. The airbnb was very clean and well-prepped with plenty of sheets, towels and even a couple of games. Will definitely be reserving again when back in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Our family really enjoyed our stay here!!! It’s very nice and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home thank you so much. Definitely want to stay again sometime!!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,It was over all a great place it would be five stars except the living room only has seating for 3 people on 1 smaller couch. Other than that it was great plenty of space and the back patio was awesome!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Maria was a very responsive host who allowed us to make changes to our reservation as necessary. We appreciated the flexibility and promptness! This location is well suited for a group of people.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great home!! Me and family would definitely book this amazing location again.
2023-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful but there are lagoons details that I didn't think the refrigerator was dirty tube to clean to put in my things and the master bedroom bathroom when you shower the water costs that it is danced by the drain. It's a bald to bathe in that bathroom.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time…
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for having us the place was nice and welcoming especially loved the patio outside.

The place is just like the pictures , I honestly didn't want to leave lol."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with my family. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Worked well
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for my large family. Beautiful home. My kids called the outside room the relaxing room. The use of washer and dryer and kitchen was so nice to have and my family was happy to have plenty of space. My kids loved making smores over the small campfire. Beds were very comfortable and Maria was an amazing host and very responsible to any questions we had. Not far from Fort Rucker so its a great place to stay for families coming to see graduations and things. Highly recommend 🥰👍
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was excellent. We had a great time here and Maria was very helpful. We let her know we would be arriving late and she left a light on for us. Also, the house was very clean and close to town. However, it is on a main road, but has a side street and a nice private backyard. We didn’t notice much noise from the traffic other than occasional cars passing. Maria was very helpful, especially when we had some unexpected visitors knocking on the door late at night. Maria answered her phone on the first call and checked the exterior cameras. She also kept an eye on the cameras and notified me when she saw another unexpected visitor. We later determined that someone down the road was having a party and some of the party goers we confused with the address. This only happened one night of our stay, the rest of the days were no problem at all and the neighborhood appeared quiet otherwise. Would would definitely recommend and stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Everything was perfect!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Love our stay here! They backyard was absolutely perfect for our dogs. Maria and Andrew were incredibly helpful going above and beyond to make us feel right at home! 100% will stay here when we visit again!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic Airbnb! Beautiful backyard that was fenced! Easy for families traveling with children and or pets. Firepit in the backyard. House had everything we needed. Showers were nice and hot and beds were comfortable. Communication with the host was excellent! Highly recommend this place if in the area. Close enough to Fort Rucker if attending Warrant Officer celebrations. We were right at home.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Maria and Andrew were very accommodating. would definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Maria was very responsive when I contacted her about some cleaning and maintenance issues and offered to send over the cleaning crew right away.

I loved the never ending hot water for showers and loved cooking in the kitchen. Maria was very helpful .Five stars all the way.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was nice and quiet and out of the way. Enjoyed it very much.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice place, we got in the first night late, checked out the place, found everything in the house, the next day it really really did feel like home. Nice big place to have your own space. Good location, nice parking."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,The most communicative and helpful host we've ever had. Truly in a league of their own and recommend without reservation!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host and wonderful home! Very responsive and accommodating hosts who ensure their guests are taken cared of and enjoy their stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this property August 30-September 1, 2022 when we travelled to Alabama to see our son graduate from AIT training at Fort Rucker Army Base. The house was clean and decorated very nice. The location of the home was very quiet and peaceful. The layout of the home was perfect because there were three bedrooms including the master at one end of the house and one bedroom at the opposite end of the house which worked out perfect for the teenage girls in our family.
There are a few things I want to say about this host. First, we had to change our reservation because my son's graduation date was pushed about a week. The host, Maria, allowed us to change our reservation with no additional charge and was so accommodating to us during this stressful time.
Second, when we arrived at the home, the air conditioning wasn't working properly. The house was 85 degrees and much too warm for my comfort. We set the thermostat to 74 but by morning the temperature had only dropped to 79 after running four about 8 hours (again too warm for my comfort). In addition to the AC issue, the toilet in the master bathroom ran on and off all night long. I contacted Maria right away about both issues. Not only did she respond within 4 minutes of my message, she had both a plumber and an HVAC technician to the house within an hour to take care of both issues. Unfortunately, the AC didn't seem to improve much so I reached out to Maria again to let her know. She was very apologetic for the inconvenience and since she didn't know if her HVAC guy could come back the same day, she had her handyman run to the store and get us three wonderful tower fans which we used that night, and it made a huge difference.
Given the few issues we had, I would definitely rent from this host again. She was on top of everything, and I feel she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best it could be.
Thank you, Maria and Andrew. You are both fantastic hosts and I would recommend you to anyone looking for a nice AirBNB in Enterprise, Alabama.
Wendy Gale and family"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Maria’s home was the perfect space for our family to spend time together while in Enterprise. The home is spacious and very clean. The backyard is quiet and the perfect place to relax and have a BBQ. The hosts are very responsive and accommodating.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is very nice, and above all it has something else for the kitchen!! The garden is beautiful, fall in love with the house"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed Marias home while visiting in Enterprise Alabama. It's right on the main road that takes you everywhere so the location is perfect! So spacious and clean inside. The back yard is great for pets or entertaining, so pretty. No hassle with checking in or out and we couldn't have asked for more in our stay. Thank you for everything and we will be back!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was literally the most perfect place for a family of four to stop on the way to the beach. The backyard was the most beautiful oasis and the perfect safe place for a toddler to run around, equipped with toddler size Adirondack style chairs, a sandbox, a swing in the sunroom, Amazon prime for Cocomelon, and even a pull out floor mattress so there is no worry of toddler falling out of bed at night. There was also a pack n play and a high chair which we used for our infant! All necesseities like dishwasher detergent, plates, cups, dishes, pizza cutter, laundry detergent, paper towels were provided in excess where we didnt have to worry about running out. This was the perfect place and we would definitely stay here again and for a longer stay if we had something else to do in Enterprise. It was the perfect stop for one night on the way to the beach but a fantastic little hideaway we would love to return to!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here due to working in Dothan for construction and we absolutely loved Kristina’s place! The master bedroom is HUGE with a nice work area that was used a lot! We had some bad storms during our stay and Kristina checked in to make sure we were ok and if we needed anything, super thoughtful! The space was awesome and if we are ever back in the area for work I would definitely book again! Thanks for the great stay Kristina!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristina’s property went above and beyond our expectations. We needed a place close to fort Rucker that was pet and kid friendly on short notice. Kristina was very accommodating, included helpful check in and check out procedures, and her property was clean, secure, and met all of our needs. Very close to fort Rucker for those going TDY with families and was perfect for our kids and dog as well. Cannot recommend enough and will be staying again next time we are in town."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I are new to the area, as my husband is Army National Guard and has orders at Fort Novosel (Rucker). With housing not secured before we got here, we needed a place to stay. Kristina’s place could not have been more perfect. Her townhouse is furnished and decorated to feel like home. Check-in was extremely easy with our door code. Our pets settled in nicely and it was so helpful to have a fenced-in yard. We couldn’t be more grateful to Kristina for being so helpful and accommodating to us. She is very responsive and understanding. We were sad to leave! I recommend a hundred times over. Thank you, Kristina!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location for visiting Fort Rucker!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this location when wanting to be close to base! Beautiful loft in a very cute downtown
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Main Street Loft was perfect. We enjoyed everything about it. The deco, the brick walls, the iron touches, etc. The living room was comfy and spacious, the dining table was great for dinner, and the kitchen was well equipped and large. Even though, we were invited to a graduation in Dothan, this was the best placed that I found that I thought I would really enjoy staying and it was worth the drive. I highly recommend this loft and I am super picky."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location downtown, spacious and comfortable. Our second time staying at Cara’s place."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden gem! Very spacious open concept kitchen & living room. Cozy beds, large open main bedroom with cute extra bedrooms blended into floor plan. Nice to see an older historic building renovated in a beautiful way. Loved the wood floors throughout! Easy entry process, but fair warning 2 small flights of stairs with no elevator , difficult for elderly. Huge kitchen with plenty of room to entertain family dinners. Long Cozy couch to watch tv or enjoy game night.
Great Location downtown in Enterprise! Walking distance to a variety of local shops and small restaurants for full meals or breakfast, coffee and doughnuts, bars , farmers market, Southern Broadway dinner theater, clothing stores, book stores, candy and soap stores , unique souvenir shops even 2 baby stores offering 4D ultra sounds. In the heart of the Historic district full of history and great opportunities for pictures. You will hear local church bells in morning till evening . ER/ hospital close by, and Library to walk to."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Plenty of room.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cara was very helpful and responsive.
The vehicle traffic, church bells and ambulance/police sirens made it next to impossible to sleep in the master bedroom."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a great space, much more comfortable than a hotel. The kitchen is well stocked from dishes to pans and utensils. The dining table is large for a big group. Good sleeping options if families have children. Location is perfect to take advantage of local shops and restaurants.
My groups only suggestion is to replace the sleeping pillows and have a few more.
We loved our stay! Thank you Cara!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was well appointed, extremely comfortable. Cara was a great host, very responsive and friendly.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the 2nd time we stayed at the Main Street loft. It is the perfect location for us when we come to visit family. It is very spacious and very well kept!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay. Plenty of room, lots of Amenities. Family had a pleasurable time. Whenever we visited the area again, this will be first choice."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was as beautiful as the pictures on the AirBnB website, loved the historic building and the exposed brick walls, and it was very clean and comfortable.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Loft was exceptionally nice, walking distance to restaurants and stores. My family was very happy with our visit to Enterprise, AL"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great spacious place for our group to hang out together. The loft is walking distance to dinner, donuts and downtown. Make sure to check out the farmers market on Saturday. Limited supply list was given at check in - be prepared to bring your own toiletries (shampoo, soap) and paper products such as toilet paper, paper towels, etc. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances and dishes which we used to cook most of our meals. We loved the place and definitely would stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wow!!! Really enjoyed my stay. Beautiful loft and a great little downtown!!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for our wedding party right in the middle of beautiful downtown Enterprise!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very cool, spacious and unique in a up and coming little town. Definitely would stay there again!! Great stores to shop and the donut shop is great. Walkable strip and felt safe."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second visit to Cara’s flat, it was just as perfect as the first. The space, the location, full kitchen meets all cooking needs and proximity to Ft Rucker. Love this place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Main Street Loft! It was right in the heart of quaint, downtown Enterprise. The loft was very clean and exactly as described. Beds were plentiful and there was plenty of seating for our group of 6. It was very cool to stay in such a historic building. Other reviewers had complained about the church bells, but we did not find them disturbing at all. We loved the coffee machine and coffee included! Cara was responsive and helpful."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we’ve stayed here and we love it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent experience
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"The positives: It’s a beautifully restored historic building. Very spacious and decorated beautifully. The furnishings are very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and extra blankets were available. The location couldn’t be better. It’s within walking distance of several eateries, shopping and historic sites. Parking is on the Main Street and even though an event was going on, there was ample parking available. Enterprise itself is a fun place to explore.
Not so positive:
There’s no elevator. I think that should be mentioned in the description so guests are aware.
The staircase doesn’t have any railing for part of it and the railing that is on the upper level is loose. If someone leaned against it, I think it would give
I always leave the places I rent in good shape and automatically clean up but we were expected to wash, dry, fold and put away the extra blankets. I feel that is asking a bit too much.
Supplies like toilet paper, trash bags, soap, etc., were minimal or not provided.
There is a Keurig coffee maker - not mentioned in description, so I didn’t know to bring K-cups.
In summary, it’s a lovely place to stay, just be aware of the above items."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful property!! Hope to be able to stay there again!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it. So clean and cute
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful loft! Very spacious and comfortable!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the best ive ever had in the 20 yrs of coming to enterprise. Looking forward to staying there again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing loft in a perfect location for flight school graduation. Beautifully decorated and equipped, we prepared dinner our first night followed by drinks at a local upscale bar and grill located a short walk away. There’s a great selection of shops up and down Main St as well as a farmer’s market on Tuesdays and Saturday mornings. The restaurant in the Rawls hotel is perfect for any special occasion dinner, we loved the player baby grand piano and we were serenaded by our waiter as well. Cara went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, will definitely stay at this loft again!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed in the loft while attending an event for our son at nearby Fort Rucker. We were very pleased with the prompt and courteous communications we received from Cara. Everything in the booking went smoothly. We arrived in the early evening and were quite pleased to find some of the lights on and the A/C set to a comfortable temperature when we arrived. We were quite road-weary, and this was a nice and welcoming touch. We were able to park in a parking lot just across from the entrance door on the side of the building, which was very convenient.
The loft was a lovely mix of historic and modern updates. The brick walls, high ceilings and wooden floors meshed well with the updated kitchen and baths and the wall-mounted televisions. The loft was well-decorated and comfortable. Everything was clean and neat and orderly and exactly as described in the listing. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for showers. Being that there were only the two of us, we were swimming in all of the space, and it felt kind of elegant. Our military son came by to see the place and deemed it ""a really neat place"".
Others have commented on the street noise, and we got to experience some of it. We were awakened on Friday morning by the city street cleaner at 4 a.m. as it made its way down Main Street. We were getting up early, anyway, so it wasn't too big of a deal for us. The street cleaner returned to clean the street next to the loft at 6 a.m. We were preparing to leave for our day at this point, so again it wasn't an issue. While it was a bit noisy at a very early hour, we recognized that we were living in a downtown setting and also appreciated the city's desire to have clean streets.
In the evenings and overnight, there were several ""vehicular enthusiasts"" who liked to rev their engines as they raced down Main Street, but there's nothing that can be done about that. We normally live in a very quiet, rural area, so having to deal with some ""city"" noise was a change for us, but not so much as to make us unhappy. The bell tower tolling throughout the day was actually quite pleasant, and it didn't bother us at all. The noises we heard were understandable and did not detract from our stay. We mention it only to let others know what to possibly expect and to have reasonable expectations. We chalked it up to being in an urban setting and just rolled with it.
We were there three days and two nights, and it suited our needs perfectly. Local businesses were plentiful and all within walking distance. The Downtown Donuts shop a few blocks away was well worth the walk on Saturday morning. Getting to Fort Rucker and around to various stores and restaurants around the area was easy. Coming back each night to the loft was a pleasure.
Check out was as easy as it gets: clean up after yourself, leave the bed unmade so they know where you slept, take out the trash, turn up the thermostat, turn off the lights and lock your door on the way out. Couldn't have been simpler or more straight-forward.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the loft and would stay there again if we travel to Enterprise in the future. The mild inconvenience of some street noise is not enough to keep us from returning. The vintage loft with modern conveniences was well-worth it. Staying there made our trip much more enjoyable and memorable than staying in a hotel. The loft has character and charm and history. That we would stay there again is as good an endorsement as we can give."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cara’s Airbnb is great! This place is in an awesome location. The loft is beautiful and well maintained.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful loft. Accommodating host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this place! Perfect location in downtown Enterprise. There was plenty of space and very comfortable! We will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty nice place. We liked the location, being right in the downtown area. The restaurants and shops close by were awesome (Coffee Corner, Annie’s, Cafe Roma, Downtown Donuts), but the church bells across the street go off every hour on the hour (8 AM until 9 PM). The bells also go off for 15 minutes straight at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM - something to keep in mind if you’re a light sleeper, because the walls in the master bedroom are paper thin. You’ll be woken up all night by loud cars driving by and promptly at 8 AM by your 15 minute church-bell alarm. However, the bed is very comfortable. The other bedroom is MUCH quieter and still has a nice queen size bed, and the tv is way closer to the bed which is nice too! The kitchen has basic utensils and pans, but the cabinets and drawers have a weird smell, so we washed everything before using it. And if you’re going to cook, you’ll need to buy your own salt, pepper, and every basic cooking need. The balcony is pretty but it’s not accessible. We also saw several small roaches, flies, and other bugs. The bathtub in the master bathroom has jacuzzi settings, but started oozing this gross yellow stuff when we tried to use it. The bare minimum of towels, toilet paper, and paper towels is provided. It was enough for 2 of us for 2 nights, but if you’re staying for a week with more than 2 people, it would be frustrating having to bring your own toilet paper. Overall, it was a fine place to stay. Very very spacious, easy check in and check out, mostly nice location."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place with very comfortable furniture and beds and conveniently situated in downtown Enterprise.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for an amazing stay
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft in downtown Enterprise; so relaxing!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very cool loft style AirBnb. Such a cool place tucked away in downtown enterprise. Very nice and clean. Would definitely stay here again, probably the best place to stay in enterprise. Host does a wonderful job of communication and makes it very easy."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This loft was absolutely beautiful in a historic area and the pics don’t do justice meaning once you walk in you will will be wowed! I would definitely stay again and the location was great near restaurants and shopping all on the same street the host Cara was great with responding.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was gorgeous. Spacious so comfortable. Great style. Stocked up. The bathrooms...wow

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. I recommend it
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time having stayed at Scott's listing and things went perfectly both times! The unit is as described, very clean, comfortable beds, seamless check-in, and great A/C (which is a must for us). The only call-out (which is no fault of the owners) is that this listing is located near a busy highway, so the road noise bothers me a bit when it's time for bed (only bc I need it silent to fall asleep). It didn't bother the other guests who were with me, so I slept with a sound machine and that did the trick for me! Just something to be aware of.
SUPER kid-friendly. They have toddler cups, a high chair, a pack and play and even a few toys. The kitchen is also equipped with everything you need to cook.
Scott is thoughtful and incredible host - extremely responsive and even accommodated a last-minute late check out request. We will absolutely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time staying in Enterprise, everything was clean and very accommodable, if we are ever in the area again we would love to stay here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scotts place was great! We were attending our son’s graduation from flight school at Rucker, very close and cozy."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great experience at the Airbnb! It was the perfect size for our guests. Thank you to the hosts for the wonderful accommodations and for the bottle of wine! We hope to come again.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I used it for a film so it’s nice. I like it. It’s a small little place but it definitely is a place for a get together. Had a great time. Definitely a good place if you are staying in enterprise.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in a convenient location with quick access to multiple restaurants, grocery stores, and other shops. Everything was as described. We enjoyed spending time with our family watching basketball on the large TV in the living room."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Scott was very helpful in accommodating us for our unexpected stay on short notice.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location and a beautiful home. We had a wonderful stay for are volleyball tournament weekend.
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place has a lot going for it; good layout, cute decor and well stocked. However, a cleaning mishap (unwashed linens) cannot be overlooked, thus the low rating. Scott was appropriately apologetic and was willing to find a remedy, but unfortunately getting into a dirty bed cannot really be fixed. I believe once the cleaning issues are resolved, Scott’s place will be a gem."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,After a late check in everything seemed okay. In the morning we noticed things not as clean as they could have been as the day went on.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Scott was easy to communicate with and helpful when my plans changed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great host! Host quickly responded to messages I sent and was very accommodating.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was perfect! We stayed for a week while visiting family nearby. There was plenty of room for our family of 4. The house was clean and cute, the kitchen was stocked well enough that we cooked several meals there. The beds were comfortable, the showers were hot and had good pressure (thats an important one for me!). Location was convenient to grocery stores and food. The house is at the entrance of a quiet little neighborhood. We felt safe and comfortable. Check in and check out were simple. Communication was easy. We were so happy with our stay, we could not have asked for more! We would gladly stay here again for any future visits to the area!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place very neat and tons of extras! The beds were comfy and they even had a bottle of wine waiting for us!!! Lots of thoughtful touches and Scott was available for any questions we had. The outdoor space was great to relax and talk. Would stay again

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My trip was personal and complicated in an area I grew up in and and am highly familiar with. Still, the home met all of our needs and was even more convenient than I guess when I booked. The hosts were very proactive ahead of my visit and responsive to all questions and concerns. Even though I have the opportunity to stay with family on my next visit, I'd consider booking here again for my own sanity, personal space and peace of mind."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The property was clean and neat and a great place to stay and relax. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. I would stay here again.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome host and a very beautiful clean home. I would definitely recommend this place. 💯
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cannot give a high enough recommendation for this place. We had a last minute booking as we found ourselves at a less than desired rental home during our family road-trip. It was our son’s birthday and the hosts kindly welcomed our late arrival with personalized amenities to support our family movie night.
The home was incredibly clean and comfortable. Good shower pressure, fans in every room, comfortable beds and bedding. Carport was a plus to keep our car safe and reduce the heat.
The hosts go out of their way to ensure the stay is comfortable and accommodating. They communicate with kindness and expediency.
My kids renamed it the “sunny home” based on the awesome sunporch. My husband and I enjoyed coffee (provided by the hosts) on the sunporch as we planned out the next leg of our road-trip.
The value cannot be beat for the level of attention provided by the hosts.
Highly recommend staying at LA the next time you pass through the area!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So grateful to Scott’s last-minute accommodation! This place felt just like home, was squeaky clean and the bottle of wine was an added touch. Absolutely will be staying here again in the future! Only complaint is the house is located off of a highway, so there is light traffic noise, but we we’re able to sleep great despite that."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for our family visit. Grocery is just a few min drive away, along with other stores/restaurants. The kitchen was very useful for us. Living room was nice and comfortable. If you have more than four people staying I would recommend a few more chairs for the dining table. Also, bring your own shampoo & conditioner if needed. Nice outside screened in porch with table. Some noise does filter from room to room and a tiny bit of traffic noise, so if you are a sensitive sleeper bring earplugs."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,all good
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,It was located not too far from the civic center where our event was. There was plenty of room for all of the guests. The extra details of having kids toys and sippy cups in the cabinet for little ones was a plus for our toddler. She loved the alphabet puzzle and play birthday cake. We made some great family memories in just the short time we were there.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a sports tournament and wanted more of a relaxed atmosphere than a hotel setting. This home was close to everything we needed access to. When we arrived the home was extremely clean. I own a cleaning company and I tend to be a harsh critic on rentals. I could not complain at all! The layout of the house was perfect for our group and the two full bathrooms were a plus. Beds were comfortable, bathroom towels were high quality, and the wine left was the extra little touch that showed the owners cared. I would highly recommend this home to anyone and definitely will book again if we are back in the area."
