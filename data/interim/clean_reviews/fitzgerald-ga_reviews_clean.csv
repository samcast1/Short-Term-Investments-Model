This was the break for that type place I needed I will stay here every time I am in town. I am reluctant to say how much I liked my stay here because I want it available for me."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming cabin and great host. Looking forward to staying Groovy Acres again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Groovy Acres for nearly 2 weeks for a work trip. It couldn't have been more perfect. The cabin is cute, with great porches and everything you need. It is near Shellahs house, but it is quiet and private. I am a light sleeper and had no trouble at all. The pool is really beautiful and the property is very large, plenty of places to explore. I enjoyed riding my bike around on the quiet dirt roads. There are adorable dogs and cats around to pet, and pigs to visit. Shellah and her husband are very kind and made me feel right at home. Highly recommend if you are in the area!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little cabin to spend some time in. Great pool in the front and private porch in the back. Also loved the dogs and barn cats that come to say hi throughout the day

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a peaceful and enchanted place. We staid at Shellah's guesthouse for several weeks to get away from everything. A wonderful, simple, maybe 100 year old wooden house with a lot of charm but very well maintained. We enjoyed remote-working on the private back porch with visits from the ""gang"" , three cute farm dogs and a cat. Cooked and baked a lot in the kitchen, fed the two pigs with our kitchen scraps, took a dip from time to time in the pool and enjoyed sunsets in the rocking chairs on the front porch. We will definitely be back."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A really amazing guest house with a warm and friendly family hosting. Had a wonderful time staying here and found it to be the perfect place to escape and rejuvenate! Can't say enough great things about it!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I HIGHLY recommend this place for either short term or semi-long term rental. I enjoyed my stay, the room was spacious with a great sized closet. Even though our stay was only for two nights, I could see myself staying here for a lot longer. Host was extremely respectful and responsive. Flexible check in due to it being self check in was a plus. 5/5 stars!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice and cozy, quick drive to everything you need!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a place to stay while visiting family near by and this place fit the bill! It’s exactly as described. There’s plenty of space in the living room and bedrooms. The bedrooms have great ceiling fans and tons of extra blankets (there’s only one window HVAC unit for the whole apartment). While the bathroom and kitchen are small, they have everything you need. There is plenty of parking but if someone is staying in the downstairs unit it’s a little tricky bc the parking isn’t marked. Bernardina was responsive to my questions and communicated well. We would definitely stay at her place again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space for a weekend getaway. The host was very responsive and friendly. The house was very comfortable and we felt right at home. Thank you for letting us use your beautiful place.

We did wake up cold in the middle of the night and weren’t sure how to adjust the heating/air but were able to find additional blankets in a bedroom closet. Overall, we had a nice stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I live on the road for work. This was way better than a cheap inn or hotel. I really enjoyed feeling like I was in a clean home.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. It was a nice clean comfortable apartment. I would have stayed longer if the dates I was in town were available.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unsatisfactory cleanliness & functionality despite clean & comfortable beds, effective AC, and great shower pressure w/ plenty of hot water. Nate's acknowledgement & response to my dissatisfaction does not change the fact that the house did not meet basic standards. There was kitchen grime on the inside of several cabinet drawers and the doors of oven, frig & freezer. Other inadequate cleaning included dust rings on several counters (bathroom/BRs & kitchen), dirt in the grooves of shower walls, a soiled & frayed dish sponge, a used coffee pod in the keurig, large smudges on cabinets & other woodwork, and 2 used ashtrays on the front porch. The kitchen was inadequately equipped for even simple cooking--each nonstick pan was too scratched to use; only 1 big knife & no cutting board; an astonishing variety of stemmed glasses, 4 coffee mugs & no plain water/juice glasses. No mixing bowls. Bathroom supplies (TP & hand soap) found in the laundry room. And sales awards as LR decor? Nope."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd time to stay at Nate’s place. As always, it was clean and comfortable. Nate is friendly, flexible, and quick to reply to messages.
I’ll will definitely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Place is amazing, 100% recommend we stayed there for a 3 months with a work crew and Nate's place was wonderful, beautiful area and very safe, a lot things to do in the area.
Nate is a great host, he will always there if you have any questions or need help with anything!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was comfortable and cozy with all the amenities we needed. There was plenty of room for our party of 5. I wondered if it would be noisy at night because it's on a busy street, but it was a quiet neighborhood and we had no problems getting a great night's sleep. Nate was easy to communicate with and quick to respond, and he went out of his way to accommodate us. 5 stars from us, and we won't hesitate to come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Awesome place to stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When visiting home before, we would always stay at a local hotel, not wanting to impose on family and friends. Also, it’s nice to be able to step away and decompress after the excitement of spending time with loved ones. Nate’s place was the same price as a room but so much cleaner and personable. Family were able to come to us to share meals and time together, something that doesn’t really work with a hotel room. The house was large, three bedrooms, and we didn’t even go into the biggest and smaller bedrooms. We were able to extend our stay an extra night and Nate checked to see if we had everything we needed several times. I highly recommend Nate and his place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nate was extremely helpful and very communicative. We had issues with the heating and the shower water being cold but he had no issues with coming over to help out with everything..
There are huge cracks all over the ceilings that you cannot see through photos but as for a older home I guess we should have expected that.. I do think whoever is cleaning needs to do a little bit better of a job, the fans had a lot of dust caked on them and the shower doors seemed dirty especially near the bottom of them.. there’s also a leak on the bottom corner of the shower, we had to put a couple hand towels down to soak up all the water that would come out but the surrounding area was extremely peaceful and was close to alot of places"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nate's place was great. Lots of space and nice and clean. Everything we could need was within walking distance. It was perfect for my family of 6 while we were town for the weekend for a wedding. Would definitely stay here again if I need to go to Fitzgerald again.Thanks Nate!

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If I need to return, I would stay again at your house"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nate’s place was conveniently located. We were in town for due diligence on a home we are purchasing and it was nice to be able to get a feel for downtown. We could walk to most of what we needed and Walmart was within 10 minutes. We even took a drive to Tifton while we were there to explore a few of the amenities there.
Nate was responsive and helpful. Instructions were clear."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Clean, comfortable, and close to everything we needed.
We’ll stay with Nate again next year!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home and were very comfortable. We enjoyed visiting my hometown and this place was the perfect spot. You can snuggle on this awesome couch and watch a movie while visiting family, make some breakfast in a southern kitchen and get a great night's sleep in one of the perfectly kept bedrooms (I loved the pillows)! Best of all, if you have any questions, Nate will have the answer in a timely manner. This place is a sweet, kept secret that I'm so glad we discovered. Thanks Nate! Can't wait to return! ☺"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here! I brought my almost 3 yr old and she had a blast playing in the house. I felt completely comfortable with her hiding under the large desk and behind the sofa because it was so clean! We had some family stay with us too and the layout of the house was such that we all had a good amount of room and privacy! we will stay again.

Host is extremely responsive, place is very clean and the multiple rooms give a lot of flexibility for various guest arrangements in terms of different bed sizes and setups. Love the location being across from a nice Mexican restaurant and near the heart of town or at least pretty centrally located. Great place, look forward to my next stay."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Totally great spot for a quick stay. The place is clearly a re-done commercial building but serves all our purposes adequately. Couple of fun spots to eat and drink nearby but it’s a small town so not tons of options. Would stay again if coming though that area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay with Nate! The house is clean and close to town!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Check in/check out was very simple. The host Nate was accommodating and easy to communicate with.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our hosts were very responsive.
They checked to make sure we were able to check in without any issues, which we did without any problems.
The house was as described with plenty of rooms and space. IF our group of 5 had needed to spread out, there were gracious plenty rooms. In addition there was space large enough for all of us to be together in several rooms as well.
I’ve never had to use a first aid kit until this trip. We were thankful for it when my husband hurt himself in the rental car!
There is a lot of history throughout the house. I just loved the spice cabinet!! The kitchen was very well stocked with plates, cups, glasses, mugs, etc. And the kitchen knives really cut!!
We enjoyed eating a couple of times under the covered walkway. During our stay the weather was great for being outdoors.
It was very helpful when I figuredout that the corner of the white picket fence indicates that I need to turn onto the side street to get to the driveway of the house for parking."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed the house and it was very spacious. I wish we had more time to stay but we were just passing through on our way to FL for spring break. I can't say much about the area because we arrived at night and left in the morning (about 12 hour stay) but the owners have a wonderful home and its very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was awesome! Host was very accommodating and responsive. We will definitely be coming back
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfect all the reason we have come back each year. Thanks again!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great hosts who were responsive. The home was large and very clean with plenty of amenities. The only drawback was the steady noise of a nearby train which kept several of us up throughout the night. Would I stay again? Yes, but I would bring a sound machine or noise eliminating app."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable, convenient, roomy, private, and very affordable! Love the hosts, very friendly! Would definitely stay again and refer others!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We visited the area to spend Thanksgiving with my brother, and other family. During previous visits in recent years, we stayed at hotels in Tifton and wanted to be closer to Fitzgerald. My daughter recommended checking the Airbnb site and we found this impressive house. The house was equipped with everything needed to make us feel right at home. BONUS - it was within 3 minutes of my brother's house and no more than 7-10 minutes to homes of my other relatives. The massive interior, design and yards provided us ample space to enjoy time together and private time. My family, relatives and friends who visited us at the house loved it. Jennifer and Nathaniel were exceptional, responsive, attentive, and accommodating hosts. The comfortable beds, multiple sitting areas inside and outside, loads of snacks, coffee, teas, and every utensil imaginable made the home an amazing choice for our family. My family and I highly recommends this house to future travelers to Fitzgerald. Nov. 2023."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Nathaniel hosted our team members for our youth development work in Fitzgerald. We have stayed at various places over the course of the past year and we found this accommodation to be one of the better ones the area has to offer. Mainly, the update and central location were of note."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home! This met our needs very well. There’s lots of space to spread out and most anything you’ll need is available, including books and board games. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. I loved the art work on the walls. The listing is very accurate. Communication was top notch! My one note is that if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs bc there is a train nearby that runs throughout the day and night (there are sound machines in the bedrooms). We will definitely stay here again when we need lodging in the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to Fitzgerald to visit with family who live in and around the area, Jennifer and Nathanial were very responsive , very accommodating and very nice from the very beginning. The house was beautiful very clean and also supplied lots of coffee options, to go cups and plenty of snacks. The residential area was very nice and quiet and walkable to the grocery store and restaurants. The house was extremely comfortable and was a wonderful place to visit with our family. Jennifer and Nathanial checked in on us throughout our stay and were willing to help in anyway way they could. They accommodated an early check in for us which was very much needed after a long drive. They were amazing hosts we are excited to come back and stay at the house again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was exactly as advertised with plenty of parking and space for the kids to hang out. Will definitely be reaching out to reserve this listing as needed in the future!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is spacious, comfortable and beautiful. The location is convenient to everything in Fitzgerald. This home is worth the price and we will definitely be repeat visitors. Thank you for a wonderful few days."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful house.. loved the charm of the
delightfully restored historic house. Jennifer and Nathaniel have thought of everything to make your stay memorable. Snacks and coffee in the butlers pantry to a well stocked kitchen gives the feel of a home away from home. Jennifer responded quickly to a small issue that was beyond their control and had someone over to address it right away. I will definitely stay here again when I visit my hometown family and friends"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We loved our stay in Fitzgerald. Great hosts, super communicative and accommodating. Thank you for having us"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, will definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hi! This is a GREAT place to stay! Every bed is one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on. Pillows and linens were great as well! And I cannot say enough about how easy it was for our 4 person family to relax on the couch with our electronics and TV. This is a great space to decompress. My only recommendation for anyone staying is to bring a noise maker bc you can hear the train. We brought box fans (which we take to every airbnb) and we didn’t hear the train at night. This is a great place to stay. We highly recommend it!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked another stay here for a few employees that are out of town for work. No complaints! The place is very comfortable.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We will definitely be back if we are in the area!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Blue Cottage was very spacious and relaxing. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunately, we did not have an excellent stay here. It was pitch black dark when we arrived, we passed the house the first time, had to use flashlight on our phones to find the lockbox but it was empty even though we had a received a message that the key was in the lockbox. The door was already unlocked, which made us nervous. The host did come walk through and turn some lights on at our request. There was old food in the fridge and the kitchen was apparently not cleaned well because one person in our party is very allergic to peanuts and had a reaction after touching surfaces in the kitchen within minutes of our arrival. I had to clean the kitchen myself. There was no soap in the kitchen or the bathroom, and the shower liner was mildewed. There was also laundry left in the dryer and dishes in the dishwasher. We were asked to wash dishes, but there was no dishwasher detergent. There were cigarette butts left in the carport and the back porch/yard was unusable. Won't stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute house! We live in Texas but my in laws live in Fitzgerald. We need a little extra room since they only have one extra bed and there were 3 of us and dogs! This place was very convenient. We really were only there at night for the most part, but the house is very spacious and would be a great place to gather! The street is a busy one, but was not loud when you were indoors. I personally love hearing trains but it wasn’t even ver frequent. The price was amazing and we will definitely rent again any time we come to visit!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as always
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Cute enough house, just could do with some nice touches like throws, wine glasses, cooking bits like oil, salt, pepper etc.
My husband slept fine but I couldn’t sleep due to the trains blaring their horns every 20 mins, a night with no sleep for me."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Easy check-in, really nice accommodations and very nice space with lots of room.

Overall, great stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Perfect for small groups as we go as a group of men for a regional car swap meet. Has everything you need, always clean and neat. Be prepared to hear the train, sometimes a little more than other days but you get used to it. Nothing bad to say, would definitely recommend."

amenities to start your trip.. highly recommend"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great House! If ever back in the area would definitely stay here again.
2022-03-01,3.0,Group trip,"Wish I could give this place a better review. The host was aware that my group had 6 of us and even though the listing said “sleeps 6,” the 6th bed was a pull out and was completely covered in plastic and we couldn’t find any sheets when we arrived around midnight (we were stopping through on our way to FL from TN). This was extremely frustrating because 2 people then had to sleep together on an uncomfortable single bed. The train was also very loud at 3am and 4am - if you’re a light sleeper this place might not be for you (I also awoke to the neighbors yelling and leaving at 4am)."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place would recommend to anyone
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed my stay. Convenient and accommodating.

A word of advice - cell service is non existent (at least with T-Mobile) so load offline maps for GPS before getting off the Highway."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our visit was wonderful. We recommend this home in Fitzgerald. Cute little town and nice relaxing stop over.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Brandy's house. It was very clean and attractive. We enjoyed the paintings she had on the walls. I have never see such a selection of books to read. She also a had a very large selection of children's books. She also had a book that had a history of Fitzgerald and places (with pictures) of places to eat and visit. This helped a lot. Some of the places also had hours printed. This helps for people like us who are not familiar with the area. We look forward to staying with her again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage in great location! Host is very accommodating!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a Quiet place to call home for your short or extended stay in Fitzgerald GA, this is it! The location was quiet and peaceful.

It’s absolutely beautiful, very spacious, comfortable and Brandy was a pleasure to work with. She communicated so well with us through our trip and was so understanding about our late check-in. My 3 children slept peacefully and so did my husband and I. Lovely neighborhood and Brandy added a great book of resources, places to eat, and info about the town! Very neat! Definitely book this home!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location - safe and convenient
Very nice and clean house"
2021-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Looking for a nice clean quiet place to get away? This is it. Close enough to whatever or far away from everything.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place with everything needed for a comfy stay. Fitzgerald is adorable - take a walk around the town. There are trains that make train sounds, so earplugs may be handy. The house is clean and roomy."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we have stayed here before & enjoyed our repeat visit just as much!

Beautiful drive from Tifton. We will definitely consider staying here again when we are there to visit!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brandy was a great host, the house was clean and the price was very reasonable I would recommend this home if your family is visiting Fitzgerald."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was as close as we could get for visiting family in town.... it comfortably fit my family of 5... we hope to be back very soon 😀
2021-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was okay , Owner should invest in keyless entry . The lockbox was hard to open and I kept losing the key to the place . A bit outdated for the charge of everything and the cleanliness should be better with the fee they charge"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandy's place was lovey! Our pup loved the fenced backyard and made a fence-friend in the dog next door. The chickens were charming too. The house has every amenity you'll need and it's very comfortable. I would recommend bringing ear plugs though, as trains do go through the town at night and their horns sound for a couple of minutes as they go by."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy home! Perfect location
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you are heading to fitzgerald, this is your place!
thank you thank you for making our trip better than ever.
we will return"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Blue Cottage was very charming. The kitchen is equipped with most of what you'd need while away from home. Many trains travel through relatively loudly at night. Had we been a group of only adults we probably wouldn't have minded but it made it difficult with a small child. The neighborhood seemed safe and has sidewalks to enjoy walks. Overall the Cottage was a great value. Thank you!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've been able to stay here several times and can vouch for the value of the stay. Brandy is super great to work with and responds quickly to any question you have. The home is always clean and neat and we have no problems with anything. Would highly recommend to anyone!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing place to stay
2021-01-01,3.0,Group trip,Off the path a bit. Great Mexican food down the street.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandy's place is one that I will be visiting again. I was late checking out and they were very nice and professional about it, even came out to check on me. Thank you for your beautiful home and the hospitality. The chickens are beautiful and no crowing in the morning ;)"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place! I loved the old hardwood floors! Lots of space and very comfortable!! Would definitely recommend!!
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was just as pictured, I would have liked to have more light to see the driveway better at night. The house is a little drafty in the winter but is nothing that turning up the heat a little won't fix. The only things I would bring for the next time are pillows from home and a larger coffee cup. Other than that it felt like home. There are trains going through and vehicles on the busy street, but they did not seem to bother anyone in my crew. The chickens were interesting as well."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute house and town. The town is building a giant chicken, because they have wild chickens that visit. The host gave great advice on what to see in the town. There are a bunch of neat old mansions, cobblestone streets and a refurbished cubouse."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here a couple times and pleased everytime. Any questions I had were quickly answered and they accommodated adding a day to our stay last minute. Very nice place and has everything you need.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great convenient stay.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Brandy’s house was perfect and fit all our needs. It was so clean and she even left the lights on for us because we arrived after dark! Our little girl forgot all her books to read and was so excited to see the huge bookshelf full of wonderful children’s books. What a treat! We will be back for sure!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were extremely pleased with this house! So spacious and equipped with everything needed and wanted. Beautiful home and very clean. We own our own cleaning business so we always pay attention to this and I have no complaints. Although the owner is close by in case you need them, they never interrupted our stay. I highly recommend this home rental!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brandy has a beautiful house in Fitzgerald Georgia we stayed there twice and had great experiences both times. Brandy is an outstanding host; the house was clean and well-appointed.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was so welcoming and wonderful. We really enjoyed the kitchen and dinner table. We had plenty of space to do work and to be able to enjoy time together. We had to extend a couple of days and Brenda was so helpful in getting us set up. So grateful for the communication. Looking forward to hopefully future travels in Fitzgerald.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great hospitality clean, affordable home"

2019-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"In all honesty, our stay here was not good. It needs to be updated desperately as it’s old and worn, not in a cool historic way, more in we just don’t care about this property kinda way. To be clear we have stayed at many Airbnb’s around the country and Europe, all much better than this one. We were very disappointed and will not be staying again."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the homey feeling at the blue cottage! It is about a 30 minute drive to tifton. But I’ll stay here against.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Cottage is just as described and simply could not have more character. The home is spacious and clean with such an eclectic, funky vibe. we loved all the random paintings throughout the home, the pink tiled bathroom was just adorable and the vintage kitchen was a joy to cook in. We also loved the back patio and fenced in yard, very private.
We also enjoyed it was walking distance to Harvey's Grocery and downtown antique shopping. We recommend Cirillo's Pizza less than .5 miles away, cool vibe with nice happy hour specials.
P.S. we loved the sounds of the train passing by at night AND the chickens chattering :)"

Chickens wandering around the backyard!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandy has a beautiful home filled with unique touches. She provided a great brochure of places to eat and things to do in the area. Her quick communication was greatly appreciated. Trains do frequent the area during the day and night. If you are a light sleeper, this could be a problem. We are from Orlando where planes fly over all of time time. Therefore, it was not a huge issue. I loved the small town feel of Fitzgerald. Brandy's home is in a perfect location to enjoy the quaint town. We would stay again if in the area."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Third time there. If you have a need to be in Fitzgerald, this is the place."

2018-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Brandy's place is as described, it was very cute with a lot of wonderful touches- well decorated and it really felt like a home. I loved the trees in the backyard and the old wood floors, as well as the cute kitchen. The only problem we had was that the pull-out was not very comfortable, so if you are sensitive to that it would be best to take one of the other beds. The twin beds in the room with two were very firm so if you want a softer bed the single twin or king are best. The single bed room also is sort of an entryway from the back porch that has been converted into a bedroom, so it may not be the most soundproof. We could also hear a rooster outside- doesn't bother me at all since I'm used to the sound but another thing to be mindful of if you aren't used to that. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and I would book again if we ever are in the area!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage is super cute and we enjoyed our stay as we traveled through Georgia to vacation and then back home. Even though it was a little more than we wanted to travel off 75, we booked and I would do it again. As it was definitely worth it to relax in a comfortable atmosphere as a family but yet still have our own space. Check in with the lockbox was really easy along with the tips that were sent prior to our arrival. Thank you for taking great care of this house so others can enjoy more comfortable travels!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brandy was an exceptional host! She took us for a tour of the town and was incredibly hospitable. The house had plenty of room for my family of 7 and was clean, organized, and charming. There is a train that passes through town quite often overnight, which was a bit loud while sleeping, but definitely manageable. Overall a great experience, would be happy to stay here again!!"
2018-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Nice quiet place. Ideal for a stop over between 2 destinations
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is just what my family of 5 needed after a long day of driving. We felt right at home and Brandy has went above and beyond to make sure you have all the amenities you’ll need. It was sparkling clean, the beds are SO comfortable, and the kids loved watching cartoons in the living room in the morning. Check in is super easy and Brandy has speedy communication. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bridesmaids and I stayed here for my wedding weekend, and I couldn’t have dreamed of a better space for me and my girls. Super clean, plenty of space to move around, great location. I most definitely would recommend!"

The home is perfectly appointed, very clean, everything is included, and highly comfortable. We had a wonderful time on the property grounds as well.

Not much around the area in terms of dining, but we had a decent meal at a Mexican restaurant a few miles down the road.
Nice and quiet and got a good night’s sleep. Very nice accommodations. Check in and check out was super simple and all the procedures were well documented. Donna was quick to answer any questions before we arrived."

We will be back in 2023 if not before!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed in the tiny house for a few days while in town for a family reunion.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I have stayed in a few Airbnbs but never one so homey. Donna is the definition of SuperHost. She made sure I was good from the moment I checked in until I left. She would randomly text to see if all was well. I have never stayed in an Airbnb for more than 4 days. This was my first time staying a month. She had everything a home would have so I didn’t need anything extra. The bed and pillows were amazing and so colorful. I have looked for the same pillows for my own home. Highly recommend and I will be back. Thank you so much Donna!!!!!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was blown away as Iwalked into this beautiful home. The pictures didn't do it justice. Fully furnished with all utensils needed.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was excited to stay in this property on my travels from Florida to Tennessee and I surely was not disappointed!

If you are traveling thru the area definitely take a detour - you won’t regret it!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! It was big for a tiny home. Very clean. Donna is very kind, clear communication and prompt response.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a super sweet spot! We only stopped at Donna`s for a quick overnight break, so we didn`t explore any of the surrounding areas. Donna has an extremely cute yet spacious tiny house. The place was tastefully decorated with thoughtful little touches throughout. Donna was very good communicator and she replied to any questions we had promptly. This would be a good place for a longer stay since it has a fully stocked pavilion, a fire pit, washer and dryer and everything else you would need for a comfortable gateway. Thank you for having us!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna’s place was great. The house was clean and the bed was comfortable. We cooked every night and had just about everything we needed (the only seasoning the house had was salt/pepper which is common for most rentals). The house is a great size for two and a pup and we had no problem finding a place for her crate in the bedroom (for reference she is a 50 pound golden retriever). Donna was kind and thoughtful and even checked in via messages during our stay to ensure everything was well. There were two over rentals on the property, but we had no problems with our temporary neighbors. I was attending a virtual convention during my stay and has 0 issues with the wifi, I was even able to join my Zoom calls from the comfort of the outdoor bar area. The place is a 2 minute drive from walmart and less than 10 minutes from downtown. I definitely recommend staying here, and if I ever find myself back in Fitzgerald I will be checking to see if Donna’s place is available!"

We really enjoyed the opportunity to get off I-75 and see some backroads. The house is within a mile of historic downtown Fitzgerald, which has more than a dozen restaurants."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful tiny home. Located pretty much near everything. Walmart was only three minutes away so that was a plus. Anytime I had a question and contacted her she didn’t mind helping . She also offered a lot of household items as far as laundry detergent etc. The style of the place was so beautiful and it smelled amazing when we walked in. It was an amazing experience and I’ll definitely be back. My kids had an amazing time as well❤️

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny farmhouse cabin was beautiful and welcoming. This has been my favorite Airbnb in Fitzgerald, GA so far!! I travel weekly for my job and have stay at a few other Airbnb’s in Fitzgerald but the tiny farmhouse cabin is my #1 favorite. The bed is comfy and the water pressure is amazing for a good hot shower in the mornings to wake you up or a nice hot shower to relax you before bed! The wifi is fast and you can log into the smart TV for those that have Netflix or Hulu. I hope to return soon!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is AMAZING! It was way bigger then you’d think, SO clean with every essential you could need if you forgot yours. The little town is so friendly and the host Donna was amazing from the minute we booked. Everything was as it was said and then some. We are already planning a trip back. This was better then our entire week cabin in the Smokys. If you are traveling from Florida to Tennessee/Carolinas or vice versa this little 20 minute out of the way (from 75) tiny cabin will not disappoint. Also try Cirillo’s pizzeria, AMAZING!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Clean and well maintained.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna's little farmhouse is cute and very clean. We needed a place to stay on our way to Florida with our two dogs and it was perfect!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! This cute tiny home was the perfect size for a weekend getaway to relax and enjoy a quiet New Year’s Eve. Donna was great at communicating with the one small issue we had and provided great customer service.

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Was very happy with Donna’s tiny house. The best part was that it was very clean especially during these pandemic times. A fully functional kitchen was a bonus as we wanted to stay in and cook our own meals. Would like to return and ride some of the bike trails.

2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My first time using Airbnb and Donna made me feel comfortable, great hospitality to the point of when I had any concerns she physically came right over minutes later and we talked about any issues or concerns on my mind she reassured me on many things and made my experience wonderful! The tiny house is beautiful just like in the pictures quiet ,great yard, lovely hangout spot and I enjoyed more that it is right across the street from the hospital in case of emergencies ,great location. Great Wi-Fi since there is no service in the area which is scary so thankful for Wi-Fi and for Donna for being such a great hostess!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable home and felt roomier than expected. If you need to use the pull out couch, I'd perhaps consider an alternative, but if a single queen bed is all you need, the one upstairs was very comfortable."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A charming, clean and perfect place to spend a night. We stayed one night en route to North Carolina. The tiny house was easy to find and Donna was a communicative and kind host. The shower pressure is amazing and the house is more spacious than you’d think!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Donna was the epitome of a tremendous host. The cleanliness, hospitality, decoration, attention to detail, and hospitable kindness was second to none. She goes the extra mile and it shows in this great property. The grill, the sounds of the owls at night and beautiful skies as the sun is setting can’t be beat either. I look forward to coming back in the future!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The pictures does not do this property justice. Inside is very spacious and felt like I was at home. I would recommend this property to anyone who’s looking for somewhere to stay within that area. Would definitely stay again.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could go on and on about this place!
I’ve stayed in many AirBnBs but Donna’s place is definitely in my top 3! The house does not at all feel like you imagine a “tiny house” would. When we walked in, we both literally said “wow” at the same time! It felt incredibly warm and homey and Donna even had it decorated for Christmas which was the cherry on top! Everything was very clean, check-in was a breeze, and Donna always responded very quickly when I reached out. She has bikes that she allows her guests to take out as well as a very nice outdoor covered area for cooking/grilling and hanging out. Such a lovely place that I hope
to visit again one day!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't let the word ""Tiny"" fool you. This cottage was definitely comfortable, bigger and more spacious than expected. Beautiful cottage, with all the amenities. Is the complete package. Perfect for a get away, retreat or a few days to get away from it all. This cottage is part of a ""tiny"" home community made up of three cottages. Great location, in a very peaceful, safe and quite area of Fitzgerald. I visited Fitzgerald for business and this cottage was perfect for working, with great internet.

Donna made accessing and checking out very simple. We hope to be back soon!"

Thanks again for having us!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun place to visit. Great and friendly host. If you are passing through worth the visit.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute,clean, tiny home, good access for pets. However, I arrived after dark,on a rainy night and could not see the driveway.
I was partially in a shallow ditch. Reflective lights on either side of the driveway would have helped immensely. Couldn't remember what my cottage looked like, so drove in front of all of them, two of them had outside lights on. Checked picture online and I realized I had driven past it, the first house on the left, that info would have helped. Probably still upset about missing the driveway.
Very easy access to keypad and entry door. Walking in was such a pleasure! Very clean, decorated in a manner fitting space.
Location is too far off I-75 on a dark night.
I really liked the tiny house but arrive in the daylight."

Thank you so much for the accommodations. Highly recommend"

This tiny but mighty house is adorable.
I would recommend this place.
Jessy"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Donna’s place was exactly as described, cute and cozy tiny home. She had decorated for Christmas which was a nice touch. She communicated well, and it was easy to find and access. It worked for our stop on our way to FL. We wish there was a little more to do in the area but everything was probably closed for the holidays."

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Always an easy stay. Stayed here many times.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice stay and was super easy to get to as we are passing through on our road trip.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was nice. I would consider booking again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and functional little cabin. For one person it’s fantastic and as a crash pad could probably sleep 3-4. Very cozy and away from the busy city.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna was great. Very responsive with any questions we had and made sure our needs were met. She was quick to give recommendations for things to do locally.
Tiny house with a host with a huge heart for hosting."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very well done tiny house. Very roomy, extremely comfortable beds, and cute! It was perfect for our midway stop between SC and Florida, and getting to explore Fitzgerald (which we had not researched prior to arrival) was an added unexpected bonus."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was nicely decorated, and the owner was very responsive, but the entry code did not work when we arrived. We also had to ask the host to allow us to stay in the larger tiny home that we booked, rather than a smaller home close by and part of the same property that we did not book. That said, the owner was accommodating when we pointed that out and we did stay in the large cottage that we booked. The cottage was nicely furnished and nothing critical was broken, but the upstairs TV remote did not work consistently, and the rolling door to the only bathroom tended to come off of the tracks, which made exiting the bathroom challenging. There are nice communal amenities, but the stay wasn’t long enough to take advantage of them. I’d stay again but hope for a smoother entry next time though I do want to emphasize the host was very responsive and accommodating, great host."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I always enjoy my time here.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little house!! We enjoyed our short stay. It’s in a great location, very bright& clean! Give it 5 stars!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a neat little gem to spend a weekend! Surprisingly larger inside than we thought from looking at the pictures, and very comfy beds in loft. The fans in loft and even downstairs was nice to have just in case. It was all our first time in a tiny home and we truly enjoyed making the memories."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Donna’s tiny home community! The house we stayed in is a super cute home that efficiently utilizes the small space. Very clean with 1 bedroom, plus a bed in 2 separate loft spaces. Perfect for up to 4 people or a small family. The kids will love sleeping in the lofts. Centrally located in a safe area close to downtown, and right next to a Wal-Mart, restaurants, and a few fast food options. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,100% good place nice experience
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was really fun. We arrived pretty late so we didn’t get to enjoy the outdoor kitchen/pavilion. It’s definitely a tiny house. The kids loved the lofts, the shower is pretty small (too small to shave your legs in). They have the cutest comforter (quilt) in the main bedroom.
I felt right at home with all chicken decor. Would highly recommend staying here if you want something fun, the steps up to the loft are a bit sketchy and wouldn’t not recommend letting a toddler sleep up there."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great location. I would have never expected a house so tiny to have 3 large beds! it was definitely the most fun I have ever had staying somewhere. it may be a tiny house but we never felt cramped and it was very comfortable.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little space for a stop on a road trip! Adorable lofted cottage with plenty of room both inside and out! Beautiful yard and outdoor area to hangout.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can expect a comfortable stay in this tiny home that makes good use of the space and allows plenty of natural light.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First off I would like to say this tiny home is very beautiful and cozy. It has all your needs and if you need anything else the owner is very responsive and helpful for any needs. Donna was very helpful when I had some trouble booking the trip and I had the issue resolved with her help. She is very quick on responding which is very helpful and it makes trip bookings faster and efficient. Donna has a little book in the home that gives you places to eat and shop which was very helpful and these places are only 2-10min away which is awesome. Me and my girlfriend always wanted to stay in a tiny home and we got to experience that with Donna’s tiny home and we are very happy and pleased with our stay.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute tiny home! Donna responded quickly to all communications and had left us snacks and waters. The tiny home had lots of towels, plenty of kitchen dish ware and pans, and comfortable beds! We had a great stay!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house was a great spot for a getaway :)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed an overnight stop on our drive back to NC from FL. This was such a great place to stay. We were a family of four, with 2 kids (11 and 13). They absolutely loved the lofts and they were much more spacious than I thought they would be. The home was full of such great touches, like fresh flowers, board games, and fuzzy throws on the couch. We had everything we could have needed. The bed was very comfortable. The temps were in the 90s when we visited, but the A/C kept the home cool. It was a little warm in the lofts, but fans were provided and it kept it cool. There was also a fan in the bedroom, which was nice to give additional air flow. The outside amenities included a commual laundry room, which we did not need to use, but it was very clean. There is also a commual covered patio area with sink and bar seating. I would absolutely stay here again if in the area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cool place to stay! They did a wonderful job with the layout of this tiny house! We were able to sit back and relax! We will for sure return!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna is a wonderful host. Her responses were helpful & quick, from booking, checking in, and the day of departure.
Upon checking into the cottage, we first noticed the wonderful aroma and fresh flowers (so sweet). Also, it was a hot day and walking inside we, immediately, were cooled off by the a/c. There’s a huge ceiling fan, also, that helps circulate the air & keep the place cool, although the
a/c is more than enough. The cottage is perfectly decorated and supplied - all the kitchen appliances, snacks, bottled waters, coffee, more than enough towels, toiletries, blankets, sheets..
A welcome pamphlet, and things to do in and around Fitzgerald provided - which we didn’t glance at since we were just passing through on our way to Florida, but thoughtful for anyone staying longer and not familiar with the area.
I am super appreciative of Donna with her efforts to all the details. It’s proof she cares!! We truly enjoyed our short stay!!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a perfect spot- well planned and so well decorated and maintained!! Sounds like it will be small and cramped but isn’t!! Donna is great with communication and tries to make everything just right for your stay.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so wonderful! We weren’t sure how much privacy it would have or if the inside would feel a bit smushed, but it was honestly so so great!!! The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze but we are small people so it didn’t bother us.
Not knowing much about Fitzgerald, I asked Donna if there was a bike rental shop nearby. She said no but that we would have bikes waiting on us when we got there! & we did!!
This stay felt like it was a million miles away from the world all while being 2 miles from downtown. It was perfect for what we needed and we look forward to seeing how the surrounding area continues to develop. :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed staying at the bungalow and would definitely stop there again. Very quiet neighborhood but still close to town. House is a bit of a ""fixer-upper,"" but everthing works fine and the price reflects this, in my opinion."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down an amazing stay!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was cute and comfortable. very clean. we came for a family reunion a couple of towns over so did not get to do much in Fitzgerald. Nice to have someplace to cook the food I had to bring, lol!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place. Would absolutely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was exactly what we needed. Our dog loved the yard, and we liked the screened in porch. The historical information posted inside was interesting, the rock collection was charming, and the organ was even playable after some experimenting. We also enjoyed playing the giant Jenga game we found. We even found a tired bumblebee trapped in the porch area and nursed it back to health by mixing a little of the sugar included in the kitchen with some water. Would definitely stay again if making the same trip."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Very quiet and easy to find. We enjoyed our stay.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really cute place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely quiet place with thoughtful decor. It was a perfect welcome for me and my dog after a stressful move out of our house in FL. We were on the way to our new home in NC. The barely audible distant train whistle added to the charm of my stay. I suggest that future guests make sure to get the lockbox code when they are in good cell range. I stupidly thought I had it when I really had just written down the reservation code number. I didn't have good cell service when I arrived so it took a bit of time to reach out (via my husband) to Barry. He was gracious and very helpful.
One other consideration is that the main bed is very soft. However, a despite my being used to a hard bed, I slept very well. The pull out couch mattress would be another option if necessary. I actually enjoyed sinking into cushiness of the bed. I also enjoyed the scenic drive back to the interstate in the morning.
Thank you Barry.
Ann"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great visit and place to stop!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was there for a special event. The hosts communicated with us and were quick to respond.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The place is cozy and the host was very communicative. We had our space, but we knew that our host was available if needed."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cute little one bedroom home was just what we needed. A dog friendly place to stay about halfway between our drive from NC to Florida. It's rare to find a place like this with a fenced in yard for the dog. It was great to be able to immediately let her run around free in the yard and play fetch after being cooped up in the car all day. Barry was very responsive and lives next door in case you need anything. Would stay here again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet neighborhood! Perfect for our short stay. They called once we arrived and Barry came over to introduce himself.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a repeat visit to Barry's place. We were returning from our trip to Florida. The home is relaxing, comfortable, and exactly as described. This is a perfect place to relax and unwind. Very pet friendly too."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was really clean. The bed was very comfortable. The fenced in yard was awesome for our pets. Gary was super friendly and his instructions for finding the place were amazing. Will stay again on next year’s trip to Florida.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet, private area. Big parking area.
Occasional train whistles from some distance away.
Worth the short venture from the freeway."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet location and great for traveling from Florida to Tennessee with my dog. A little off the highway but cost and allowing pets worth the extra few minutes.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay. The home was as described with everything we needed. We brought our dogs, and the fenced yard was perfect for them to run around. The home was clean and the hosts were friendly."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a quiet resful place for a brief stop on our long drive, and Barry’s place fit our needs nicely. Will gladly reserve again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Barry's place was like a calm oasis. It was rustic, yet totally comfortable. The surroundings were so relaxing. Our dog loved the fenced in large yard, and we loved the large porch with the rocking chairs. This is not a high-tech, chrome and glass place (thankfully)--but a down to earth joy to spend time in. We were on our way from Minnesota to Florida, and picked this for an overnight stay. It was so perfect after a hard day of driving. Barry's directions for finding the place were excellent. It's a bit off the beaten path, but worth the extra few miles. We plan to book again on our return trip. Highly recommend the place. Exactly as described."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The fenced-in yard literally put a smile on our dog's face. We had our breakfast sitting in rocking chairs on the screened-in porch for what became almost 3 relaxing hours. The time melted away as this was our first night on vacation heading to Florida. A little far off 75 but is a great value, quiet, relaxing was an entire house to ourself, plus the AC was cranked up before we arrived!"

We loved the rural neighborhood, especially the beautiful view of the stars at night. The house was clean and tidy, and more spacious than we imagined! Plenty of room for our family of 4."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you don't like peace and quiet, don't stay here! This is a nice country vibe, with activities for the kids and family. The host communicated very well, and was proactive with letting us know of an issue even before we arrived. The space was clean and met our needs. The only thing we wished for were curtains in the bedroom, to have more light filtration. There seemed to be a slight smoke smell, but admittedly, I have a very sensitive nose, and it was nothing that essential oils in my diffuser didn't take care of. I expected there to be bugs and little critters because of the location... nope! This was a wonderful spot that I will stay at any time I'm in Fitzgerald! The owner even allowed us to pick figs, which was the highlight of the trip!!! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a quiet place on our way to Florida, and Barry’s place was a great find. The small town of Fitzgerald is a bit away from the major road. The house is very nice, clean, equipped with everything we needed. The most interesting thing was the history of the Fitzgerald town book. We even went to downtown the next day to take some photos of the old buildings. I can definitely recommend Barry’s house and will certainly book it again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quaint and beautiful. The screened porch is perfect to sit and have morning coffee surrounded by trees and listening to the birds.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful and cozy space! We loved staying here and felt right at home. I really enjoyed reading on the screened-in porch and listening to the rain.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for my amazing husband and I and our two fur babies to stay on our way back home to Florida for my birthday trip!!! My fur babies loved the huge fenced in yard! The beef was super comfortable and location was very peaceful!! Definitely better than any hotel! Great little place and we recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We found this place as a one night stay on our trip to Florida (from Cincinnati area). It was perfect for a restful and quiet (and very private) overnight stay! The price was great and didn’t have all the extra fees that most Airbnb places seem to have (which we appreciated very much). Perfect for a couple with no kids! We will definitely stay here again any chance we can and next time will try to stay two nights so we can explore the area. For us, it wasn’t our final destination; so I can’t say much about the surrounding area, but it was pretty close to a Walmart (if that’s your thing.. haha). Barry was a great host and made it super easy for us!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great value, safe quiet neighborhood"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little house was perfect. It is very ""no frills"", but it's quaint and historical and everything you need for a quiet stay. There is a park down the road for kids to play at a nice playground and also basketball court (with balls provided) On top of that, the house was stocked with paint and glitter and bubbles for small children, which was much appreciated. the bed was pretty comfortable (a little soft if you like a firm mattress) There were no issues, however I felt a little bit of TLC would go a long way in the way of attention to detail with painting and dusting. They recommend tipping the cleaning lady- I felt that was not called for given the dust on the lamps and in the reclining chair. I felt that with one day and about $50 of supplies the place could really be spruced up a bit and feel a tiny bit more polished. We did really enjoy our stay, and have no complaints. It's just not that ""fancy"". But I highly recommend! Very good place to stay. We will stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent as always!!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had the best sleep in this house! It was very private and quite.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So glad that we found this hidden gem! The price was extremely reasonable & suited us perfectly for the night on our way back from Florida. The extra plus side was that our pup was welcomed. We also got to paint a rock Spartan Strong! Thank you!
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,everything was good except we couldn't get the heat to kick on. the thermostat would not go above 67. not that it was really needed but when we first come in I would like to have run it up higher then turn back down. everything else was great for the price.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great spot for anyone traveling who needs rest for a day or two and needs to do laundry. Spot is also great if you are traveling in an RV/camper. Spot is great to pull up to the porch and unload and you can easily get in and out even if you are in a bigger rig.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic stay. I work remotely and this was the first time I took a trip away from home to work so I was a bit nervous, but the wifi was great and my stay couldn't have been better. Hopefully I find myself in the area again sometime!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for a great stay. It was just what my husband and I needed to break up our drive from FL and NC. We appreciate the pet friendly option as well for an affordable price.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Barry and Brandy place literally was beyond what I expected. I truly enjoy staying at their bungalow and it was soooo cold this past weekend, however the comfy bed waiting for me was the peak of my days/night. I wanted to write and leave a little note in their guest book but I couldn’t find a pen nowhere. I even enjoyed the piano they had in the living room. It was too cute. I will definitely book again if there is ever a need to come back that way. Thanks again for everything! (:"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this quaint cottage was probably the easiest check-in and most relaxing time we’ve had in our history with renting vacation rental homes. Barry and Brandy are great Super-hosts and have made sure that all of their guests have what they need and could possibly want during their stay. The cottage is as listed in the description with everything provided that you need to enjoy your stay. It’s very close to an adorable small town with plenty of restaurants but yet in a very quiet and family-oriented area. Great fenced yard for the pets, our dog loved it. We really enjoyed sitting on the front porch drinking our coffee and listening to the birds singing and chatting in the mornings. We will definitely return for another stay."

It was off a dirt road, it was an actual farmhouse with longhorns, growing corn, horses and even though you felt like you were deep in the country, it was 6 minutes from town where there was a Walmart, gas station, liquor store, clothing store, and a restaurant. The Farmhouse was pet friendly and my 3 dogs had a blast. The house was fully stocked and I asked about a grill and Hal even made sure there was one! He went above and beyond for us. He always replied back quickly. Thank you for making our stay so serine. Definitely worth the 5 stars!"

2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts communicated well and I communicated on everything that I listed to them. They had explained that they hadn't been to the property in over a year and weren't made aware of the items found. Everything from torn furniture that we found on checkout morning, iron was unusable, ironing board was the same and once I got it to stand I couldn't get it to unlock to collapse down. My wife found some dead insects in one of the bathrooms, the batteries were held in a bedroom remote with a band-aid, the exhaust fan in the shower has a grinding sound to it. The area the house sits in doesn't feel safe. It's very rundown and just overall has a very unsafe feeling to it. We were honestly overall displeased with how much we paid and what we recieved. We definitely don't feel we got our money's worth. I encouraged the owners to please visit to see for themselves the issues we saw and experienced. It truly needs some basic maintenance and some more remodeling and upgrades. Overall very let down"

2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is an older home with the typical older home issues. The bathrooms were nicely updated but the kitchen was disappointing. The cabinets were old and there was no dishwasher.
The home is just one block away from a fairly busy road which you could hear traffic from all night. The backyard is not fully fenced so you had to watch your pets very carefully. There is almost no parking."

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was as listed. Very clean, cute and charming. Loved the arcade game. Our only issue was the A/C. It was not working properly. It got pretty hot . We did communicate with host daily , and a technician was called out. However, The problem was not resolved before we left. The host did offer a partial credit for our trouble. It took awhile for this to happen, but the credit was sent."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay in Fitzgerald. Plenty of space and little old house remodeled well but still with some old time trim work. It is South Georgia though so bring a thermacell or some citronella candles/torches because the gnats are relentless in the hot weather.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We sold our house and were promised our apartment would be move-in ready. It was not and the Prices let us stay long term and worked with us on the price. It was great to have a “home” when we were displaced. Great location. Close to downtown Fitzgerald. All the things you could need for a stay.
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is newly renovated and nice enough...but had a very distinct odor. It was bad enough that I was only able to stay one night. Owners thought it might be the plug ins but I disagree....I think it was the varnish on the floors. Plug ins will fade when unplugged, but this odor was very strong and distinct. The owners were most likely aware of the odor, otherwise, why were there plug ins in every room? What upsets me most though is they made no offer of a refund knowing the smell was offensive. I would also highly recommend checking out the neighborhood before booking this house."

,,,"This trip was a spare-of-the-moment trip to help us in our journey to Florida. However, it was booked at the last minute. Upon arrival it was raining and dark, our ETA was an hour later than excepted due to the weather. When we pulled up to the home it was dark and raining, hard to see. We pulled into the driveway between Brandy's house and the neighbor. We found the key box under the carport; however, the grass was extremely high and hard to walk in. Once we entered the home it was beautiful, very warm, charming, and southern antique. It was hot in the house at the time we entered. The ceiling fans in the living room were on and running, we looked for the A/C Control Box on the wall and it was set to 68° and Auto On, we did not touch it. We allowed the A/C to do its job and continued to sit on the couch in the living room. When we went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea there was a cockroach running on the floor. We killed it and didn't think anything of it. In the kitchen, there are basic kitchen supplies, nothing more, nothing less. We continued to sit on the couch, however, the heat in the house never left. It continued to stay warm. We looked at the A/C Control Box and it said it was 80° in the house. We moved the dial to 60° to see if that would help, we waited another hour, and nothing seemed to change. The house continued to stay hot. We had a guest with us that has serious medical conditions and figured that the description of the residence was accurate, and we choose this location. We reported this situation to the host assist and the reply we got back was ""we haven't had any complaints about the air."" We provided photo/video evidence to the host assistant as to what we were experiencing and no resolution. So, we had to decide based on our guest that since the description fails to state that the A/C does not properly work. We had to leave earlier than excepted due to the health conditions of our guests. We tried to make a resolution with Airbnb however based on their information they stated that the host said, ""we turned the A/C way down and caused the A/C to freeze,"" which is inaccurate and false. I am advising any future guest to this location to please be courteous to yourself and bring a fan and any additional comfort creatures from home because this house is very beautiful and antique, however, it is not properly stocked or cooled."
